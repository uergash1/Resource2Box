For More Information    References     Appendix I    Appendix II       Homeopathy (""home-ee-AH-pah-thy""), also known as homeopathic medicine, is a form of health care that developed in Germany and has been practiced in the United States since the early 19th century. Homeopathic practitioners are commonly called homeopaths. This fact sheet answers some frequently asked questions on homeopathy and reviews scientific research on its use and effectiveness.     Key Points       In homeopathy, a key premise is that every person has energy called a vital force or self-healing response. When this energy is disrupted or imbalanced, health problems develop. Homeopathy aims to stimulate the body's own healing responses.      Homeopathic treatment involves giving extremely small doses of substances that produce characteristic symptoms of illness in healthy people when given in larger doses. This approach is called ""like cures like.""       Various explanations have been proposed as to how homeopathy might work. However, none of these explanations has been scientifically verified.       Research studies on homeopathy have been contradictory in their findings. Some analyses have concluded that there is no strong evidence supporting homeopathy as effective for any clinical condition. However, others have found positive effects from homeopathy. The positive effects are not readily explained in scientific terms.      It is important to inform all of your health care providers about any therapy that you are currently using or considering, including homeopathic treatment. This is to help ensure a safe and coordinated course of care.        Top    1. What is homeopathy?    The term homeopathy comes from the Greek words  homeo , meaning similar, and  pathos , meaning suffering or disease. Homeopathy is an alternative medical system. Alternative medical systems are built upon complete systems of theory and practice, and often have evolved apart from and earlier than the conventional medical approach used in the United States. a   Homeopathy takes a different approach from conventional medicine in diagnosing, classifying, and treating medical problems.    Key concepts of homeopathy include:    Homeopathy seeks to stimulate the body's defense mechanisms and processes so as to prevent or treat illness.     Treatment involves giving very small doses of substances called remedies that, according to homeopathy, would produce the same or similar symptoms of illness in healthy people if they were given in larger doses.     Treatment in homeopathy is individualized (tailored to each person). Homeopathic practitioners select remedies according to a total picture of the patient, including not only symptoms but lifestyle, emotional and mental states, and other factors.        a. Conventional medicine, as defined by NCCAM, is medicine as practiced by holders of M.D. (medical doctor) or D.O. (doctor of osteopathy) degrees and by their allied health professionals, such as physical therapists, psychologists, and registered nurses. Some conventional medical practitioners are also practitioners of complementary and alternative medicine. To find out more about these terms, see the NCCAM fact sheet "" What Is Complementary and Alternative Medicine? ""    Top    2. What is the history of the discovery and use of homeopathy? b    In the late 1700s, Samuel Hahnemann, a physician, chemist, and linguist in Germany, proposed a new approach to treating illness. This was at a time when the most common medical treatments were harsh, such as bloodletting, c   purging, blistering, and the use of sulfur and mercury. At the time, there were few effective medications for treating patients, and knowledge about their effects was limited.     Hahnemann was interested in developing a less-threatening approach to medicine. The first major step reportedly was when he was translating an herbal text and read about a treatment (cinchona bark) used to cure malaria. He took some cinchona bark and observed that, as a healthy person, he developed symptoms that were very similar to malaria symptoms. This led Hahnemann to consider that a substance may create symptoms that it can also relieve. This concept is called the ""similia principle"" or ""like cures like."" The similia principle had a prior history in medicine, from Hippocrates in Ancient Greece--who noted, for example, that recurrent vomiting could be treated with an emetic (such as ipecacuanha) that would be expected to make it worse--to folk medicine. 14 , 15  Another way to view ""like cures like"" is that symptoms are part of the body's attempt to heal itself--for example, a fever can develop as a result of an immune response to an infection, and a cough may help to eliminate mucus--and medication may be given to support this self-healing response.     Hahnemann tested single, pure substances on himself and, in more dilute forms, on healthy volunteers. He kept meticulous records of his experiments and participants' responses, and he combined these observations with information from clinical practice, the known uses of herbs and other medicinal substances, and toxicology, d   eventually treating the sick and developing homeopathic clinical practice.     Hahnemann added two additional elements to homeopathy:        A concept that became ""potentization,"" which holds that systematically diluting a substance, with vigorous shaking at each step of dilution, makes the remedy more, not less, effective by extracting the vital essence of the substance. If dilution continues to a point where the substance's molecules are gone, homeopathy holds that the ""memory"" of them--that is, the effects they exerted on the surrounding water molecules--may still be therapeutic.       A concept that treatment should be selected based upon a total picture of an individual and his symptoms, not solely upon symptoms of a disease. Homeopaths evaluate not only a person's physical symptoms but her emotions, mental states, lifestyle, nutrition, and other aspects. In homeopathy, different people with the same symptoms may receive different homeopathic remedies.       Hans Burch Gram, a Boston-born doctor, studied homeopathy in Europe and introduced it into the United States in 1825. European immigrants trained in homeopathy also made the treatment increasingly available in America. In 1835, the first homeopathic medical college was established in Allentown, Pennsylvania. By the turn of the 20th century, 8 percent of all American medical practitioners were homeopaths, and there were 20 homeopathic medical colleges and more than 100 homeopathic hospitals in the United States.     In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, numerous medical advances were made, such as the recognition of the mechanisms of disease; Pasteur's germ theory; the development of antiseptic techniques; and the discovery of ether anesthesia. In addition, a report (the so-called ""Flexner Report"") was released that triggered major changes in American medical education. Homeopathy was among the disciplines negatively affected by these developments. Most homeopathic medical schools closed down, and by the 1930s others had converted to conventional medical schools.    In the 1960s, homeopathy's popularity began to revive in the United States. According to a 1999 survey of Americans and their health, over 6 million Americans had used homeopathy in the preceding 12 months. 16  The World Health Organization noted in 1994 that homeopathy had been integrated into the national health care systems of numerous countries, including Germany, the United Kingdom, India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, and Mexico. 7  Several schools of practice exist within homeopathy. 17    Persons using homeopathy do so to address a range of health concerns, from wellness and prevention to treatment of injuries, diseases, and conditions. Studies have found that many people who seek homeopathic care seek it for help with a chronic medical condition. 18 , 19 , 20  Many users of homeopathy treat themselves with homeopathic products and do not consult a professional. 13      b. Items 1-13 in the references served as general sources for this historical discussion.     c. Bloodletting was a healing practice used for many centuries. In bloodletting, incisions were made in the body to drain a quantity of blood, in the belief that this would help drain out the ""bad blood"" or sickness.     d. Toxicology is the science of the effects of chemicals on human health.     Top    3. What kind of training do homeopathic practitioners receive?     In European countries, training in homeopathy is usually pursued either as a primary professional degree completed over 3 to 6 years or as postgraduate training for doctors. 14      In the United States, training in homeopathy is offered through diploma programs, certificate programs, short courses, and correspondence courses. Also, homeopathic training is part of medical education in naturopathy. e   Most homeopathy in the United States is practiced along with another health care practice for which the practitioner is licensed, such as conventional medicine, naturopathy, chiropractic, dentistry, acupuncture, or veterinary medicine (homeopathy is used to treat animals).    Laws about what is required to practice homeopathy vary among states. Three states (Connecticut, Arizona, and Nevada) license medical doctors specifically for homeopathy.     e. Naturopathy, also known as naturopathic medicine, is an alternative medical system that emphasizes natural healing approaches (such as herbs, nutrition, and movement or manipulation of the body).  Some elements of naturopathy are similar to homeopathy, such as an intent to support the body's own self-healing response.    Top      4. What do homeopathic practitioners do in treating patients?    Typically, in homeopathy, patients have a lengthy first visit, during which the provider takes an in-depth assessment of the patient. This is used to guide the selection of one or more homeopathic remedies. During followup visits, patients report how they are responding to the remedy or remedies, which helps the practitioner make decisions about further treatment.     Top     5. What are homeopathic remedies?     Most homeopathic remedies are derived from natural substances that come from plants, minerals, or animals. A remedy is prepared by diluting the substance in a series of steps (as discussed in  Question 2 ). Homeopathy asserts that this process can maintain a substance's healing properties regardless of how many times it has been diluted. Many homeopathic remedies are so highly diluted that not one molecule of the original natural substance remains. 12 , 21  Remedies are sold in liquid, pellet, and tablet forms.     Top     6. How does the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulate homeopathic remedies?    Because of their long use in the United States, the U.S. Congress passed a law in 1938 declaring that homeopathic remedies are to be regulated by the FDA in the same manner as nonprescription, over-the-counter (OTC) drugs, which means that they can be purchased without a physician's prescription. Today, although conventional prescription drugs and new OTC drugs must undergo thorough testing and review by the FDA for safety and effectiveness before they can be sold, this requirement does not apply to homeopathic remedies.     Remedies are required to meet certain legal standards for strength, quality, purity, and packaging. In 1988, the FDA required that all homeopathic remedies list the indications for their use (i.e., the medical problems to be treated) on the label. 22 , 23  The FDA also requires the label to list ingredients, dilutions, and instructions for safe use.     The guidelines for homeopathic remedies are found in an official guide, the  Homeopathic Pharmacopoeia of the United States , which is authored by a nongovernmental, nonprofit organization of industry representatives and homeopathic experts. 24  The  Pharmacopoeia  also includes provisions for testing new remedies and verifying their clinical effectiveness. Remedies on the market before 1962 have been accepted into the  Homeopathic Pharmacopoeia of the United States  based on historical use, rather than scientific evidence from clinical trials.     Top      7. Have any side effects or complications been reported from the use of homeopathy?    The FDA has learned of a few reports of illness associated with the use of homeopathic remedies. However, the FDA reviewed these reports and decided that the remedies were not likely to be the cause, because of the high dilutions. 3    Here is some general information that has been reported about risks and side effects in homeopathy:       Homeopathic medicines in high dilutions, taken under the supervision of trained professionals, are considered safe and unlikely to cause severe adverse reactions. 25      Some patients report feeling worse for a brief period of time after starting homeopathic remedies. Homeopaths interpret this as the body temporarily stimulating symptoms while it makes an effort to restore health.      Liquid homeopathic remedies can contain alcohol and are permitted to have higher levels of alcohol than conventional drugs for adults. This may be of concern to some consumers. However, no adverse effects from the alcohol levels have been reported either to the FDA or in the scientific literature. 3      Homeopathic remedies are not known to interfere with conventional drugs; however, if you are considering using homeopathic remedies, you should discuss this with your health care provider. If you have more than one provider, discuss it with each one.      As with all medicinal products, a person taking a homeopathic remedy is best advised to:        Contact his health care provider if his symptoms continue unimproved for more than 5 days.      Keep the remedy out of the reach of children.      Consult a health care provider before using the product if the user is a woman who is pregnant or nursing a baby.      Top     8. What has scientific research found out about whether homeopathy works?    This section summarizes results from (1) individual clinical trials (research studies in people) and (2) broad analyses of groups of clinical trials.     The results of individual, controlled clinical trials of homeopathy have been contradictory. In some trials, homeopathy appeared to be no more helpful than a placebo; in other studies, some benefits were seen that the researchers believed were greater than one would expect from a placebo. f    Appendix I  details findings from clinical trials.     Systematic reviews and meta-analyses take a broader look at collections of a set of results from clinical trials. g   Recent examples of these types of analyses are detailed in  Appendix II . In sum, systematic reviews have not found homeopathy to be a definitively proven treatment for any medical condition. Two groups of authors listed in  Appendix II  found some positive evidence in the groups of studies they examined, and they did not find this evidence to be explainable completely as placebo effects (a third group found 1 out of 16 trials to have some added effect relative to placebo). Each author or group of authors criticized the quality of evidence in the studies. Examples of problems they noted include weaknesses in design and/or reporting, choice of measuring techniques, small numbers of participants, and difficulties in replicating results. A common theme in the reviews of homeopathy trials is that because of these problems and others, it is difficult or impossible to draw firm conclusions about whether homeopathy is effective for any single clinical condition.    f. A placebo is designed to resemble as much as possible the treatment being studied in a clinical trial, except that the placebo is inactive. An example of a placebo is a pill containing sugar instead of the drug or other substance being studied. By giving one group of participants a placebo and the other group the active treatment, the researchers can compare how the two groups respond and get a truer picture of the active treatment's effects. In recent years, the definition of placebo has been expanded to include other things that could have an effect on the results of health care, such as how a patient and a health care provider interact, how a patient feels about receiving the care, and what he or she expects to happen from the care.    g. In a systematic review, data from a set of studies on a particular question or topic are collected, analyzed, and critically reviewed. A meta-analysis uses statistical techniques to analyze results from individual studies.     Top     9. Are there scientific controversies associated with homeopathy?     Yes. Homeopathy is an area of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) that has seen high levels of controversy and debate, largely because a number of its key concepts do not follow the laws of science (particularly chemistry and physics).        It is debated how something that causes illness might also cure it.      It has been questioned whether a remedy with a very tiny amount (perhaps not even one molecule) of active ingredient could have a biological effect, beneficial or otherwise.   There have been some research studies published on the use of ultra-high dilutions (UHDs) of substances, diluted to levels compatible with those in homeopathy and shaken hard at each step of dilution. h   The results are claimed to involve phenomena at the molecular level and beyond, such as the structure of water, and waves and fields. Both laboratory research and clinical trials have been published. There have been mixed results in attempts to replicate them. Reviews have not found UHD results to be definitive or compelling. i      There have been some studies that found effects of UHDs on isolated organs, plants, and animals. 15  There have been controversy and debate about these findings as well.        Effects in homeopathy might be due to the placebo or other non-specific effect.      There are key questions about homeopathy that are yet to be subjected to studies that are well-designed--such as whether it actually works for some of the diseases or medical conditions for which it is used, and if so, how it might work.      There is a point of view that homeopathy does work, but that modern scientific methods have not yet explained why. The failure of science to provide full explanations for all treatments is not unique to homeopathy.       Some people feel that if homeopathy appears to be helpful and safe, then scientifically valid explanations or proofs of this alternative system of medicine are not necessary.        h. For some examples, see references  26-29 .     i. For examples of debates on UHDs and reviewers' papers, see especially references  13 ,  15 , and  30-33 .      Top     10. Is NCCAM funding research on homeopathy?    Yes, NCCAM supports a number of studies in this area. For example:       Homeopathy for physical, mental, and emotional symptoms of fibromyalgia (a chronic disorder involving widespread musculoskeletal pain, multiple tender points on the body, and fatigue).       Homeopathy for brain deterioration and damage in animal models for stroke and dementia.       The homeopathic remedy cadmium, to find out whether it can prevent damage to the cells of the prostate when those cells are exposed to toxins.

Clinical Trials on Homeopathy Published from 1998 to 2002 j              Citation        Description        Findings           Vickers and Smith, 2002 34        Seven trials were included in the review (three prevention and four treatment trials); only two studies had sufficient information for complete data extraction.        The homeopathic remedy oscillococcinum appears safe and effective in reducing the duration of  influenza , but has no effect on prevention.             Lewith et al., 2002 28        Randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial of 242 participants aged 18 to 55 years.         Trial compared an oral homeopathic treatment to placebo in  asthmatic people allergic to house dust . Authors found the homeopathic treatment ""no better than placebo."" They noted ""some differences between the homeopathic immunotherapy and placebo for which we have no explanation.""              Oberbaum et al., 2001 35        Randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial in 32 children; 30 completed the study.        Traumeel S, a homeopathic skin cream, may significantly reduce the severity and length of  pain and inflammation of the tissues lining the inside of the mouth from chemotherapy  in children being treated with bone marrow transplantation.             Taylor et al., 2000 36        Randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial of 51 participants aged 17 years or older (50 completed the study).           Team tested the hypothesis that homeopathy is a placebo by examining effects of an oral homeopathic preparation in patients with  perennial allergic rhinitis . They found a ""significant objective improvement in nasal airflow"" compared with the placebo group. However, both groups reported subjective improvement in ""nasal symptoms"" (with no statistically significant difference between groups).  Authors concluded that the objective evidence supports that ""homeopathic dilutions differ from placebo.""              Jacobs et al., 2000 37        Randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial of 126 children; 116 completed the study.        Individualized homeopathic treatments improved digestive problems in children with  acute childhood diarrhea . Results are consistent with findings of a previous study.             Weiser et al., 1999 38        Randomized, double-blinded trial of 146 people.        For the treatment of  hay fever , a homeopathic nasal spray is as efficient and well tolerated as a conventional therapy, cromolyn sodium.             Rastogi et al., 1999 39        Randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial of 100 people between 18 and 50 (71 percent male/29 percent female).        A subgroup of patients with  HIV  in the symptomatic phase, receiving treatment, had increased levels of CD4 cells at the end of the trial; the placebo subgroup did not.             Vickers et al., 1998 40        Randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial of 519 people; 400 completed the study.        Homeopathic remedies, including arnica, are not effective for  muscle soreness  following long-distance running.             Weiser et al., 1998 41        Randomized, double-blinded, controlled trial of 119 people; 105 completed the study.        The homeopathic treatment vertigoheel, and the standard treatment of betahistine, are equally effective in reducing the frequency, duration, and intensity of  vertigo attacks .         j. Due to the large number of trials, these studies have been selected to give a representative overview of the findings published in peer-reviewed scientific and medical journals in English and indexed in the National Library of Medicine's MEDLINE database.    Top     Appendix II.    Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses k  of Clinical Trials of Homeopathy                Citation        Description        Findings           Ernst, 2002 33        Analyzed 17 systematic reviews (including meta-analyses) of controlled clinical trials for homeopathy.        Author found that the reviews failed to provide strong evidence in favor of homeopathy. No homeopathic remedy was proven by convincing evidence to yield clinical effects that are different from placebo or from other control intervention for any medical condition.  Positive recommendations for use of homeopathy in clinical practice are not supported, and ""homeopathy cannot be viewed as an evidence-based form of therapy"" until more convincing results are available.              Linde et al., 2001 42        Analyzed the methodological quality of 207 randomized trials collected for 5 previously published reviews on homeopathy, two herbal medicines (St. John's wort and echinacea), and acupuncture.        Authors found that the majority of trials had major weaknesses in methodology and/or reporting. Homeopathy trials were ""less frequently randomized...and reported less details on dropouts and withdrawals"" than the other types.              Cucherat et al., 2000 17        Analyzed 16 randomized, controlled trials (17 comparisons were made) comparing homeopathic treatment to placebo.  Work was part of a report prepared for the European Union on the effectiveness of homeopathy.         Authors found that the ""strength of evidence remains low"" because of trial flaws and other limitations. They added that ""at least one [of the tested homeopathic treatments] shows an added effect relative to placebo."" Group recommended that homeopathy be studied further using the same methods used to study conventional medicine.              Ernst and Pittler, 1998 43        Systematic review of eight trials.        Rigorous clinical trials indicate arnica is not more effective than a placebo; most trials studied use of arnica for  tissue trauma .              Linde et al., 1997 6        Analyzed 89 trials. Each trial was controlled; compared homeopathy to a placebo; was either randomized or double-blinded; and yielded a written report.         Authors concluded that their results were not compatible with a hypothesis that the clinical effects of homeopathy are completely due to placebo.  However, they found insufficient evidence that homeopathy is clearly efficacious for any single clinical condition.  They stated that further research is warranted if it is rigorous and systematic.              Kleijnen et al., 1991 21        Assessed 105 controlled trials of homeopathy, 68 randomized.         Authors found a positive trend in the evidence, regardless of the quality of the trial or the method of homeopathy used. They cautioned, however, that definitive conclusions about homeopathy could not be drawn, because many of the trials were not of good quality and the role of publication bias was unknown.              Systematic Reviews of Clinical Trials on Single Medical Conditions             Long and Ernst, 2001 44        Systematic review of four osteoarthritis clinical trials.        Research on homeopathic treatment for  osteoarthritis  is insufficient to reliably assess the clinical effectiveness of homeopathic treatment of osteoarthritis.              Jonas et al., 2000 45        Meta-analysis of six controlled clinical trials.        Controlled clinical trials indicate that homeopathic remedies appear to work better than a placebo in studies of  rheumatic syndromes , but there are too few studies to draw definitive conclusions, and efficacy results are mixed.          k.

GX253-16-13500810	"SUMMARY OF DATA FOR CHEMICAL SELECTION Dietary Supplements Containing Ephedrine Alkaloids BASIS OF NOMINATION Dietary supplements containing ephedrine alkaloids from herbal sources (ephedra) are brought to the attention of the CSWG as part of an ongoing National Institutes of Health (NIH) Office of Dietary Supplements (ODS) research initiative on the safety and efficacy of these products. This initiative was recommended by the Senate Committee on Appropriations in fiscal year (FY) 2001. In its Report making FY 2002 appropriations for the Department of Health and Human Services, the Committee expressed pleasure that the ODS followed through on its FY 2001 recommendation and urged the ODS to continue and expand this important effort. The nomination of ephedracontaining supplements to the National Toxicology Program (NTP) is part of the expanded effort by the ODS. As the Senate Committee noted, the number of Americans taking dietary supplements containing ephedra has risen dramatically. Dietary supplements containing herbal ephedra (chiefly Ephedra sinica Stapf.) are widely used as diet aids and athletic performance enhancers, with over 3 billion servings1 sold each year for weight loss alone. The active ingredients in these supplements are primarily ephedrine and pseudoephedrine with small amounts of other ephedrine alkaloids usually present. Ephedra-based diet aids often contain other stimulants, such as caffeine (guarana), as well as salicin, diuretics, and cathartics. Ephedra-containing performance enhancers often contain caffeine and other ingredients, such as chromium picolinate or l-carnitine, and may be consumed with other performance enhancers, such as androstenedione and creatine monohydrate. The ephedrine alkaloids are sympathomimetic amines, a class of compounds with fairly well characterized short to medium term biological activities. Specific combinations of synthetic ephedrine and caffeine have been used as prescription drugs in Europe, and were formerly available in the US until they were withdrawn by the FDA in 1992 for reasons of safety. Very little is known 1  Dose or portion, in this case, is referred to as a ""serving"" because diet aids are defined as foods.  1   about the possible interactions between herbal ephedra and biologically active compounds in the other plant species that are constituents of many dietary supplements. Some agents, often components of herbal preparations at far greater concentrations than the ephedrine alkaloids, may profoundly influence the toxicity attributed to ephedra supplements. Limited information suggests that ephedrine may cause fetal heart defects, a matter that needs further examination since dietary supplements containing ephedrine alkaloids are readily available even though the manufacturers caution against their use during pregnancy. Ephedrine sulfate and caffeine, tested separately, were both negative for carcinogenic activity. The National Cancer Institute (NCI), through the Chemical Selection Working Group (CSWG), recently submitted several other ingredients commonly found in combination with ephedrine alkaloid sports supplements to the National Toxicology Program for toxicological testing. These include chromium picolinate, androstenedione, and yohimbe bark extract. INPUT FROM GOVERNMENT AGENCIES/INDUSTRY: Dr. Paul Coates, Director of the NIH Office of Dietary Supplements, provided information on existing studies of ephedra. SELECTION STATUS: Action By CSWG: 12/11/01 Studies requested: - Reproductive and developmental toxicity studies - Comparative toxicological evaluation using ephedra, ephedra and natural caffeine products, and other combinations of ephedra/herbal remedies with an emphasis on the heart and central nervous system Priority: High  2   Rationale/Remarks: - Herbal ephedrine alkaloids (ma huang) combined with other herbal products are widely used as diet aids and for performance enhancement. - Concern that naturally occurring non-ephedrine alkaloid constituents of Ephedra spp. may have toxicologic significance. - Concern that the herbal combinations used as dietary supplements may possess toxicity not seen from administration of synthetic ephedrine/caffeine combinations. - Emphasize testing of products/combinations actually marketed to consumers as dietary supplements. - Priority for testing should be given to combinations of herbals used as diet aids. - Involve the NIH Office of Dietary Supplements and the FDA in study design of to ensure that the testing performed addresses their concerns.  3   Ephedrine alkaloids  CHEMICAL IDENTIFICATION CAS Registry Number: Ephedrine alkaloids: none l-Ephedrine; (-)-ephedrine: 299-42-3 d-Pseudoephedrine; (+)-pseudoephedrine: 90-82-4 None Chinese Ephedra, Chinese Jointfir, herbal ephedra, ma huang Botanical mixture  CAS Name: Synonyms and Trade Names: Structural Class:  Structure, Molecular Formula and Molecular Weight: This information is provided for the main active ingredients in ephedrine alkaloid supplements.

Pure or synthetic ephedrine is considered to be a drug, not a dietary supplement; in fact, a company was recently fined, and all of its product seized, for ""spiking"" its ma huang-containing extracts with synthetic ephedrine (Coates, 2001). The most commonly used herbal ephedra, ma huang contains total ephedrine alkaloids at 0.52.5% by weight; ephedrine accounts for 30-90% of these alkaloids (Lee et al., 2000). Because of the variation in content, ma huang is mostly used as an extract, concentrated to about 6% alkaloids (American Herbal Products Association, 1999). The alkaloid pattern can often lead to identification of the species, the geographical area where it grew and the climatic conditions, while atypical patterns can suggest that a ma huang sample is ""fake"", made from pharmaceutical raw materials (American Herbal Products Association, 1999). Twenty commercially available diet aids containing ephedrine alkaloids were tested by HPLC procedures. Ephedrine and pseudoephedrine in a 2:1 ratio accounted for 96-98% of the ephedrine alkaloid content. Norephedrine (phenylpropanolamine) content was less than 2% of the total ephedrine alkaloid content. Additional ephedrine alkaloids, (+)-norpseudoephedrine (cathine), a Schedule IV controlled substance, and methylephedrine have been identified in 5 Prepared for NCI by Technical Resources International, Inc. to support chemical nominations under contract no. N02-CB-07007 (10/01)   Ephedrine alkaloids  small amounts in ma huang and in extracts prepared from ma huang (CANTOX, 2000; Gurley et al., 2000; Kalix, 1991; Lwanami et al., 1985). Among the 20 dietary supplements examined, ephedrine alkaloid content varied considerably suggesting that industry standards are often not met by individual supplements. Total alkaloid content ranged from 0.0 to 18.5 mg per dosage unit. Ranges for (-)-ephedrine and (+)pseudoephedrine were 1.1-15.3 mg and 0.2-9.5 mg, respectively. Significant lot-to-lot variations in alkaloid content, from 44 to 260% of label claim, were also observed. Half the products exhibited discrepancies between the label claim for ephedrine alkaloid content and actual alkaloid content in excess of 20% (CANTOX, 2000; Gurley et al., 2000). Most ephedra product labels indicate the amount of ephedra herb or extract contained in each dosage form; however, not all make a claim of ephedrine alkaloid content (CANTOX, 2000). Dietary supplements containing ephedrine alkaloids generally contain a host of other botanical ingredients. Kola nut and guarana are used as natural caffeine sources; St. John's Wort, white willow bark (salicin), diuretics, or cathartics are also often included (CANTOX, 2000). Performance enhancers may include chromium picolinate or l-carnitine (Karch, 2000). Yohimbine is sometimes added (Bucci, 2000).  6 Prepared for NCI by Technical Resources International, Inc. to support chemical nominations under contract no. N02-CB-07007 (10/01)   Ephedrine alkaloids  EXPOSURE INFORMATION Production and Producers: Dietary supplements containing botanical sources of ephedrine alkaloids are marketed for weight loss and increased energy. These products are available in a variety of forms, including pills, powders, liquid drops, and teas (GAO, 1999). Herbal ephedra products are sold via traditional retail chains (drug stores, health food stores, etc.), mail-order catalogs, and direct sales distribution networks. Industry sources estimate that there are over 500,000-750,000 independent distributors of dietary supplements that contain herbal ephedra (Pape et al., 1999). Most companies marketing herbal ephedra are privately held and do not report sales and earnings figures to the public. Nevertheless, retail sales of these dietary supplement products are conservatively estimated to exceed $1.5 - $2 billion per year (Pape et al., 1999). In testimony to the Office on Women's Health, industry sources estimated that 3 billion doses of ephedra-containing products are sold in the United States annually. This figure appears to be low. The American Herbal Products Association contacted 42 companies known to distribute dietary supplements containing ephedrine alkaloids. The 13 companies that responded reported aggregate figures of 3,086,041,072 servings sold in 1999. Metabolife International reported that projected sales of one ephedrine alkaloid weight-loss product, Metabolife 356, were nearly 2 billion caplets in that same year (Anon., 1999; CANTOX, 2000; Office on Women's Health, 2000). Use Pattern: Ma huang is derived from Ephedra sinica Stapf, E. intermedia Schrenk et C.A. Mey, and E. equisetina Bunge (Ephedraceae). North American and Central American types are alkaloid free (American Herbal Products Association, 1999). A traditional Chinese medicine, it has been used for about 5000 years to treat asthma, nose and lung congestion, and fever with anhidrosis. Ma huang's traditional use to treat cough and respiratory infections may be related to 4-quinolone-2-carboxylic acid 7 Prepared for NCI by Technical Resources International, Inc. to support chemical nominations under contract no. N02-CB-07007 (10/01)   Ephedrine alkaloids  (transtorine) which inhibits the growth of several common bacteria. Large quantities of ma huang are now used as a source of ephedrine in dietary supplements formulated to promote weight loss. Ma huang products sold for weight control often contain other stimulants, such as caffeine, which may have synergistic effects and increase the potential for adverse effects (American Herbal Products Association, 1999; Botanical Dermatology Database, 2001; FDA, 1993; Office on Women's Health, 2000; Karch, 2000; Lee et al., 2000). The best selling herbal weight-loss product is Metabolife 356 (Anon., 1999). According to its manufacturer, Metabolife 356 contains vitamin E, magnesium chelate, zinc chelate, chromium picolinate, guarana (seed), ma huang extract, bee pollen, Siberian ginseng (root), ginger root, lecithin, bovine complex, damiana (leaf), sarsaparilla root, goldenseal, nettle leaf, gotu kola, spirulina, Royal jelly, citric acid, glycine, caffeine, croscarmellose sodium, protein hydrolysate, silica, modified cellulose, magnesium stearate, dextrin, dextrose, sodium carboxymethylcellulose, sodium citrate, and ascorbic acid (Metabolife, 2001). The exact amounts of each ingredient are proprietary, but each tablet contains 12 mg of ephedrine alkaloids and 40 mg of caffeine alkaloids (Metabolife, 2001). Ephedrine alkaloid/caffeine products are used by some athletes to enhance physical performance, especially bodybuilders who want to maximize body fat loss while maintaining muscle mass (Bucci, 2000). Ephedra is often taken along with other sports nutrition supplements, especially androstenedione and creatine monohydrate (Consumers Union, 2001). l-Ephedrine sulfate has FDA approval as an over-the-counter (OTC) medication for use in asthma patients. An  +  adrenergic agonist, ephedrine functions as a bronchodilator. Isolated and synthesized in 1885, ephedrine became a first-line drug against asthma in the 1930s, although this no longer appears to be an important use of ephedrine. Unlike the other alkaloid drugs, ephedrine is also a potent central nervous system (CNS) stimulant that has been used as a drug of abuse, much like methamphetamine (McEvoy, 2000; 8 Prepared for NCI by Technical Resources International, Inc. to support chemical nominations under contract no. N02-CB-07007 (10/01)   Ephedrine alkaloids  Karch, 2000; Office on Women's Health, 2000). In the past, ephedrine was used to treat Stokes-Adams attacks with complete heart block and as a CNS stimulant in narcolepsy and depressive states. Ephedrine has been used to treat the hypotension that may occur with spinal anesthesia (McEvoy, 2000). As an alternative for the structurally related illegal drug, Ecstasy (4-methyl-2-dimethoxyamphetamine, MDMA), ephedra supplements are sometimes sold outside usual channels of commerce and marketed specifically to young adults to achieve a legal high (FDA, 2000). These products may be spiked with synthetic ephedrine alkaloids and combined with other stimulants such as caffeine (Bucci, 2000). One of these products, Cloud 9, was labeled as containing 650 mg of Indonesian ma huang extract per capsule with a recommended dose of 1-2 capsules 30-35 minutes before activity (Blumenthal & King, 1996). The FDA considers Herbal Ecstasy to be a street drug alternative, not a dietary supplement. Since street drug alternatives have a potential for abuse, FDA considers them to be unapproved new drugs and misbranded drugs under sections 505 and 502of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDA, 2000; US Department of Health and Human Services, 1996). Human Exposure: The two main groups that use ephedra products are young to middle age, overweight individuals, and young individuals engaged in exercise programs (Office on Women's Health, 2000). Results of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) in 1999 indicate that an estimated 61% of US adults are either overweight or obese. In adults aged 20-74 years, obesity has nearly doubled from approximately 15% in 1980 to 27% in 1999 (CDC, 2001). According to industry sources, Americans spend more than $30 billion a year on diet-related products and services related to obesity treatment (Office on Women's Health, 2000). 9 Prepared for NCI by Technical Resources International, Inc. to support chemical nominations under contract no. N02-CB-07007 (10/01)   Ephedrine alkaloids  Ephedra supplement labels warn customers not to use herbal ephedra for more than 12 weeks. An industry spokesperson testified before the Office on Women's Health that this warning label is needed to comply with state laws and is not regarded by the industry as scientifically based (Office of Women's Health, 2000). On the other hand, there have been no published studies in which subjects have been given ephedra for longer than 12 weeks (Coates, 2001). Metabolife International advertises a ""preferred customer"" program that ships Metabolife 356 automatically every month without a specified time limit (Metabolife, 2001). A typical ephedra supplement for weight loss contains approximately 12 mg of ephedrine alkaloids per oral serving with a maximum daily intake of 96 mg recommended. Some products include as much as 20 mg of ephedra per dose, but those products recommend consumption of no more than 100 mg/day (Office on Women's Health, 2000). No information was found in the available literature on the number of persons taking ephedrine alkaloid diet aids. If 3 billion servings are taken at a rate of 8 per day for 12 weeks in the course of one year, then over 370,000 persons would be exposed annually for purposes of weight loss alone. According to Nutrition Business Journal, 4% of American adults have taken a sports supplement at least once and 1.2 million use them regularly. According to a 1999 survey by Blue Cross/Blue Shield, 6% of youths 15-16 and 8% of those 17-18 have taken sports supplements; the vast majority of users were male. Although ephedra was mentioned as one of the most popular supplements, estimates of the actual number of persons taking ephedra supplements for performance enhancement were not provided. Ephedra is often taken along with other sports nutrition supplements, e.g., androstenedione and creatine monohydrate (Consumers Union, 2001; Council for Responsible Nutrition, 2001). Ripped Fuel by Twin Labs is a popular supplement used by bodybuilders that contains ma huang, guarana, l-carnitine, and chromium picolinate. Another popular product is AST Research's EPH 833, composed mainly of ma huang. The ephedrine content of this 10 Prepared for NCI by Technical Resources International, Inc. to support chemical nominations under contract no. N02-CB-07007 (10/01)   Ephedrine alkaloids  type of product ranges anywhere from 12-80 mg per serving (Karch, 2000). The recommended dosage for l-ephedrine sulfate as a bronchodilator is 25 mg (as ephedrine) with a maximum daily dosage of 150 mg (McEvoy, 2000; Office on Women's Health, 2000). The number of persons exposed to ephedrine through this and other medical uses is believed to be small. Environmental Occurrence: Ephedra sinica Stapf is one of 40 species in the Ephedraceae (Joint-Pine) family that occurs in northern and southern warm temperate regions. A perennial shrub indigenous to China, its dried young stems, harvested in fall, are used to produce ephedra alkaloids. Ephedra alkaloids can be derived from other species in the Ephedracea family as well, notably E. equisentina and E. gerardiana Wall (Pakistani ephedra). The alkaloid content and the relative quantities of different alkaloids vary widely among the various species; generally, the roots, berries, and seeds contain no alkaloids. Ephedra sinica Stapf is a natural source of the clinically important isomeric alkaloids, (-)-ephedrine and (+)-pseudoephedrine. These compounds differ only in their stereochemistry (Botanical Dermatology Database, 2001; Duke & Beckstrom-Sternberg, 2001; Karch, 2000; Nutritionfocus.com, 1999). Regulatory Status: Since 1994, dietary supplements have been regulated under the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act (DSHEA). The DSHEA requires no proof of safety for dietary supplements on the market prior to October 15, 1994. Labeling requirements for dietary supplements allow warnings and dosage recommendation as well as substantiated ""structure or function"" claims. All claims must prominently note that they have not been evaluated by the FDA, and they must bear the statement ""This product is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease"" (FDA, 1995). FDA has taken several actions to respond to a perceived public heath concern related to ephedrine alkaloid supplements. In 1994, the Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition issued a medical bulletin outlining potential adverse reactions from dietary supplements containing ephedrine alkaloids. In 1995, the FDA warned consumers not 11 Prepared for NCI by Technical Resources International, Inc. to support chemical nominations under contract no. N02-CB-07007 (10/01)   Ephedrine alkaloids  to purchase or consume Nature's Nutrition Formula One products labeled as containing ma huang and kola nut because the product posed a risk to consumers' health. In October of that same year, FDA convened a special workgroup to address ephedrine alkaloid dietary supplements. In August 1996, FDA's Food Advisory Committee (FAC) was asked to provide opinions on specific ways to address ephedrine alkaloid supplements. Over half the members concluded that no safe level for ephedrine alkaloids could be identified and recommended that these products be removed from the market (FDA,1995; GAO, 1999). In June 1997, FDA published a proposed rule Dietary Supplements Containing Ephedrine Alkaloids (62 FR107) defining 8 mg as the amount of ephedrine alkaloids in a serving of dietary supplement above which the product would be deemed adulterated. Among other things, the proposed rule restricted daily dosages to 24 mg or less, required warning labels that product should not be used for more than 7 days, and prohibited use of ephedrine alkaloids with ingredients having a known stimulant effect (e.g., caffeine). FDA's proposed rule was extremely controversial, leading to a GAO audit which found the FDA's position to be deficient on a number of points. Portions of the proposal were withdrawn on April 3, 2000, and the FDA held public hearings to collect more information. To date a final rule has not been issued (FDA, 1997; GAO, 1999). Ephedrine is listed in and regulated by the 1988 UN Convention Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (Pape et al., 1999). Its use by athletes is banned by the National Collegiate Athletic Association, the International Olympic Committee, and recently, by the National Football League (Wilner, 2001; Vardigan, 2001). Since ephedrine became the precursor of choice for making methamphetamine, federal regulators have severely restricted its bulk sales (Karch, 2000). The complex matrix of ingredients present in herbal ephedra, however, is not conducive to easy conversion to methamphetamine (Pape et al., 1999).  12 Prepared for NCI by Technical Resources International, Inc. to support chemical nominations under contract no. N02-CB-07007 (10/01)   Ephedrine alkaloids  To date, 28 states have taken action to restrict ephedrine use (Leikin & Klein, 1000). Under Ohio law, the maximum recommended dosage of ephedrine for a healthy adult is 100 mg in a 24-hour period for not more than 12 weeks (Metabolife, 2001). Texas law requires the following statement: ""This product has ephedrine group alkaloids in the form of herbal extracts and may cause serious adverse health effects""(Metabolife, 2001).  13 Prepared for NCI by Technical Resources International, Inc. to support chemical nominations under contract no. N02-CB-07007 (10/01)   Ephedrine alkaloids  EVIDENCE FOR POSSIBLE TOXICOLOGIC ACTIVITY Human Data on Ephedrine and Ephedrine Alkaloid Supplements: No epidemiological studies or case reports investigating the association between cancer and the ingestion of ephedrine or dietary supplements containing ephedrine alkaloids, either alone or in combination with caffeine, diuretics and cathartics, or herbal remedies to protect the heart, were identified in the available literature. Ephedrine alkaloids belong to a class of chemicals called the sympathomimetic amines. The biological activities of individual ephedrine alkaloids are well characterized, but the effects of combinations of these compounds, such as are found in dietary supplements, are less well known (CANTOX, 2000). In the US, sympathomimetic poisoning is a common toxicologic emergency. The 1999 annual report of the American Association of Poison Control Centers' Toxic Exposure Surveillance System noted 29,023 sympathomimetic exposures, of which 16,599 were referred to a health care facility and 67 resulted in fatality. Toxicity typically presents with classic sympathomimetic signs and symptoms that include tachycardia, hypertension, diaphoresis, hyperthermia, agitation, and combativeness (Kolecki, 2001). In persons taking caffeine and ephedrine (often with other ingredients) for weight loss, adverse events appear to reach and remain at placebo levels after 4 to 12 weeks, but data from randomized trials are available only up to 6 months. Since obesity requires chronic treatment, controlled clinical trials of longer duration may be needed to assess whether the benefits outweigh risk, even for synthetic product combinations (Greenway, 2001). Overview of the Individual Ephedrine Alkaloids as Sympathomimetic Amines. Ephedrine: Ephedrine stimulates both - and -adrenergic receptors. Stimulation of 1receptors produces contraction of vascular smooth muscle, increased contractile force of the heart, and arrhythmias, as well as glycogenolysis, gluconeogenesis, and hyperpolarization and relaxation of intestinal smooth muscle. Stimulation of 2-receptors decreases insulin secretion, platelet aggregation, and the release of norepinephrine from 14 Prepared for NCI by Technical Resources International, Inc. to support chemical nominations under contract no. N02-CB-07007 (10/01)   Ephedrine alkaloids  the nerve terminals, but causes contraction of the vascular smooth muscle. Stimulation of 1-receptors increases force and rate of contraction of the heart, increased velocity of conduction through the atrioventricular node, and increased renin secretion. The primary effects from stimulation of 2-adrenergic receptors with therapeutic doses of ephedrine are relaxation of the smooth muscle of the blood vessels and bronchi. Stimulation of 3adrenergic receptors causes lipolysis. In addition to its direct sympathomimetic effects, ephedrine can release norepinephrine from its storage sites (Mack, 1997). With prolonged use or frequent dosing, ephedrine depletes norepinephrine stores in sympathetic nerve endings. After several doses of ephedrine are administered, hypotension may result from direct cardiac depression and vasodilation. Ephedrine has CNS stimulating effects similar to those of amphetamines, but less pronounced (McEvoy, 2000). Pseudoephedrine: Pseudoephedrine acts directly on -adrenergic receptors in the respiratory tract mucosa producing vasoconstriction which results in shrinkage of swollen nasal mucous membranes, reduction of tissue hyperemia, edema, and nasal congestion and an increase in nasal airway patency. Drainage of sinus secretions is increased. Like ephedrine, pseudoephedrine has an indirect effect by releasing norepinephrine from its storage sites. Pseudoephedrine acts on -adrenergic receptors to a lesser degree than ephedrine. Pseudoephedrine may relax bronchial smooth muscle by stimulation of 2adrenergic receptors. However, substantial bronchodilation following oral administration has not been demonstrated consistently. Usual doses of pseudoephedrine generally produce negligible effect on blood pressure in normotensive patients. Pseudoephedrine may increase the irritability of the heart muscle and may alter the rhythmic function of the ventricles, especially in large doses (McEvoy, 2000). Norephedrine: d,l-Norephedrine hydrochloride, better known as phenylpropanolamine hydrochloride (PPA), indirectly stimulates both - and -adrenergic receptors by releasing norepinephrine from its storage sites. Like pseudoephedrine, PPA produces vasoconstriction of the bronchial mucosa. PPA increases heart rate, force of contraction, 15 Prepared for NCI by Technical Resources International, Inc. to support chemical nominations under contract no. N02-CB-07007 (10/01)   Ephedrine alkaloids  and cardiac output and excitability and causes CNS stimulation which may result in nervousness, restlessness, insomnia, dizziness, and headache. In some patients, severe reactions including headache, chest tightness, greatly elevated blood pressure, ventricular or atrial premature contractions, and paroxysms of ventricular and atrial tachycardia have occurred with therapeutic doses. Excessive doses may produce heart attack, stroke, intracranial bleeding, parenchyma cerebral hemorrhage, and death (McEvoy, 2000). A recently published study of 702 patients and 1376 control subjects suggested that PPA in appetite suppressants, and possibly in cough and cold remedies, is an independent risk factor for hemorrhagic stroke in women (Kernan et al., 2000). Early in 2001, FDA issued a public health advisory asking companies to stop marketing products containing PPA (Coates, 2001). Case Reports of Toxicity from Ingestion of Ephedrine or Ephedrine Alkaloid Supplements. Toxicity of ephedrine occurs mostly in the cardiovascular and central nervous systems and includes hypertension, dysrhythmias, myocardial infarction, seizures, anxiety, psychosis, stroke, and death (Powell et al., 1998). Case reports describing toxicity from the ingestion of ephedrine alkaloid supplements or ephedrine diet pills have been reported in the literature. Examples include:  Vasculitis and hypersensitivity myocarditis in a 39-year-old man who ingested Herbalife, a ma huang product (1-3 tablets twice daily for 3 months) (Zaacks et al., 1999). Cardiovascular toxicity in a 21-year-old man who ingested herbal ecstasy taken with alcohol and a marijuana cigarette. Caffeine may have contributed to the toxicity observed (Zahn et al., 1999). Death of a 23-year-old body builder who consumed Ripped Fuel ""according to the stated directions"" once or twice a day for >6 months. Autopsy revealed myocardial necrosis with healing of 1-2 weeks, mild fibrosis, and moderate myocyte hypertrophy and vascular congestion (Theoharides, 1997). Cerebral infarct in a 33-year-old sportsman consuming high doses of ma huang extract and creatine monohydrate (Vahedi et al., 2000). 16 Prepared for NCI by Technical Resources International, Inc. to support chemical nominations under contract no. N02-CB-07007 (10/01)         Ephedrine alkaloids     Thalamic infarct (stroke) in a 37-year-old man who ingested street-purchased ""speed"" containing ephedrine for weight loss (Bruno et al., 1993). Hemorrhagic stroke in a 19-year-old woman with a history of anorexia/bulemia and alcoholism after she ingested alcohol and 15-18 tablets containing 25 mg ephedrine and 100 mg guaifenesin (Matthews et al., 1997). Myocardial infarction in a previously healthy 19-year-old male bodybuilder after using tablets containing ephedra and caffeine (Traub et al., 2001). Three deaths from non-prescription diet aids or stimulants; ephedrine concentrations in the blood were 3.5-20.5 mg/L; corresponding blood caffeine concentrations (130 to 344 mg/L) were sufficient to be lethal (Garriott et al., 1985). Hepatitis in a previously well 33-year-old woman shortly after taking a Chinese medicine product containing ma huang (Nadir et al., 1996).       Cardiomyopathy has been reported in individuals who have taken high doses of ephedrine for prolonged durations, in one case 80 25-mg tablets daily for 8 years (Gualtieri & Harris, 1996). In another case, a 35-year old man developed cardiomyopathy following many years of ephedrine use at doses sometimes exceeding 400 mg/day for treatment of asthma (Van Mieghem et al., 1978). At the time of FDA's proposed rule, the FDA had received over 800 Adverse Event Reports (AERs) for products thought to contain ephedrine alkaloids, more AERS than for any other dietary supplement. FDA does not have the authority to require submission of reports of adverse events, and AERs are a passive monitoring tool that relies on voluntary reporting. Like all passive surveillance systems, AERs have certain limitations such as under-reporting and poor report quality (GAO, 1999). An independent review of 276 AERs conducted for the Ephedra Education Council, a trade association, contended that the FDA database contained numerous inaccuracies, inconsistencies, and omissions (Ephedra Education Panel, 2000). Because the FDA's use of AER data to support its proposed regulation of ephedrinealkaloids was widely criticized, the FDA requested an independent review of the AER 17 Prepared for NCI by Technical Resources International, Inc. to support chemical nominations under contract no. N02-CB-07007 (10/01)   Ephedrine alkaloids  reports. A total of 140 reports of adverse effects related to the use of dietary supplements containing ephedra alkaloids submitted to FDA between June 1, 1997, and March 31, 1999, were examined. Of these cases, 31% were judged as definitely or probably related to the use of supplements containing ephedra alkaloids, and 31% were deemed to be possibly related. Among the adverse events deemed definitely, probably, or possibly related, 47% involved cardiovascular symptoms and 18% involved the CNS. Hypertension was the single most frequent adverse effect (17 reports), followed by palpitations, tachycardia, or both (13), stroke (10); and seizures (7). Ten events resulted in death and 13 events produced permanent disability (Haller & Benowitz, 2000). In a September 5, 2001 petition to the FDA to ban dietary supplements containing ephedra, Public Citizen contends that 1,398 of 3,308 AERs received by FDA between January 1993 and February 2000 were associated with ephedra and related substances. Among the 1,398 cases, there were 81 deaths, 32 heart attacks, 62 reports of cardiac arrhythmia, 91 reports of hypertension, 69 strokes, and 70 seizures. Public Citizen also noted an increase in adverse events associated with ephedra-containing supplements in data collected by the American Association of Poison Control Centers, which showed 211 events in 1997 vs 407 in 1999 (Public Citizen, 2001). In a single study, nephrolithiasis (kidney stones) was reported to be associated with chronic ephedrine intake (Blau, 1998). In followup to a case of nephrolithiasis in a 27year old man who had taken 4-12 energy supplement tablets containing 170 mg of ma huang extract daily for 11 months, it was determined that 106 specimens from a total of 166,466 stones archived at a single facility contained ephedrine metabolites (Powell et al., 1998). In many of the case reports and AERs, alternative explanations for the cause of the adverse event are possible, or additional factors were present that may have contributed to the toxicity. Thus, the role of ephedra remains disputed. Effects of Ephedrine or Ephedra without Caffeine. 18 Prepared for NCI by Technical Resources International, Inc. to support chemical nominations under contract no. N02-CB-07007 (10/01)   Ephedrine alkaloids  According to an industry spokesperson, an extensive literature review by Jewel and Binramache indicated that a single dose of 60 mg of ephedrine is required to cause a significant increase in blood pressure in healthy adults. The magnitude of this increase was 10-15 mm Hg (Office of Women's Health, 2000). A short-term (2 day) randomized crossover study involving 10 subjects (5 male, 5 female) compared the effects of ingesting three dietary supplements containing ma huang vs 25 mg ephedrine capsules. Although the dietary supplements also contained other herbal ingredients, the adverse effects reported (tachycardia, anxiety, headache, irritability, insomnia, and loss of appetite) were typical of ephedrine (Gurley et al., 1998). A second study examined the short-term effects of ingesting ma huang on heart rate and blood pressure in 12 normotensive subjects administered two doses (19.4 mg ephedrine, 4.9 mg pseudoephedrine, 1.2 mg methylephedrine) 9 hours apart. Six developed a statistically significant increase in heart rate and three had a nonsignificant increase. Four participants experienced statistically significant increases in systolic blood pressure, but two had significant decreases in diastolic blood pressure (White et al. 1997). Using a double blind, placebo, crossover protocol, Kaats and Adelman (1994) demonstrated a significant loss of weight (P<0.01) and body fat (P<0.001) in 100 subjects administered a proprietary formulation that included ma huang over a 4-week period. No significant changes were observed in resting heart rates and blood pressure. 2  In a controlled study with exposures for up to a year, the effects of an ephedrine bronchodilator on the cardiovascular system were measured (Wilson et al., 1976). Baseline heart rate changed little in the ephedrine group. Both baseline systolic pressure and diastolic pressure fell progressively, particularly during the last 6 months. Study participants took ephedrine at 75 mg/day and terbutaline at 15 mg/day in 3 divided doses.  Whether this formulation contains caffeine could not be determined; the study sponsor manufactures Lite Bites which contain chromium picolinate and 22 vitamins and minerals (AMBI, Inc., 2001).  2  19 Prepared for NCI by Technical Resources International, Inc. to support chemical nominations under contract no. N02-CB-07007 (10/01)   Ephedrine alkaloids  Controlled Studies of Ephedrine/Ephedra and Caffeine. Ephedra-containing dietary supplement products reported to the FDA as causing adverse events have almost always contained large amounts of caffeine (150-300 mg per unit dose) in addition to ephedrine alkaloids (Bucci, 2000). Thus, the adverse events reported in controlled studies of such products are of interest. Several key papers are described below. Additional information is contained in CANTOX (2000). Single doses of placebo or ephedrine + caffeine (E+C) (10/200 mg; 20/100 mg; 20/200 mg) were administered to six healthy, lean subjects. The 3-hour post-intake increase in systolic blood pressure after all three combinations average 5-7 mm Hg more than placebo (P<0.01). Diastolic blood pressure was increased by approximately 4 mm Hg more than placebo only in the 10/200 and 20/100 groups. Heart rate was increased in the 20/100 and 20/200 groups (Astrup et al., 1991; Astrup & Toubro, 1993). In followup to the previous study, Astrup and coworkers (1992) conducted a randomized, placebo-controlled, double blind study of 180 obese patients treated by diet, E+C (20 mg/200mg), ephedrine (20), caffeine (200), or placebo 3 times a day for 24 weeks. Weight losses were significantly greater in the E+C group than in the other groups, all of whom lost weight. Systolic and diastolic blood pressure fell in all four groups. Three E+C patients and one ephedrine patient withdrew because of adverse reactions. Approximately half of the E+C and ephedrine patients complained of transient symptoms (tremor, insomnia, dizziness). Nasser and coworkers (1999) conducted a double-blind, placebo-controlled 8-week trial of Metabolife-356 (E, 72 mg/d; C, 240 mg/d) in healthy subjects. Of the 67 subjects, 7 dropped out before first follow-up, 5 on E+C: 1 with high blood pressure, 4 with heart palpitations. Of 60 with at least one follow-up visit, 12 dropped out before week 8, 6 on E+C: 2 with heart palpitations, 1 with irritability, and 1 with increased systolic blood pressure. Of the 48 subjects who completed the study, the 24 on E+C had greater changes in body weight, % body fat, and serum triglycerides, but they also reported increases in 20 Prepared for NCI by Technical Resources International, Inc. to support chemical nominations under contract no. N02-CB-07007 (10/01)   Ephedrine alkaloids  dry mouth, heart palpitations, blood pressure, and insomnia. Boozer and coworkers (2000) studied of the effects of E+C in obese, but otherwise healthy subjects. A total of 69 persons ingested 90 mg ephedrine alkaloids and 192 mg caffeine daily, given as three equally divided doses. An additional 68 subjects received placebo. Statistically significant increases in systolic blood pressure and heart rate were observed in the ephedra/caffeine group by week 4. A total of 46 subjects in the active group and 38 in the placebo group continued to participate in the study, extending the results through 6 months. Heart rate remained persistently increased although cardiac arrhythmias were not increased. Huber administered the weight-loss preparations, Nutra 1 (Lean-R-Gy: Thermogenic Weight Loss and Natural Energizer), Nutra 2 (Trim-4-Life), and Nutra 3 (ProTrim) to obese volunteers for 6 months. These products contained approximately 48, 24, and 72 mg ephedrine alkaloid/day, respectively, when used as directed3. Nutra 3 also contained 200 mg/day of caffeine when used as directed. Symptoms were stated to be of extremely low frequency; neither systolic nor diastolic blood pressure were raised. The study was not blinded and there were no control groups, limiting its utility (American Herbal Products Association, 1999; CANTOX, 2000). Ingerslev and coworkers (1997) conducted a 6-week study on the effects of a slimming drug on blood pressure. The 136 subjects were normotensive, hypertensives treated with adrenergic -receptor blocking drugs, and hypertensives treated with other antihypertensive agents. Systolic blood pressure was reduced significantly (5.5 mm Hg) in the group given E+C (20mg/200mg) and treated with agents other than -blockers. In the normotensive group given E+C, both systolic and diastolic blood pressure were reduced significantly(4.4/3.9 mmHg). In the E+C groups, 45 of 81 patients had side effects including nausea (12%), palpitations (10%), increased perspiration (6%), and  Nutra 1 and Nutra 2 are derived primarily from ma huang. Nutra 3 ephedra is derived from other sources (American Herbal Products Association, 1999).  3  21 Prepared for NCI by Technical Resources International, Inc. to support chemical nominations under contract no.

In the placebo group, 21% reported undesirable effect During the course of a 15-week study comparing dexfenfluramine with 20 mg ephedrine/200 mg caffeine given 3 times a day, 27 of 50 E+C patients complained of side effects, primarily agitation. Both systolic and diastolic blood pressures were reduced (Breum et al., 1994). Nrregaard and coworkers (1996) administered E+C (60 + 600 mg/day) for 1 year to heavy smokers. A total of 152 received E+C and 73 received placebo. Subjects in the treatment group reported significantly more palpitations, sweating, dizziness, and nausea during the first week but then the differences leveled off; 6 subjects withdrew because of side effects. Six subjects administered ephedrine (75-150 mg), caffeine (150 mg), and aspirin (330 mg) (ECA) for 7-26 months lost weight without significant changes in heart rate, blood pressure, or cholesterol levels (Daly et al., 1993). Supplements of E+C (50 mg/400 mg) given daily for 10 days to 9 obese women were described as having only a weak effect on the cardiovascular system, but addition of yohimbine (10 mg/day) attenuated cardiac performance during rest and handgrip stress and increased cardiac work during dynamic exercise in a second group of 9 obese women (Waluga et al., 1998). The nervousness, psychosis, headache, dizziness, seizures, stroke, premature ventricular contraction, hypertension, myocardial infarction and death described in reports of the adverse effects of ephedra supplements are consistent with the nonselective adrenergic agonist properties of sympathomimetic amines (Boullata & Nace, 2000). Caffeine appears to potentiate these effects. Animal Data on Ephedra Supplements: Acute Studies. LD50 values for various species and routes of administration are available.

Clinical signs of toxicity included tremors, seizures, vomiting, tachycardia, hyperthermia, and nonspecific behavioral changes. Doses of guarana and ma huang at which signs of intoxication were reported ranged between 4.4 and 296 mg/kg bw and 1.3 and 89 mg/kg bw, respectively. Clinical signs developed within 8 hours after ingestion in 80% of the dogs; duration ranged from 10 to 48 hours (Ooms et al., 2001). Subacute Studies of Ephedra Supplements. The safety of a ma huang herbal preparation containing 9% l-ephedrine was addressed in a repeated-dose study in BALB/c mice. Male and female mice (5/sex/dose) were dosed twice a day at 20-4,000 mg/kg for 2 weeks. The highest dose (8,000 mg/kg/day) was lethal to 50% of the animals with gastrointestinal bleeding observed at necropsy. The same toxicity findings to a lesser degree were observed in the 4,000 mg/kg groups; liver weights were not increased. From these data, the LD50 for l-ephedrine in this herbal preparation was determined to be 360 mg/kg twice daily (720 mg/kg/day). Based on body surface area corrections, this corresponds to 2.1 grams twice daily of l-ephedrine and 23.3 grams twice daily of ma huang in a 70 kg human (Law et al., 1996). 23 Prepared for NCI by Technical Resources International, Inc. to support chemical nominations under contract no.

No subchronic or chronic studies of the effects of ephedrine alkaloid extracts in animals were identified in the available literature. Genotoxicity Studies of Ephedra Supplements. Zenedrine RFA-1, a herbal tea containing ephedrine (8.5 mg/ml), pseudoephedrine (3.4 mg/ml), norpseudoephedrine (0.2 mg/ml), and norephedrine (0.2 mg/ml) was tested in the National Cancer Institute Short-Term Test Program (STTP). This material was negative in all five strains of Salmonella in the Ames test. Results from the mouse lymphoma assay are not yet available (Seifried, 2001). Xue-jun and coworkers (1991) reported that Ephedrae sinica Staph extract was not mutagenic in Salmonella typhimurium TA98 or TA100 either in the absence or presence of S-9 at doses up to 40 mg/plate. The ephedra extract was also administered intraperitoneally to mice at doses described as equivalent to 1-40 times that used in traditional medicine. No changes in the ratio of polychromatic erythrocytes to total erythrocytes or in the frequency of micronucleated polychromatic erythrocytes in the bone marrow micronucleus assay were observed. Ephedra herba was screened for mutagenic activity by the rec-assay with Bacillus subtilis as well as the Ames reversion assay with S. typhimurium TA98 and TA100 with and without metabolic activation. The ephedra extract was not mutagenic at concentrations up to 100 mg/ml (Morimoto et al., 1982). E. sinica extract inhibited the mutagenicity of benzo[a]pyrene in S. typhimurium TA98 with S-9. However, the extract was an ineffective antitumor agent when administered for 50 weeks in the drinking water of F344/DuCrj male rats that had received benzo[a]pyrene by subcutaneous injection. E. sinica extract also inhibited the mutagenicity of 3,9dinitrofluoranthene and 1,6-dinitropyrene (Horikawa et al., 1994). Decoctions of Ephedra foliata extracts produced nitrosamines when reacted with excess sodium nitrite at conditions found in gastric juice (pH 2, 37EC) (Alwan et al., 1986) 24 Prepared for NCI by Technical Resources International, Inc. to support chemical nominations under contract no. N02-CB-07007 (10/01)   Ephedrine alkaloids  The cytoxicities of various ma huang extracts on a battery of cell lines could not be totally accounted for by their ephedrine contents, suggesting the presence of other toxins in the extracts (Lee et al., 2000). Animal Data on Ephedrine Acute Studies. NTP (1986) reported an LD50 of 812 mg/kg in male mice and 1,072 mg/kg in female mice of the B6C3F1 strain for ephedrine sulfate administered via gavage. An LD50 was not be determined in F344 rats similarly dosed at 75-1,200 mg/kg because deaths occurred in all dose groups. Subchronic and Chronic Studies. Thirteen-week studies of ephedrine sulfate via feed were conducted by NTP (1986) in F344/N rats and B6C3F1 mice. Doses were 125-2,000 ppm in rats and 310-5,000 ppm in mice. Hyperactivity and excitability, the most frequent clinical observations, were observed with the greatest incidence in animals receiving ephedrine sulfate at 1,000 ppm or higher. No compound-related histopathological effects were observed. Compound-related reduced weight gain was observed in each sex of both species even though feed consumption by dosed and control animals was comparable. These effects at concentrations of ephedrine sulfate of 500 ppm or higher were considered to be potentially life threatening over the course of a 2-year study. For this reason, the ephedrine sulfate doses selected for the 2-year study were 125 and 250 ppm in feed. Ephedrine sulfate was tested for carcinogenic activity in a 103-week feed study in rats and mice. The compound was administered at 0, 125, or 250 ppm to 50 animals/group/sex. Throughout most of the 2-year study, mean body weights of males and females of both species were lower than those of controls and survival of the chemically exposed female rats (39/50) was greater than survival of controls (27/50). No evidence of a tumorigenic effect was observed. However, a significant decrease in the incidence of mammary gland fibroadenomas observed in ephedrine sulfate-treated female rats was thought to be associated with reduced weight gain (NTP, 1986, pp. 55-56).  25 Prepared for NCI by Technical Resources International, Inc. to support chemical nominations under contract no.

N02-CB-07007 (10/01)   Ephedrine alkaloids  Genotoxicity: Ephedrine sulfate at 100-10,000 g/plate was negative in S. typhimurium TA97, TA98, TA100, TA1535 with or without metabolic activation (NTP, 1986). Ephedrine sulfate was also negative in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells without S-9. With metabolic activation, the test was equivocal for both sister chromatid exchanges (SCE) and chromosomal aberrations (CA) (NTP, 1986). Ephedrine hydrochloride was tested in the National Cancer Institute Short-Term Test Program (STTP) and was negative in all five strains of Salmonella in the Ames test. Results from the mouse lymphoma assay are not yet available (Seifried, 2001). Metabolism of Ephedrine and Ephedra: Ephedrine is rapidly absorbed and extensively distributed throughout the body after oral administration, with distribution to the liver, lungs, kidneys, spleen, and brain. Wide interindividual variation in plasma levels has been observed after oral dosing (CANTOX, 2000). In a study by Gurley and coworkers (1998), the absorption and distribution of ephedrine was similar whether it was supplied as ephedra extract in combination with other botanicals or as a single ingredient ephedrine capsule. In contrast, White and coworkers (1997) reported that ephedrine ingested in the form of ma huang had a time to maximum plasma concentration (Tmax) of almost 4 hours, compared with the Tmax for pure ephedrine of 2 hours. The major route of elimination for ephedrine in humans is urinary excretion. Ephedrine is eliminated in the urine largely as unchanged drug, with a half-life of about 3 to 6 hours (McEvoy, 2000). Up to 95% of an oral dose may be excreted in the urine within 24 hours. The urinary excretion of ephedrine is pH-dependent due to the presence of an ionizable group in the ephedrine molecule and is increased in acidic urine. In alkaline urine, excretion is reduced to 20 to 35% of the dose (CANTOX, 2000). The metabolism of ephedrine in humans, dogs and several species of rodents proceeds 27 Prepared for NCI by Technical Resources International, Inc. to support chemical nominations under contract no. N02-CB-07007 (10/01)   Ephedrine alkaloids  primarily by three reactions; aromatic hydroxylation, N-demethylation, and oxidative deamination. The extent to which ephedrine is metabolized and the major metabolites vary quantitatively between species. The extent of aromatic hydroxylation is greatest in rats, followed by rabbits, guinea pigs, and dogs, with no aromatic hydroxylation observed in humans. N-demethylation of ephedrine is greatest in rabbits followed by dogs, guinea pigs, rats, and humans. Deamination is greatest in rabbits, followed by humans and rats (CANTOX, 2000). Ephedrine, 8-20%, is metabolized in humans by N-demethylation to PPA. A total of 413% of an oral dose of ephedrine (CANTOX, 2000). The duration and magnitude of ephedrine activity are known to be affected by antacids and agents which alter the pH of urine thus affecting absorption and excretion, respectively. Ephedrine was not found to affect theophylline clearance (CANTOX, 2000; Upton, 1991). Other Biological Effects Teratogenicity. No information on the teratogenicity of ma huang extracts was found in the available literature. Kanai and coworkers (1986a,1986b) investigated the cardiovascular teratogenicity of ephedrine in pregnant Wistar-Imamichi rats injected ip on days 9,10, or 11 of gestation with single doses of 0.1, 1, 10, or 50 mg/kg of ephedrine. The frequency of cardiovascular abnormalities was dose dependent, ranging from 8.1 to 26.9%, although no significant differences were seen based on day of gestation dosed. All cardiovascular malformations were ventricular septal defects; no extracardiac malformations were observed. Evidence of cardiovascular teratogenicity has also been observed in chick embryos 28 Prepared for NCI by Technical Resources International, Inc. to support chemical nominations under contract no. N02-CB-07007 (10/01)  undergoes oxidative deamination yielding 1-  phenylpropan-1,2-diol and further side-chain oxidation to benzoic acid and hippuric acid   Ephedrine alkaloids  (Nishikawa et al., 1985). Placental transfer of ephedrine occurs at 70% of the maternal blood levels. Ephedrine is also excreted in breast milk. No clinical studies have been conducted with ephedrine in pregnant or nursing mothers (CANTOX, 2000). Effects Contributed by Other Ingredients in Ephedrine Alkaloid Supplements: The possibility of effects contributed by other agents should be considered since they are often a major component of herbal preparations at far greater concentrations than the ephedrine alkaloids. These agents include stimulants, diuretics and cathartics, and heart protectors. Stimulants. Guarana: Guarana seed has been used by Rainforest Indian tribes as a stimulant, astringent, and in treating diarrhea and for curing fevers, headaches, and cramps. Guarana seeds contain up to 5% (25,000-75,000 ppm) of guaranine as well as trace amounts of theophylline (500-750 ppm) and theobromine (300-500 ppm). Guarana seeds also contain large quantities of tannins. Guaranine would affect the body in the same manner as caffeine (Blumenthal, 1998; Guarana.com, 2001a, 2001b, 2001c; Raintree.com, 2001; Vitacost.com, 2001). Limited testing of guarana has been conducted. No significant toxicological effects were observed in rats and mice given guarana at 1000-2000 mg/kg (ip and po) and motor activity was not affected. Progress in weight gain was similar to controls in rats administered 0.3 or 3 mg/ml guarana in water/Tween as the only source of liquid for 12 months. Histopathological examination found no alterations in heart, lungs, stomach, small and large intestine, liver, pancreas, kidneys, bladder, or spleen (Mattei et al., 1998). Mice that ingested a guarana suspension at a dose of 0.3 mg/ml had the same average lifespan as controls even after 23 months of treatment (Espinola et al., 1997).  29 Prepared for NCI by Technical Resources International, Inc. to support chemical nominations under contract no. N02-CB-07007 (10/01)   Ephedrine alkaloids  Aqueous extracts of guarana did not affect the blood glucose in mice with epinephrineinduced glycogenolysis (Miura et al., 1998). In contrast, aqueous extracts of guarana were genotoxic as assessed by lysogenic induction in Escherichia coli, and this extract also induced frameshift mutations in Salmonella typhimurium TA97 (da Fonseca et al., 1994). Aqueous guarana extract induced cytotoxicity in Chinese hamster ovary cells and bacterial cells (Photobacterium phosphoreum) causing the authors to conclude that high doses could be harmful to human health (Santa Maria et al., 1998). Caffeine [58-08-3]. Caffeine is pharmacologically similar to the other xanthine drugs, theobromine and theophylline; however, these three agents differ in the intensity of their actions on various structures (McEvoy, 2000). Caffeine causes transient increases in heart rate, force of contraction, cardiac output, and heart work. Caffeine constricts cerebral vasculature but dilates peripheral blood vessels, decreasing peripheral vascular resistance. The effect on blood pressure is offset by increased cardiac output. The overall effect of caffeine on heart rate and blood pressure depends on whether CNS or peripheral effects predominate. Adverse CNS effects include insomnia, restlessness, nervousness, and mild delirium. Adverse GI effects include nausea, vomiting, and gastric irritation. It is not known whether caffeine is teratogenic in humans; however, it is teratogenic in rats (McEvoy, 2000). Caffeine has been tested for carcinogenicity in two separate studies in rats: (1) males and female of the Wistar strain, at doses of 0.1 & 0.2% in drinking water for 78 weeks; and (2) males and females of the Sprague-Dawley strain, at doses of 200, 430, 930, 2000 mg/L in drinking water for 2 years. Both studies were negative (CCRIS, 2001). As seen in Table 4, below, clastogenicity and mutagenicity have been demonstrated in some in vitro and animal studies although many other studies are negative.  30 Prepared for NCI by Technical Resources International, Inc. to support chemical nominations under contract no.

The bark contains anthranoids, mainly of the aloe-emodin type, in addition to those of the chrysophanol and physcion type. 1,8Dihydroxyanthracene derivatives have a laxative effect, and cascara sagrada bark is used to treat constipation. German Commission E warns against long-time use/abuse, which may cause disturbances of electrolyte balance, especially potassium deficiency, which can lead to disorders of heart function and muscular weakness (Blumenthal, 1998). Experiments pertaining to the genotoxicity of cascara sagrada and its preparations are not available. Data obtained for aloe-emodin (481-72-1) are outlined in Table 5 below. Table 5.

Hawthorn: Preparations of hawthorn berry have been applied to the treatment of coronary circulation, coronary complications, and weak heart. Preparations of hawthorn flowers have been applied to enhance the activity of myocardium, prevent stress-related heart disease, strengthen the heart and circulatory system, and for coronary insufficiency. Hawthorn leaf preparations have been applied prophylactically to improve the perfusion and nutrition of the myocardium, for simple circulatory disorders of the coronary artery, for diminished cardiac output due to hypertension and pulmonary disease, and for hypotension. According to German Commission E, the effectiveness of hawthorn for the claimed applications has not been documented and there are no scientific data on which 32 Prepared for NCI by Technical Resources International, Inc. to support chemical nominations under contract no.

Willow: White willow bark is considered a natural aspirin. Its salicin derivatives are oxidized in the liver and blood to produce salicylic acid. Average daily dosage corresponds to 60-120 mg total salicin. It has pain-relieving effects like aspirin: typical dosages, up to six 400 mg capsules a day, may be too low to achieve the effect of aspirin (American Herbal Products Association, 2000; Blumenthal, 1998). Both willow bark and aspirin are salicylates, a class of compounds that work by virtue of their salicylic acid content. All salicylates share substantially the same side effects. The major adverse effects include irritation of the gastric mucosa, adverse effects when used during pregnancy (stillbirth, bleeding, prolonged gestation and labor, low birth weigh infants), stroke, and adverse effects in children with fever and dehydration. Approximately 5% of the population is hypersensitive to salicylates ( FDA, 1993).  33 Prepared for NCI by Technical Resources International, Inc. to support chemical nominations under contract no.

SMITH, Administrative Patent Judge, McKELVEY, Senior Administrative Patent Judge, and ROBINSON, Administrative Patent Judge. ROBINSON, Administrative Patent Judge. DECISION ON APPEAL This is an appeal under 35 U.S.C.  134 from the final rejection of claims 27 - 36. Claims 19-26 remain pending but are not now subject to rejection or objection. 2  This application was filed on August 4, 1994 under the provisions of 35 U.S.C.  371 as a national stage application of PCT/EP92/02914 which was filed December 16, 1992. Therefore, the present application has an effective filing date of December 16, 1992. (35 U.S.C.  363; 37 CFR  1.495). 1  We find no explicit statement by the examiner indicating that claims 19-26 are allowable. We note the examiner's statement, in the Examiner's Answer (Answer) of September 4, 1996 (Paper No. 17), that ""The statement of the status of claims contained in the brief is correct. (Answer, page 1). Appellants indicate that ""[p]resumably, claims 19-26 therefore will have been found allowable."" Therefore, it is our understanding that these claims are not before us. 2   Appeal No. 1997-2336 Application No. 08/256,065 Claims 27, 30, 35, and 36 are representative of the subject matter on appeal and read as follows: 27. A transdermal therapeutic application system useful for cancer prophylaxis for applying through the skin of a person, an effective cancer prophylactic amount of an active ingredient consisting essentially of acetyl salicylic acid or a non-toxic pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof or a combination thereof; said transdermal therapeutic application system comprising a matrix containing a substance such that hydrolysis of acetyl salicylic acid is precluded or is at least greatly reduced; and said substance being selected from the group consisting of dioctyl cyclohexane, dioctyl cyclohexane dissolved in n-heptane, glycerol ester of a partially hydrogenated colophonium and dioctyl cyclohexane dissolved in n-heptane, and silicone oil. 30. A therapeutic method for preventing cancer in a person, comprising  administering through a transdermal therapeutic application system applied to the skin of said person, an effective cancer prophylactic amount of an active ingredient consisting essentially of acetyl salicylic acid or a non-toxic pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof or a combination thereof; and said transdermal application system comprising a matrix containing a substance such that hydrolysis of acetyl salicylic acid is precluded or is at least greatly reduced;(sic, .) 35. The therapeutic method of claim 30,  wherein said cancer prophylaxis is against tumor formation. 36. The therapeutic method of claim 35,  wherein said tumor formation prophylaxis is in the gastrointestinal tract.  2   Appeal No. 1997-2336 Application No. 08/256,065 There are no references relied upon by the examiner in this appeal.

For the reasons discussed below, we affirm the rejection of claim 27-35, vacate the rejection of claim 36 and enter a new ground of rejection of claims 27-29 under the provisions of 37 CFR  1.196(b). Background Appellants describe the invention at page 5 of the specification as being directed to a transdermal application system for the administration of acetylsalicylic acid or its pharmaceutical salts for antithrombotic therapy and prophylaxis against cancer. The system is described as avoiding the disadvantages associated with oral application and allows for target-specific dosages of the unchanged active substance. Jan. 19, 1999  4   Appeal No. 1997-2336 Application No. 08/256,065 Discussion The rejection under 35 U.S.C.  112, first paragraph Claims 27-35: As stated in Genentech Inc. v. Nova Nordisk A/S, 108 F.3d 1361, 1366, 42 USPQ2d 1001, 1005 (Fed. Cir. 1995): Patent protection is granted in return for an enabling disclosure of an invention, not for vague intimations of general ideas that may or may not be workable. See Brenner v. Manson, 383 U.S. 519, 536, 148 USPQ 689, 696 (1966) (stating, in context of the utility requirement, that ""a patent is not a hunting license. It is not a reward for the search, but compensation for its successful conclusion.) When the issue of enablement is raised under 35 U.S.C.  112, first paragraph, the initial burden is on the Patent and Trademark Office to establish reasons why one skilled in the art would not believe the objective statements of enablement in the specification. In re Marzocchi, 439 F.2d 220, 223, 169 USPQ 367, 369 (CCPA 1971). The examiner urges that (Answer, paragraph bridging pages 2-3): [t]he specification does not reasonably provide enablement for prevention of any and all cancers via transdermal administration of acetyl salicylic acid. The cancer therapy art remains highly unpredictable, and no examples exists for efficacy of a single compound or product against cancer generally. For example, certain cancers/tumors are dependent upon estrogen for their induction or stimulation (e.g. breast tumors) and others are not. Thus, the issue presented in this appeal is whether the appellants' disclosure would have enabled one skilled in this art to use the claimed invention throughout its scope without undue experimentation.  5   Appeal No. 1997-2336 Application No. 08/256,065 Factors appropriate for determining whether undue experimentation is required to practice the claimed invention throughout its full scope are listed in In re Wands, 858 F.2d 731, 737, 8 USPQ2d 1400, 1404 (Fed. Cir. 1988). These factors include: (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) the the the the the the the the quantity of experimentation necessary, amount of direction or guidance presented, presence or absence of working examples, nature of the invention, state of the prior art, relative skill of those in the art, predictability or unpredictability of the art, and breadth of the claims.  The examiner's rejection and the reasoning presented in support thereof focus on these factors. At pages 2 and 3 of the Answer, the examiner begins her analysis by interpreting the claims to encompass the use of the transdermal acetylsalicylic acid system for the prevention of cancers generally. The examiner urges that the prevention of cancer in general is a field of endeavor which remains unpredictable. The appellants argue that the examiner has failed to provide prior art documentation to justify the statement that the art area of cancer therapy remains highly unpredictable. However, the examiner's reasoning appears sound (Answer, paragraph bridging pages 2-3) and appellants have offered no meaningful evidence which would indicate that at the time of the filing of this application, the field of endeavor relating to the prevention of cancer, as compared to the treatment of patients with cancer, was not unpredictable. In such situations, it is not necessary to provide extrinsic evidence to establish the relevant factor. See Enzo Biochem. Inc. v. Calgene Inc., 188 F.3d 1362, 1371-72, 6   Appeal No. 1997-2336 Application No. 08/256,065 52 USPQ2d 1129, 1136 (Fed. Cir. 1999) (""We have also noted that all of the factors need not be reviewed when determining whether a disclosure is enabling."") (citing Amgen, Inc. v. Chugai Pharm. Co., Ltd. , 927 F.2d 1200, 1213, 18 USPQ2d 1016, 1027 (Fed. Cir. 1991)). The examiner, additionally, notes the lack of working examples describing the prevention of any kind of cancer by transdermal delivery of aspirin. (Answer, page 4). Further, the examiner notes that the claims are not limited to a particular type of cancer but are directed to the treatment of ""cancer generally"". (Answer, pages 3 and 4). The examiner concludes that (Answer, page 5): the instant specification does not provide enablement for the prevention of any cancer via the transdermal administration of aspirin, even at the disclosed blood levels. As explained in PPG Indus., Inc. v. Guardian Indus. Corp., 75 F.3d 1558, 1564, 37 USPQ2d 1618, 1623 (Fed. Cir. 1996): The test is not merely quantitative, since a considerable amount of experimentation is permissible, if it is merely routine, or if the specification in question provides a reasonable amount of guidance with respect to the direction in which the experimentation should proceed to enable the determination of how to practice a desired embodiment of the invention claimed. Ex parte Jackson, 217 USPQ 804, 807 (Bd. App. 1982). In the case before us, the examiner has established that the specification is lacking in guidance as to the use or application of the transdermal system for the prevention of cancers generally. Overall, we find that the examiner provides both evidence and sound scientific reasoning in support of her position. We, therefore, find no error in  7   Appeal No. 1997-2336 Application No. 08/256,065 the examiner's determination that a prima facie case of unpatentability has been established sufficient to support the rejections of claims 27-35 under 35 U.S.C.  112, first paragraph. Having met her initial burden, the burden shifts to the appellants to rebut the basis for the rejection. Appellants, initially, argue that the amount of direction or guidance present in the application is adequate for those skilled in this art to practice the invention and cites the article by Thun I, published in 1991, as evidence that aspirin has been shown to reduce the risk of colon cancer and reduce mortality caused by colonic cancer. (Principal Brief, paragraph bridging pages 7-8). However, as appellants acknowledge, the article is limited to the discussion of colon cancer and ""fails to provide further information as to the manner and form of administration and dosage."" (Principal Brief, page 8). Also, as pointed out by the examiner (Answer, page 4): In the article by Thun, it is clearly stated as a conclusion that ""regular aspirin use at low dosages may (emphasis added) reduce the risk of fatal colon cancer. Whether this is due to a direct effect of aspirin . . . or to other factors is unclear."" The results of this one study, are therefore, inconclusive as to the efficacy of aspirin in reducing the risk of fatal colon cancer, (sic, .) Moreover, however, even if aspirin was shown to be indisputably effective in reducing the risk of fatal colon cancer, that finding would not be predictive of aspirin preventing any and all cancers in general. Finally, ""reducing the risk"" is not equivalent to ""prevention of"".  8   Appeal No. 1997-2336 Application No. 08/256,065 We read Thun I to reflect caution on the part of the authors in describing the potential use of aspirin in the prevention of cancer in stating (page 1323, column 1, first full paragraph): The risk of all fatal cancers combined was somewhat lower among persons who used aspirin than in nonusers; this difference was of borderline statistical significance except in women in the highest category of use. No dose-response trend was seen for all cancers. Thun I, also, states (page 1324, column 1, first paragraph): However, until the findings can be replicated, they should be interpreted cautiously, given the observational nature of our study and the important differences in the biology and epidemiology of these cancers. Thus, appellants' evidence appears to urge caution with respect to the potential usefulness of aspirin in reducing the risk or prevention of cancer in a subject. In addition, the article provides little guidance which would assist those skilled in this art in practicing the presently claimed prevention of cancers in general and would not remove the need for experimentation to obtain the claimed prevention of cancer. Appellants point to page 6, lines 22-25 of the present specification as disclosing that in the prophylaxis against cancer, a therapeutically effective amount of acetyl-salicylic acid and/or acetylsalicylic acid salts in the blood corresponds to blood level values of acetylsalicylic acid of between 0.1 and 1.0 g/ml. (Principal Brief, page 11). The examiner acknowledges this disclosure, but urges that there are no working examples indicating prevention of any kind of cancer by transdermally delivering a sufficient quantity 9   Appeal No. 1997-2336 Application No. 08/256,065 of acetylsalicylic acid to provide blood levels between 0.1 to 1.0 microgram/ml. (Answer, page 4). The appellants have, also, submitted 16 references, listed above, in addition to Thun I, to establish that aspirin has efficacy in the prevention of several different cancers. (Supplemental Reply Brief filed May 19, 1997). We note, initially, that all of these documents were published after the effective filing date of the present application. (December 12, 1992). Thus, they can not be said to represent the state of the art or the skill level of those in this art as of the filing date of this application. They are of little probative value for the proposition asserted by the appellants that the disclosure was sufficient at the time of filing of the application for patent to permit the practice of the invention without undue experimentation. In re Wright, 999 F.2d 1557, 1562, 27 USPQ2d 1510, 1514 (Fed. Cir. 1993) (""[A]ll of these developments occurred after the effective filing date of Wright's application and are of no significance regarding what one skilled in the art believed as of that date.""). The examiner, having reviewed these documents, maintained the position that the evidence may link aspirin to a ""reduction of risk"" of cancer, but urges that this was not equivalent to ""prevention"" as presently claimed. Having weighed all of the evidence of record, including the Wands factors, we find no error in the examiner's determination that the specification does not enable one skilled in this art to use the claimed invention throughout its scope without undue experimentation. Appellants have failed to provided evidence or arguments which, on balance, would be  10   Appeal No. 1997-2336 Application No. 08/256,065 sufficient to meet the burden of demonstrating that the disclosure is enabling. The examiner has established a prima facie case of lack of enablement which is sufficient to support the rejections of claims 27-35 under 35 U.S.C.  112, first paragraph, which appellants have not overcome by arguments or convincing evidence. Therefore, the rejection of claims 27-35 under 35 U.S.C.  112, first paragraph, is affirmed. Claim 36: We vacate the rejection of claim 36 under 35 U.S.C.  112, first paragraph, as being based on a non-enabling disclosure for the following reasons. The record with regard to this claim is less than clear. Claim 36 is directed to a therapeutic method wherein the tumor prophylaxis is against tumor formation in the gastrointestinal tract. The appellants in their principal Appeal Brief at page 6 state that claims 27-36 are grouped together which is reasonably read as indicating that they stand and fall together. (37 CFR  1.192(7)(1995)). Yet, in the Reply Brief of November 8, 1996 (Paper No. 18) at pages 12, appellants separately argue claim 36 as being limited to the use of aspirin against tumor formation in the gastrointestinal tract which reads on the use of aspirin to prevent colon cancer. The examiner acknowledged receipt and entry of the Reply Brief in a letter mailed November 26, 1996 (Paper No. 20),but failed to respond to the newly submitted arguments relating to claim 36. Thus, we are left with no rebuttal to arguments explicitly raised by the appellants and no indication whether these arguments taken with the teaching of the Thun I would reasonably be considered persuasive. In this regard, we note  11   Appeal No. 1997-2336 Application No. 08/256,065 the language at page 4 of the Answer where, in discussing the relevance of Thun I, the examiner states that ""even if aspirin was shown to be indisputably effective in reducing the risk of fatal colon cancer, that finding would not be predictive of aspirin preventing any and all cancers in general."" Since ""indisputably effective"" is not the test of whether the disclosure of the application is enabling for that which is claimed, the record is not clear as to the rejection of claim 36. For these reasons, we vacate the rejection of claim 36 under 35 U.S.C.  112, first paragraph. On return of the application to the examining group, we would encourage the examiner to step back and consider the evidence of record, including the Thun I reference, and determine whether the facts and evidence would reasonably support the rejection of claim 36 under 35 U.S.C.  112, first paragraph, using the factors set forth in Wands, supra. New Ground of Rejection Under the provisions of 37 CFR  1.196(b) we enter the following new ground of rejection. Claims 27-29 are rejected under 35 U.S.C.  112, first paragraph, as failing to find adequate written description in the application as filed for the presently claimed invention. In pertinent part, claim 27 provides: said transdermal therapeutic application system comprising a matrix containing a substance such that hydrolysis of acetyl salicylic acid is precluded or at least greatly reduced; and said substance being selected from the group consisting of dioctyl cyclohexane, dioctyl cyclohexane dissolved in n-heptane,  12   Appeal No. 1997-2336 Application No. 08/256,065 glycerol ester of a partially hydrogenated colophonium and dioctyl cyclohexane dissolved in n-heptane, and silicone oil. This portion of claim 27 was added by amendment filed June 6, 1996 (Paper No. 15) to replace matter previously canceled.3 Appellants indicate at page 2 of that paper, that ""[t]he amendment to claim 27 is to insert the Markush group of substances that preclude or greatly reduce hydrolysis of acetyl salicylic acid."" We find no written description, in the application as filed, of the members of the Markush group of claim 27 as being substances that preclude or greatly reduce hydrolysis of acetyl salicylic acid in the transdermal patch. The individual members of this group are named in the examples but there is no explicit statement of their function. We contrast this lack of description of these substances with the explicit statement at page 7 of the specification which states: For reducing or suppressing the hydrolysis, substances may be added such as acylating agents, preferably acetylating agents, and, in particular, acetic anhydride, . . . Further, we compare claim 1 of co-assigned U.S. Patent 5,861,170 to Kissel wherein the members of the Markush group of claim 27 are designated as ""solvents"" rather than as hydrolysis suppressing agents. The members of the Markush group of claim 27 are  Similar terminology was initially added to claim 27 by amendment filed May 25, 1995 (Paper No. 7) in response to the first Office action. In the subsequent final rejection, the examiner rejected the claim as directed to subject matter which lacked antecedent basis in the application as filed for the description of the Markush group of substances as providing hydrophobic adjustments. This terminology was canceled from claim 27, as well as the other claims in which it appeared, by amendment filed April 8, 1996. (Paper No. 11). Claim 27 was subsequently amended at the time of the filing of the Appeal Brief to reintroduce the noted language. (Paper No. 15). While not explicitly stated in the record, the examiner's initials appear on this amendment authorizing entry thereof. Further, the Examiner's Answer, at page 2, indicates that the copy of the claims attached to the Appeal Brief, which included the cited language, was correct. 3  13   Appeal No. 1997-2336 Application No. 08/256,065 individually found in the examples at pages 10-13. In each of these examples, when acetylsalicylic acid is present, the exemplified composition additionally includes acetic anhydride which the specification describes as being the substance useful to preclude or at least reduce the hydrolysis of acetyl salicylic acid in the transdermal system. Thus, on these facts, the designation of the substances found in the Markush group of claim 27 as substances which preclude or at least greatly reduce hydrolysis lacks written support or antecedent basis in the application as filed. Conclusion The examiner's rejection of claims 27-35 under 35 U.S.C.  112, first paragraph, is affirmed. The rejection of claim 36 under 35 U.S.C.  112, first paragraph, is vacated. A new ground of rejection under 37 CFR  1.196(b) is entered as to claims 27-29 under 35 U.S.C.  112, first paragraph.

All Rights Reserved.   Purpose The purpose of this monograph is to provide an extensive review of new therapy to determine whether the reviewed drug should be considered a prior authorization drug or not (open access). While prescription expenditures are increasing at double-digit rates, payors are evaluating ways to control these costs by influencing prescriber behavior and guide appropriate medication usage. This review will assist in the achievement o f qualitative and economic goals related to health care resource utilization. Restricting the use of certain medications can reduce costs by requiring documentation of appropriate indications for use, and where appropriate, encourage the use of less expensive agents within a drug class.  Introduction  1,2  On June 24, 2002, the US Food and Drug Administration granted approval for ziprasidone mesylate (Geodon for Injection) to rapidly control agitated behavior and psychotic symptoms, such as hallucinations and delusions, in patients with acute exacerbations of schizophrenia. Ziprasidone mesylate is the first and only atypical antipsychotic agent approved in the United States for intramuscular (IM) injection.  Dosage Form(s)  2,3  Geodon for Injection is available in a single dose vial as ziprasidone mesylate (20mg ziprasidone/mL when reconstituted according to label instructions) for intramuscular administration. Each mL of ziprasidone mesylate for injection (when reconstituted) affords a colorless to pale pink solution that contains 20mg of ziprasidone and 4.7mg of methanesulfonic acid soulbulized by 294mg of sulfobutylether -cyclodextrin sodium.  Manufacturer  3,4  Pfizer US Pharmaceutical Group 235 East 42nd Street New York, New York, 10017 800-438-1985 http://www.pfizer.com  Indication(s)  3,4  Ziprasidone intramuscular is indicated for the treatment of acute agitation in schizophrenic patients for whom treatment with ziprasidone is appropriate and who need intramuscular antipsychotic medication for rapid control of the agitation.  PA Criteria Proposal l 2  2002 Heritage Information Systems, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   Clinical Efficacy  3,4  The mechanism of action of ziprasidone, as with other drugs having efficacy in schizophrenia, is unknown. However, it has been proposed that this drug's efficacy in schizophrenia is mediated through a combination of dopamine type 2 (D2) and serotonin type 2 (5HT2) antagonism. Antagonism at receptors other than dopamine and 5HT2 with similar receptor affinities may explain some of the other therapeutic and side effects of ziprasidone. Intramuscular Pharmacokinetics Systemic Bioavailability: The bioavailability of ziprasidone administered intramuscularly is 100%. After intramuscular administration of single doses, peak serum concentrations typically occur at approximately 60 minutes post-dose or earlier and the mean half-life (T) ranges from two to five hours. Exposure increases in a dose-related manner and following three days of intramuscular dosing, little accumulation is observed. Metabolism and Elimination: Although the metabolism and elimination of IM ziprasidone have not been systematically evaluated, the intramuscular route of administration would not be expected to alter the metabolic pathways. The results of the intramuscular ziprasidone trials: (1) In a one-day, double-blind, randomized trial (n=79) involving doses of ziprasidone intramuscular of 20 mg or 2 mg, up to four times daily, ziprasidone intramuscular 20 mg was statistically superior to ziprasidone intramuscular 2 mg, as assessed by AUC of the BARS at 0-4 hours, and by CGI severity at 4 hours and study endpoint. (2) In another one-day, double-blind, randomized trial (n=117) involving doses of ziprasidone intramuscular of 10 mg or 2 mg, up to four times daily, ziprasidone intramuscular 10 mg was statistically superior to ziprasidone intramuscular 2 mg, as assessed by AUC of the BARS at 0-2 hours, but not by CGI severity.  Contraindications  3,4  QT Prolongation Because of ziprasidone's dose-related prolongation of the QT interval and the known association of fatal arrhythmias with QT prolongation by some other drugs, ziprasidone is contraindicated in patients with a known history of QT prolongation (including congenital long QT syndrome), with recent acute myocardial infarction, or with uncompensated heart failure. Pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic studies between ziprasidone and other drugs that prolong the QT interval have not been performed. An additive effect of ziprasidone and other drugs that prolong the QT interval cannot be excluded. Therefore, ziprasidone should not be given with:        Dofetilide Class Ia anti-arrhythmics Mesoridazine Pimozide Halofantrine Levomethadyl acetate Arsenic trioxide        Sotalol Class III anti-arrhythmics Thioridazine Sparfloxacin Mefloquine Dolasetron mesylate Tacrolimus        Quinidine Droperidol Chlorpromazine Gatifloxacin Moxifloxacin Pentamidine Probucol  PA Criteria Proposal l 3  2002 Heritage Information Systems, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   Ziprasidone is also contraindicated with drugs that have demonstrated QT prolongation as one of their pharmacodynamic effects.  Warnings  3,4  QT Prolongation and Risk of Sudden Death Ziprasidone use should be avoided in combinations with other drugs that are known to prolong the QTc interval. Additionally, clinicians should be alert to the identification of other drugs that have been consistently observed to prolong the QTc interval. Such drugs should not be prescribed with ziprasidone. Ziprasidone should also be avoided in patients with congenital long QT syndrome and in patients with a history of cardiac arrhythmias. Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS) A potentially fatal symptom complex sometimes referred to as Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS) has been reported in association with administration of antipsychotic drugs. Clinical manifestations of NMS are hyperreflexia, muscle rigidity, altered mental status, and evidence of autonomic instability (irregular pulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, diaphoresis, and cardiac dysrhythmia). Additional signs may include elevated creatinine phosphokinase, myoglobinuria (rhabdomyolysis), and acute renal failure. The management of NMS should include: (1) immediate discontinuation of the antipsychotic drugs and other drugs not essential to concurrent therapy; (2) intensive symptomatic treatment and medical monitoring; (3) treatment of any concomitant serious medical problems for which specific treatments are available. There is no general agreement about specific pharmacological regimens for NMS. Tardive Dyskinesia A syndrome of potentially irreversible, involuntary, dyskinetic movements may develop in patients undergoing treatment with antipsychotic drugs. Although the prevalence of the syndrome appears to be highest among the elderly, especially elderly women, it is impossible to rely upon prevalence estimates to predict, at the inception of antipsychotic treatment, which patients are likely to develop the syndrome. Whether antipsychotic drug products differ in their potential to cause tardive dyskinesia is unknown. The risk of developing tardive dyskinesia and the likelihood that it will become irreversible are believed to increase as the duration of treatment and the total cumulative dose of antipsychotic drugs administered to the patient increases. However, the syndrome can develop, although much less commonly, after relatively brief treatment periods at low doses. There is no known treatment for established cases of tardive dyskinesia, although the syndrome may remit, partially or completely, if antipsychotic treatment is withdrawn. Given these considerations, ziprasidone should be prescribed in a manner that is most likely to minimize the occurrence of tardive dyskinesia. Chronic antipsychotic treatment should generally be reserved for patients who suffer from a chronic illness that (1) is known to respond to antipsychotic drugs, and (2) for whom alternative, equally effective, but potentially less  PA Criteria Proposal l 4  2002 Heritage Information Systems, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   harmful treatments are not available or appropriate. In patients who do not require chronic treatment, the smallest dose and the shortest duration of treatment producing a satisfactory clinical response should be sought. The need for continued treatment should be reassessed periodically. If signs and symptoms of tardive dyskinesia appear in a patient on ziprasidone, drug discontinuation should be considered. However, some patients may require treatment with ziprasidone despite the presence of the syndrome.  Precautions  3,4  General Rash  In premarketing trials with ziprasidone, about 5% of patients developed rash and/or urticaria with discontinuation of treatment in about one-sixth of these cases. The occurrence of rash was related to the dose of ziprasidone, although the finding might also be explained by the longer exposure time in the higher dose patients. Most patients improved promptly with adjunctive treatment with antihistamines or steroids and/or upon discontinuation of ziprasidone, and all patients experiencing these events were reported to completely recover. Orthostatic Hypotension  Ziprasidone may induce orthostatic hypotension associated with dizziness, tachycardia, and, in some patients, syncope, especially during the dose-titration period. Seizures  During clinical trials, seizures occurred in 0.4% of patients treated with ziprasidone, although there were confounding factors that may have contributed to the occurrence of seizures. Ziprasidone should be used cautiously in patients with a history of seizures or with conditions that potentially lower the seizure threshold, especially in the population of 65 years and older. Hyperprolactinemia  Ziprasidone elevates prolactin levels in humans, as do other drugs that antagonize dopamine D2 receptors. Increased prolactin levels were also observed in animal studies with this compound. Although disturbances such as galactorrhea, amenorrhea, gynecomastia, and impotence have been reported with prolactin-elevating compounds, the clinical significance of elevated serum prolactin levels is unknown for most patients. Potential for Cognitive or Motor Impairment  Somnolence was a commonly reported adverse event in patients treated with ziprasidone. Since ziprasidone has the potential to impair judgment, thinking, or motor skills, patients should be cautioned about performing activities requiring mental alertness, such as operating a motor vehicle or operating hazardous machinery until they are reasonably certain that ziprasidone therapy does not affect them adversely. Priapism  One case of priapism was reported in the premarketing database. While the relationship of the event to ziprasidone use has not been established, other drugs with similar effects have been reported to induce priapism, and it is possible that ziprasidone may share this capacity. Body Temperature Regulation - Although not reported with ziprasidone, disruption of the body's ability to reduce core body temperature has been attributed to antipsychotic agents.  PA Criteria Proposal l 5  2002 Heritage Information Systems, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   Appropriate care is advised when prescribing ziprasidone for patients who will be experiencing conditions that may contribute to elevation in core body temperature. Use in Patients with Concomitant Illness  Clinical experience with ziprasidone with certain concomitant systemic illnesses is limited.  Adverse Effects  3,4  The most commonly observed adverse events associated with intramuscular ziprasidone (incidence 5% or greater) and observed at a rate on intramuscular ziprasidone (in higher dose groups) at least twice that of the lowest intramuscular ziprasidone group were:  Headache (13%)  Nausea (12%)  Somnolence (20%)  Drug Interactions  3,4  All interaction studies have been conducted with oral ziprasidone Pharmacodynamic interactions (combined pharmacological effects): (1) Ziprasidone should not be used with any drug that prolongs the QT interval (2) Given the primary CNS effects, caution should be used when it is taken in combination with other centrally acting drugs. (3) Because of its potential for inducing hypotension, ziprasidone may enhance the effects of certain antihypertensive agents. (4) Ziprasidone may antagonize the effects of levodopa and dopamine agonists. Pharmacokinetic interactions (alteration of plasma levels): Drug/Drug Class The Effect of Other Drugs on Ziprasidone Carbamazepine  Outcome  Ketoconazole  Cimetidine Antacid Benztropine Propranolol Lorazepam Lithium  Carbamazepine is an inducer of CYP3A4; administration of 200mg BID for 21 days resulted in a decrease of approximately 35% in the AUC of ziprasidone. This effect may be greater when higher doses of carbamazepine are administered. Ketoconazole, a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4, at a dose of 400mg for 5 days, increased the AUC and Cmax of ziprasidone by about 25-40%. Other inhibitors of CYP3A4 would be expected to have similar effects Cimetidine at a dose of 800mg QD for 2 days did not affect ziprasidone pharmacokinetics. The co administration of 30mL of Maalox with ziprasidone did not affect the pharmacokinetics of ziprasidone. Population pharmacokinetic analysis of schizophrenic patients enrolled in controlled clinical trials has not revealed evidence of an clinically significant pharmacokinetic interactions with the either of these agents. Ziprasidone at a dose of 40mg BID administered concomitantly with lithium at a dose of 450mg BID for 7 days did not affect the steady-state level or renal clearance of lithium.  The Effect of Ziprasidone on Other Drugs  PA Criteria Proposal l 6  2002 Heritage Information Systems, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   Oral Contraceptives  Dextromethorphan  Ziprasidone at a dose of 20mg BID did not affect the pharmacokinetics of concomitantly administered oral contraceptives, ethinyl estradiol (0.03mg) and levonorgestrel (0.15mg) Consistent with in vitro results, a study in normal healthy volunteers showed that ziprasidone did not alter the metabolism of dextromethorphan, a CYP2D6 model substrate, to its major metabolite, dextrophan. There was no statistically significant change in the urinary dextromethorphan/dextrophan ratio.  In vitro studies revealed little potential for ziprasidone to interfere with the metabolism of drugs cleared primarily by CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4, and little potential for drug interactions with ziprasidone due to displacement. Interactions with Laboratory Tests  Patients being considered for ziprasidone treatment that are at risk of significant electrolyte disturbances should have baseline serum potassium and magnesium measurements. Low potassium and magnesium should be repleted before proceeding with treatment.  Patients who are started on diuretics during ziprasidone therapy need periodic monitoring of serum potassium and magnesium.  Ziprasidone should be discontinued in patients who are found to have persistent QTc measurements >500msec.  Dosage and Administration Intramuscular Administration  3,4  The recommended dose is 10 to 20mg administered as required up to a maximum dose of 40mg per day. Doses of 10mg may be administered every two hours; doses of 20mg may be administered every four hours up to a maximum of 40mg/day. Intramuscular administration of ziprasidone for more than three consecutive days has not been studied. If long-term therapy is indicated, oral ziprasidone hydrochloride capsules should replace the intramuscular administration as soon as possible. Since there is no experience regarding the safety of administering ziprasidone intramuscular to schizophrenic patients already taking oral ziprasidone, the practice of co-administration is not recommended. Preparation for Administration Geodon for injection (ziprasidone mesylate) should only be administered by intramuscular injection. Single-dose vials require reconstitution prior to administration; any unused portion should be discarded. Add 1.2mL of Sterile W ater for Injection to the vial and shake vigorously until all the drug is dissolved. Each mL of reconstituted solution contains 20mg ziprasidone. Since no preservative or bacteriostatic agent is present in this product, aseptic technique must be  PA Criteria Proposal l 7  2002 Heritage Information Systems, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   used in preparation of the final solution. This medicinal product must not be mixed with other medicinal products or solvents other than Sterile Water for Injection. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Dosing in Special Populations Intramuscular: Ziprasidone intramuscular has not been systematically evaluated in elderly patients or in patients with hepatic or renal impairment. As the cyclodextrin excipient is cleared by renal filtration, ziprasidone intramuscular should be administered with caution to patients with impaired renal function. Dosing adjustments are not required on the basis of gender or race.

It does have a few characteristics that seem to differentiate it from the other agents in its class, such as a low risk of weight gain and a high incidence of QT prolongation on electrocardiogram. However, since one of the limitations of the atypical antipsychotic class was no available parenteral formulation, acutely agitated patients with schizophrenia were given older, typical antipsychotics, such as haloperidol (Haldol). The older antipsychotic agents were effective in these situations, but would frequently cause unpleasant side effects such as dystonias, sedation, and extrapyramidal side effects (EPS). Since June of 2002, Geodon for injection has been indicated for use in patients with acute exacerbations of schizophrenia - assisting in rapidly controlling the agitated behavior and psychotic symptoms, such as hallucinations and delusions, in these patients. The maximum daily dose of Geodon for injection is 40mg per day. The safety of the intramuscular dosing has not been shown beyond three days. Therefore, in order to maintain control, the patient should be switched to oral Geodon.  Recommendation(s) It is recommended that Geodon for Injection (20mg/mL) remain on the prior authorization approval status list  classified as `Clinical Edit' status.

In an initial proposed rule published in the Federal Register on June 4, 1997, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA or Agency) proposed to amend its regulations to require a warning label on dietary supplements containing ephedrine alkaloids and mau huang (collectively referred to as ephedra in these comments).  On April 3, 2000, the Agency withdrew the proposed requirements and restrictions.  The Agency now has reopened the comment period, and has requested comments on: (1) A proposed warning label for ephedra-containing products; (2) Whether, in light of more recent evidence, FDA should determine that dietary supplement products present a significant or unreasonable risk of illness or injury; and (3) What additional legislative authorities, if any, would be necessary or appropriate to enable FDA to address this issue more effectively?    Summary of Consumers Union Position   Ephedra's known risks include hypertension, heart attack, irregular heartbeat, stroke, and seizures.  In an article published in Consumer Reports in 1995, Consumers Union was among the first to warn the public about the risks associated with the use of ephedra.  In addition, Consumers Union and ConsumerReports.org repeatedly have called on the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) and the FDA to ban the use of ephedra in dietary supplements.  We believe that the FDA's proposed warning label is an inadequate response to this serious public health hazard and fails to protect consumers from those risks. We believe that based upon information available to Consumers Union, and to the Agency, it is clear that dietary supplements containing ephedra do indeed pose an unreasonable risk of illness or injury and that the Secretary of DHHS Secretary Tommy Thompson should commence with the process to ban ephedra immediately under the powers he currently holds under the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994     Secretary Thompson Should Immediately Ban Ephedra   Since 1993, the FDA has received 117 reports of deaths among ephedra users, as well as 16,000 reports of other problems such as strokes, seizures, heatstroke, heart disorders, and psychotic episodes.   As stated in a letter from Consumers Unions President James Guest to Secretary Thompson, dated November 15, 2002, we urge Secretary Thompson to declare dietary supplements containing ephedrine alkaloids and mau huang adulterated under Section 402 of the Federal Food Drug and Cosmetic Act (The Act), 21 U.S.C.  342(f)(1)(A)(i) because they [present] a significant or unreasonable risk of illness or injury and 342(f)(1)(C underconditions of use recommended or suggested in labeling. In addition, we urged the Secretary to initiate proceedings to ban the production and sale of dietary supplements containing ephedra under Section 402 of the Act, 21 U.S.C. 342(f)(1)(C), because they pose an imminent hazard to public health or safety.  In the time interval since Consumers Union sent the above letter, the Agency has failed to act, and more consumers have suffered  and possibly have died from use of ephedra-containing  products.  The February 17, 2003 death of Baltimore Orioles pitcher Steve Bechler focused additional attention on ephedra.  As is well known,  Bechler, 23, died of heatstroke after a spring-training practice session.  Several news reports after his death revealed that ephedra supplements were found in his locker.  On March 13, 2002, the Associated Press reported that Broward County, Florida, medical examiner Dr. Joshua Perper stated that toxicology tests disclosed significant amounts of ephedra in his body tissues. The presence of that substance probably contributed to the victims heatstroke and eventual demise.     Recent Evidence from Studies on Ephedra  Alarming evidence about the harmful effects of ephedra have been mounting for years.  We believe there is ample evidence that ephedra poses an unacceptable risk to consumers and provides minimal benefits.  Below is a summary of recent reports and studies illustrating the grave, life-threatening, and sometimes fatal, dangers posed by dietary supplements containing ephedra.    1 Annals of Internal Medicine    A report in the February 2003 Annals of Internal Medicine revealed additional evidence of ephedra-related harms. The study showed that products containing ephedra accounted for 64% of all adverse reactions to herbal products reported to the American Association of Poison Control Centers in 2001.  The researchers calculated that the relative risk for an adverse reaction to ephedra compared with other herbs in the database was 100-fold or more.     2. Journal of the American Medical Association - RAND Report  An article based upon an evaluation of scientific reports conducted by the authors and the Southern California Evidence-Based Practice Center -- RAND, and commissioned by DHHS and NIH, appeared in the March 26, 2003 issue of The Journal of the American Medical Association.  This report links the use of ephedra with risks of heart, psychiatric, and gastrointestinal problems, while finding insufficient evidence to support its use to enhance athletic performance, or to promote long-term weight loss.   The researchers stated:  We found sufficient evidence to conclude that ephedrine and ephedra are associated with 2 to 3 times the risk of psychiatric symptoms, autonomic symptoms, upper gastroenterological symptoms and heart palpitations.         3. The American Association of Poison Control Centers  The American Association of Poison Control Centers (AAPCC) has reported a steadily increasing number of serious adverse events related to supplements containing ephedra over the last five years.  Data released in 2002 by the AAPCC indicates that in the year 2001 alone there were 812 reported events relating to the use of dietary supplements containing ephedra as a sole ingredient, including 3 deaths, 103 adverse reactions, 10 major effects (defined as exhibiting signs or symptoms that were life-threatening or resulted in significant residual disability) and 139 moderate effects (defined as exhibiting symptoms or signs that were more pronounced, more prolonged or more systemic in nature than minor symptoms -- and where usually some form of treatment is indicated).  Of the 812 exposures, 440 persons (54%) were treated in a health care facility.  Forty-eight percent (48%) of reported exposures occurred in individuals over 19 years of age.  In addition to the above reports there were 7,115 reported events linked to the use of multi-botanical supplements containing ephedra as an ingredient, including three deaths, 1,075 adverse reactions, 87 major effects and 1,325 moderate effects.  Of the 7,115 exposures, 3,849 persons (54%) were treated in a health care facility.  Forty-three percent (43%) of reported exposures occurred in individuals over 19 years of age.   4. Other Studies    Two recent independent studies reported in peer-reviewed journals, scrutinized adverse events reports filed with the FDA between 1995 and 1999.  In the reports, researchers found dozens of cases of abnormal heartbeats, strokes and heart attacks that were likely related to ephedra use.   Samenuk and others at the New England Medical Center in Boston analyzed almost 1,000 cases of possible ephedra toxicity submitted to the FDA.  The researchers reported in the January 2002 issue of Mayo Clinic Proceedings that adverse events were clearly related to immediate prior use of the ephedra-containing products in 37 people, and that 36 of these 37 victims had taken the dietary supplement products according to the manufacturers directions.  Sixteen suffered a stroke; 10 had a heart attack; and 11 died.  The study concluded that ma Huang use is temporally related to stroke, myocardial infarction, and sudden death; (2) underlying heart or vascular disease is not a prerequisite for ma Huangrelated adverse events; and (3) the cardio-vascular toxic effects associated with ma Huang were not limited to massive doses.     In the December 21, 2000 issue of The New England Journal of Medicine, Haller and Benowitz from the University of California in San Francisco analyzed 140 cases of alleged ephedra toxicity that were reported to the FDA from 1997 to 1999.  Abnormal heart rhythms, increases in blood pressure, stroke, sudden death, and heart attack led the list.  Of those reactions, 62% were thought to be definitely or probably or possibly due to ephedra.  Eight of the 10 deaths were attributed to ephedra, including that of a 15-year-old girl.      Additional Legislative Authority  DSHEA allowed dietary supplements to receive reduced scrutiny under the Federal Food Drug and Cosmetic Act.   As the growing number of adverse event reports for ephedra alone illustrates, current law is inadequate to protect consumers from the risks of dietary supplements -- known and unknown.  Although dietary supplement manufacturers are prohibited from making specific disease-cure claims for products, the ability to make a truthful structure-function claim depends upon the biological effects any botanical may have. As such, all dietary supplements making health claims may have potential inherent risks, and therefore should be reviewed for safety prior to marketing.  Efficacy is a separate problem and therefore has to be preceded by the establishment of adequate standards.  Below is a summary of some of the most important legislative changes we believe are necessary protect consumers from harm relating to the use of dietary supplements:  (1) Adverse event reporting by manufacturers of dietary supplement products should be made mandatory.  Under the current system, adverse event reporting is voluntary and creates a conflict of interest on the part of the manufacturer who might be inclined to overlook seemingly marginal risk reporting or simply fail to report adverse effects at all.   Since it is well known that only a small fraction of adverse events are ever reported to any authority, the ever-growing number of ephedra-related events take on even more significance.     (2) FDA must be granted meaningful authority to immediately halt sales of dietary supplement products posing any health risks to consumers.  Since dietary supplement manufacturers are not required to prove efficacy, and claims of benefit are often exaggerated or dubious, any risk of harm to a user should make a given product unacceptable and result in its withdrawal from the market.  The FDA should not have the burden of proving that a supplement is unsafe. Such proof is difficult to achieve since adverse event reporting is always anecdotal. In the case of ephedra that anecdotal evidence is overwhelming.    (3) Ephedra is a natural substance with recognized physiological effects. It belongs to a class of compounds known as pressor amines, all of which cause vasoconstriction and central nervous system stimulation in varying degrees. Tachycardia and euphoria are common effects. When millions of people are exposed to ephedra it should be expected that complications of those side effects (hypertensive episodes, arrhythmias, heart attacks, seizures, and strokes) will occur.  In fact, they can be anticipated. It is therefore within the current power of the FDA to declare ephedra a drug and make it subject to all the regulations pertaining thereto.     Consumers Union requests that Secretary Thompson ban ephedra-containing dietary supplement products under the authority granted by DSHEA.  In addition, we request that the FDA seek any and all additional legislative authority necessary to protect consumers from serious risks associated with dietary supplements, including FDA pre-market review, regulation of suspect dietary supplements as drugs, and mandatory adverse event reporting for all dietary supplements.

In preparation for that meeting, the panel was provided with a draft copy of the RAND report, as well as new publications since the preparation of the report.  The panel was charged to identify avenues of potential research to expand knowledge of the risks and benefits of ephedra.  In that context, the panel addressed four main areas:  the current status of evidence regarding the safety of ephedra; the current status of evidence regarding the efficacy of ephedra for weight loss; the current status of evidence regarding the efficacy of ephedra for enhanced athletic performance; and the optimal study design(s) for addressing identified gaps in knowledge regarding both safety and efficacy.       With regard to the current status of the evidence regarding the safety of ephedra, the panelists concluded that:        It was clear from the RAND report that the data on safety of ephedra are currently inconclusive.  The available data afford no basis for estimating the balance of risks and benefits of ephedra.  Given the evidence currently available, however, there is no justification for the presumption of safety of ephedra.  It cannot be demonstrated that ephedra is safe, nor can it be demonstrated that ephedra is not safe.      However, while the available data may be inadequate to definitively evaluate the question of safety, they are more than adequate to clearly send a signal of concern, which must be evaluated.  The data from randomized trials are sufficient to indicate that the use of ephedrine or ephedrine with caffeine is associated with 2-3 times the risk of nausea, vomiting, psychiatric symptoms such as anxiety and change in mood, autonomic hyperactivity, and palpitations.  The trials were not of sufficient size to evaluate even in aggregate the possibility of serious side effects that are rare such as death, myocardial infarction, strokes, seizures and psychiatric symptoms.        Information on these serious but rare events was available only from sporadic adverse event reports.  It is important to note the limitations of these data in that they do not have information on denominators, and cannot demonstrate causality.  Of most concern were the ""sentinel"" events, which were based on documentation that:  1) an adverse event had occurred; 2) the subject had consumed ephedra within 24 hours prior to the event or a toxicological examination showed ephedrine or one of its associated products in the blood or urine; and 3) an adequate investigation had evaluated for and excluded other causes.  A total of 21 sentinel events were identified with prior ephedra consumption:  two deaths, four myocardial infarctions, nine strokes, one seizure, and five psychiatric cases.*  About half of all sentinel events occurred in persons aged 30 years or younger, although this could easily reflect patterns of spontaneous reporting.        To more rigorously evaluate whether consumption of ephedra is causally related to these serious but rare adverse events requires an analytic epidemiologic study design, such as a case-control study.         *The Ephedra Working Group reviewed a draft copy of the RAND report in preparation for the meeting on February 26, 2003.  The final document, released on February 28, 2003, reports a total of 22 sentinel events identified with prior ephedra consumption: two deaths, three myocardial infarctions, nine strokes, three seizures, and five psychiatric cases.          Top      With regard to the current status of the evidence regarding the efficacy of ephedra for weight loss, the panelists concluded that:            Few trials of ephedra have been conducted.  However, taken together, the evidence suggests that short-term use of ephedrine, ephedrine with caffeine, or dietary supplements containing ephedra with or without caffeine, is associated with short-term weight loss of approximately 2 pounds per month, compared to placebo.  However, panelists with extensive experience evaluating other weight loss agents noted that little is known about how ephedra is used by the public, in terms of factors that could potentiate the success of any dietary supplement, such as concurrent dietary changes, exercise, or counseling.  As a result, the reported studies that included these components are likely overestimating the effects of ephedra as it would be used by consumers, and thus many would not achieve this degree of weight loss with ephedra.          No evidence exists as to the dose-response relationship.          No evidence from controlled trials exists as to whether continued use of ephedra would result in long-term (>6 months) weight loss or weight loss maintenance, or influence clinical health outcomes as distinguished from cardiovascular disease risk factors.             Top       With regard to the current status of the evidence regarding the efficacy of ephedra for athletic performance enhancement, the panelists concluded that:           There are no clinical trials of ephedra for athletic performance enhancement.          There are no clinical trials of chronic use, even of ephedrine, for performance enhancement.  Available trials have assessed effects of acute dosing on very short-term immediate performance (1-2 hours after a single dose) among very fit individuals.          There has been limited replication of the findings with regard to ephedrine, with virtually all reported trials having emanated from a single laboratory.          Virtually all trials of ephedrine have been conducted on a small number of very fit young men (athletes, military recruits), limiting generalizability of the findings.          The available data support a modest effect of ephedrine with caffeine on very short-term indicators of athletic performance enhancement, such as time to exhaustion, increase in performance time, and power output.          In reviewing reported cases of ephedra use, no information was provided on factors such as:  patterns of actual use of ephedra by the general population to enhance athletic performance, including concomitant use of medications such as anabolic steroids; effects of different environmental conditions such as humidity and hydration; effects on blood pressure and arrhythmic effects (observed increase seen in exercise heart rates with ephedrine); effects of thermal stress plus exercise stress; and effects of sustained use on performance over time.         Top       With regard to the next steps in terms of research on ephedra, the panel agreed that a portfolio of research options should be recommended.           The Ephedra Working Group made the clear and strong recommendation that the National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM), and Office of Dietary Supplements (ODS) must consider dealing with the safety of ephedra as its first priority.  Given that the young represent a vulnerable population in whom assessing risks are of greatest concern,  the panel recommended that the first step of any research portfolio should be a case-control study conducted among adolescents and young adults using ephedra for performance enhancement.  ""Cases"" in various such studies could include ischemic vascular events, and/or cardiovascular events, and/or heat stroke.  Not only would a case-control study be the optimal study design to evaluate these rare events, but the lack of substantial co-morbidity in this group would make it easier to judge the existence of a cause-effect relationship, as compared with the co-morbidities present in obese women using ephedra for weight loss.  While the rigorous scientific design of such a case-control study would involve careful consideration of a number of epidemiologic issues, it would allow the evaluation of the safety of ephedra use among the young in a cost-efficient and timely manner.           While such a case-control study is ongoing, a number of other research avenues to evaluate safety and efficacy could be pursued, which would take varying lengths of time to complete and would concurrently address many of the current gaps in knowledge concerning ephedra. These include:            The initiation of surveys, or the piggy-backing of questionnaires onto ongoing cohort studies, in order to elucidate the current patterns of use of ephedra, including dose and use of concurrent medications, as well as the characteristics of the users.  This would also allow initiation of prospective follow-up of self-reported users.  Such information would provide critical pieces regarding the numerators of events and denominators of use, information that would inform the design of future studies.            The conduct of basic research investigations, including pharmacokinetic drug interaction assessments (including identification of particular vulnerabilities and interactions with agents such as anabolic steroids or sympathomimetics), and experiments that examine physiologic responses under such conditions as exercise and thermal stress.            The conduct of clinical trials to evaluate the safety and efficacy of ephedra for weight loss among overweight and obese women and men.  The first part of this research would consist of a Phase II study, evaluating adverse effects, weight loss, and physiological responses, as well as optimal dosing.  The next step would consist of a randomized clinical trial of adequate sample size to characterize side effects and evaluate efficacy with regard to moderate or long-term weight loss, weight loss maintenance, and relevant health outcomes.  The panelists emphasized that for any clinical trial testing, the study design would have to control for the quality of the active ingredient in the accurate amount, an effort that would require standardizing the products and determining the right dose to be used for testing.                Top     Comments  The panel emphasized that there was not going to be a quick or inexpensive way to answer the ephedra questions of safety and efficacy definitively; that one study could not provide all the answers; and that it would take a portfolio of research approaches.  While the panel members were clearly cognizant that their charge was not to advise on the regulatory aspects of ephedra, but only to identify potential research opportunities to expand knowledge, they felt the situation with ephedra was directly analogous to that seen in the development of any new drug, while recognizing that it is a complex botanical product.  Finally, deciding how to invest precious NCCAM, ODS, and NIH resources in answering public health questions is always a difficult issue.  While evaluating the safety issues of a product being widely used is an overarching priority, the panelists felt a decision to invest a significant portion of NCCAM's research dollars in establishing the efficacy of ephedra and ephedra-containing products as weight loss tools would involve the weighing of competing research priorities.

GX229-50-11351574	"NATIONAL CENTER FOR COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE National Institutes of Health  Questions and Answers About Homeopathy Homeopathy (""home-ee-AH-pah-thy""), also known as homeopathic medicine, is a form of health care that developed in Germany and has been practiced in the United States since the early 19th century. Homeopathic practitioners are commonly called homeopaths. This fact sheet answers some frequently asked questions on homeopathy and reviews scientific research on its use and effectiveness. Key Points  In homeopathy, a key premise is that every person has energy called a vital force or selfhealing response. When this energy is disrupted or imbalanced, health problems develop. Homeopathy aims to stimulate the body's own healing responses. Homeopathic treatment involves giving extremely small doses of substances that produce characteristic symptoms of illness in healthy people when given in larger doses. This approach is called ""like cures like."" Various explanations have been proposed as to how homeopathy might work. However, none of these explanations has been scientifically verified. Research studies on homeopathy have been contradictory in their findings. Some analyses have concluded that there is no strong evidence supporting homeopathy as effective for any clinical condition. However, others have found positive effects from homeopathy. The positive effects are not readily explained in scientific terms. It is important to inform all of your health care providers about any therapy that you are currently using or considering, including homeopathic treatment. This is to help ensure a safe and coordinated course of care.         1. What is homeopathy? The term homeopathy comes from the Greek words homeo, meaning similar, and pathos, meaning suffering or disease. Homeopathy is an alternative medical system. Alternative medical systems are built upon complete systems of theory and practice, and often have evolved  NCCAM Clearinghouse Pub. No. D183  Page 1   apart from and earlier than the conventional medical approach used in the United States.* Homeopathy takes a different approach from conventional medicine in diagnosing, classifying, and treating medical problems. Key concepts of homeopathy include:   Homeopathy seeks to stimulate the body's defense mechanisms and processes so as to prevent or treat illness. Treatment involves giving very small doses of substances called remedies that, according to homeopathy, would produce the same or similar symptoms of illness in healthy people if they were given in larger doses. Treatment in homeopathy is individualized (tailored to each person). Homeopathic practitioners select remedies according to a total picture of the patient, including not only symptoms but lifestyle, emotional and mental states, and other factors.    2. What is the history of the discovery and use of homeopathy? In the late 1700s, Samuel Hahnemann, a physician, chemist, and linguist in Germany, proposed a new approach to treating illness. This was at a time when the most common medical treatments were harsh, such as bloodletting, purging, blistering, and the use of sulfur and mercury. At the time, there were few effective medications for treating patients, and knowledge about their effects was limited. Hahnemann was interested in developing a less-threatening approach to medicine. The first major step reportedly was when he was translating an herbal text and read about a treatment (cinchona bark) used to cure malaria. He took some cinchona bark and observed that, as a healthy person, he developed symptoms that were very similar to malaria symptoms. This led Hahnemann to consider that a substance may create symptoms that it can also relieve. This concept is called the ""similia principle"" or ""like cures like."" The similia principle had a prior history in medicine, from Hippocrates in Ancient Greece--who noted, for example, that recurrent vomiting could be treated with an emetic (such as ipecacuanha) that would be expected to make it worse--to folk medicine.14,15 Another way to view ""like cures like"" is that symptoms are part of the body's attempt to heal itself--for example, a fever can develop as a result of an immune response to an infection, and a cough may help to eliminate mucus--and medication may be given to support this self-healing response.  Conventional medicine, as defined by NCCAM, is medicine as practiced by holders of M.D. (medical doctor) or D.O. (doctor of osteopathy) degrees and by their allied health professionals, such as physical therapists, psychologists, and registered nurses. Some conventional medical practitioners are also practitioners of complementary and alternative medicine. To find out more about these terms, see the NCCAM fact sheet ""What Is Complementary and Alternative Medicine?""  Items 113 in the references served as general sources for this historical discussion.  Bloodletting was a healing practice used for many centuries. In bloodletting, incisions were made in the body to drain a quantity of blood, in the belief that this would help drain out the ""bad blood"" or sickness. NCCAM Clearinghouse Pub. No. D183 Page 2  *   Hahnemann tested single, pure substances on himself and, in more dilute forms, on healthy volunteers. He kept meticulous records of his experiments and participants' responses, and he combined these observations with information from clinical practice, the known uses of herbs and other medicinal substances, and toxicology, eventually treating the sick and developing homeopathic clinical practice. Hahnemann added two additional elements to homeopathy:  A concept that became ""potentization,"" which holds that systematically diluting a substance, with vigorous shaking at each step of dilution, makes the remedy more, not less, effective by extracting the vital essence of the substance. If dilution continues to a point where the substance's molecules are gone, homeopathy holds that the ""memory"" of them--that is, the effects they exerted on the surrounding water molecules--may still be therapeutic. A concept that treatment should be selected based upon a total picture of an individual and his symptoms, not solely upon symptoms of a disease. Homeopaths evaluate not only a person's physical symptoms but her emotions, mental states, lifestyle, nutrition, and other aspects. In homeopathy, different people with the same symptoms may receive different homeopathic remedies.    Hans Burch Gram, a Boston-born doctor, studied homeopathy in Europe and introduced it into the United States in 1825. European immigrants trained in homeopathy also made the treatment increasingly available in America. In 1835, the first homeopathic medical college was established in Allentown, Pennsylvania. By the turn of the 20th century, 8 percent of all American medical practitioners were homeopaths, and there were 20 homeopathic medical colleges and more than 100 homeopathic hospitals in the United States. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, numerous medical advances were made, such as the recognition of the mechanisms of disease; Pasteur's germ theory; the development of antiseptic techniques; and the discovery of ether anesthesia. In addition, a report (the so-called ""Flexner Report"") was released that triggered major changes in American medical education. Homeopathy was among the disciplines negatively affected by these developments. Most homeopathic medical schools closed down, and by the 1930s others had converted to conventional medical schools. In the 1960s, homeopathy's popularity began to revive in the United States. According to a 1999 survey of Americans and their health, over 6 million Americans had used homeopathy in the preceding 12 months.16 The World Health Organization noted in 1994 that homeopathy had been integrated into the national health care systems of numerous countries, including Germany, the United Kingdom, India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, and Mexico.7 Several schools of practice exist within homeopathy.17 Persons using homeopathy do so to address a range of health concerns, from wellness and prevention to treatment of injuries, diseases, and conditions. Studies have found that many people who seek homeopathic care seek it for help with a chronic medical condition.18,19,20   Toxicology is the science of the effects of chemicals on human health.

What kind of training do homeopathic practitioners receive? In European countries, training in homeopathy is usually pursued either as a primary professional degree completed over 3 to 6 years or as postgraduate training for doctors.14 In the United States, training in homeopathy is offered through diploma programs, certificate programs, short courses, and correspondence courses. Also, homeopathic training is part of medical education in naturopathy.** Most homeopathy in the United States is practiced along with another health care practice for which the practitioner is licensed, such as conventional medicine, naturopathy, chiropractic, dentistry, acupuncture, or veterinary medicine (homeopathy is used to treat animals). Laws about what is required to practice homeopathy vary among states. Three states (Connecticut, Arizona, and Nevada) license medical doctors specifically for homeopathy. 4. What do homeopathic practitioners do in treating patients? Typically, in homeopathy, patients have a lengthy first visit, during which the provider takes an in-depth assessment of the patient. This is used to guide the selection of one or more homeopathic remedies. During followup visits, patients report how they are responding to the remedy or remedies, which helps the practitioner make decisions about further treatment. 5. What are homeopathic remedies? Most homeopathic remedies are derived from natural substances that come from plants, minerals, or animals. A remedy is prepared by diluting the substance in a series of steps (as discussed in Question 2). Homeopathy asserts that this process can maintain a substance's healing properties regardless of how many times it has been diluted. Many homeopathic remedies are so highly diluted that not one molecule of the original natural substance remains.12,21 Remedies are sold in liquid, pellet, and tablet forms. 6. How does the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulate homeopathic remedies? Because of their long use in the United States, the U.S. Congress passed a law in 1938 declaring that homeopathic remedies are to be regulated by the FDA in the same manner as nonprescription, over-the-counter (OTC) drugs, which means that they can be purchased without a physician's prescription. Today, although conventional prescription drugs and new OTC drugs must undergo thorough testing and review by the FDA for safety and effectiveness before they can be sold, this requirement does not apply to homeopathic remedies. **  Naturopathy, also known as naturopathic medicine, is an alternative medical system that emphasizes natural healing approaches (such as herbs, nutrition, and movement or manipulation of the body). Some elements of naturopathy are similar to homeopathy, such as an intent to support the body's own self-healing response. Page 4  NCCAM Clearinghouse Pub. No. D183   Remedies are required to meet certain legal standards for strength, quality, purity, and packaging. In 1988, the FDA required that all homeopathic remedies list the indications for their use (i.e., the medical problems to be treated) on the label.22,23 The FDA also requires the label to list ingredients, dilutions, and instructions for safe use. The guidelines for homeopathic remedies are found in an official guide, the Homeopathic Pharmacopoeia of the United States, which is authored by a nongovernmental, nonprofit organization of industry representatives and homeopathic experts.24 The Pharmacopoeia also includes provisions for testing new remedies and verifying their clinical effectiveness. Remedies on the market before 1962 have been accepted into the Homeopathic Pharmacopoeia of the United States based on historical use, rather than scientific evidence from clinical trials. 7. Have any side effects or complications been reported from the use of homeopathy? The FDA has learned of a few reports of illness associated with the use of homeopathic remedies. However, the FDA reviewed these reports and decided that the remedies were not likely to be the cause, because of the high dilutions.3 Here is some general information that has been reported about risks and side effects in homeopathy:   Homeopathic medicines in high dilutions, taken under the supervision of trained professionals, are considered safe and unlikely to cause severe adverse reactions.25 Some patients report feeling worse for a brief period of time after starting homeopathic remedies. Homeopaths interpret this as the body temporarily stimulating symptoms while it makes an effort to restore health. Liquid homeopathic remedies can contain alcohol and are permitted to have higher levels of alcohol than conventional drugs for adults. This may be of concern to some consumers. However, no adverse effects from the alcohol levels have been reported either to the FDA or in the scientific literature.3 Homeopathic remedies are not known to interfere with conventional drugs; however, if you are considering using homeopathic remedies, you should discuss this with your health care provider. If you have more than one provider, discuss it with each one.      As with all medicinal products, a person taking a homeopathic remedy is best advised to:    Contact his health care provider if his symptoms continue unimproved for more than 5 days. Keep the remedy out of the reach of children. Consult a health care provider before using the product if the user is a woman who is pregnant or nursing a baby.  NCCAM Clearinghouse Pub.

This section summarizes results from (1) individual clinical trials (research studies in people) and (2) broad analyses of groups of clinical trials. The results of individual, controlled clinical trials of homeopathy have been contradictory. In some trials, homeopathy appeared to be no more helpful than a placebo; in other studies, some benefits were seen that the researchers believed were greater than one would expect from a placebo. Appendix I details findings from clinical trials. Systematic reviews and meta-analyses take a broader look at collections of a set of results from clinical trials. Recent examples of these types of analyses are detailed in Appendix II. In sum, systematic reviews have not found homeopathy to be a definitively proven treatment for any medical condition. Two groups of authors listed in Appendix II found some positive evidence in the groups of studies they examined, and they did not find this evidence to be explainable completely as placebo effects (a third group found 1 out of 16 trials to have some added effect relative to placebo). Each author or group of authors criticized the quality of evidence in the studies. Examples of problems they noted include weaknesses in design and/or reporting, choice of measuring techniques, small numbers of participants, and difficulties in replicating results. A common theme in the reviews of homeopathy trials is that because of these problems and others, it is difficult or impossible to draw firm conclusions about whether homeopathy is effective for any single clinical condition. 9. Are there scientific controversies associated with homeopathy? Yes. Homeopathy is an area of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) that has seen high levels of controversy and debate, largely because a number of its key concepts do not follow the laws of science (particularly chemistry and physics).   It is debated how something that causes illness might also cure it. It has been questioned whether a remedy with a very tiny amount (perhaps not even one molecule) of active ingredient could have a biological effect, beneficial or otherwise. There have been some research studies published on the use of ultra-high dilutions (UHDs) of substances, diluted to levels compatible with those in homeopathy and shaken hard at each step of dilution. The results are claimed to involve phenomena at the molecular level and beyond, such as the structure of water, and waves and fields. Both laboratory  A placebo is designed to resemble as much as possible the treatment being studied in a clinical trial, except that the placebo is inactive. An example of a placebo is a pill containing sugar instead of the drug or other substance being studied. By giving one group of participants a placebo and the other group the active treatment, the researchers can compare how the two groups respond and get a truer picture of the active treatment's effects. In recent years, the definition of placebo has been expanded to include other things that could have an effect on the results of health care, such as how a patient and a health care provider interact, how a patient feels about receiving the care, and what he or she expects to happen from the care.  In a systematic review, data from a set of studies on a particular question or topic are collected, analyzed, and critically reviewed. A meta-analysis uses statistical techniques to analyze results from individual studies.  For some examples, see references 2629. NCCAM Clearinghouse Pub. No. D183 Page 6     research and clinical trials have been published. There have been mixed results in attempts to replicate them. Reviews have not found UHD results to be definitive or compelling.*** There have been some studies that found effects of UHDs on isolated organs, plants, and animals.15 There have been controversy and debate about these findings as well.   Effects in homeopathy might be due to the placebo or other non-specific effect. There are key questions about homeopathy that are yet to be subjected to studies that are well-designed--such as whether it actually works for some of the diseases or medical conditions for which it is used, and if so, how it might work. There is a point of view that homeopathy does work, but that modern scientific methods have not yet explained why. The failure of science to provide full explanations for all treatments is not unique to homeopathy. Some people feel that if homeopathy appears to be helpful and safe, then scientifically valid explanations or proofs of this alternative system of medicine are not necessary.      10. Is NCCAM funding research on homeopathy? Yes. Current National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM)supported research projects are studying:    Homeopathy for physical, mental, and emotional symptoms of fibromyalgia (a chronic disorder involving widespread musculoskeletal pain, multiple tender points on the body, and fatigue). Homeopathy for brain deterioration and damage in animal models for stroke and dementia. The homeopathic remedy cadmium, to find out whether it can prevent damage to the cells of the prostate when those cells are exposed to toxins.

Clinical Trials on Homeopathy Published from 1998 to 2002 Citation Vickers and Smith, 2002 34  Description Seven trials were included in the review (three prevention and four treatment trials); only two studies had sufficient information for complete data extraction. Randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial of 242 participants aged 18 to 55 years.  Findings The homeopathic remedy oscillococcinum appears safe and effective in reducing the duration of influenza, but has no effect on prevention. Trial compared an oral homeopathic treatment to placebo in asthmatic people allergic to house dust. Authors found the homeopathic treatment ""no better than placebo."" They noted ""some differences between the homeopathic immunotherapy and placebo for which we have no explanation."" Traumeel S, a homeopathic skin cream, may significantly reduce the severity and length of pain and inflammation of the tissues lining the inside of the mouth from chemotherapy in children being treated with bone marrow transplantation. Team tested the hypothesis that homeopathy is a placebo by examining effects of an oral homeopathic preparation in patients with perennial allergic rhinitis. They found a ""significant objective improvement in nasal airflow"" compared with the placebo group. However, both groups reported subjective improvement in ""nasal symptoms"" (with no statistically significant difference between groups). Authors concluded that the objective evidence supports that ""homeopathic dilutions differ from placebo."" Individualized homeopathic treatments improved digestive problems in children with acute childhood diarrhea. Results are consistent with findings of a previous study.  Lewith et al., 2002  28  Oberbaum et al., 200135  Randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial in 32 children; 30 completed the study.

Jacobs et al., 200037  Randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial of 126 children; 116 completed the study.  Due to the large number of trials, these studies have been selected to give a representative overview of the findings published in peer-reviewed scientific and medical journals in English and indexed in the National Library of Medicine's MEDLINE database.

For the treatment of hay fever, a homeopathic nasal spray is as efficient and well tolerated as a conventional therapy, cromolyn sodium. A subgroup of patients with HIV in the symptomatic phase, receiving treatment, had increased levels of CD4 cells at the end of the trial; the placebo subgroup did not. Homeopathic remedies, including arnica, are not effective for muscle soreness following long-distance running. The homeopathic treatment vertigoheel, and the standard treatment of betahistine, are equally effective in reducing the frequency, duration, and intensity of vertigo attacks.

Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses of Clinical Trials of Homeopathy Citation Ernst, 2002 33    Description Analyzed 17 systematic reviews (including meta-analyses) of controlled clinical trials for homeopathy.  Findings Author found that the reviews failed to provide strong evidence in favor of homeopathy. No homeopathic remedy was proven by convincing evidence to yield clinical effects that are different from placebo or from other control intervention for any medical condition. Positive recommendations for use of homeopathy in clinical practice are not supported, and ""homeopathy cannot be viewed as an evidence-based form of therapy"" until more convincing results are available. Authors found that the majority of trials had major weaknesses in methodology and/or reporting. Homeopathy trials were ""less frequently randomized...and reported less details on dropouts and withdrawals"" than the other types. Authors found that the ""strength of evidence remains low"" because of trial flaws and other limitations. They added that ""at least one [of the tested homeopathic treatments] shows an added effect relative to placebo."" Group recommended that homeopathy be studied further using the same methods used to study conventional medicine. Rigorous clinical trials indicate arnica is not more effective than a placebo; most trials studied use of arnica for tissue trauma. Authors concluded that their results were not compatible with a hypothesis that the clinical effects of homeopathy are completely due to placebo. However, they found insufficient evidence that homeopathy is clearly efficacious for any single clinical condition. They stated that further research is warranted if it is rigorous and systematic.  Linde et al., 200142  Analyzed the methodological quality of 207 randomized trials collected for 5 previously published reviews on homeopathy, two herbal medicines (St. John's wort and echinacea), and acupuncture. Analyzed 16 randomized, controlled trials (17 comparisons were made) comparing homeopathic treatment to placebo. Work was part of a report prepared for the European Union on the effectiveness of homeopathy. 43  Cucherat et al., 200017  Ernst and Pittler, 1998  Systematic review of eight trials.  Linde et al., 19976  Analyzed 89 trials. Each trial was controlled; compared homeopathy to a placebo; was either randomized or doubleblinded; and yielded a written report.    Systematic reviews and meta-analyses are defined on page 6. Page 13  NCCAM Clearinghouse Pub. No. D183   Kleijnen et al., 1991  21  Assessed 105 controlled trials of homeopathy, 68 randomized.  Authors found a positive trend in the evidence, regardless of the quality of the trial or the method of homeopathy used. They cautioned, however, that definitive conclusions about homeopathy could not be drawn, because many of the trials were not of good quality and the role of publication bias was unknown.  Long and Ernst, 2001  44  Systematic Reviews of Clinical Trials on Single Medical Conditions Systematic review of four osteoarthritis clinical trials. Research on homeopathic treatment for osteoarthritis is insufficient to reliably assess the clinical effectiveness of homeopathic treatment of osteoarthritis. Controlled clinical trials indicate that homeopathic remedies appear to work better than a placebo in studies of rheumatic syndromes, but there are too few studies to draw definitive conclusions, and efficacy results are mixed.

FDA is issuing this final rule  after considering public comments on its proposed regulation, issued as  a tentative final monograph (TFM), and all new data and information on  antiperspirant drug products that have come to the agency's attention.  DATES: Effective Date: This rule is effective December 9, 2004.     Compliance Dates: The compliance date for products with annual  sales less than $25,000 is June 9, 2005. The compliance date for all  other products is December 9, 2004.  FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Gerald M.

Background      In the Federal Register of October 10, 1978 (43 FR 46694), FDA  published an advance notice of proposed rulemaking to establish a  monograph for OTC antiperspirant drug products, together with the  recommendations of the Advisory Review Panel on OTC Antiperspirant Drug  Products (the Panel), which evaluated the data on these products. The  agency's proposed regulation (TFM) for OTC antiperspirant drug products  was published in the Federal Register of August 20, 1982 (47 FR 36492).     In the Federal Register of November 7, 1990 (55 FR 46914), the  agency issued a final rule establishing that certain active ingredients  in OTC drug products are not generally recognized as safe and effective  and are misbranded. These ingredients included seven antiperspirant  ingredients, which are included in Sec.  310.545(a)(4) (21 CFR  310.545(a)(4)). In this rulemaking, the agency is adding one additional  ingredient to this section. (See section III.1 of this document.)     In the Federal Register of March 23, 1993 (58 FR 15452), the agency  requested public comment on two citizen petitions, and a response to  one of the petitions, related to the safety of aluminum compounds in  OTC antiperspirant drug products. This final monograph completes the  TFM and provides the substantive response to the citizen petitions.     Twenty-four months after the date of publication in the Federal  Register, for products with annual sales less than $25,000, and 18  months after the date of publication in the Federal Register, for all  other products, no OTC drug product that is subject to this final rule  and that contains a nonmonograph condition may be initially introduced  or initially delivered for introduction into interstate commerce unless  it is the subject of an approved new drug application (NDA) or  abbreviated new drug application. Further, any OTC drug product subject  to this final monograph that is repackaged or relabeled after the  compliance dates of the final rule must be in compliance with the  monograph regardless of the date the product was initially introduced  or initially delivered for introduction into interstate commerce.  Manufacturers are encouraged to comply voluntarily as soon as possible.     In response to the TFM on OTC antiperspirant drug products and the  request for comment on the citizen petitions, the agency received 20  comments. One manufacturer requested an oral hearing before the  Commissioner of Food and Drugs on six different issues. Copies of the  information considered by the Panel, the comments, and the hearing  request are on public display in the Dockets Management Branch (HFA- 305), Food and Drug Administration, 5630 Fishers Lane, rm. 1061,  Rockville, MD 20852. ``OTC Volumes'' cited in this document refer to  information on public display.     The agency received some ``feedback'' communications under the OTC  drug review procedures (see the Federal Registers of September 29, 1981  (46 FR 47740) and April 1, 1983 (48 FR 14050)). The agency has included  these communications in the administrative record and addressed them in  this document.     The safety issues raised by the citizen petitions are discussed in  section II.F of this document. The agency believes it has adequately  responded to the six issues related to the hearing request; therefore,  a hearing is not necessary.  II. The Agency's Conclusions on the Comments  A. General Comments on OTC Antiperspirant Drug Products      (Comment 1) One comment requested that FDA reconsider its position  that OTC drug monographs are substantive, as opposed to interpretive,  regulations.     The agency addressed this issue and reaffirms its conclusions as  stated in  [[Page 34274]]  paragraphs 85 through 91 of the preamble to the procedures for  classification of OTC drug products (May 11, 1972, 37 FR 9464 at 9471  to 9472) and in paragraph 1 of the preamble to the TFM in the present  proceeding (47 FR 36492 at 36493).     (Comment 2) Three comments disagreed with the agency's proposed  definition of an antiperspirant: ``A drug product that, when applied  topically to the underarm, will reduce the production of perspiration  (sweat) at that site,'' (47 FR 36492 at 36503). One comment contended  it was unduly restrictive and unnecessary to limit use only in the  underarm area because it is not the only area of the body upon which  these products could potentially be applied. The comment asked the  agency to modify the definition to parallel the pharmacologic activity  of the active ingredients and suggested: ``A drug product that, when  applied topically, will reduce the production of perspiration (sweat)  at that site.''     A second comment stated that the definition limiting use to the  underarm only would adversely affect its products labeled for use on  the hands and for use with orthotic and prosthetic appliances (to keep  appliance-skin contact areas dry). Noting that the agency and the Panel  recognized the similarities and differences between axillary and foot  perspiration, a third comment stated that ingredients effective in the  underarm area are probably effective to control foot perspiration.     The agency agrees with the first comment that it is not necessary  to specify the area of use on the body in the definition of an  antiperspirant because that information is included in the product's  labeling. Accordingly, the agency is deleting the phrase ``to the  underarm'' from the definition of an antiperspirant in Sec.  350.3 (21  CFR 350.3) of this final monograph to read: ``Antiperspirant. A drug  product applied topically that reduces the production of perspiration  (sweat) at that site.'' The use of an antiperspirant on other areas of  the body, as mentioned by the second and third comments, is discussed  in section II.A, comment no. 4 and section II.C, comment 14 of this  document.     (Comment 3) One comment stated that the TFM for OTC antiperspirant  drug products was substantively and procedurally defective because it  failed to address adequately the Panel's Category III recommendations  concerning ``enhanced duration of effect'' and ``problem perspiration''  and failed to state what testing was required to substantiate these  claims. The comment requested that FDA issue a new or amended TFM to  address these issues.     The agency has determined that there is no need to withdraw, amend,  or initiate a new TFM. Since the Panel's report was published in 1978,  the procedural regulations for the OTC drug review were revised to  comply with the Court ruling in Cutler v. Kennedy, 475 F. Supp. 838  (D.D.C. 1979). The revised regulations (46 FR 47730, September 29,  1981) provide that TFMs and final monographs will no longer contain  recommended testing guidelines. The agency is not required by statute  or regulation to include testing guidelines as part of OTC panel  reports or TFMs. The agency stated in proposed Sec.  350.60 of the TFM  (47 FR 36492 at 36504) and states in Sec.  350.60 of this final  monograph (21 CFR 350.60) that ``To assure the effectiveness of an  antiperspirant, the Food and Drug Administration is providing  guidelines that manufacturers may (emphasis added) use in testing for  effectiveness.''     The ``enhanced duration of effect'' and the ``problem  perspiration'' issues are discussed in section II.C, comments 10 and 12  of this document. Extended duration of effect claims have been placed  in Category I based on data submitted by other comments (see also  comment 12). The agency has determined that claims for problem  perspiration are outside the scope of this monograph because no data  were submitted to support such claims (see also comment 10).     (Comment 4) One comment contended that the proposed monograph would  have a disastrous economic effect on its company, which markets an  antiperspirant product first formulated in 1902 and labeled for  excessive perspiration, including keeping the hands free of  perspiration (labeled for use on the hands for tennis, racquetball,  bowling, football, and other sporting uses), and marketed for  prosthesis and orthotic use (for amputees to keep their appliance  contact areas dry).     To qualify for exemption from the ``new drug'' definition under the  1938 grandfather clause of the act, the drug product must have been  subject to the Food and Drug Act of 1906, prior to June 25, 1938, and  at such time its labeling must have contained the same representations  concerning the conditions of its use (21 U.S.C. 321(p)(1)). Under the  1962 grandfather clause of the act, a drug product which on October 9,  1962 was: (1) Commercially used or sold in the United States; (2) not a  ``new drug'' as defined in the 1938 act; and (3) not covered by an  effective NDA under the 1938 act, would not be subject to the added  requirement of effectiveness ``when intended solely for use under  conditions prescribed, recommended, or suggested in labeling with  respect to such drug on that day.'' (Public Law 87-781, section  107(c)(4), 76 Stat. 788, note following 21 U.S.C. 321).     The person seeking to show that a drug comes within a grandfather  exemption must prove every essential fact necessary for invocation of  the exemption. See United States v. An Article of Drug * * * ``Bentex  Ulcerine,'' 469 F.2d 875, 878 (5th Cir. 1972), cert. denied, 412 U.S.  938 (1973). Furthermore, the grandfather clause will be strictly  construed against one who invokes it. See id.; United States v. Allan  Drug Corp., 357 F.2d 713, 718 (10th Cir.), cert. denied, 385 U.S. 899  (1966). A change in composition or labeling precludes the applicability  of the grandfather exemption. See USV Pharmaceutical Corp. v.  Weinberger, 412 U.S. 655, 663 (1973).     Although the comment stated that its drug products have been  marketed since 1902 with hand perspiration labeling claims, no evidence  was submitted to show that the labeling and composition of the products  have remained unchanged since either 1938 or 1962, so that they qualify  as grandfathered products. The agency requested product labeling from  these years on several occasions (Refs. 1, 2, and 3), but none was ever  provided. Without such evidence, the products do not qualify for either  grandfather exemption. The burden of proof with respect to the  grandfather exemption is not on FDA, but on the person seeking the  exemption. See An Article of Drug * * * ``Bentex Ulcerine,'' supra.     The 1938 and 1962 grandfather clauses apply only to the new drug  provisions of the act (see 21 CFR 314.200(e)) and not to the  adulteration and misbranding provisions. The OTC drug review was  designed to implement both the misbranding and the new drug provisions  of the act. (See Sec.  330.10 (21 CFR 330.10), 37 FR 9464 at 9466.) The  grandfather clauses do not preclude the agency from reviewing any  currently marketed OTC drug product, regardless of whether it has  grandfather protection from the new drug provisions, in order to ensure  that it is not misbranded.     Although the comment claimed this final rule would have a  disastrous economic effect on its company if antiperspirants can be  labeled only for underarm use, it provided no documentation about this  impact. The agency notes that while the company's products would need  to be relabeled to bear different indications, as long as the monograph  conditions are met, the  [[Page 34275]]  products could remain in the marketplace after relabeling occurred. The  economic impact of this final rule is discussed in section VI of this  document.  B. General Comments on Labeling of OTC Antiperspirant Drug Products      (Comment 5) Several comments contended that FDA should not  incorporate the ``exclusivity policy'' in the final monograph by  prescribing specific labeling terminology to the exclusion of other  truthful nonmisleading language.     After these comments were submitted, in the Federal Registers of  May 1, 1986 (51 FR 16258) and March 17, 1999 (64 FR 13254), the agency  published final rules changing its labeling policy for stating the  indications for use of OTC drug products. Under Sec.  330.1(c)(2) (21  CFR 330.1(c)(2)), the agency provides options for labeling OTC drug  products. The final monograph in this document is subject to the  labeling provisions in Sec.  330.1(c)(2). In addition, the monograph  labeling follows the format and content requirements of Sec.  201.66  (21 CFR 201.66).     (Comment 6) One comment objected to limiting the terms proposed in  Sec.  350.50(b)(1), (b)(2), and (b)(3) to ``reduces,'' ``decreases,''  ``diminishes,'' and ``lessens.'' The comment stated that ``lower'' and  ``mitigate'' are synonyms for ``reduce'' and other words and phrases  state, truthfully and accurately, the effect of antiperspirants.     Several comments disagreed with the agency that words such as  ``stop,'' ``check,'' ``halt,'' ``end,'' ``eliminate,'' and ``protect''  should not be used in the labeling of antiperspirant drug products,  even if preceded by the word ``helps,'' because these words imply the  ability to stop underarm perspiration totally and would therefore  mislead the consumer about the effectiveness of antiperspirant drug  products. The comments mentioned the minority Panel position that ``The  Panel did not see scientific data to indicate that a consumer can  differentiate between such words as `halts,' `checks,' `stops,' and  `ends,' as disallowable words versus `diminishes' and `reduces' as  allowable words,'' (43 FR 46694 at 46725). One comment agreed with the  minority because a review of the entire record of this proceeding found  no studies or data to support a decision to disallow ``protects,''  ``halts,'' ``checks,'' and ``stops.'' Another comment requested a  hearing on this issue.     One comment disagreed with the Panel's Category II status for the  following labeling claims (43 FR 46694 at 46724): ``Dry,'' ``dry  formula,'' ``super dry,'' ``helps stop wetness,'' ``completely guards  your family,'' ``helps stop embarrassing perspiration wetness,''  ``complete protection,'' ``really helps keep you dry,'' and ``gentle  enough for sensitive areas of the body.'' The comment asked the agency  to allow these claims in the final monograph.     The agency has re-evaluated these claims in light of the comments'  arguments and its current policy to provide consumer friendly OTC drug  product labeling. The agency is deleting one previously proposed word  (``diminishes'') and adding some more consumer-friendly words  (``sweat'' and ``sweating'') to antiperspirant product labeling.     The agency proposed the word ``diminishes'' in Sec.  350.50(b) as  one of the optional terms that could be used as the first word of the  indications statement. While the word ``diminish'' means to ``reduce,''  the agency does not consider it as consumer-friendly as the other  optional words ``reduces,'' ``decreases,'' or ``lessens.'' Therefore,  the agency is not including ``diminishes'' in Sec.  350.50(b) of this  final monograph as an FDA-approved term. The agency rejected the words  ``mitigate'' and ``lower'' in the TFM (comment 14, 47 FR 36492 at 36496  to 36497). The agency's position has not changed. While the terms  ``mitigate,'' ``lower,'' and ``diminishes'' are not in the monograph  and the agency does not favor their use, manufacturers may use these  terms, or other words or phrases that truthfully and accurately express  a similar meaning, under the flexible labeling policy in Sec.   330.1(c)(2).     The agency is not changing its position on the use of the word  ``helps'' in conjunction with the words ``stop,'' ``halt,'' ``check,''  ``end,'' and ``eliminate.'' In the TFM (comment 14), the agency stated  that these words imply the ability to stop underarm perspiration  totally and would therefore mislead consumers about antiperspirant  effectiveness. Although neither the Panel nor the agency had any  consumer comprehension studies to support a decision to disallow this  information, the comments also did not provide any data to support  these terms. The agency would consider these terms if data are provided  to show that consumers would not be misled about the effect of  antiperspirant drug products. The agency is not including ``helps  protect'' before ``underarm dampness,'' ``underarm perspiration,'' or  ``underarm wetness,'' because the language is not clear and could  confuse consumers.     The agency is not including any ``dry'' or similar claims (``dry,''  ``dry formula,'' ``super dry,'' ``really helps keep you dry'') in this  final monograph because no criteria have been established to define  ``dry.'' Thus, what may be ``dry'' for one manufacturer's product may  not be ``dry'' for another manufacturer's product. The agency would  consider including ``dry'' claims in the monograph if appropriate  criteria for such claims are developed.     The agency is not including claims such as ``complete protection''  or ``completely guards your family'' in the monograph because there is  no evidence that antiperspirant drug products provide ``complete''  protection. The agency is not including the claim ``gentle enough for  sensitive areas of the body'' because the words ``sensitive areas'' may  imply that the product can be used on other body areas in addition to  the underarm. The agency is not including the claim ``helps stop  embarrassing perspiration wetness'' because what is ``embarrassing'' or  ``problem'' perspiration for one individual may not be ``embarrassing''  or a ``problem'' for others. (See section II.C, comment 10 of this  document.)     The agency is not including both ``perspiration'' and ``wetness''  in the same claim because it considers the duplicative wording  unnecessary. The currently allowed claims are ``* * * underarm  wetness'' or ``* * * underarm perspiration.'' The agency would have no  objection to ``* * * underarm perspiration wetness,'' but such would  have to be done under the flexible labeling provisions of Sec.   330.1(c)(2). The agency is adding the words ``sweat'' and ``sweating''  in Sec.  350.50(b) as other ways to describe ``wetness'' and  ``perspiration,'' because consumers regularly use these terms to  describe perspiration. Based on the previous discussion, the agency  concludes that a hearing is not warranted on these issues.     (Comment 7) Three comments requested that OTC antiperspirant drug  products be exempted from the keep out of reach of children and  accidental ingestion warnings in Sec.  330.1(g) because these products  are not toxic by oral ingestion. One comment noted only one reported  ingestion in 30 years of marketing antiperspirant products. Another  comment stated that aerosols, in particular, should be exempt from the  ingestion warning due to the characteristics of the delivery system and  the warnings already required for aerosols pressurized by gaseous  propellants under Sec.  369.21 (21 CFR 369.21).     Although the comments did not submit any data to show that  antiperspirant drug products are safe if ingested, the agency believes  these products should not be toxic by oral  [[Page 34276]]  ingestion for most individuals. However, individuals with renal  dysfunction or immature renal function (i.e., infants) are at a higher  risk from any exposure to aluminum. Further, ingestion of the various  inactive ingredients present in these products may make young children  ill or cause other undesirable consequences. Without adequate proof of  safety if accidental ingestion were to occur, the agency has no basis  to exempt OTC antiperspirant drug products from the accidental  ingestion warning.     Although aerosol antiperspirant drug products are unlikely to be  accidentally ingested by most consumers, the agency notes that the  product containers are similar to those used for some food products.  Spraying an aerosol into the mouth and ingesting it could be more  hazardous than ingesting other dosage forms of the product because of  the aerosol propellants. The warnings required under Sec.  369.21, for  those drugs in dispensers pressurized by gaseous propellants, are not  related to ingestion, but state the following: ``Avoid spraying in the  eyes. Do not puncture or incinerate. Do not store at temperatures above  120 [deg]F. Keep out of reach of children.'' The agency does not  consider these warnings a basis to exempt aerosol antiperspirants from  the accidental ingestion warning required by Sec.  330.1(g) for topical  drug products. The last statement of the warning required by Sec.   369.21 and the first warning required by Sec.  330.1(g) (i.e., ``Keep  out of reach of children.'') are identical as of March 17, 1999 (64 FR  13254 at 13294). Section 350.50(c)(4)(ii)) of the final monograph  requires aerosol antiperspirant drug products to bear the language in  Sec.  369.21. These products do not have to repeat the first general  warning required by Sec.  330.1(g) but need to have the accidental  ingestion warning required by Sec.  330.1(g).     (Comment 8) Two comments objected to the proposed warning in Sec.   350.50(c) for aerosol antiperspirants, which states: ``Avoid excessive  inhalation.'' The comments argued that the warning duplicates and gives  less information than the current warning required for aerosol drug  products under Sec.  369.21.     Section 369.21 requires the following warning statement for a drug  packaged in a self-pressurized container in which the propellant  consists in whole or in part of a halocarbon or hydrocarbon: ``Use only  as directed. Intentional misuse by deliberately concentrating and  inhaling the contents can be harmful or fatal.'' The agency does not  consider this warning (which addresses deliberate misuse) as being the  same as a general statement warning people to avoid excessive  inhalation. There are many people who would not deliberately misuse the  product who should be alerted to keep away from their face and mouth  and to avoid excessive inhalation. The warning appears in the final  monograph in more consumer friendly language and in the new labeling  format as follows: ``When using this product [bullet] keep away from  face and mouth to avoid breathing it.'' (See Sec.  201.66(b)(4) for  description of a ``bullet.'')  C. Comments on Category III Effectiveness Testing      (Comment 9) Several comments objected to user perception testing to  substantiate Category III effectiveness claims. (See comment 24, 47 FR  36492 at 36499.) The comments contended that the user perception test  is not reliably indicative of product effectiveness and offers at best  a crude index of activity that is difficult to employ for precise  qualitative and quantitative evaluations. The comments considered  objective gravimetric sweat collection procedures more reliable than  user perception testing to assess antiperspirant activity levels and  requested that user perception testing be deleted. Three comments  submitted data on user perception testing of Category III claims,  including extra effective, 24-hour duration, emotional sweating, and  foot perspiration (see section II.C, comments 11 through 14 of this  document).     The agency has determined that user-perception test data support  emotional sweating, 24-hour protection, and extra effective claims.  Accordingly, the agency concludes that there are sufficient data on  user perception tests (including both user and independent observer  perception tests) for use of antiperspirants for the underarm. No  further user perception tests are necessary if an underarm  antiperspirant shows at least 20 percent sweat reduction by gravimetric  tests for emotional sweating and 24-hour protection claims or 30  percent sweat reduction for extra effective claims. Adequate user  perception tests have not been conducted for parts of the body other  than the underarms, such as the hands or feet. The agency will still  require user perception and other effectiveness data to support use of  antiperspirants on the hands and feet (see section II.A, comment 4 and  section II.C, comment 14 of this document).     (Comment 10) Several comments objected to the Category III status  of the claims ``problem perspiration'' and ``especially troublesome  perspiration.'' One comment contended these claims are not inherently  misleading or untruthful and many people who do not perspire heavily  may, at times, consider themselves to have ``problem'' or  ``troublesome'' perspiration.     Other comments objected to the agency's definition of problem  perspiration as affecting the upper 5 percent of perspirerers,  contending that a more realistic approach would be to let consumers  define the meaning of these words by running efficacy studies on people  who identify themselves as having problem or especially troublesome  perspiration. One comment objected to the economic consequences of  testing the top 5 percent of the population to establish a ``problem  perspiration'' claim, because this could raise the price for one  efficacy evaluation from the current $5,000 to $10,000 up to $200,000.  The comment requested a hearing on this issue if FDA did not revise its  approach.     No data were submitted to the agency to show that any OTC  antiperspirant drug product is effective in reducing ``problem'' or  ``especially troublesome'' perspiration. The agency is not aware of any  products that currently qualify as effective for those conditions. If  products are found to be effective in the future, the agency will  include a definition and labeling for ``problem'' or ``especially  troublesome'' perspiration in the monograph. The agency proposed in the  tentative final monograph that a 30 percent reduction in sweat  production in the upper 5 percent of perspirerers is necessary for a  ``problem perspiration claim'' (47 FR 36492 at 36500). As discussed in  section II.C, comment 9 of this document, gravimetric testing is  sufficient to prove these claims. The agency would find acceptable an  antiperspirant effectiveness study on a population of individuals who  perceive themselves to have ``problem perspiration,'' as one comment  suggested. Based on changes in the testing to support these claims, the  agency concludes that a hearing is not needed.     (Comment 11) Several comments objected to the agency's proposed  Category II classification of the claims ``extra strength,'' ``extra  effective,'' or any other comparative effectiveness claims (see comment  19, 47 FR 36492 at 36498). The comments argued that if manufacturers  can demonstrate by appropriate testing and methods of statistical  analysis that one product is more effective than another, they should  be permitted to so inform consumers. The comments noted that the agency  had approved an NDA for an acetaminophen ``extra strength'' product and  allowed sunscreen products to label  [[Page 34277]]  their degree of effectiveness. One comment requested a hearing on this  subject.     To prove the validity of comparative claims, two comments submitted  both gravimetric and perceptual data (Refs. 4 and 5). Another comment  submitted gravimetric data only (Refs. 6 and 7) and stated that one  study showed that a 10 percent difference in antiperspirant  effectiveness can be measured with currently marketed antiperspirant  products. This comment stated that adequate data (Ref. 8) had been  submitted to the Panel (43 FR 46694 at 46715) to show that as  differences in antiperspirant performance levels increase, larger  numbers of consumers perceive the difference. These data included a  chart plotting differences in sweat reduction against the percentage of  subjects who noted variations in axillary wetness. The chart shows that  at 20 percent sweat reduction, approximately 45 to 50 percent of the  subjects noticed a difference; at 35 percent sweat reduction,  approximately 60 percent noticed a difference; and at 50 percent sweat  reduction, approximately 75 percent noticed a difference. The comment  contended that this study confirmed the Panel's determination that the  user can perceive a shift of at least 10 percent in antiperspirant  effectiveness and that a product providing a 30 percent or greater  sweat reduction is perceived as more effective than a standard  antiperspirant. The comments requested monograph status for ``extra  strength'' and ``extra effective'' claims, as qualified by gravimetric  studies.     The agency has determined that some of the studies (Ref. 4) meet  the Panel's ``guidelines for user perception test to be done for claims  of `extra-effective' to be classified as Category I'' (43 FR 46694 at  46730). In these studies, two solid stick antiperspirant products  (containing either 10 percent or 25 percent aluminum chlorohydrate)  were compared by both a gravimetric and a user perception test. In the  gravimetric test, 91 female subjects used the 10-percent product, and  88 used the 25-percent product. A 17-day conditioning period with no  antiperspirant use was followed by four daily applications of one of  the products to a randomly selected axilla (armpit or underarm). The  opposite axilla received no treatment and served as the control.  Baseline sweat production was determined the first day of the test. On  days two and three, the antiperspirant was applied and 1 hour later a  sweat production sample was collected. On day five, 24 hours after the  fourth application, a sweat production sample was collected. Both the  10- and 25-percent products were more effective than the no treatment  control for all time periods according to the statistical methods  (Wilcoxon signed rank test) in the agency's guidelines for  effectiveness testing of OTC antiperspirant drug products (Ref. 9).  Evaluation of the Z values for the two 1-hour test days and the 24-hour  test day showed that both products were statistically (Wilcoxon test)  at least 20 percent better than the control axilla for all time periods  (p < 0.001 for all three cases). Thus, both products met the  requirements for standard effectiveness, i.e., a minimum of 20-percent  reduction in underarm perspiration. Applying the same statistical  methods to a 30-percent reduction in underarm perspiration on the last  24-hour data showed that the 25-percent product was more effective than  no treatment (p < 0.001) and, thus, met one of the extra effective  criteria.     The same study design was used in the user perception test except  that the subjects applied the 10-percent product under one axilla and  the 25-percent product under the other axilla. On day five, 24 hours  after the fourth application, the 100 female subjects were asked  ``Under which arm do you feel drier?'' All subjects had a preference:  33 favored the 10-percent product and 67 favored the 25-percent  product. A statistically significant number of the subjects were able  to perceive that the 25-percent product was more effective than the 10- percent product (p = 0.0005 one-sided). This result exceeded the  Panel's requirement that 58 out of 100 subjects have a preference for  the test antiperspirant (43 FR 46694 at 46731). Thus, these studies  showed that the 25-percent aluminum chlorohydrate met the Panel's  criteria (gravimetric measurements and user perception) for an extra  effective claim.     The agency has determined that the studies indicate that  gravimetric testing shows an adequate difference between a standard  antiperspirant (with a 20-percent reduction in sweat) and an  antiperspirant with at least a 30-percent reduction in sweat, as  required by the Panel, to support an ``extra effective'' claim. The  agency stated in the tentative final monograph (47 FR 36492 at 36499)  that once the level of activity that is perceivable by users has been  established using the Panel's recommended guidelines, it will not be  necessary to perform user perception testing on individual products.  Accordingly, the agency concludes that no further user perception  testing is necessary for an ``extra effective'' claim, which is being  included in the monograph for those antiperspirant products that reduce  underarm perspiration by 30 percent or more using the guidelines for  effectiveness testing of antiperspirant drug products referred to in  Sec.  350.60.     The Panel placed ``extra-strength'' claims in Category II because  it concluded that ``the presence of more active ingredient in an  antiperspirant product cannot be used as a basis for a claim of added  effectiveness because additional amounts of antiperspirant active  ingredient do not necessarily result in improved product  effectiveness'' (43 FR 46694 at 46724). The Panel also stated that  ``the term `extra-strength' normally refers to increased concentration  of the active ingredient which would normally mean added  effectiveness.'' Several comments agreed that more active ingredient  may not yield more effectiveness. Thus, a product containing 20 percent  of an active ingredient (compared to 15 percent) that did not provide  30 percent or more sweat reduction could not claim ``extra strength''  or ``extra effective.''     The agency does not believe that for antiperspirants the claim  ``extra strength'' is as informative to consumers as the claim ``extra  effective.'' The agency considers ``extra effective'' to be the key  information that consumers want to know to select an appropriate  antiperspirant product. The agency is including this new labeling claim  in Sec.  350.50(b)(4) of this final monograph. Based on this  discussion, the agency concludes that a hearing is not needed on this  subject.     (Comment 12) Several comments objected to the Panel's Category III  classification of claims for enhanced duration of effect, such as ``24- hour protection,'' ``one spray keeps you comfortably dry all day,''  ``prolonged protection,'' etc. (43 FR 46694 at 46728). One comment  stated that if an antiperspirant product can be shown to provide the  required 20-percent reduction in perspiration under hotroom conditions  for 24, 48, etc. hours after application, then duration claims have  been substantiated.     Three manufacturers submitted gravimetric studies (Refs. 4, 7, 10,  and 11) that used a hotroom to induce sweating and measured sweat  collected in cotton pads twice over a 24-hour period. The tested  ingredients showed a 20-percent or more reduction in sweat production  for both collection times, which the comments contended satisfied  enhanced duration claims such as ``24 hour protection'' and ``all day  protection.'' One comment added that its data (Ref. 11) support a  variety of product forms (cream, roll-on, solid  [[Page 34278]]  stick) and, thus, the enhanced duration effect is not limited to  product form.     The agency has determined that the data support a claim of enhanced  duration for 24 hours according to the Panel's criteria. The protocols  in seven of the studies (Refs. 7 and 10) varied only slightly from the  Panel's recommended protocol. Subjects in one study abstained from  antiperspirant use for 2 weeks prior to the study. Subjects in the  other six studies stopped using antiperspirants 4 weeks prior to the  studies. The subjects were pretreated with an antiperspirant for the 5  days prior to beginning sweat collection procedures. Sweat was  collected 4 and 24 hours following the last antiperspirant application.  Five studies included untreated axilla controls, and two studies  included placebo controls. One product was tested in two different  studies (one with a placebo and one without), and the results were  virtually identical. The tests supported enhanced duration efficacy of  20 percent sweat reduction over the 24-hour period for aluminum  zirconium tetrachloride (15.5 percent roll-on and 18.2 percent stick),  zirconium tetrachloride (20 percent roll-on), aluminum chlorohydrate  (6.8 percent aerosol), and aluminum chloride (20 percent solution).     Other data (Ref. 4) also supported enhanced duration of  effectiveness for antiperspirant solid sticks containing 10 and 25  percent aluminum chlorohydrate. Subjects, who abstained from  antiperspirant use for 17 days prior to the study, were pretreated with  an antiperspirant for the 3 days prior to sweat collection, 1 and 24  hours after the last antiperspirant application. Standard hotroom and  sweat collection procedures were used. Over the 24-hour period, both 10  percent and 25 percent aluminum chlorohydrate sticks reduced sweat  production in the treated axilla by 20 percent compared to the  untreated axilla. The 25-percent aluminum chlorohydrate product also  showed a 30-percent reduction in sweat production.     Six other studies (Ref. 11) support enhanced duration claims. Most  products showed a 20-percent reduction in sweat production compared to  an untreated axilla for both the 4- and 24-hour evaluation periods,  with several products showing a 30-percent sweat reduction. However,  the studies did not identify the antiperspirant active ingredients.     The agency is including the following enhanced duration claims in  Sec.  350.50(b)(3) of this final monograph: ``all day protection,''  ``lasts all day,'' ``lasts 24 hours,'' or ``24 hour protection.'' In  order to make such a claim, an antiperspirant product must reduce sweat  production by at least 20 percent over a 24-hour period after  application using the guidelines for effectiveness testing referred to  in Sec.  350.60. Antiperspirant products that meet the extra effective  criteria (see section II.C, comment 11 of this document) over a 24-hour  period can be labeled with both extra effective and enhanced duration  claims (e.g., ``24 hour extra effective protection,'' ``all day extra  effective protection,'' ``extra effective protection lasts all day,''  etc.). Claims of enhanced duration for more than 24 hours are  nonmonograph because the agency has not received any data to  demonstrate antiperspirant effectiveness for more than 24 hours  according to the Panel's criteria.     (Comment 13) Several comments objected to the Panel's Category III  classification of claims for control of emotional sweating, e.g.,  induced by tension or stress (43 FR 46694 at 46728). The comments  contended that a product's antiperspirant activity is the same whether  the sweat is due to thermal conditions or emotional factors. Some  comments disagreed with the need for additional testing, especially  consumer perception testing, to establish these claims. One comment  requested a hearing.     One comment submitted clinical data (Refs. 7 and 12) which it  contended showed: (1) There is a valid scientific protocol that  combines a gravimetric sweat test with a word-quiz stress test to  measure reduction in emotionally-induced sweat; (2) an antiperspirant  is not washed from the axillae during controlled emotional stressing,  and excessive sweat does not diminish antiperspirant effectiveness; (3)  an antiperspirant effective in reducing thermally-induced sweat is  effective in reducing emotionally-induced sweat also; and (4) an  antiperspirant that reduces emotionally-induced sweat by 20 percent or  more meets the standard for antiperspirant effectiveness for which user  perception and benefit has already been accepted and, thus, there is no  need for additional user perception testing. The studies included  aerosol, roll-on, and stick products containing aluminum chlorohydrate  or aluminum zirconium tetrachlorohydrate, the major antiperspirant  active ingredients.     The agency has determined that gravimetric sweat tests combined  with mental stress tests support an emotionally-induced sweating claim.  The data included 12 studies with the same design of 5 days each on  panels of approximately 25 female subjects: Pretest-abstention from all  antiperspirants for at least 4 weeks prior to the study; day one-- pretreatment control sweat collection under no stress; day two-- pretreatment control sweat collection under emotional stressing; days  two through five--apply test product; and days four and five-- posttreatment sweat collection under emotional stressing. Subjects  applied the antiperspirant test formulation to one axilla and used  either a comparative formulation, a control placebo formulation, or no  treatment on the opposite axilla. A control emotional challenge test,  which lasted for about 60 minutes, was done on day two and an emotional  challenge test was done on days four and five of the study.     Emotional sweating was induced by having subjects do a word  definition test conducted by a moderator experienced at insuring  optimum stress. The subjects received monetary rewards for a correct  definition, but forfeited some of their rewards for incorrect or  untimely definitions. Subjects had a 5-second time limit to begin a  response and a 15-second maximum time to give the actual word  definition. After 60 minutes, sweat was measured gravimetrically from  the preweighed absorbent pads. Standard sweat collection and  statistical evaluation procedures were used. The median sweat output  for the 12 studies was 1,257 milligrams (mg) for the pretreatment  control under emotional stressing compared to 415 mg for the  pretreatment control under no stress. This word definition test  effectively elicited a sweat response.     In the 12 studies using the word definition test, there was at  least a 20-percent reduction of sweat production. The top 10 percent of  heavy sweaters from each study (25 subjects) having the highest  sweating rates on the untreated axilla had a 36.8 percent average sweat  reduction compared to 38.2 percent reduction in the remaining 90  percent of each population (196 subjects), showing no significant  difference in effectiveness in the two groups. Majors and Wild (Ref.  13) obtained similar results when comparing individual percent  reduction in thermal sweating in the antiperspirant-treated axilla to  rate of sweating from the untreated axilla in 89 subjects. They found  that heavy sweating did not affect the rate of reduction.     The products tested under the emotional sweat protocol were also  evaluated under a standard thermal sweat protocol at 100 [deg]F with 30  percent relative humidity. The average percent sweat reduction for  aerosols was 37.0 percent for emotional sweating and 34.0 percent for  thermal sweating, for sticks it was 46.0 percent for emotional  [[Page 34279]]  sweating and 41.4 percent for thermal sweating, and for roll-ons it was  51.3 percent for emotional sweating and 53.3 percent for thermal  sweating. These data show that the same products have similar average  percent sweat reduction for both emotional and thermal sweating.     The agency concludes that gravimetric sweat tests combined with  mental stress tests are sufficient to show effectiveness for control of  emotionally-induced sweating; the data show antiperspirant drug  products that are effective for thermal sweating are also effective for  emotional sweating. The agency has determined that no additional  testing (e.g., user perception tests) is required for an emotionally- induced sweating claim for products containing monograph ingredients  that meet the guidelines for effectiveness testing of antiperspirant  drug products referred to in Sec.  350.60.     The agency is including the following emotionally-induced sweating  claim in Sec.  350.50(b)(2) of this final monograph: ``also [select one  of the following: `decreases,' `lessens,' or `reduces'] underarm  [select one of the following: `dampness,' `perspiration,` `sweat,'  `sweating,' or `wetness'] due to stress''. Based on the previous  discussion, the agency concludes that a hearing is not needed on this  subject.     (Comment 14) One comment requested monograph status for 25 percent  aluminum chlorohydrate to control foot perspiration based on  gravimetric and perceptual data from four randomized, double-blind,  bilateral, paired-comparison trials, each having 12 female subjects  (Ref. 14). Treatment was randomly assigned; aluminum chlorohydrate was  used on one foot and placebo on the other foot. A 25 percent aluminum  chlorohydrate solution in 50 percent ethanol:50 percent water and a  placebo control consisting of 50 percent ethanol:50 percent water were  used in the first study. The same solutions in aerosol form were used  in the other three studies. The procedure in the agency's ``Guidelines  for Effectiveness Testing of OTC Antiperspirant Drug Products'' (Ref.  9) was modified for foot testing: (1) A 3-day pre-treatment period  during which subjects were not to use any foot care products, with each  subject receiving four daily product applications prior to final  hotroom posttreatment testing collection; (2) sweat collection media  were cotton socks rather than absorbent pads; (3) a required 5-minute  period of mild exercise (walking around the hotroom at the beginning of  each collection period); and (4) a modified method to calculate  effectiveness due to the erratic rate of sweat collections for both  treated and control feet.     The comment stated that the calculation technique included in the  agency's guidelines could not be used for the following several  reasons: (1) The increased number and higher concentration of sweat  glands in the foot area, (2) the occlusive nature of the foot area, and  (3) the erratic rate of sweat collections for both treated and control  feet. The comment contended that by considering the baseline, the  posttreatment sweat collections, and the preferential subject  perception data, statistically significant differences could be shown  between sweat collection values for the treated foot compared to  baseline values.     The comment stated that based on at least a 5-percent difference  between the measured sweat output of each foot, sweat reduction was  achieved for the treated foot in 25 of 48 subjects (52 percent)  compared to only 10 of 48 subjects (21 percent) for the control foot.  The comment added that, based on the user perception questionnaire, 75  percent of the subjects (29 out of 39 subjects who were able to  discriminate) were able to perceive after the hotroom exposure that the  treated foot was drier compared to only 21 percent of the subjects (10  out of 48) who perceived the control foot to be drier.     A second comment submitted a proposed clinical protocol (Ref. 15),  but never submitted any clinical data.     The agency has found the data are insufficient to support a foot  antiperspirant claim. In axillary sweating tests submitted to the  Panel, the range of effectiveness (average percent sweat reduction) of  antiperspirants was 20 to 40 percent in most tests, with aerosols  having a reduction range of 20 to 33 percent (43 FR 46694 at 46713). In  the comment's studies on aluminum chlorohydrate for foot  antiperspirancy (Ref. 14), the average percent sweat reduction was  below 10 percent, which is considerably below the 20 percent minimum  level of sweat reduction recommended by the Panel for efficacy testing  of OTC antiperspirant drug products on the foot (43 FR 46728). In  addition, the agency has a number of concerns about the comment's data  treatment methods: (1) The particular sweat collections selected for  analysis were not chosen consistently across studies but were based on  arbitrarily chosen final sweat measurements that varied with the  different studies, (2) the choice of a 5-percent difference between the  measured sweat output of each foot as ``clinically significant'' seems  arbitrary and was not prespecified in the protocol, (3) the efficacy  criterion used (greater than 15 percent reduction from baseline) was  apparently defined after the data were collected and the results are  therefore potentially biased, and (4) comparison with baseline is not  an adequate basis upon which to conclude product efficacy because it  ignores placebo and time effects that are accounted for in between  product comparisons. The agency's analysis of ``across study'' data  (using the average of the two sweat collections on day four, or average  of the four collections on day four and five as the baseline, and the  average of the two final collections as a measure of the final sweat  product) did not show a statistically significant mean (or mean  percent) sweat reduction from baseline in treated or control feet.     The agency does not agree with the comment's evaluation of its user  perception data, but considers the product as ineffective both in  subjects who preferred placebo and in subjects with no preference. It  appears that the comment chose to ignore tied preferences. However,  when subjects with no preference were included in the analysis, 22 out  of 48 subjects (45.8 percent) and 29 out of 48 subjects (60.4 percent)  preferred the treated foot, before entering and after leaving the  hotroom, respectively. Both proportions are not significantly different  from 1/2 (two-tailed, p = 0.28 and 0.15, respectively). Furthermore,  the subjects apparently could not perceive which foot, treated or  untreated, was drier. More subjects failed to choose the drier foot,  than chose it correctly, both at baseline and posttreatment. Thus, the  wetness perception study failed to show that subjects are able to tell  marginal differences in sweating of the feet.     The agency has concluded that no statistically significant  treatment effect was found in sweat reduction or in subject's  perception of sweat (Ref. 16). Thus, 25 percent aluminum chlorohydrate  has not been shown to be an effective foot antiperspirant. The agency  provided the second comment suggestions on its protocol; a revised  protocol was acceptable (Ref. 17), but no test data were ever  submitted. The agency is not including foot antiperspirancy claims in  the final monograph.  D. Comments on Testing Guidelines      (Comment 15) Several comments requested that the background section  of the effectiveness testing guidelines include the following: ``FDA  recognizes that alternative methodologies may be appropriate to qualify  an antiperspirant drug product as effective. These  [[Page 34280]]  guidelines do not preclude the use of alternative methodologies that  provide scientifically valid results.''     The agency is adding this statement (but changing the words  ``alternative methodologies'' to ``alternate methods'') and adding  ``subject to FDA approval'' to provide for alternate methods and  statistical evaluations of effectiveness test data.     (Comment 16) Several comments requested that the relative humidity  of 35 to 40 percent in the effectiveness testing guidelines be lowered  to 30 percent, the hotroom condition widely used by industry. One  comment submitted the results of effectiveness studies (Refs. 7, 10,  and 18) that used a hotroom operated at 30 + 3 percent relative  humidity. The comment stated that 30 percent relative humidity  accurately measures antiperspirant effectiveness without causing  excessive discomfort to test subjects. Two other comments submitted  effectiveness test data where the relative humidity in the hotroom was  ``about 35 percent'' (Refs. 19 and 20) or ``35 percent +/- 5 percent''  (Ref. 21).     Based on these data, the agency is revising the relative humidity  range for hotroom conditions in the antiperspirant effectiveness  testing guidelines from 35 to 40 percent to a range of 30 to 40  percent. Seven studies (Ref. 10) that showed an enhanced duration of  effectiveness of 20 percent sweat reduction over a 24-hour period for  several antiperspirant products (see also section II.C, comment 12 of  this document) used a protocol (Ref. 18) in which the subjects were  placed in a controlled environment with the temperature held at 100 +/-  2 [deg]F and the relative humidity held at 30 +/- 3 percent. Because  the subjects were able to generate at least 150 mg of sweat per axilla  per 20 minute period, the agency considers the results of the  gravimetric tests valid. In other studies (Refs. 20 and 21), sweating  was induced by having the subjects sit in a hotroom maintained at a  temperature of 100 +/- 2 [deg]F and at a relative humidity of about 35  percent or 35 +/- 5 percent. These studies support claims of extra  effectiveness and enhanced duration (24-hour claims). See section II.C,  comments 11 and 12 of this document. To assure that test subjects sweat  adequately during the hotroom test, the agency is adding the following  baseline perspiration rate condition: ``Baseline perspiration rate.  Test subjects must produce at least 100 milligrams of sweat from the  untreated or placebo control axilla in a 20-minute collection in the  controlled environment.''     (Comment 17) Two comments requested revision of the part of the  antiperspirant effectiveness testing guidelines that involves  application of a control formulation to the alternate axilla during  testing. Noting that the guidelines state that the control formulation  is to be ``devoid of any antiperspirant activity * * * determined in a  test compared to no treatment,'' a comment contended that it should be  appropriate to compare antiperspirant activity directly against an  untreated axilla and, thereby, reduce the time, complexity, and cost of  the testing, especially the cost of developing a control formulation  ``devoid'' of antiperspirant activity. The comment requested that the  testing guidelines be revised to provide for the application of a  control formulation or no treatment to the other axilla of each test  subject. The other comment submitted data from two studies (Refs. 22  and 23) where one antiperspirant formulation was tested against both a  placebo control and an untreated axilla control with virtually  identical results; therefore, a placebo control was unnecessary to  evaluate product effectiveness.     The data (Refs. 22 and 23) involved an aerosol spray containing 6.8  percent aluminum chlorohydrate tested by two gravimetric sweat tests  under hotroom conditions to substantiate the claim that the product  provides ``all day wetness protection.'' Both studies had the same  design: Day one--pretreatment control collection; days two, three, and  four--application of antiperspirant; and days four and five-- posttreatment sweat collection 4 and 24 hours after application. The  data were evaluated using one of the statistical methods recommended in  the antiperspirant testing guidelines. In one study (Ref. 22), the  product was tested against a placebo aerosol in 44 subjects. The  placebo was identical to the test formulation and supposedly devoid of  antiperspirant activity; the formula difference was adjusted with  aerosol propellant. The results were statistically significant and  showed that the aluminum chlorohydrate aerosol effectively reduced  sweat production by at least 20 percent more than the placebo aerosol  at 4 and 24 hours after application. However, the placebo showed some  antiperspirant activity. In the second study (Ref. 23), the same  product was tested against an untreated axilla control in 49 subjects  with statistically significant results. The aluminum chlorohydrate  aerosol effectively reduced sweat production by at least 20 percent  more on the treated axilla than the untreated control axilla at 4 and  24 hours after application.     The agency is unable to conclude from these data that an untreated  comparator is equivalent to use of a placebo. The observed effect of a  treatment (e.g., antiperspirant) may represent the sum of the  pharmacological effects of the test drug and other effects associated  with the intervention effort, which may include psychological effects  and the effects of the excipients used in a product formulation.  Although studies have been conducted in the past using no treatment for  one axilla, the use of a placebo control for that axilla allows for  assessment of the net treatment effects of the test article. Therefore,  the agency is retaining the requirement for a placebo/vehicle control  in the antiperspirant effectiveness testing guidelines.     The proposed guidelines stated that the control formulation is as  similar as possible to the test formulation and devoid of any  antiperspirant activity. As the placebo used in one study (Ref. 22) was  not completely devoid of antiperspirant activity, the agency is  revising the guidelines to state:     Hotroom procedure. (1) For gravimetric and user perception  testing, treatments consist of the application of the test  formulation to one axilla and the application of a placebo control  formulation to the other axilla of each test subject. Except for the  active ingredient, the placebo control formulation should be as  similar as possible to the test formulation.     The agency concludes that this revised testing procedure will  reduce the time, complexity, and cost of testing because it eliminates  the cost of developing a control formulation ``devoid'' of  antiperspirant activity.  E. Comments on Antiperspirant Active Ingredients      (Comment 18) Several comments noted a discrepancy in a heading in  an active ingredient table in the Panel's report (43 FR 46694 at  46697), where ``Metal:Halide'' is used, and in proposed Sec.  350.10  (47 FR 36492 at 36504), where ``Al:Cl'' is used. Two comments suggested  that ``Al:Cl'' in the table heading and in Sec.  350.10 should be  changed to ``Metal:Cl,'' because the ratio range in the table is for  the ratio of the ``Cl'' to either aluminum (``Al'') or aluminum plus  zirconium (``Al+Zr'').     The agency notes that the ratio range designated as ``A1:Cl'' in  the TFM should have been ``Metal:Halide,'' as it was in the Panel's  report. The agency is not including the ratio range table in Sec.   350.10 of this final monograph because this information is now included  in the U.S. Pharmacopeia-  [[Page 34281]]  National Formulary (USP-NF) monographs for each active ingredient  included in Sec.  350.10, where applicable. The agency is changing the  introductory text of Sec.  350.10 to state: ``Where applicable, the  ingredient must meet the aluminum to chloride, aluminum to zirconium,  and aluminum plus zirconium to chloride atomic ratios described in the  United States Pharmacopeia-National Formulary.''     (Comment 19) Two comments agreed with the agency that buffer  components present in the compound, such as glycine or glycol, should  be omitted when calculating the maximum allowable concentration of  active ingredients in an antiperspirant product (47 FR 36492 at 36495).  One comment noted a potential source of confusion because the active  ingredients table in proposed Sec.  350.10 included the buffer names  along with the active ingredient names. To minimize confusion and to be  consistent with the agency's policy regarding buffers, the comment  requested the agency to remove the buffer names from the ``active  ingredient'' column in Sec.  350.10. The comment proposed a number of  changes in the active ingredient section.     When the Panel first discussed terminology for aluminum chloride  and aluminum chlorohydrate antiperspirant active ingredients, the  buffer additives were not included (Ref. 24). Subsequently, the  Cosmetic, Toiletry, and Fragrance Association (CTFA) Antiperspirant  Task Force developed definitions for aluminum chlorohydrex complexes  with propylene glycol or polyethylene glycol, and for aluminum  zirconium chlorohydrex complexes with glycine (Ref. 25). The Panel  adopted these definitions, including those for ingredients with  buffered additives, in its report (43 FR 46694 at 46696 and 46697), and  the agency proposed this nomenclature in the TFM (47 FR 36492). Since  the comment was submitted, the USP-NF developed names for these  antiperspirant active ingredients that include the names of the  buffers, where applicable, and active ingredient names in this final  monograph include the buffer, where applicable.     The agency considers calculation of the concentration of an  antiperspirant ingredient present in a product based on the amount of  anhydrous ingredient to be appropriate. Buffered antiperspirant  ingredients contain the same active chemical moiety as the  corresponding nonbuffered ingredients, and the antiperspirant activity  of both ingredients is similar.     (Comment 20) One comment requested the agency allow concentrations  of antiperspirant active ingredients above those proposed in the  monograph as long as the amount of ingredient applied to the skin is  not greater than the amount judged safe by the Panel. The comment noted  that, in the TFM (comment no. 12, 47 FR 36492 at 36495 to 36496), the  agency had disagreed with earlier comments on this issue and stated  that ``the comments included no new data to show that a higher  concentration of antiperspirant active ingredient marketed in a  particular container would deliver no more than the amount of active  ingredient judged safe by the Panel.''     The comment submitted new data from eight usage studies (Ref. 26)  to support a higher (up to 35 percent) active ingredient concentration  for powder roll-on antiperspirant drug products. Fifty male and female  subjects, between the ages of 18 and 55, participated in each study.  Subjects were given a preweighed product and instructed to use only  that product, to keep a record of how many times they used it, and not  to allow anyone else in the household to use the product. An average of  43 subjects completed the 1-week studies and returned their product to  the laboratory where it was reweighed.     The amount of product applied with each use was calculated. The  four powder roll-ons, which contained 33 percent aluminum zirconium  tetrachlorohydrate, were found to deliver between 23 and 44 mg of  antiperspirant ingredient per axilla per use. The other product forms  (solid stick, cream, or liquid roll-on), containing 18 to 19 percent of  either aluminum chlorohydrate or aluminum zirconium tetrachlorohydrate,  were found to deliver between 54 and 98 mg of antiperspirant ingredient  per axilla per use. The comment contended these data show that higher  concentrations of active antiperspirant ingredients, as used in powder  roll-on systems, deposit no more and, in fact, deposit less active  ingredient than is deposited in a liquid roll-on, solid stick, or cream  product containing proposed monograph concentrations of active  ingredients. Thus, the comment argued that concentrations up to 35  percent of Category I active ingredients should be allowed in powder  roll-on antiperspirants.     This issue was specifically brought before the Panel, which did not  agree to change the maximum concentration (Ref. 27). The Panel noted  that aluminum antiperspirants can be irritating, expressed concern that  a small amount of a concentrated formulation may be more irritating  than a large amount of a more dilute formulation, and concluded that  antiperspirant products with a higher concentration would need an NDA  with additional safety studies. The agency notes that increasing the  concentration of aluminum antiperspirant ingredients increases the  acidity of the material and irritation of the skin (Refs. 28, 29, and  30). The agency concludes that safety data are needed to show that  powder roll-on dosage forms containing up to 35 percent aluminum  chlorhydrates or aluminum zirconium chlorhydrates are not irritating.     Since the TFM was published, several citizen petitions have raised  concerns about the amount of aluminum absorbed from topical  antiperspirant drug products. (See section II.F, comment 23 of this  document.) The agency has no data showing that products containing up  to 35 percent aluminum chlorhydrates or aluminum zirconium  chlorhydrates increase aluminum absorption and is not revising the  monograph to provide for powder roll-on dosage forms containing up to  35 percent antiperspirant active ingredient, without additional safety  data being provided.     (Comment 21) One comment requested monograph status for aluminum  sesquichlorohydrate prepared by neutralizing aluminum chloride with  magnesium hydroxide even though the aluminum to chloride (Al:Cl) ratio  of the ingredient prepared in this manner does not fall within the  range specified for aluminum sesquichlorohydrate in the TFM. The  comment stated that during the course of the rulemaking all aluminum  chlorhydrates placed in Category I were prepared by conventional  techniques: Either by neutralization of aluminum chloride with aluminum  monochlorohydrate or by a controlled reaction of aluminum metal with  hydrochloric acid. Thus, the comment argued that it was both  appropriate and convenient to characterize the various aluminum  chlorhydrates in terms of their Al:Cl ratios.     The comment stated that its data showed that the reaction of  aluminum chloride with magnesium hydroxide yields aluminum  sesquichlorohydrate equivalent to that listed in the TFM and the  neutralizer magnesium hydroxide does not contribute either aluminum or  chloride ions to the neutralization process; thus, the Al:Cl ratio of  aluminum sesquichlorohydrate prepared this way will always remain 0.33,  the same as aluminum chloride alone. The comment was concerned because  this Al:Cl ratio of 0.33 does not fall within the ratio range of 1.9  down  [[Page 34282]]  to but not including 1.25:1 proposed for aluminum sesquichlorohydrate  in the tentative final monograph (47 FR 36492 at 36504). The comment  contended that if the final product is regarded as a mixture of  aluminum sesquichlorohydrate and magnesium chloride, and if the amount  of chloride that serves as counter ions for the magnesium ions were  subtracted from the total chloride, then the Al:Cl ratio of the  aluminum sesquichlorohydrate component of the mixture would have the  Al:Cl ratio specified in the TFM. The comment submitted data (Ref. 31)  using gel permeation chromatography and elemental analysis of the  eluates (the substance separated out by washing) to show that aluminum  sesquichlorohydrate prepared by this neutralization method is  chromatographically indistinguishable from that prepared by  conventional methods. The comment suggested designating the ingredient  prepared by the neutralization method as ``aluminum sesquichlorohydrate  MAG.''     The agency does not find these analytical data sufficient to  support the comment's claim that the ingredient prepared by this  neutralization method is chemically equivalent in composition to  aluminum sesquichlorohydrate. The chromatographic indistinguishability  from aluminum sesquichlorohydrate prepared by conventional methods only  demonstrates that the chromatographic method in this study is  insufficient to support the claim. This result perhaps is to be  expected because the gel permeation chromatographic method used in this  study is based primarily on a size exclusion principle; however, the  agency doubts that any chromatographic method will provide such  support.     USP 23-NF 18 Fifth Supplement (Ref. 32) added a monograph for  aluminum sesquichlorohydrate and described it as consisting of complex  basic aluminum chloride that is polymeric and loosely hydrated and  encompasses a range of aluminum-to-chloride atomic ratios between  1.26:1 and 1.90:1. Its chemical formula is stated as:  Al y (OH) 3y-z Cl z .nH 2 O.     According to the method described in the comment, when aluminum  sesquichlorohydrate is prepared by the reaction of aluminum chloride  with magnesium hydroxide, the product must be a mixture of aluminum  sesquichlorohydrate and magnesium chloride. The agency does not  consider it suitable from a technical point of view to simply designate  this material as aluminum sesquichlorohydrate. Information provided by  the comment shows that the alternate process material is not  ``equivalent in composition'' because the aluminum to chloride ratio of  0.33 is outside the specified range for aluminum sesquichlorohydrate  and because the material contains measurable amounts of magnesium.  Also, as discussed in section II.E, comment 18 of this document,  because the atomic ratio range should be metal to halide, magnesium  should be counted as a metal in the atomic ratio range of the comment's  material. Using the name aluminum sesquichlorohydrate for an ingredient  prepared by neutralization of aluminum chloride with magnesium  hydroxide would be misleading because this would imply that the drug is  the same identifiable ingredient as aluminum sesquichlorohydrate  prepared by neutralization of aluminum chloride with aluminum  chlorohydrate. The agency believes the material described in the  comment should be classified as a new ingredient, perhaps an aluminum  magnesium chlorohydrate, rather than aluminum sesquichlorohydrate.     The agency concludes that additional information on the chemical  characterization of the proposed material, particularly its ionic  structure, is needed to permit a more scientific review. The submitted  information does not provide a technical basis for allowing the  substitution of aluminum sesquichlorohydrate manufactured by  neutralization with magnesium chloride for that neutralized with  aluminum monochlorohydrate. The USP-NF monograph (Ref. 32) does not  contain information to characterize or identify an aluminum  sesquichlorohydrate containing magnesium (e.g., no identification or  content test, and no assay involving magnesium calculations).     Further, the agency notes that no clinical efficacy data were  provided to show that the material proposed in the comment would be  equally effective as aluminum sesquichlorohydrate prepared in the  conventional manner. Even minor variations in formulation, such as the  addition of emollients or buffers, can alter the effectiveness of an  antiperspirant ingredient. (See comment no. 8 in the TFM (47 FR 36492  at 36494).) The new mixture may be just as effective. However, whether  such a finding would apply to equal amounts, or whether an equivalent  effect could be achieved with a greater or lesser amount of aluminum  sesquichlorohydrate prepared with magnesium hydroxide, should be  determined by effectiveness testing that follows the guidelines  referred to in Sec.  350.60 of the final monograph. The agency needs  appropriate effectiveness data and an appropriate USP-NF monograph  amendment (see 21 CFR 330.14(i)) before the ingredient prepared by the  new method can be generally recognized as safe and effective and  included in the final monograph.     (Comment 22) One comment objected to the agency's rejection of its  earlier request (discussed in comment no. 9 of the TFM, 47 FR 36492 at  36495) that combinations of two or more Category I antiperspirant  ingredients should be Category I. The comment stated that the  combination policy in Sec.  330.10(a)(4)(iv) allows combinations of two  or more safe and effective active ingredients; thus, the Panel should  be reversed.     In the TFM (47 FR 36495), the agency concurred with the Panel (43  FR 46694 at 46718) that both combinations of antiperspirant active  ingredients and combinations of antiperspirant active ingredients with  other types of active ingredients (except for a deferred  antiperspirant/antifungal combination) are Category II because of no  information on the existence of any such combinations or any data to  support their safe and effective use.     The agency classified antiperspirant/antifungal combination drug  products in Category III in the TFM for OTC antifungal drug products  (December 12, 1989, 54 FR 51136 at 51148 and 51149). No additional data  were submitted to support this combination, and in the final monograph  for OTC antifungal drug products (September 23, 1993, 58 FR 49890 at  49891), the agency classified all antifungal combination drug products  as nonmonograph.     The comment did not provide any supporting data or specific  examples of Category I antiperspirant ingredients that would be  suitable for use in combination with other antiperspirant or  nonantiperspirant Category I ingredients. Thus, the combination policy  does not apply. These combinations remain nonmonograph. However, new  clinical data may be submitted to support safety and effectiveness.  F. Comments on the Safety of Aluminum Ingredients      (Comment 23) The information and arguments presented by the citizen  petitions that questioned the safety of aluminum-containing ingredients  in OTC antiperspirant drug products and the comment that disagreed with  one of the citizen petitions were discussed in detail in the Federal  Register of March 23, 1993 (58 FR 15452 at 15453 and 15454). One  petition was concerned that aluminum can be absorbed and get into the  blood and that some of the aluminum in the blood enters the brain,  [[Page 34283]]  where it remains and accumulates. The petition cited a study by Perl  and Good (Ref. 33) that suggested that inhaled aluminum compounds could  have a direct nasal-olfactory pathway to the brain. The other petition  contended that two inhalation studies (Refs. 34 and 35) provided by  industry showed aluminum absorption in the peribronchial lymph nodes,  brain, and adrenal glands of the animals after 12 and 24 months. Both  petitions expressed concern about the potential neurotoxicity of  aluminum upon chronic use, especially a possible link to Alzheimer's  disease.     The comment that disagreed with one petition contended that the  majority of the petitioner's references described findings from in  vitro studies that did not consider the blood-brain barrier, which is  the brain's main defense against potentially toxic substances such as  aluminum. The comment contended that extraordinarily high  concentrations of aluminum were used in these studies, and that  aluminum from antiperspirants would never reach a biologically  significant level to be of concern. The comment stated that the  majority of researchers investigating the etiology of Alzheimer's  disease would consider current evidence insufficient to link aluminum  to Alzheimer's disease. The comment concluded that current scientific  information does not support the need to reclassify the safety of  aluminum-containing antiperspirants.     The agency does not find the current evidence sufficient to  conclude that aluminum from antiperspirant use results in Alzheimer's  disease. Both petitions mention the widely quoted study by Perl and  Good (Ref. 33) as showing that inhaled aluminum compounds may get  directly into the brain by a nasal-olfactory pathway. The agency does  not consider this animal study (published as a one-page Letter to the  Editor in Lancet) as adequate to establish a direct nasal-olfactory  pathway for aluminum. This study was only a small pilot animal study,  about which the agency has a number of concerns.     First, the method of introducing the aluminum to these animals was  not physiologically relevant. Two strips of Gelfoam (absorbable gelatin  sponge, USP) saturated with high concentrations of aluminum salts (15  percent aluminum lactate or 5 percent aluminum chloride) were inserted  into rabbits' left nasal recess through a hole drilled into the frontal  bone. While the authors attempted to demonstrate the accessibility of  aluminum from the nasal recess to the brain, the agency questions  whether the normal use of antiperspirant aerosols would ever produce a  high aluminum concentration in this relatively distant anatomic site.  Second, the size of this study was very small (only three rabbits in  each group). The agency is concerned that any error in this complicated  surgical procedure to introduce the aluminum salts or in preparing the  specimens for analysis could have caused a major difference in the  final results. Third, the results were not consistent. Of the three  animals exposed to aluminum lactate, besides the involvement of the  left olfactory bulb and the cerebral cortex, only one rabbit had a  lesion in the hippocampus while the other two rabbits had granulomas  found in the pyriform cortex. In the group exposed to aluminum  chloride, only one rabbit had a granuloma in the olfactory bulb while  the other two rabbits were free of lesions. The distribution of lesions  in this study was fairly random. If a nasal-olfactory pathway exists  for neuronal aluminum transport, the agency believes that the  distribution of these lesions should follow a more persistent  anatomical pattern. In addition, the authors were unable to explain why  two of the six rabbits were free of lesions. Finally, although some of  the rabbits had granulomas, these lesions did not resemble the plaques  or neurofibrillary tangles found in Alzheimer's disease, and none of  the rabbits had any symptomatic neurologic deficit. While this study  implied that access to the brain via the nasal recess may be possible  under nonphysiological conditions, a direct nasal-olfactory pathway and  any relationship to Alzheimer's disease cannot be established. Several  other studies, which were not done with aluminum, are of no value in  establishing a direct nasal-central nervous system pathway for aluminum  antiperspirants.     Aluminum lactate, one aluminum salt used in this study (Ref. 33),  is not included in this final monograph. Sodium aluminum lactate has  been used as a buffer for aluminum sulfate in a nonaerosol dosage form,  but that product is nonmonograph.     In one of the inhalation studies (Ref. 34), the life-span of the  male hamsters exposed to the aluminum chlorhydrate aerosol was shorter  (583 days) than that of the controls (661 days). The female hamsters  exposed to aluminum chlorhydrate had a slightly longer life-span (489  days) than the controls (481 days). Male hamsters exposed to aluminum  chlorhydrate coated with a high concentration of isopropyl myristate,  an emollient frequently used to increase the retention on the skin of  the aluminum salts used in antiperspirant products, had a life-span  (646 days) comparable to the controls (661 days). Overall, these  numbers do not follow a consistent pattern and could be affected by  other experimental conditions.     The same petition criticized the other inhalation study (Ref. 35),  contending that the results showed that the animals had suffered  significant weight loss and increased terminal brain-to-body weight  ratios, results it considered consistent with clinical aluminum  toxicity, and that the increase in brain weight was possibly due to  cerebral edema. The petition claimed that because aluminum was found to  be deposited in the animals' brains, peribronchial lymph nodes, and  adrenal glands, this proved that systemic absorption of aluminum had  occurred and that aluminum had been transported to the brain. Other  comments disagreed with the petition's argument that the rats in this  study were found to have detectable aluminum levels in their brains  after 12 months, contending that this finding may only be artificial  considering the analytical methods used. The comments added that if  aluminum did accumulate in the rats' brains, those rats should have had  symptoms of neurotoxicity, which they did not have. The comments  concluded that the artificial finding should be ignored.     The agency does not concur with the petition's extrapolations. The  weight loss occurred only in rats and not in guinea pigs that were  similarly treated. The increase in terminal brain-to-body weight ratio  occurred only in the female rats at 12 months in the low- and high-dose  groups. The female rats in the middle-dose group and all the males were  not affected. At 24 months, this same ratio was found to increase only  in the high-dose groups of both sexes; however, the increase in the  female high-dose group was not statistically significant. The agency  notes that all of these findings did not follow any predictable pattern  or a pattern that would be expected from a dose-related or cumulative  toxin exposure.     The pattern of deposition was not consistent. In the guinea pigs,  aluminum was found in the peribronchial lymph nodes, but not in the  adrenal glands and brains (as occurred in the rats). The agency finds  it possible that aluminum absorption and deposition may be animal  dependent. If this were the case, then even if the rat data were  evidence of a problem, the same situation may not apply to humans. The  agency is not aware of other investigators having similar results.     The petitions and the comment had different views on a study by  Rollin,  [[Page 34284]]  Theodorou, and Kilroe-Smith (Ref. 36) in which rabbits were exposed to  aluminum oxide dust for 8 hours a day, 5 days a week, for 5 months. The  authors of the study found that the brains of these rabbits had a  significant increase in aluminum at the end of the study. The first  petition contended that this study showed that the inhalation of  aluminum antiperspirants poses a special risk because this route of  delivery bypasses the blood-brain barrier. The comment calculated that  this study would be equivalent to a person using spray antiperspirants  for approximately 10 seconds daily for 789 years to experience the same  toxicity. The second petition contended that this 10-seconds-exposure  assumption was incorrect because the aluminum particles in an  antiperspirant aerosol remain suspended in the air for a long period of  time, and the exposure will be more than the comment calculated.     The agency finds this study has a number of limitations: (1) The  extraordinary high concentrations of aluminum oxide exposure in the  animals, (2) the small sample size (eight animals in each group), and  (3) an overlap in the standard deviations of the results obtained  decreases the power and generalizability of the study. While the study  shows an accumulation of aluminum in the rabbits' body tissues under  certain exposure conditions, the agency does not consider the study as  providing evidence of a direct nasal-olfactory pathway or that normal  use of aluminum-containing antiperspirants would provide comparable  results. Further, the second petition's position includes a number of  assumptions, which might not occur: (1) That the place where the  product is used is a confined, poor-ventilated airspace, and (2) that  the user remains in the vicinity of the dispersed aerosol for a period  of time during which significant inhalation would occur.     One petition claimed that an epidemiology study by Graves et al.  (Ref. 37) has shown that Alzheimer's disease was associated with the  use of aluminum antiperspirants and that a high incidence of  amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and Parkinson's disease in Chamorro  natives of Guam, as reported by Garruto (Ref. 38), may be related to  high environmental aluminum. The agency has looked closely at the  Graves et al. study (Ref. 37) because it explored the association  between exposure to aluminum through the lifetime use of  antiperspirants and antacids and Alzheimer's disease. This was a case- control study of 130 matched pairs, where the controls were friends or  nonblood relatives of the case. Subjects (cases and controls) were  matched by age, sex, and the relationship between the case/control and  his or her surrogate (spouse or child).     The authors mentioned that, in general, antiperspirants contain  aluminum and deodorants do not, except for some deodorants marketed for  women. The authors reported that there was no association between the  use of ``any'' antiperspirant/deodorant and Alzheimer's disease.  However, when the data were stratified by aluminum-containing  antiperspirants the overall odds ratio showed a modest increase in risk  and a statistically significant trend emerged between increasing  lifetime use of aluminum-containing antiperspirants and the estimated  relative risk of Alzheimer's disease.     The authors commented that, to their knowledge, this was the first  epidemiological study of this association between antiperspirants and  Alzheimer's disease, and there were several methodologic limitations  that made interpretation of their results difficult. First, there were  missing data because the case surrogate and the control surrogate could  only recall all variables (frequency and duration of use, and product  brand name) in about one-half of the matched pairs. Second, there might  have been some misclassification because the analyses were based on the  most common brand provided, while some subjects may have used multiple  brands. Third, the authors considered the validity of the data,  resulting from difficulty in learning the subjects' exposure using  telephone interview methods, to be a critical limitation. Despite these  limitations, the authors considered an association between aluminum- containing antiperspirants and Alzheimer's disease as biologically  plausible, but concluded that their findings are provocative and, due  to methodologic problems, should be considered preliminary.     Garruto (Ref. 38) described efforts to establish models of chronic  motor neuron degeneration in a long-term effort to understand the  cellular and molecular mechanisms of aluminum neurotoxicity. He studied  foci of dementia (ALS and Parkinson's disease) in western Pacific  populations. He mentioned experimental models in rabbits and cell  culture as demonstrating that chronic, rather than acute, toxicity is  the cause of human neurodegenerative disorders with a long latency and  slow progression. However, Garruto stated that he and his colleagues  had been most deficient in the design and implementation of good  epidemiological studies, particularly of Alzheimer's disease and the  epidemiology of aluminum intoxication per se, and described what he  felt was needed for future well-designed studies.     The petitions/comment also discussed environmental exposure to  aluminum, percutaneous absorption after topical use, inhaled absorption  after aerosol use, aluminum neurotoxicity (and a possible relationship  to Alzheimer's disease), and possible mechanisms of action. Numerous  references were provided. The agency has reviewed these references and  other literature published on aluminum since the petitions were  submitted. Many early references were simply hypotheses and different  theories that have not been adequately substantiated in humans or any  animal models. A number of studies were pilot projects in a few  animals, and the agency is unable to draw any definite conclusions  based on the small sample sizes.     The agency notes Priest's (Ref. 39) statement that most  investigators now agree that aluminum is unlikely to be implicated in  causing Alzheimer's disease, whereas Rowan (Ref. 40) contended it would  be considerably more correct to state that the issue is controversial.  More recently, Savory et al. (Ref. 41) stated that the question whether  aluminum presents a health hazard to humans as a contributing factor to  Alzheimer's disease is still subject to debate.     The agency finds the literature shows the issue of aluminum  toxicity and Alzheimer's disease remains controversial and is not  resolved. Scott et al. (Ref. 42) reported that aluminum has been  detected in Alzheimer neurofibrillary tangles, but the significance of  its presence is unknown. Kasa, Szerdahelyi, and Wisniewski (Ref. 43)  reported that histochemical staining showed that aluminum was present  in brain samples from Alzheimer's disease victims, but the structural  localization indicated that it is not primarily involved in the  etiology of the disease. Candy et al. (Ref. 44) reported that data from  post mortem brain examinations of patients with chronic renal failure  who did not have dialysis encephalopathy suggest that it is unlikely  that aluminum plays any major role in neurofibrillary tangle formation  and that its role in senile plaque formation is likely to be only part  of a complex cascade of changes. Savory et al. (Ref. 41) stated that  the lack of agreement on the question whether the brain content of  aluminum is increased in Alzheimer's disease attests to the complexity  of the issue.     Savory et al. (Ref. 41) indicated that most of the data linking  aluminum  [[Page 34285]]  exposure to Alzheimer's disease have been derived from several  epidemiological studies of aluminum in drinking water, which represents  only a small percentage of the total exposure. They concluded that  quantification of the risk of Alzheimer's disease from other sources of  aluminum (such as food additives, cosmetics, deodorants,  antiperspirants, pharmaceuticals, and respiratory dusts) is needed  before the total risk from all environmental sources of aluminum can be  fully evaluated.     Despite Graves et al.'s acknowledgment of the limitations of their  study (Ref. 37), other authors, e.g., Anane et al. (Ref. 45), report  that Graves et al. found an increased risk of Alzheimer's disease with  lifetime use of aluminum-containing antiperspirants after an  epidemiological study. Anane et al. applied low aqueous concentrations  (0.025 to 0.1 micrograms (microg)/square centimeter) of aluminum  chloride (AlCl 3 .6H 2 O) to healthy shaved Swiss  mouse skin for 130 days. They reported that this led to a significant  increase in urine, serum, and whole brain aluminum, especially in the  hippocampus area, compared to control animals. They mentioned that this  percutaneous uptake and accumulation of aluminum in the brain was  greater than that caused by dietary exposure to 2.3 microg per day in  feed and water.     Anane et al. conducted in vitro and in vivo mouse skin studies and  showed for the first time that aluminum is absorbed through mouse skin  and this contributes to a greater body burden than does oral uptake.  They also mentioned that several antiperspirant preparations containing  AlCl 3 .6H 2 O are applied to sensitive regions of  the skin, which may increase penetration and could be an important  source of body aluminum burden. Anane et al. recommended that an  epidemiological study be conducted to ascertain whether use of  AlCl 3 .6H 2 O-containing antiperspirants correlates  with neurodegenerative disease, because such cannot be excluded based  on the results of their study.     Forbes and Agwani (Ref. 46) stated that there is uncertainty about  how aluminum-containing substances enter the body, but current  information suggests that the skin and/or the lung are important. They  mentioned that Priest (Ref. 39) noted that at least some antiperspirant  sprays contain aluminum compounds of a particle size of about 1  micrometer (micron) (micro), which is ideally sized for deposition in  the deep lung, and that such deposition may also be relevant for skin.     Salib and Hillier (Ref. 47) examined clinically diagnosed  Alzheimer's disease patients and controls (other dementias and  nondementias) and collected information to examine the association  between Alzheimer's disease and aluminum occupation. They reported that  manual work, such as welding, expected to be in direct contact with  aluminum dust and fumes does not appear to be significantly associated  with the risk of Alzheimer's disease. The authors concluded that no  significant association was shown between developing Alzheimer's  disease later in life and previous occupational history for all of the  occupations in the study. This included both manual workers, who would  be expected to have had a higher exposure opportunity to aluminum dust  and fumes, and other workers at an aluminum factory. The authors  concluded that neither Alzheimer's disease nor dementia in general were  shown to be associated with previous aluminum occupation.     Salib and Hillier (Ref. 47), in 1996, repeated Doll's (Ref. 48)  conclusions from 1993 that it is generally accepted that the delayed  effects of chronic aluminum exposure have not been adequately assessed  in man. Factors that govern the bioavailability, neurotoxicity, and the  effect of chronic low dose exposure to aluminum compounds remain  unclear. Flaten et al. (Ref. 49) stated that the lack of a readily  available radioactive isotope of aluminum has been a major obstacle  toward elucidating the mechanisms of absorption, distribution, and  excretion of the metal.     Both Doll (Ref. 48) and Salib and Hillier (Ref. 47) stated that the  possibility of a causal link between aluminum and Alzheimer's disease  must be kept open until uncertainty about neuropathological evidence is  resolved and the prognosis of humans exposed to aluminum by inhalation  is known. Flaten et al. (Ref. 49) stated that multidisciplinary  collaborative research efforts, involving scientists from many  different specialities, are needed, with emphasis placed on: (1)  Increasing knowledge of the chemistry of aluminum in biologic systems  and determining the cellular and molecular mechanisms of aluminum  toxicity, and (2) variations in neuropathology from long-term, low- level exposure to aluminum.     In summary, the literature shows that at high doses and long-term  industrial exposures, aluminum can be associated with recognizable,  specific neurologic effects. However, to date, the agency considers the  evidence insufficient to link aluminum to Alzheimer's disease,  Parkinson's disease, or ALS. Although aluminum uptake and transport by  a ``nasal-olfactory pathway'' has been suggested in a nonphysiologic  study in an animal model (Ref. 36), the agency is not aware of any  evidence in humans that supports an olfactory-neuronal transport of  aluminum to the brain.     One petition suggested that the agency require that 90 percent of  the particles of an aerosol aluminum antiperspirant be greater than 50  micro (currently the requirement is between 10 and 50 micro) to reduce  exposure to the upper respiratory tract. The agency notes that both  Priest (Ref. 39) and Forbes and Agwani (Ref. 46) discussed a particle  size of 1 micro for deposition in the deep lung. Based on current  knowledge (no proof in humans of an olfactory neuronal transport of  aluminum to the brain) and the lack of information on a minimum  particle size to affect the respiratory tract, the agency finds no  basis to impose a greater than 50micro requirement at this time. Flaten  et al. (Ref. 49) stated that the possible human toxicity of aluminum  has been a matter of controversy for well over 100 years. Despite many  investigators looking at this issue, the agency does not find data from  topical and inhalation chronic exposure animal and human studies  submitted to date sufficient to change the monograph status of aluminum  containing antiperspirants. The agency will continue to monitor the  scientific literature on aluminum and, if new information appears, will  reassess the status of aluminum-containing antiperspirants at such  time.     The agency acknowledges that small amounts of aluminum can be  absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and through the skin. Assuming  a person has normal renal function, accumulation of aluminum resulting  from usual exposures to antiperspirant drug products (application to  the underarms once or twice daily) and subsequent absorption is  considered minimal. However, people with renal dysfunction have an  impairment in normal renal excretion of aluminum.     Flaten et al. (Ref. 49) noted that the first human conditions  generally accepted to be causally related to aluminum exposure did not  occur until the 1970's, shortly after the introduction of routine  dialysis therapy in persons with chronic renal failure. Dialysis  encephalopathy was perhaps the first disease recognized in this  population (1972, 1976). Later, fracturing osteomalacia (1977, 1978)  and a microcytic hypochromic anemia (1980) were related to aluminum  exposure in dialysis patients. Flaten et al. indicated that aluminum  can cause encephalopathy, bone disease, and anemia in dialysis patients  resulting  [[Page 34286]]  from the introduction of aluminum directly into the blood stream via  high-aluminum dialysate or the consumption of large oral doses of  aluminum-containing phosphate binders. Reduced urine production (the  major route for aluminum excretion) contributes to this problem. The  authors noted that, in the early 1980's, reports began to appear  describing aluminum neurotoxicity and osteotoxicity in children with  renal failure who were not on dialysis treatment.     The agency is concerned that people with renal dysfunction may not  be aware that the daily use of antiperspirant drug products containing  aluminum may put them at a higher risk because of exposure to aluminum  in the product. The agency considers it prudent to alert these people  to consult a doctor before using or continuing to use these products on  a regular basis and is including a warning in the final monograph:  ``Ask a doctor before use if you have kidney disease.``     Flaten et al. (Ref. 49) mentioned several reports of aluminum  accumulation and toxicity in individuals without chronic renal failure,  especially preterm infants (primarily fed intravenously), and stated  that preterm infants are at risk for aluminum loading because of their  immature kidney function. Term infants with normal renal function may  also be at risk because of their rapidly growing and immature brain and  skeleton, and an immature blood-brain barrier. Until they are 1 to 2  years old, infants have lower glomerular filtration rates than adults,  which affects their kidney function. The agency is concerned that young  children and children with immature renal function are at a higher risk  resulting from any exposure to aluminum. Accordingly, the agency is  requiring both general warnings in Sec.  330.1(g) on all aluminum- containing antiperspirant drug products to inform parents and others to  keep these products away from children, and to seek professional  assistance if accidental ingestion occurs. (See also section II.B,  comment 7 of this document.)     (Comment 24) One comment submitted a research paper (Ref. 50)  containing the author's theories concerning how antiperspirants and  aluminum in these products may be associated with breast cancer: The  secretions of the apocrine sweat glands contain androgens, which are  blocked by the antiperspirant and thus caused to spread internally.  These androgens may be converted in the surrounding adipose tissues to  estrogens, and excess estrogens have been associated with an increase  in breast cancer. Alternatively, these excess androgens may interfere  with the normal functioning of the hypothalamic-pituitary axis, thereby  causing an imbalance of estrogen in the body. About 50 percent of  breast cancers occur in the upper outer quadrant of the breast, and  axillary sweat glands are anatomically very close to this site. A  protein marker called GCDFP-15 (Gross Cystic Disease Fluid Protein),  which is normally found only in the sweat glands, was found in the  fluids of many breast cysts. The author postulated that the blocked  axillary sweat glands would cause GCDFP-15 and other markers to migrate  to the breast due to its proximity and gravity, and because the fetal  precursors for apocrine sweat glands and mammary glands are the same,  these migrated protein markers may stimulate the breast and play a role  in the carcinogenic process.     The author also postulated that aluminum may play a role in the  development of breast cancer because calcification of breast tissues  (commonly seen in breast cancer) may be caused by a local electrolyte  imbalance induced by the absorbed aluminum. The author noted that  breast cancer in Japan was more than five times lower than in the  United States and postulated this has occurred because Japanese women,  especially the older population, do not use antiperspirants. The author  noted that the breast cancer rate is currently on the rise in Japan,  especially among young premenopausal women, and postulated that this is  occurring because the young Japanese generation has adopted the western  habit of using antiperspirants.     The agency finds these theories lack sufficient evidence. The  agency notes that the amount of androgens produced by the sweat glands  is relatively insignificant compared to normal physiologic amounts  produced by the adrenals and the gonads. The agency is not aware of any  studies that have shown an ``internal spread'' of androgens or that  establish that GCDFP-15 or other protein markers are carcinogenic in  humans.     The agency considers the author's views about a local electrolyte  imbalance by absorbed aluminum causing breast tissue calcification  inconsistent with knowledge about the calcification process. In  addition, there are many benign calcifications. Finally, many proposals  (e.g., diet, lifestyle changes) have been made as to why there is an  increased incidence of breast cancer among Japanese women. However,  there is no evidence to associate this increase with an increased use  of antiperspirants. Thus, the agency concludes that there is  insufficient evidence to support these theories.     (Comment 25) The agency previously assessed the carcinogenic  potential of aerosolized aluminum chlorhydrate antiperspirants in  comment 22 of the TFM (47 FR 36492 at 36498 and 36499). Primary lung  tumors, granulomatous lesions, and macrophagic activity were evaluated  in animal studies. No increase in lung tumors was seen in the low- and  mid-dose rats given doses at least 100 times greater than the expected  human exposure via aerosolized antiperspirants. Normal macrophage  response and pulmonary fibrosis were observed at higher doses with  chronic exposure. No increase in tumors was noted in guinea pigs or  hamsters at any dose levels in the studies. While the agency removed  aerosol antiperspirant products containing zirconium from the market  because of granuloma formation (August 16, 1977, 42 FR 41374), the  agency is not aware of data that indicate aluminum antiperspirants  cause foreign body granulomas or pulmonary tumors.  III. Agency Changes      1. It has been agency policy since April 3, 1989 (54 FR 13480 at  13486), that before any ingredient is included in a final OTC drug  monograph, it must have a compendial (USP-NF) monograph. Compendial  monographs include an ingredient's official name, chemical formula, and  analytical chemical tests to confirm the quality and purity of the  ingredient. These monographs establish public standards for the  strength, quality, purity, and packaging of ingredients and drug  products available in the United States. Eighteen of the 19  antiperspirant active ingredients that the agency proposed in Sec.   350.10 of the antiperspirant TFM (47 FR 36492 at 36504) currently have  compendial monographs. Nine of the official compendial names are the  same as those proposed in Sec.  350.10, while 10 of the names have  changed slightly. (See Table 1 of this document for the previous and  current ingredient names.)  [[Page 34287]]                   Table 1.--Antiperspirant Active Ingredients ------------------------------------------------------------------------      Name in Tentative Final Monograph              Current Name ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Aluminum chloride                           Same ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Aluminum chlorohydrate                      Same ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Aluminum chlorohydrex polyethylene glycol   Aluminum chlorohydrex  complex                                     polyethylene glycol ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Aluminum chlorohydrex propylene glycol      Aluminum chlorohydrex  complex.                                    propylene glycol ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Aluminum dichlorohydrate                    Same ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Aluminum dichlorohydrex polyethylene        Aluminum dichlorohydrex  glycol complex                              polyethylene glycol ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Aluminum dichlorohydrex propylene glycol    Aluminum dichlorohydrex  complex.                                    propylene glycol ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Aluminum sesquichlorohydrate                Same ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Aluminum sesquichlorohydrex polyethylene    Aluminum sesquichloro-hydrex  glycol complex                              polyethylene glycol ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Aluminum sesquichlorohydrex propylene       Aluminum sesquichloro-hydrex  glycol complex                              propylene glycol ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Aluminum sulfate buffered\1\                Same ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Aluminum zirconium octachlorohydrate        Same ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Aluminum zirconium octachlorohydrex         Aluminum zirconium  glycine complex                             octachlorohydrex gly ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Aluminum zirconium pentachlorohydrate       Same ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Aluminum zirconium pentachlorohydrex        Aluminum zirconium  glycine complex                             pentachlorohydrex gly ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Aluminum zirconium tetrachlorohydrate       Same ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Aluminum zirconium tetrachlorohydrex        Aluminum zirconium  glycine complex                             tetrachlorohydrex gly ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Aluminum zirconium trichlorohydrate         Same ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Aluminum zirconium trichlorohydrex glycine  Aluminum zirconium  complex                                     trichlorohydrex gly ------------------------------------------------------------------------ \1\ Aluminum sulfate buffered with sodium aluminum lactate.      The agency is including in Sec.  350.10 of this final monograph  those antiperspirant active ingredients that currently have a  compendial monograph. Only one active ingredient, aluminum sulfate  buffered, does not have a current or proposed compendial monograph.  While aluminum sulfate does have a compendial monograph, the buffer  component, sodium aluminum lactate, does not. This buffer ingredient  must also have a compendial monograph or there must be a compendial  monograph for aluminum sulfate buffered in order for aluminum sulfate  buffered to be included in the antiperspirant final monograph. At the  present time, this ingredient is being included in Sec.   310.545(a)(4)(ii) as a nonmonograph ingredient because the agency is  not aware of any pending compendial monograph being developed. Should a  compendial monograph eventually be developed, the agency will move this  ingredient from Sec.  310.545(a)(4)(ii) to Sec.  350.10.     2. The agency is revising the format for active ingredients in  Sec.  350.10 for consistency with recent monographs: The proposed chart  format is now a paragraph format listing ingredients in alphabetical  order. The amount of active ingredient is stated as ``up to ----------  percent'' instead of as ---------- percent or less concentration.'' The  information about calculating the concentration on an anhydrous basis  is moved to the preamble of Sec.  350.10. The preamble statement about  aluminum to chloride and/or aluminum to zirconium ratios is revised to  state: ``Where applicable, the ingredient must meet the aluminum to  chloride, aluminum to zirconium, and aluminum plus zirconium to  chloride atomic ratios described in the United States Pharmacopeia- National Formulary.'' The proposed ratio range table is not included in  the final monograph because this information is now included in the  USP-NF monographs for each active ingredient in Sec.  350.10, where  applicable.     3. The agency is expanding the indications proposed in Sec.   350.50(b) of the TFM to provide additional uses based on new  effectiveness data. The agency is also revising the uses format to make  it more concise.     Because the indications proposed in Sec.  350.50(b)(1), (b)(2), and  (b)(3) of the TFM are very similar, the agency is combining them as a  single indication with choices under Sec.  350.50(b)(1): [Select one of  the following: ``decreases,'' ``lessens,'' or ``reduces''] ``underarm''  [select one of the following: ``dampness,'' ``perspiration,''  ``sweat,'' ``sweating,'' or ``wetness'']. (See section II.B, comment 6  of this document.) The agency is adding a new additional indication in  Sec.  350.50(b)(2): ``also [select one of the following: `decreases,'  `lessens,' or `reduces'] underarm [select one of the following:  `dampness,' `perspiration,' `sweat,' `sweating,' or `wetness'] due to  stress''. (See section II.B, comment 6 and section II.C, comment 13 of  this document.) The agency is adding a new additional indication in  Sec.  350.50(b)(3): Select one of the following: [``all day  protection,'' ``lasts all day,'' ``lasts 24 hours,'' or ``24 hour  protection'']. (See section II.C, comment 12 of this document.) The  agency is adding a new additional  [[Page 34288]]  indication in Sec.  350.50(b)(4) that states ``extra effective''. This  claim applies to products that demonstrate 30 percent or more sweat  reduction using the guidelines for effectiveness testing of  antiperspirant drug products referred to in Sec.  350.60. (See section  II.C, comment 11 of this document.) The agency is adding a new  additional indication in Sec.  350.50(b)(5) for products that  demonstrate extra effectiveness sustained over a 24-hour period: These  products may state the claims in Sec. Sec.  350.50(b)(3) and (b)(4)  either individually or combined, e.g., ``24 hour extra effective  protection,'' ``all day extra effective protection,'' ``extra effective  protection lasts 24 hours,'' or ``extra effective protection lasts all  day''. (See section II.C, comment 12 of this document.)     4. The agency is revising the ``Do not apply * * *'' warning in  proposed Sec.  350.50(c)(1) to the new labeling format. The warning now  reads: ``Do not use on broken skin'' and ``Stop use if rash or  irritation occurs''.     5. The agency is including a warning to alert people with renal  dysfunction to consult a doctor before using antiperspirants containing  aluminum. The warning appears in the new labeling format and states:  ``Ask a doctor before use if you have kidney disease''. (See section  II.F, comment 23 of this document.)     6. The agency has revised the August 1982 Guidelines for  Effectiveness Testing. The revised guidelines (dated as of the date of  publication of this document) state that ``FDA recognizes that  alternate methods may be appropriate to qualify an antiperspirant drug  product as effective. These guidelines do not preclude the use of  alternate methods that provide scientifically valid results, subject to  FDA approval.'' (See section II.D, comment 15 of this document.)     The agency has revised parts of the test procedures section of the  guidelines to delete the requirement that the control formulation be  devoid of ``any'' antiperspirant activity. Therefore, the control  formulation no longer needs to be compared to no treatment. (See  section II.D, comment 17 of this document.) The agency has changed the  permitted relative humidity of the hotroom conditions from 35 to 40  percent to a range of 30 to 40 percent. (See section II.D, comment 16  of this document.) The agency has added a requirement for ``baseline  perspiration rate'' to assure that test subjects sweat adequately  during a hotroom test: ``Test subjects must produce at least 100  milligrams of sweat from the placebo control axilla in a 20-minute  collection in the controlled environment.'' (See comment 16 also.)     Because the final monograph contains 24-hour duration effectiveness  claims, the agency has revised section 4(a)(4) of the guidelines to  state: ``For claims of enhanced duration of effect, the test should be  conducted at least two times during the period of the claim, such as 1  hour and 24 hours after the last daily treatment for 24 hour claims.''  (See section II.C, comment 12 of this document.) Because the final  monograph contains ``extra-effective'' claims shown by standard  gravimetric testing to have a 30-percent or more reduction in sweat,  the agency has revised the guidelines to include a section on data  treatment to demonstrate, with high probability, at least 50 percent of  the target population will obtain a sweat reduction of at least 30  percent. (See section II.C, comment 11 of this document.)     The revised ``Guidelines for Effectiveness Testing of OTC  Antiperspirant Drug Products'' are now dated as of the date of  publication of this final rule and are on file in the Dockets  Management Branch (address above) and on FDA's Web site at  http://www.fda.gov/cder/otc/index.htm .  Persons wishing to obtain a copy of the  guidelines should submit a Freedom of Information (FOI) request in  writing to FDA's FOI Staff (HFI-35), 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, MD  20857. The agency has revised Sec.  350.60 to include this information  about the guidelines.  IV. Summary of Changes from the Proposed Rule      1. The agency is modifying the definition of an antiperspirant that  was proposed in Sec.  350.3 of the TFM to delete the phrase ``to the  underarm.'' (See section II.B, comment 2 of this document.)     2. The agency is revising the format for listing active ingredients  in Sec.  350.10. (See section III.2. of this document.)     3. The agency is expanding the indications for OTC antiperspirant  drug products based on new data that support these additional uses (see  section III.3. of this document) and is expanding the ``Guidelines for  Effectiveness Testing of OTC Antiperspirant Drug Products'' to address  some of these additional uses (see section III.6. of this document).  V. The Agency's Final Conclusions      The agency is issuing a final monograph establishing conditions  under which OTC antiperspirant drug products are generally recognized  as safe and effective and not misbranded; 18 ingredients listed in  Sec.  350.10 are a monograph condition. In the Federal Register of  November 7, 1990 (55 FR 46914), the agency published a final rule in  part 310 establishing that certain active ingredients that had been  under consideration in a number of OTC drug rulemaking proceedings were  not generally recognized as safe and effective. That final rule  included the antiperspirant ingredients aluminum bromohydrate, aluminum  chloride (alcoholic solutions), aluminum chloride (aqueous solution)  (aerosol only), aluminum sulfate, aluminum sulfate buffered (aerosol  only), potassium alum, and sodium aluminum chlorohydroxy lactate in  Sec.  310.545(a)(4), and was effective on May 7, 1991. In this final  rule, the agency is redesignating the text of paragraph (a)(4) as  paragraph (a)(4)(i), adding new paragraph (a)(4)(i) heading, and adding  new paragraph (a)(4)(ii) to contain aluminum sulfate buffered with  sodium aluminum lactate. Any drug product labeled, represented, or  promoted for use as an OTC antiperspirant drug that contains any of the  ingredients listed in Sec.  310.545(a)(4)(i) or (a)(4)(ii) or that is  not in conformance with the monograph (21 CFR part 350) may be  considered a new drug within the meaning of section 201(p) of the  Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act) (21 U.S.C. 321(p)) and  misbranded under section 502 of the act (21 U.S.C. 352). Such a drug  product can not be marketed for OTC antiperspirant use unless it is the  subject of an approved application under section 505 of the act (21  U.S.C. 355) and 21 CFR part 314. An appropriate citizen petition to  amend the monograph may also be submitted in accord with 21 CFR 10.30  and Sec.  330.10(a)(12)(i). Any OTC antiperspirant drug product  initially introduced or initially delivered for introduction into  interstate commerce after the effective date of the final rule for  Sec.  310.545(a)(4)(i) or after the compliance dates of this final rule  that is not in compliance with the regulations is subject to regulatory  action.     Mandating warnings in an OTC drug monograph does not require a  finding that any or all of the OTC drug products covered by the  monograph actually caused an adverse event, and FDA does not so find.  Nor does FDA's requirement of warnings repudiate the prior OTC drug  monographs and monograph rulemakings under which the affected drug  products have been lawfully marketed. Rather, as a consumer protection  agency, FDA has determined that warnings are necessary to ensure that  these OTC drug products continue  [[Page 34289]]  to be safe and effective for their labeled indications under ordinary  conditions of use as those terms are defined in the act. This judgment  balances the benefits of these drug products against their potential  risks (see Sec.  330.10(a)).     FDA's decision to act in this instance need not meet the standard  of proof required to prevail in a private tort action (Glastetter v.  Novartis Pharmaceuticals, Corp., 252 F.3d 986, 991 (8th Cir. 2001)). To  mandate warnings, or take similar regulatory action, FDA need not show,  nor do we allege, actual causation. For an expanded discussion of case  law supporting FDA's authority to require such warnings, see ``Labeling  of Diphenhydramine-Containing Drug Products for Over-the-Counter Human  Use, Final Rule'' (67 FR 72555, December 6, 2002).  VI. Analysis of Impacts      An analysis of the costs and benefits of this regulation, conducted  under Executive Order 12291, was discussed in the TFM for OTC  antiperspirant drug products (47 FR 36492 at 36503). The one comment  received is addressed in section II.A, comment 4 of this final rule and  further addressed later in this section.     FDA has examined the impacts of this final rule under Executive  Order 12866, the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601-612), and the  Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (2 U.S.C. 1501 et seq.). Executive  Order 12866 directs agencies to assess all costs and benefits of  available regulatory alternatives and, when regulation is necessary, to  select regulatory approaches that maximize net benefits (including  potential economic, environmental, public health and safety, and other  advantages; distributive impacts; and equity). Under the Regulatory  Flexibility Act, if a rule has a significant economic impact on a  substantial number of small entities, an agency must analyze regulatory  options that would minimize any significant impact of the rule on small  entities. Section 202(a) of the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995  requires that agencies prepare a written statement of anticipated costs  and benefits before proposing any rule that may result in an  expenditure in any one year by State, local, and tribal governments, in  the aggregate, or by the private sector, of $100 million (adjusted  annually for inflation). The proposed rule that has led to the  development of this final rule was published on August 20, 1982, before  the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 was enacted. This final rule  will not result in an expenditure in any one year by State, local, and  tribal governments, in the aggregate, or by the private sector, of $100  million.     The agency concludes that this final rule is consistent with the  principles set out in Executive Order 12866 and in these two statutes.  Additionally, the final rule is not a significant regulatory action as  defined by the Executive order. The Unfunded Mandates Reform Act does  not require FDA to prepare a statement of costs and benefits for this  final rule, because the final rule will not result in any 1-year  expenditure that would exceed $100 million adjusted for inflation. The  current inflation adjusted statutory threshold is about $110 million.     FDA has determined that this final rule will not have a significant  economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. While the  exact number of affected small entities is difficult to determine at  any given time, the agency received only one comment from a small  entity, which is discussed later in this section. This discussion  explains the agency's determination that this final rule will not have  a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small  entities.     The purpose of this final rule is to establish conditions under  which OTC antiperspirant drug products are generally recognized as safe  and effective and not misbranded. This includes establishing the  allowable monograph ingredients and labeling. Eighteen of the 19 active  ingredients under review are included in the final monograph. The  remaining ingredient could have been included had a USP-NF monograph  been developed for this ingredient. If a USP-NF monograph is developed  before the effective date of this final monograph, products containing  this ingredient could continue to be marketed without reformulation.  Without a USP-NF monograph for the ingredient, product reformulations  to include a monograph antiperspirant active ingredient or  discontinuation of the products will need to occur. The agency believes  that this one antiperspirant active ingredient is currently in only a  few products. Based on the large number of antiperspirant drug products  in the OTC marketplace and the vast array of products that one known  affected company currently markets, the agency considers the required  reformulation or discontinuation of a few products not to be overly  burdensome or substantial. The one known affected company markets at  least 30 products not affected by this final rule. Only one of its  products includes the active ingredient excluded under the final rule.  Any company using this active ingredient has the option to: (1)  Reformulate using any of the 18 active ingredients included in this  final rule, (2) reformulate without this active ingredient and market  the product as a deodorant, or (3) discontinue the product.     This final rule establishes the monograph labeling for OTC  antiperspirant drug products and will require relabeling of all  products covered by the monograph. The agency's Drug Listing System  identifies approximately 200 manufacturers and 700 marketers of 1,300  OTC antiperspirant drug products containing the 19 ingredients covered  by this final rule. It is likely that there are additional products  that are not currently included in the agency's system. While it is  difficult to determine an exact number, the agency estimates that about  1,500 OTC antiperspirant drug products will need to be relabeled based  on this final rule.     The agency has been informed that relabeling costs of the type  required by a final monograph generally average about $3,000 to $5,000  per stock keeping unit (SKU) (individual products, packages, and  sizes). However, some of the relabeling that occurs as a result of this  specific final monograph will be due to additional indications that the  agency has included in the final monograph and that manufacturers will  wish to add to their labeling. Assuming that there are about 1,300 to  1,500 affected OTC SKUs in the marketplace, total one-time costs of  relabeling would be $3.9 million ($3,000 per SKU x 1,300 SKUs) to $7.5  million ($5,000 per SKU x 1,500 SKUs). The agency believes that actual  costs will be lower for several reasons. First, many of the label  changes will be made by private label manufacturers that tend to use  relatively simple and less expensive labeling. Second, the agency has  finalized a revised labeling format for OTC drug products in Sec.   201.66. The agency is allowing manufacturers to incorporate the  labeling changes required by this final rule along with the new general  OTC drug labeling format. Thus, the relabeling costs resulting from two  different but related final rules will be individually reduced by  implementing both required changes at the same time.     Some relabeling costs will be further reduced because the agency is  allowing up to 18 months (24 months for products with annual sales less  than $25,000) for these revisions so they may be done in the normal  course of business. Thus, manufacturers who  [[Page 34290]]  wish to add additional indications included in this final monograph can  do so at their next regular printing of product labeling. Among the  steps the agency is taking to minimize the impact on small entities  are: (1) To provide enough time to enable entities to use up existing  labeling stock, and (2) to allow the labeling changes required by this  final monograph to be done concurrently with the changes required by  the new OTC drug labeling format. The agency believes that these  actions provide small entities substantial flexibility and reductions  in cost.     The agency considered but rejected several labeling alternatives:  (1) A shorter or longer implementation period, and (2) an exemption  from coverage for small entities. While the agency believes that  consumers would benefit from having this new labeling in place as soon  as possible, a longer time period would unnecessarily delay the benefit  of new labeling and a few revised formulations. Conversely, a shorter  time period was also considered but rejected because it would be  inflexible and more costly for the affected companies. The agency  rejected an exemption for small entities because the new labeling and  revised formulations, where applicable, are also needed by consumers  who purchase products marketed by those entities. However, a longer  (24-month) compliance date is being provided for products with annual  sales less than $25,000.     One small manufacturer has indicated that it will suffer economic  consequences because it will no longer be able to make claims for use  of its antiperspirant products on the hands, and for prosthesis and  orthotic use. However, the manufacturer did not provide sufficient data  to show that its products were safe and effective for these uses and  did not provide documentation to show the economic impact of this final  rule on its sales. The agency notes that the company could: (1) Relabel  its products to contain only the monograph indications and then remain  in the marketplace, or (2) discontinue its products. While revising the  product labeling may have an economic impact on a company, it will be  able to continue to market its products and can use the expanded  indications provided by the final monograph to try to enhance product  sales.     The final rule would not require any new reporting and  recordkeeping activities, and no additional professional skills are  needed. There are no other Federal rules that duplicate, overlap, or  conflict with the final rule.     For the reasons in this section and under the Regulatory  Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 605(b)), the agency certifies that this final  rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial  number of small entities. Therefore, under the Regulatory Flexibility  Act, no further analysis is required.  VII. Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995      FDA concludes that the labeling requirements in this document are  not subject to review by the Office of Management and Budget because  they do not constitute a ``collection of information'' under the  Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.). Rather, the  labeling statements are a ``public disclosure of information originally  supplied by the Federal government to the recipient for the purpose of  disclosure to the public'' (5 CFR 1320.3(c)(2)).  VIII. Environmental Impact      The agency has determined under 21 CFR 25.31(a) that this action is  of a type that does not individually or cumulatively have a significant  effect on the human environment. Therefore, neither an environmental  assessment nor an environmental impact statement is required.  IX. Federalism      FDA has analyzed this final rule in accordance with the principles  set forth in Executive Order 13132. FDA has determined that the rule  does not contain policies that have substantial direct effects on the  States, on the relationship between the National Government and the  States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the  various levels of government. Accordingly, the agency has concluded  that the rule does not contain policies that have federalism  implications as defined in the Executive order and, consequently, a  federalism summary impact statement is not required.  X. Section 369.20 Revision      Section 369.20 (21 CFR 369.20) contains a recommended warning and  caution statement for OTC antiperspirant drug products under the  heading ``ANTIPERSPIRANTS:'' ``Do not apply to broken skin. If a rash  develops, discontinue use.'' This statement is very similar to, but not  quite as extensive as, the warnings required by the final monograph:  ``Do not use on broken skin'' and ``Stop use if rash or irritation  occurs''. The agency is removing the entry for ``ANTIPERSPIRANTS''  under Sec.  369.20 because it is superseded by Sec. Sec.  350.50(c)(1)  and (c)(2).  XI.

General Comments         Comments by Sidney M. Wolfe, MD   Director, Public Citizens Health Research Group   On Federal Register Notice concerning Ephedra Alkaloids  Extension of Docket 95N-0304      Is the FDA Part of the Public Health Service or   The Ephedra Industry Survival Service?                   For an agency that promised, for months, that definitive action concerning ephedra alkaloids would be taken upon completion of the Rand review, the lack of definitive action in the March 7 Federal Register Notice represents a pitiful reminder of how beholden the Administration is to the death- and injury-dealing ephedra industry. First, asking the public to comment on whether the legal standard for banning ephedra alkaloids can be met; second, asking for comments on a warning label that, if read and adhered to would still predictably result in deaths and injuries since most of these adverse effects did not occur in those using higher doses or engaging in vigorous exercise; and, finally, asking for further evidence of the dangers of these products, are all delaying tactics that will guarantee further deaths and injuries in the interval between March 7 and the inevitable ban.     At the time of our September 2001 petition to the FDA to ban ephedra alkaloids (http://www.citizen.org/publications/release.cfm?ID=7053), there was already more than adequate evidence of unreasonable risk of harm when these products were used as recommended. Since then, other than what must be described as more of the same--additional deaths and disabling injuries that would not have occurred if there had been a ban 18 months ago--the legal standard continues to be met.      What follows is an explanation, based on medical and scientific articles published well before our petition and available to anyone at the FDA, about the relationship between ephedra alkaloids and arrhythmias.      In addition to well-documented cases of strokes, presumably related to the hypertension-inducing properties of ephedra, there have been a number of sudden deaths after using ephedra of young people with no history of cardiovascular problems, including some with structurally normal hearts at autopsy. The following example, which I have condensed from medical records and an autopsy report, exemplifies this problem:    A 37-year-old woman with no past medical history suddenly collapsed in April 2002. Since there was no abnormal autopsy finding, it was assumed that she died of a cardiac arrhythmia.  At autopsy, there was no evidence of a heart attack, atherosclerosis or arteriosclerosis. The pharmacologic findings consisted of non-lethal (therapeutic) levels of ephedrine and pseudoephedrine (both are components of herbal ephedra) in her blood. She was 53, 110 pounds and was using a natural herbal energizer/diet supplement for weight loss.    The existence of such cases warrants a brief discussion of the mechanism, involving stimulation of cardiac cyclic AMP (cAMP), whereby drugs like ephedra alkaloids can cause arrhythmias.     Early evidence of the role of increased cardiac cAMP levels in causing arrhythmias showed that the perfusion of cAMP into isolated rat hearts decreased the threshold for ventricular fibrillation and that further lowering of the threshold occurred with the administration of a phosphodiesterase inhibitor, theophylline, which, like caffeine, increases tissue cAMP by inhibiting its breakdown.  By 1980, experiments with intact pig hearts found that the infusion of beta adrenergic stimulants such as adrenaline or isoproterenol, which increase cardiac cAMP levels, may play an important role in the initiation or perpetuation of ventricular tachycardia and that the combination of such drugs and cAMP and calcium ions may act via a common pathway to induce pacemaking activity [that can initiate ventricular arrhythmias] in the intact ventricular myocardium.  Subsequent human studies established that people with structurally normal hearts can experience exercise-induced ventricular tachycardia triggered by increased cAMP levels and that this can be stopped or prevented with beta blocking drugs that inhibit accumulation of cAMP.   All of this is quite consistent with the arrhythmia-provoking properties of ephedra alkaloids.    The dangers of these products, combined with the attractiveness of products that allegedly improve fitness and strength, have led to a number of deaths and serious damage in people in the armed services. According to Navy Surgeon General Richard Nelson, All three military services have documented medical cases where significant adverse events and deaths have occurred among active duty service members taking certain dietary supplements, specifically preparations containing ephedrine alkaloids. This led to a Navy ban of the sale of ephedrine-containing dietary supplements from stores at Pearl Harbor and the Marine base at Kaneohe Bay. As the administration is aware, last August (2002) their sale was also banned in Army and Air Force commissaries and PXs  following reports of more than 30 deaths in active duty military personnel using these products.

There continue to be serious questions about the risks surrounding this particular dietary supplement.    Today's Actions   HHS announced a series of actions designed to protect Americans from potentially serious risks of dietary supplement products containing ephedra and cautioned about the use of such products, especially under conditions of strenuous exercise and in combination with other stimulants, including caffeine.    What action is HHS taking?      Seeking rapid public comment on the new evidence on health risks associated with ephedra to establish an up-to-date record as quickly as possible to support new restrictions on ephedra-containing products.      Seeking rapid public comment on whether the currently available evidence and medical literature present a ""significant or unreasonable risk of illness or injury"" from dietary supplements containing ephedra.      Seeking rapid comment on a strong new warning label on any ephedra products that continue to be marketed.      Immediately executing a series of actions against ephedra products making unsubstantiated claims about sports performance enhancement.      In seeking the 30-day public comment period, FDA is reopening a proposed rule entitled ""Dietary Supplements Containing Ephedrine Alkaloids,"" which would have required a warning statement for these products, as well as restrictions on their potency and composition. FDA later withdrew parts of this proposed rule because of concerns about the specific scientific evidence, expressed by the General Accounting Office.        Why are we taking these steps?      There continue to be serious questions about the risks surrounding ephedra, and we therefore caution all Americans about using dietary supplements containing ephedra.      Although the overall evidence suggests that serious adverse events from ephedra appear to be infrequent, we know that such events can be very serious and possibly fatal.      We believe that the current scientific evidence strongly suggests that at least some ephedra products may present an unreasonable risk.      We are particularly concerned about the risks of using products containing ephedra during heavy workouts, with caffeine and other stimulants, in a diet program that stresses the cardiovascular system, or by people under the age of 18.        What evidence is there that ephedra may be harmful?      A RAND Corporation study commissioned by NIH concluded ephedra is associated with higher risks of mild to moderate side effects such as heart palpitations, psychiatric and upper gastrointestinal effects, and symptoms of autonomic hyperactivity such as tremor and insomnia, especially when taken with other stimulants.      The RAND review of 16,000 adverse event reports revealed two deaths, four heart attacks, nine strokes, one seizure, and five psychiatric cases involving ephedra in which the records appeared thorough and no other contributing factors were identified. RAND called such cases ""sentinel events,"" because they may indicate a safety problem but do not prove that ephedra caused the adverse event.        A study published this month in the  Annals of Internal Medicine  found that although ephedra products make up less than 1 percent of all dietary supplement sales, these products account for 64 percent of adverse events associated with dietary supplements.      A study published in the journal  Neurology  concluded that the rate of hemorrhagic (bleeding) strokes among ephedra users was statistically significantly higher than among non-users, for people who take doses above 32 milligrams a day. Many ephedra dietary supplement labels recommend that users take up to approximately 100 mg of ephedra daily.       Background on ephedra      Ephedra is a naturally occurring substance derived from the Chinese herbal Ma Huang. While products containing natural ephedrine alkaloids have long been used to treat certain respiratory symptoms in traditional Chinese medicine, in recent years they been extensively promoted and used with the goals of aiding weight loss, enhancing sports performance, and increasing energy.     Background on the law      FDA does not review dietary supplements for safety and effectiveness before they are marketed under the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994.      The law allows FDA to prohibit sale of a dietary supplement if it ""presents a significant or unreasonable risk of injury.""      This legal standard of ""significant or unreasonable risk"" implies a risk-benefit calculation based on the best available scientific evidence.      It strongly suggests that the FDA must determine if a product's known or supposed risks outweigh any known or suspected benefits, based on the available scientific evidence, in light of the claims the product makes and in light of the product's being sold directly to consumers without medical supervision.       What is next?      Once the comment 30-day period has ended, FDA will analyze the comments and publish its conclusions about the most appropriate approach to reducing the risk of using dietary supplement products containing ephedrine alkaloids.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:  DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES Food and Drug Administration 21 CFR Part 111 [Docket No. 95N0304] RIN 0901AA59  Dietary Supplements Containing Ephedrine Alkaloids AGENCY  : Food and Drug Administration,  HHS. ACTION  : Proposed rule.  SUMMARY: The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is proposing to make a finding, which will have the force and effect of law, that a dietary supplement is adulterated if it contains 8 milligrams (mg) or more of ephedrine alkaloids per serving, or if its labeling suggests or recommends conditions of use that would result in intake of 8 mg or more in a 6-hour period or a total daily intake of 24 mg or more of ephedrine alkaloids; require that the label of dietary supplements that contain ephedrine alkaloids state ``Do not use this product for more than 7 days''; prohibit the use of ephedrine alkaloids with ingredients, or with ingredients that contain substances, that have a known stimulant effect (e.g., sources of caffeine or yohimbine), which may interact with ephedrine alkaloids; prohibit labeling claims that require long-term intake to achieve the purported effect (e.g., weight loss and body building); require a statement in conjunction with claims that encourage short-term excessive intake to enhance the purported effect (e.g., energy) that ``Taking more than the recommended serving may result in heart attack, stroke, seizure or death''; and require specific warning statements to appear on product labels. FDA is proposing these actions in response to serious illnesses and injuries, including multiple deaths, associated with the use of dietary supplement products that contain ephedrine alkaloids and the  I. Background A. Characteristics of Ephedrine Alkaloids Dietary supplements containing ephedrine alkaloids are widely sold in  the United States (Refs. 1 through 3). The ingredient sources of the ephedrine alkaloids include raw botanicals and extracts from botanical sources. Ma huang, Ephedra, Chinese Ephedra, and epitonin are several names used for botanical products, primarily from Ephedra sinica Stapf, E. equistestina Bunge, E. intermedia var. tibetica Stapf and E. distachya L. (the Ephedras), that are sources of ephedrine alkaloids. These alkaloids, ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, norpseudoephedrine, norephedrine, methylephedrine, methylpseudoephedrine, and related alkaloids, are naturally occurring chemical stimulants (Refs. 4 through 8). Although the proportions of the various ephedrine alkaloids in botanical species vary from one species to another, in most species used commercially, ephedrine is the most predominant alkaloid. The ephedrine and related alkaloids are amphetamine-like compounds. They exhibit some common types of effects but vary in the relative intensity of these effects (Table 1) (Refs. 5, 6, and 9 through 15). For example, ephedrine is a cardiovascular system (CVS) and nervous system (NS) stimulant. Pseudoephedrine has some CVS and NS stimulatory effects but is less potent than ephedrine. Norephedrine (also called phenylpropanolamine) is similar to ephedrine in its NS stimulant effects but has fewer CVS stimulant effects than ephedrine (Refs. 12 and 16 through 18). Although norephedrine is often a minor ephedrine alkaloid constituent, in humans it can be produced from ingested ephedrine through normal metabolic processes (Refs. 9, 19, and 20). Thus, its presence in body tissues and fluids may be detected, and its physiological effects can occur, even if norephedrine is not contained in meaningful amounts in the original supplement product. Data on the other ephedrine alkaloids and related alkaloids are limited, and thus their physiological and pharmacological effects are largely unknown (Ref. 15).

B. The Availability of Ephedrine Alkaloids To determine the types of ephedrine alkaloid-containing dietary supplements available in the marketplace, the agency has collected over 125 dietary supplement products labeled as containing a known source of ephedrine alkaloids during the past 2 years (Refs. 1 and 2). These products show that ephedrine alkaloid-containing-dietary supplements are marketed in a variety of forms, including capsules, tablets, powders, and liquids. The source of the ephedrine alkaloids in these supplements vary from the raw botanical to powdered plant material and concentrated extracts; however, most of the products contain concentrated extracts. Although FDA is aware that some companies have changed their labeling and formulation since the market review, this review of the marketplace reflects the general contours of products currently sold in the United States. Ephedrine alkaloids are present in some products as a single ingredient, but more commonly, they are combined with other ingredients, including vitamins, minerals, amino acids, and other botanicals (Refs. 1, 2, and 21). Most of the dietary supplements that contain an ingredient source of the ephedrine alkaloids also contain between 6 and 20 other ingredients. Some of these other ingredients have known or suspected physiological and pharmacological activities that have the potential for interacting with the ephedrine alkaloids so as to increase their effects. For example, the majority of dietary supplements containing ephedrine alkaloids also contain a source of xanthine alkaloids (e.g., caffeine), another stimulant substance that is known to increase the effects of ephedrine alkaloids (Refs. 7, 16, 22, and 23). Because product labels do not usually provide information on product composition (Ref. 24), and there are no data bases containing such data, FDA laboratories analyzed the products collected to quantify the levels of ephedrine alkaloids (Refs. 1, 2, 21, and  25). Results of the analyses show that these products, taking into account the labeled recommended serving instructions, are likely to provide intakes of ephedrine alkaloids that range from below the detectible limits of FDA's analytical method to 110 mg per serving (i.e., per single use) (Refs. 1, 2, 21, 25, and 26). Most of the products, regardless of their promoted use, had ephedrine alkaloid levels at or above 10 mg per serving. Many of the dietary supplement products that FDA collected were promoted for uses such as weight loss, body building, increased energy, increased mental concentration, increased sexual sensations, or euphoria or as alternatives to illicit street drugs (Refs. 1, 2, and 25). The majority of the products collected also bore warning statements on their labels (Refs. 1, 2, and 27). The warning statements varied from general precautions, suggesting that the consumer check with a health care professional before beginning any diet or exercise program, to more specific warning statements. The more specific warning statements contained several elements, including cautions that the consumer not use the product if they have certain diseases or health conditions or are using certain drugs, and to stop the use of the product if they develop certain symptoms (Refs. 1, 2, 25, and 27). C. Adverse Events Associated With Ephedrine Alkaloids Since 1993, FDA has received more than 800 reports of illnesses and injuries (AER's) associated with the use of more than 100 different dietary supplement products that contained, or were suspected to contain, ephedrine alkaloids. These adverse events tended to involve CVS effects and NS effects. FDA evaluated the AER's showing CVS and NS effects and found that the single most common element was that the products contained, or were thought to contain, a source of ephedrine alkaloids. Approximately 50 to 60 percent of the AER's associated with use of dietary supplements were for such products.  The AER's associated with the ephedrine alkaloid-containing products included consistent patterns of signs and symptoms among both otherwise healthy individuals and those with underlying diseases or conditions. These signs and symptoms included rapid and irregular heart rhythms, increased blood pressure, chest pain, anxiety, nervousness, tremor, hyperactivity, and insomnia (i.e., inability or difficulty in sleeping) and were associated with clinically significant conditions, including heart attack, stroke, psychoses, seizure, and, in a few cases, death. Many of these signs and symptoms occurred in young adults who generally would not have been expected to be at high risk for such conditions (e.g., heart attack and stroke). Many adverse events were reported to occur with the first use or within the first 2 weeks of use. Although the majority occurred in women, men also reported experiencing adverse events. The nature and patterns of these AER's are consistent with the known physiological and pharmacological effects of ephedrine alkaloids as described in: (1) Pharmacology texts for single ephedrine alkaloid products, (2) case reports of adverse effects from the scientific literature related to the pharmaceutical use of ephedrine alkaloids, (3) adverse events reported in controlled clinical trials using ephedrine in the treatment of obesity, and (4) known safety concerns with traditional medical uses of botanicals that contain ephedrine alkaloids. As a result, FDA focused its investigation on ephedrine alkaloids as a likely factor in the rapidly increasing number of serious AER's associated with the use of dietary supplement products. D. Review Activities The growing number and consistency of reports of serious adverse events associated with a wide variety of ephedrine alkaloid-containing dietary supplements, and the virtual absence of publicly available safety data on these supplements, prompted FDA to convene an ad hoc Working Group of its Food   30680  Federal Register / Vol. 62, No. 107 / Wednesday, June 4, 1997 / Proposed Rules 2. The Food Advisory Committee Meeting In the 6 months that followed the Working Group meeting, the number of reports of adverse events associated with the use of dietary supplements thought to contain ephedrine alkaloids doubled. In addition, FDA received information on two deaths of young adult males in which the medical examiners specifically attributed the cause of death to use of ephedrine alkaloid-containing dietary supplements (see medical examiners' reports in Adverse Reaction Monitoring System (ARMS) No. 10862 and 11134). FDA analyzed samples of products that consumers claimed that they had consumed and suffered an adverse event and found that the ephedrine alkaloid levels in many of these products were below the 25-mg limit suggested by certain members of the Working Group. In light of the rapidly increasing numbers of adverse events as well as of the new analytical information on AERrelated intakes of ephedrine alkaloids, FDA recognized that a determination on how to deal with dietary supplements that contained these substances could not be further delayed. Thus, FDA convened its Food Advisory Committee in conjunction with the Working Group to review and provide final recommendations on what to do with ephedrine alkaloid-containing dietary supplements. The Food Advisory Committee met on August 27 and 28, 1996. The meeting included all members from the Working Group who were available to attend the meeting, as well as additional experts to replace those experts unable to attend or to fill out the range of expertise needed to appropriately evaluate the subject. FDA asked the Food Advisory Committee to consider the safety of using dietary supplements containing ephedrine alkaloids and to make specific recommendations on how to resolve the public health concerns surrounding their use (Ref. 25). The Food Advisory Committee reviewed the evidence that had been presented to the Working Group as well as new data and information that had become available since the October 1995 Working Group meeting. Following a review of the totality of the available evidence, the October 1995 recommendations of the Working Group, public comments, and considerable discussion, the Food Advisory Committee agreed that FDA should take action to address the rapidly evolving and serious public health concerns associated with the use of ephedrine alkaloid-containing dietary supplements (Ref. 25). The Food Advisory Committee could not, however, come to consensus on a specific approach to the public health concerns. Over half of the Food Advisory Committee members stated that, based on the available data, no safe level of ephedrine alkaloids could be identified for use in dietary supplements (Ref. 25). Many of these members expressed concern that many individuals who would be at risk if they were to use products were unaware of that risk because many of the conditions that increase the risk of adverse events may not be self-evident (Ref. 25). Consequently, they recommended removing dietary supplements containing ephedrine alkaloids from the market (Ref. 25). Other members of the Food Advisory Committee suggested that the agency establish conditions of use that would reduce the risk of adverse events, including establishing ``reasonably'' safe per serving and daily use levels for both ephedrine alkaloids and ephedrine as well as other requirements (Ref. 25). II. FDA's Response Following the August 1996 meeting of the Food Advisory Committee, the agency completed its review of the majority of the AER's associated with these products and reviewed the discussions and the recommendations of the Food Advisory Committee, the scientific literature, the views expressed in public comments, and other data. Based on this information, the agency has tentatively concluded that use of ephedrine alkaloids raises important public health concerns, that the risks these substances create are potentially very serious, and that action must be taken to protect the public health. A. Summary of Initial Considerations Between 1993 and 1996, FDA received a rapidly escalating number of AER's associated with the use of dietary supplements, some that contained ephedrine alkaloids, some that did not (Refs. 32 through 34). Figure 1 shows that in the 3 years since the initiation of an adverse event monitoring system for special nutritional products, the number of AER's received by the agency on dietary supplements has quadrupled. BILLING CODE 416001P  Advisory Committee (the Working Group) (Refs. 27 through 29). 1. The Food Advisory Committee Working Group Meeting on Dietary Supplements Containing Ephedrine Alkaloids On October 11 and 12, 1995, the Working Group, which consisted of medical and other scientific experts from outside FDA as well as industry and consumer representatives, considered the potential public health problems associated with the use of dietary supplements and other food products containing ephedrine alkaloids. The Working Group reviewed the evidence on the occurrence of adverse events associated with the use of ephedrine alkaloids. This evidence included the known pharmacology of ephedrine alkaloids, numerous case reports published in the scientific literature, and published findings from clinical studies investigating the use of ephedrine in the treatment of obesity (Ref. 30). The evidence also included over 325 AER's that had been received by FDA that were associated with the consumption of dietary supplements known to contain, or suspected of containing, ephedrine alkaloids (Refs. 29 and 31). The Working Group also considered public comments made during the meeting (Ref. 27). Following their review of this evidence, the members of the Working Group agreed that the use of certain dietary supplements containing ephedrine alkaloids may cause consumers to experience serious adverse events. On this basis, the Working Group recommended that FDA: (1) Establish single serving and daily total use limits for ephedrine and total ephedrine alkaloids; (2) require warning or cautionary statements on the labels of these products; and (3) establish good manufacturing practice (GMP) requirements, including proper botanical identification and standardization of the ephedrine alkaloid and ephedrine content in concentrated extracts. Several members of the Working Group suggested that ephedrine alkaloids be limited to 25 mg per single serving and 100 mg total daily use. Other members suggested a variety of lower levels of ephedrine alkaloids per serving. The Working Group also discussed specific warning label statements but failed to agree on the wording of the warning statements.   Federal Register / Vol. 62, No. 107 / Wednesday, June 4, 1997 / Proposed Rules  30681  BILLING CODE 416001C   30682  Federal Register / Vol. 62, No. 107 / Wednesday, June 4, 1997 / Proposed Rules to the age and gender of individuals experiencing an adverse event). When FDA examined the products reported to be associated with the CVS and NS effects, the most common element among them was that they involved products that contained or were believed to contain an ingredient source of ephedrine alkaloids. Thus, FDA focused its investigation on the ephedrine alkaloids in dietary supplement products. BILLING CODE 416001P  Many of these reports have been for clinically significant events (e.g., heart attack, stroke, seizures) that were observed most often in young adults for whom the risk of these types of events are generally low (see Figure 2, which summarizes data from the AER's relative  BILLING CODE 416001C  However, many of the ephedrine alkaloid-containing products also contained other ingredients (e.g., amino acids, vitamins and minerals, other botanicals) whose possible influence on the observed AER's could not be ignored. Upon examination of the types of other ingredients, FDA tentatively concluded that these other ingredients should not be the primary focus of its evaluation because these ingredients, unlike the ephedrine alkaloids, did not have a history (in the amounts likely to be found in dietary supplements) of being able to produce the types of serious adverse events being observed. For example, many ephedrine alkaloidcontaining dietary supplements also contain known stimulants (e.g., sources of caffeine). While caffeine is known to stimulate the NS, in the amounts likely to be found in dietary supplements it is not expected to produce effects such as stroke, heart attack, and seizure.  Nonetheless, FDA remained aware of the possibility that other ingredients in these dietary supplement products contributed to the adverse events reported. For example, other stimulants in the ephedrine-containing dietary supplements could enhance the known stimulant effects of ephedrine alkaloids. Likewise, substances that affect kidney function (e.g., sources of salicin, concentrated amino acids) could influence the body's ability to ``clear'' or rid itself of ingested ephedrine alkaloids. The agency also considered in its evaluation the fact that botanical sources contain mixtures of ephedrine alkaloids that may have slightly different effects (e.g., additive or interactive effects) than those from a single ephedrine alkaloid, as found in over-the-counter (OTC) products. The agency compared the observed effects of supplement products with the known  physiological and pharmacological effects of single sources of the alkaloids that are used as ingredients in several drugs (e.g., ephedrine in OTC bronchodilator products, pseudoephedrine in cough and cold preparations, and phenylpropanolamine in anoretic products). However, the agency was not able to find definitive evidence to evaluate whether ephedrine alkaloids from botanical sources are metabolized differently than those from pharmaceutical sources, and in the absence of more directly relevant data for dietary supplement products, the agency considered it appropriate to rely on evidence from pharmaceutical sources of single ephedrine alkaloids in assessing the effects of botanical sources (see section II.C.2. of this document). B. FDA's Strategy for Evaluation FDA considered five questions in evaluating the reports of adverse events involving ephedrine alkaloids that it   Federal Register / Vol. 62, No. 107 / Wednesday, June 4, 1997 / Proposed Rules had received. These questions were designed to help the agency discern relationships among AER's where direct and readily interpretable clinical studies were not available, and where multiple host or product factors may have affected any association (Refs. 35 through 37). The questions focused the evaluation on whether there was a likely association between the ephedrine alkaloids and the adverse events that had been reported and on the strength, nature, and biological plausibility of any association. These questions were: (1) Using the AER's on marketed ephedrine alkaloid-containing dietary supplements from FDA's passive surveillance system, are there consistent patterns of signs and symptoms associated with the use of a number of different ephedrine alkaloid-containing dietary supplement products? (2) Are the patterns of the signs and symptoms consistent with the available scientific evidence and known physiologic and pharmacologic effects of ephedrine alkaloids? (3) Is there sufficient evidence that the relationships are temporally correct, that is, does exposure occur temporally before the onset of the observed patterns of signs and symptoms? (4) Is there other evidence of causality, even in the absence of controlled trials, e.g., evidence of dechallenge (improvement or resolution of the signs and symptoms when use of the product is discontinued) or positive rechallenge (reoccurrence of the signs and symptoms when reexposed to ephedrine alkaloids)? (5) Considering the totality of the available information, is there a biologically plausible explanation for the adverse events? Finally, in fully evaluating the public health concerns associated with these products, the agency evaluated the potential impact of other factors that could influence final decisions on the best approach to addressing the public health concerns. C. Evaluation and Tentative Conclusions of the Agency 1. Using the AER's From FDA's Passive Surveillance System for Dietary Supplements, FDA Has Tentatively Concluded That There Are Consistent Patterns of Signs and Symptoms Associated With the Use of a Number of Different Ephedrine AlkaloidContaining Dietary Supplement Products In preparation for its August 27 and 28, 1996, Food Advisory Meeting, FDA reviewed each of the approximately 600 AER's that it had received before June 7, 1996 (Refs. 31 and 38). The adverse events associated with ephedrine alkaloid-containing dietary supplement products ranged from those with clinically serious sequelae (such as abnormal heart rhythms, chest pain, heart attack, stroke, significant elevations in blood pressure, seizure, hepatitis, coma, psychosis, and death) to those with less clinically significant signs and symptoms (such as nervousness, dizziness, tremor, minor alterations in blood pressure or heart rate, headache, and gastrointestinal distress) (see Table 1). Although many of the AER's crossed clinical categories, approximately 15 percent of the reports described serious cardiovascular effects, including abnormal heart rhythms, stroke, heart attack, and cardiomyopathy (disease of the heart muscle). Approximately 16 percent of the reports mentioned serious NS effects, including seizure, psychosis, mania, severe depression, vestibular (inner ear) disturbances, and loss of consciousness. Other clinically serious or potentially serious adverse effects reported to be associated with the use of these products included elevations of liver function tests or overt hepatitis (4 percent), myopathies (disease of muscle, particularly skeletal muscle) (3 percent), disturbances of the genitourinary system (e.g., urinary retention, urinary infection, prostatitis (inflammation of the prostate gland), and epididymitis (inflammation of the epididymis, part of the male genitourinary tract)) (3 percent), and dermatologic manifestations (including systemic rashes which appear to be immune mediated or allergic in nature) (6 percent). Approximately 30 percent of the reports mentioned other effects, including gastrointestinal distress, abnormal blood sugar levels or diabetes, blood disorders (including increased bleeding tendencies and abnormal blood cell counts), thyroid disorders, and addiction to the product. Finally, approximately 60 percent of the adverse events were characterized by general stimulant effects on the CVS and NS of a ``less clinically serious'' nature, including anxiety, nervousness, hyperactivity, tremor, insomnia, and altered heart rate or rhythms. However, FDA recognized that these reports of less clinically significant effects could be indicative of early warnings of serious cardiovascular or nervous system risks if product use were to continue. Serious adverse events were reported for a number of different products promoted for a variety of uses and marketed in a variety of formulations  30683  (Refs. 27, 31, and 38). Of these, where there was sufficient information to evaluate how the product was marketed or used, approximately 92 percent of the adverse events were related to the use of products marketed for weight loss and energy purposes, and 5 percent were related to products promoted for enhancing athletic performance or body building, although there was overlap among these uses. Approximately 2 percent of the adverse events were related to products marketed as alternatives to illicit street drugs or for euphoric purposes. (This distribution of types of products parallels the observations made from FDA's market review, which found that most of the dietary supplements containing ephedrine alkaloids bear weight loss and energy claims on their labels or in their labeling (Refs. 1 and 2).) Moreover, specific types of adverse events did not appear to be limited to products promoted for any single use, such as weight loss, energy, or euphoria. The adverse events were reported to occur in both healthy individuals and in individuals with underlying diseases or conditions that may have influenced the frequency, pattern, or severity of the adverse event (Refs. 25, 27, 31, and 38). Of great concern to the agency are the heart attacks, strokes, seizures, and other clinically serious illnesses and injuries reported to occur in young adults (Figure 2). In approximately 56 percent of the reported adverse events, the injured party was less than 40 years of age, and approximately 25 percent of injuries occurred in those between 40 and 49 years of age. Generally, significant CVS or NS risk factors are not expected in these age groups. Almost 75 percent of the adverse events were reported to occur in females, often using products promoted for weight loss. The higher frequency of adverse events in women most likely reflects a difference in product use (i.e., women predominantly use products marketed for weight loss and energy purposes). However, gender predominance in these ratios may also occur because of genderrelated differences in metabolism of ephedrine alkaloids, or gender-related differences in the numbers and types of tissue receptors interacting with ephedrine alkaloids (Refs. 39 through 41). Data on duration of use of ephedrine alkaloid-containing dietary supplements relative to the occurrence of AER's can also be used to examine the similarity of patterns of adverse events across different types of exposures and individual sensitivities. Figure 3 summarizes the duration of use data collected from the AER's associated   30684  Federal Register / Vol. 62, No. 107 / Wednesday, June 4, 1997 / Proposed Rules dietary supplement (Ref. 38) (see ARMS No. 10009 and 11619 in the Appendix to this document) and, in a few cases, on the initial use (Ref. 38) (ARMS No. 11401 in the Appendix to this document). Of equal concern to the agency are reports of serious adverse events occurring within a relatively short time period after consumers began to use the products or consumers began to start using the products after having stopped use for a period of time (ARMS No. 11076 in the Appendix to this document). BILLING CODE 416001P  with products containing ephedrine alkaloids. As shown in Figure 3, this information reveals that about 59 percent of the adverse events were reported to occur within 4 weeks of starting to use the product. About 14 percent of the reported adverse events occurred on the first day of using the  BILLING CODE 416001C  Adverse events appear to reflect different inherent types of individual sensitivities relative to dose levels, frequency or duration of use, and subsequent results of sympathomimetic stimulation. In some cases, particular events appear to occur as the result of increased individual susceptibility to the effects of sympathetic stimulation (Refs. 39 through 42). For example, in one report (ARMS No. 10862 in the Appendix to this document), three young adult males consumed similar amounts of a dietary supplement containing ephedrine alkaloids, yet only one male experienced serious adverse effects, which resulted in his death (see Police and Medical Examiner's Reports in ARMS No. 10862 in public docket number 95N0304). This report is illustrative of numerous AER's  suggesting an unpredictable pattern and severity of adverse events when consuming ephedrine alkaloidcontaining dietary supplements, even when used according to package directions or under ordinary conditions of use. In other cases, some of the adverse events were associated with consumption of relatively low levels of ephedrine alkaloids (e.g., approximately 10 mg or less total ephedrine alkaloids per serving), some occurring shortly after onset of use. These variations in the occurrence of adverse events relative to duration, frequency, and levels of exposure are suggestive that multiple factors influence sensitivity to ephedrine alkaloid intakes and could be indicative that some of the adverse effects are the result of increased individual  susceptibility to the acute or chronic effects of ephedrine alkaloids. In summary, in reviewing the AER's associated with ephedrine alkaloidcontaining dietary supplements, the agency noted a consistency of signs and symptoms across a large number of products, across a range of products with a variety of intended uses, across products with many different formulations, and across a heterogeneous group of individuals with respect to gender, age, and health condition. Generally, the overall pattern of observed results was consistent with stimulant CVS and NS effects, even though not every product showed the same effect or the same seriousness of effect, not every case involved CVS or NS effects, and not all reports were complete or uncomplicated. The patterns of duration of use and dosage   Federal Register / Vol. 62, No. 107 / Wednesday, June 4, 1997 / Proposed Rules levels suggest patterns of adverse events that are influenced by variations in individual sensitivities. Overall, however, there was a remarkable consistency in the types of signs and symptoms of adverse effects reported. This consistency was recognized by the Working Group (Ref. 27). The foregoing discussion summarizes the AER's from a descriptive statistical perspective. Many of these reports are summarized in the Appendix to this document. An abbreviated description of all reports is in public docket number 95N0304. A few examples of experiences of particular individuals are given below. ARMS No. 11134--A 23-year-old male college student used an ephedrine alkaloid-containing ergogenic product for approximately 2 years, along with several other dietary supplement products. He was previously healthy and was known to have a healthy life style. He was found dead by his sister in the apartment that they shared. The Medical Examiner's report stated that the cause of death was due to ``patchy myocardial necrosis associated with ephedrine toxicity from protein drink containing Ma huang extract.'' ARMS No. 9552--A 35-year-old female, who was on no medications and who had a negative past medical history, developed a non-Q wave myocardial infarction (heart attack) while using an ephedrine alkaloidcontaining dietary supplement within the dosage recommended on the label. She used the product for approximately 30 days, stopped for 1 week while on vacation, and then reinitiated the use of the product. About 11 days after restarting the product, she developed acute throbbing, anterior chest pain at rest, with radiation to the left shoulder, numbness of the left arm and hand, diaphoresis (sweating), and shortness of breath. In the hospital, clinical evaluations (electrocardiogram and cardiac enzymes) indicated an acute non-Q wave myocardial infarction, thought to be secondary to coronary artery spasm. Cardiac catheterization showed normal coronary arteries. ARMS No. 10009--A 35-year-old male took an ephedrine alkaloidcontaining dietary supplement (2 capsules at noon, 3 capsules at 4:30 pm). He worked out from 5:30 to 6:30 pm, developing chest pain at 7:30 pm. He was admitted to the hospital with an acute myocardial infarction (by electrocardiogram and cardiac enzymes) and was treated medically. Subsequent cardiac catheterization demonstrated normal coronary arteries. ARMS No. 11144--A 28-year-old man used an ephedrine alkaloid-containing product for 10 months (1 capsule per day) for energy. His father found him bloody and responding inappropriately. In the emergency department, his blood pressure was 168/90, with a pulse of 116. Results of extensive clinical and laboratory evaluations were all within normal limits. He was diagnosed with syncope and a closed head injury. His neurologist concluded that ``most likely he had a seizure secondary to ephedrine'' from the health food substance he was taking. He was advised to avoid the product and dispose of it. This man was on no other medications and had no significant past medical history. In particular, he never had problems with dizziness or passing out. ARMS No. 10974--A 19-year-old woman took an ephedrine alkaloidcontaining product, one before each meal, three times per day (1/2 of recommended amount) for 1 month, for weight loss. Her family witnessed seizure activity at mealtime and took her to the emergency room. Evaluations there were essentially normal (CT scan of the head and electroencephalogram or EEG). The neurologist's evaluation found no other risk factors for seizure. No other products had been used, and there was no significant past medical history. ARMS No. 10088--A 38-year-old female took two products containing ephedrine alkaloids for 4 days, and she developed syncope (light-headedness) and an extremely elevated blood pressure, measured at 180/110. She was seen in the emergency department with severe headache, nausea, and sweating. The consumer had been seen every 3 to 4 months for the 5 years before this event and had no history of high blood pressure. After stopping the products, her blood pressure returned to normal. ARMS No. 10919--A 49-year-old woman used an ephedrine alkaloidcontaining product, 3 capsules three times daily for 3 weeks for weight loss. She developed weakness, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, and palpitations and went to the emergency room, where she was found to have vertigo (type of dizziness), serous otitis media (middle ear inflammation) bilaterally, hypertension (150/102), and elevated liver enzymes. The consumer reported that when she stopped the product, her blood pressure returned to normal without any medical treatment. She did not have a history of high blood pressure. ARMS No. 10946--A 42-year-old female used an ephedrine alkaloidcontaining product, 1 capsule twice daily for 3 days for weight loss. She was also taking vitamin B12 and an  30685  antioxidant supplement. She developed a rash over her entire body and stopped all three products. She restarted the ephedrine alkaloid-containing product 3 days after the onset of her rash. Three days later, on a visit to her doctor for a nonproductive cough and congestion, she was found to be seriously hypertensive (170/114). She had no history of hypertension and had been seen by her gynecologist 1 week before starting the ephedrine alkaloidcontaining product, where a normal blood pressure (120/78) was documented. 2. The Patterns of the Signs and Symptoms of Adverse Events Associated With Ephedrine AlkaloidContaining Dietary Supplements Are Consistent With the Available Scientific Evidence and Known Physiologic and Pharmacologic Effects of Ephedrine Alkaloids The observed CVS and NS effects associated with use of ephedrine alkaloid-containing dietary supplements are consistent with the known pharmacologic and physiologic effects of ephedrine alkaloids. Because there is a general paucity of scientific data or other information on the physiologic or pharmacologic properties of ephedrine alkaloids from botanical sources, and particularly from marketed dietary supplement products, FDA reviewed other available evidence on ephedrine and other ephedrine alkaloids for information on their effects. This evidence included data from clinical and animal studies in support of drugs containing a single, synthetic ephedrine alkaloid in a well-defined and characterized product, case reports from the literature of adverse events with ephedrine alkaloid-containing products, and traditional medical uses of ephedrine alkaloid-containing botanicals. Although there may be some differences in the pharmacokinetic properties of synthetic ephedrine alkaloids used in drug products as compared to the botanical sources of these alkaloids as used in dietary supplements (e.g., differences in enantiomer forms, dissolution, absorption, and bioavailability or differences that result from interactions with other components of the botanical), given that once absorbed, the botanical and synthetic sources of ephedrine alkaloids undergo similar metabolic processes (Refs. 24 and 43), the agency considered it appropriate to rely on evidence from pharmaceutical sources of single ephedrine alkaloids in assessing the effects of botanical sources. This judgment is supported by   30686  Federal Register / Vol. 62, No. 107 / Wednesday, June 4, 1997 / Proposed Rules sympathetic nervous system and thus are classified as sympathomimetic agents (i.e., agents stimulating the sympathetic nervous system) (Refs. 7, 9 through 13, and 44 through 48). Ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, and norephedrine are naturally occurring sympathomimetic amines in some botanicals. Ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, and norephedrine each have varying effects because of interaction with specific receptors in the human body (i.e., alpha, beta-1, and beta-2 adrenergic receptors) (Refs. 9 through 13). (Table 2 summarizes some of the major receptor effects, and Table 3 summarizes the adrenergic activity of ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, phenylpropanolamine (dlnorephedrine), and norepinephrine.) Some of the physiological roles of alpha receptors are central NS stimulation, vasoconstriction (i.e., narrowing of blood vessels), uterine contraction, centrally mediated cardiovascular depression, and decreased insulin secretion. Alpha receptors also have an effect on the urinary bladder, which can result in urinary retention. The major physiological roles of beta receptors include cardiac (i.e., heart) stimulation and bronchodilation (enlargement of the bronchial or breathing tube secondary to relaxation of bronchial smooth muscle).  the fact that adverse events reported for dietary supplements containing ephedrine alkaloids from botanical sources are similar to those that are reported in the literature for drugs containing an ephedrine alkaloid from synthetic sources. FDA's Working Group agreed that evidence on synthetic sources of ephedrine alkaloids could be considered in evaluating botanical sources (Ref. 27). Ephedrine and its related alkaloids are known to elicit physiological responses similar to catecholamines (i.e., groups of chemically related neurotransmitters, such as epinephrine, norepinephrine, and dopamine) that have stimulant effects on the  TABLE 2.--ADRENERGIC ACTIVITY OF SYMPATHOMIMETIC AGENTS (MODIFIED FROM REF. 9) Type of effects adrenergic receptors Organ/system Nervous system (NS) .........

The different types of ephedrine alkaloids exhibit some similar effects but vary in the intensity of these effects (Refs. 10 through 13). For example, ephedrine increases arterial blood pressure in humans both by peripheral vasoconstriction (narrowing of the blood vessels in the periphery of the body)  and by cardiac stimulation, resulting in increased heart rate and cardiac output. The magnitude of these cardiovascular responses can vary on an individual basis and may be dependent on a number of factors, including genetic characteristics, a history of certain diseases or conditions, or the use of  certain medications. Other actions of ephedrine include stimulation of oxygen uptake and thermogenesis (heat or energy production). Pseudoephedrine is less potent than ephedrine both in its bronchodilatory and vasopressor effects (i.e., effect of elevating blood pressure). It produces about one half the   Federal Register / Vol. 62, No. 107 / Wednesday, June 4, 1997 / Proposed Rules bronchodilation and one quarter of the vasopressor effects of ephedrine (Refs. 9 and 13). a. Physiologic and pharmacologic evidence: cardiovascular effects of ephedrine alkaloids. The adverse events involving the CVS reported to FDA that are associated with dietary supplements containing ephedrine alkaloids are consistent with the known effects of sympathomimetic agents on the CVS. Cardiovascular effects resulting from the use of sympathomimetic agents are well documented in the literature (Refs. 49 through 52). For example, use of ephedrine has been reported to interfere with the regulation of serum potassium levels (Refs. 53 through 55) and thus may predispose certain individuals to cardiac dysrhythmias (i.e., abnormal heart rhythms) (Refs. 18 and 56); myocardial ischemia (i.e., inadequate circulation of blood and oxygen to the heart muscle); and infarction (i.e., death or damage of heart cells, also called heart attack) (Refs. 57 through 61). Cardiac damage has also been reported with the use of pseudoephedrine and phenylpropanolamine (norephedrine) (Refs. 16, 56, 60, and 62 through 64). Results of several studies on blood pressure effects with the use of ephedrine alkaloids have indicated that individuals with hypertension may be at greater risk of blood pressure elevations with the use of ephedrine (reviewed in (Ref. 64)). The signs and symptoms observed in the AER's are consistent with the available scientific literature on the effects of ephedrine alkaloids. Serious cardiovascular adverse events are the major cause of death reported in the AER's with the use of ephedrine alkaloid-containing products and primarily involve ischemia (inadequate blood flow) which can cause heart attacks and strokes. These events have occurred in asymptomatic, otherwise healthy young adults with normal coronary or cerebral blood vessels (Ref. 25), a finding also noted with pharmaceutical preparations of ephedrine alkaloids (Refs. 60, 61, and 65), where vasospasm with subsequent ischemia is a proposed mechanism of tissue injury. Besides causing damage by affecting blood flow, sympathomimetic agents, such as ephedrine, can damage the heart and other tissues or organs by other mechanisms. Cardiomyopathy (i.e., disease of the heart muscle) related to catecholamine mediated cytotoxicity (cell damage) has been reported with chronic use of ephedrine alkaloids (durations of use generally at or above the recommended dose that occur over many months or years) (Refs. 62 and 66 through 68). Fatal cardiomyopathies have also been reported with chronic use of ephedrine alkaloid-containing dietary supplements (ARMS No. 11134 in Ref. 149a). Ephedrine and pseudoephedrine have been implicated also in stroke secondary to intracranial (i.e., inside the brain) and subarachnoid (i.e., underneath the membrane that covers the brain and spinal cord) hemorrhage and vasculitis (i.e., inflammation of blood vessels), as well as in ischemic strokes (Refs. 9 and 69 through 71), particularly when used in combinations with phenylpropanolamine (norephedrine) or caffeine (Refs. 65 and 72 through 78) or in the presence of monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOI) (Ref. 72). These effects are noted to be similar to the necrotizing angiitis (severe inflammation with destruction of the blood vessels) seen in chronic amphetamine abuse (Refs. 16, 74, and 77 through 79).  30687  b. Physiologic and pharmacologic evidence: NS effects of ephedrine alkaloids. The adverse events involving the NS reported to FDA that are associated with dietary supplements containing ephedrine alkaloids are consistent with the known effects of sympathomimetic agents on the NS. These effects, such as seizure (Refs. 63, 65, and 80), psychosis, and mania (Refs. 81 through 99), have been reported with the use and the abuse of ephedrine alkaloids. More recently, a case report in the scientific literature reported ephedrine-induced mania associated with the use of a botanical dietary supplement (Ref. 100). Neuropsychiatric effects reported in AER's related to ephedrine alkaloidcontaining dietary supplements also are consistent with the known physiologic and pharmacologic actions of ephedrine alkaloids documented in the scientific literature. Mania and psychosis have occurred in individuals without identifiable risk factors who have used these products, as well as in people who used them who had possible predisposing factors, such as a personal history of mood disorders (i.e., depression or manic depression), a family history of manic depression, or concurrent use of products that increase sensitivity of an individual to the effects of ephedrine alkaloids (see Table 4). AER's noting neuropsychiatric adverse effects in persons using non-MAOI antidepressant drugs concurrently with dietary supplements containing ephedrine alkaloids are consistent with a report of the serotonin syndrome associated with the concurrent use of serotonin reuptake inhibitors (a new class of antidepressant drugs) and OTC cold remedies containing pseudoephedrine (Ref. 101).

Heart disease, thyroid disease, diabetes, renal disease, high blood pressure, depression, psychiatric conditions, glaucoma, prostate enlargement, seizure disorder. Vascular spasm; stroke and myocardial infarction may influence the type and severity of adverse events in the sensitive individual.  c. Variability in individual responses to ephedrine alkaloids. The unpredictability of individual responses to ephedrine alkaloid-containing dietary supplement products, as reported in AER's, is also consistent with what is  known about the physiological and pharmacological properties of these alkaloids (Refs. 7, 10 through 12, 39 through 41, and 48). Individual variability in the effects of ephedrine has been reported in several clinical  investigations (Refs. 5 and 102 through 104). The marked sensitivity of some individuals to the effects of ephedrine has been recognized in the Western scientific literature almost from the time that ephedrine was introduced as a   30688  Federal Register / Vol. 62, No. 107 / Wednesday, June 4, 1997 / Proposed Rules A Danish group of researchers investigated the usefulness of ephedrine and caffeine alone and in combination for the treatment of obesity (Refs. 105, 106, and 112). One hundred and eighty subjects were randomized to one of four treatment groups: (1) Ephedrine--20 mg, (2) ephedrine--20 mg and caffeine--200 mg, (3) caffeine--200 mg, and (4) placebo control. The treatments were administered three times a day for 24 weeks in conjunction with a defined low calorie diet. One hundred and fortyone individuals completed the trial. Subject withdrawals were reported to be equally distributed across the four groups with no statistical differences among the groups. More side effects were noted in the treatment groups compared to the placebo control group in both those subjects continuing in, and those withdrawing from, the trial. Study results showed that 60 percent of the ephedrine and caffeine treatment group, 44 percent of the ephedrine treatment group, and 36 percent of the caffeine treatment group experienced side effects compared to 24 percent of the placebo control group. These results were statistically significant (p<0.05) (Ref. 105). This study showed that there was a possibility of rebound symptoms (symptoms occurring as a consequence of withdrawal of an agent, especially headache and fatigue) once the treatment was stopped. Rebound symptoms were seen most in the ephedrine and caffeine treatment group but also occurred in the ephedrine alone group (Refs. 105 and 106). Astrup et al. enrolled 127 of the subjects completing the above clinical trial into an open label study where all subjects received the same treatment (diet and ephedrine plus caffeine) for 24 weeks (Refs. 106 through 108). Five of the 38 subjects that withdrew or dropped out of this study did so because they experienced adverse drug reactions (NS and CVS effects). Adverse drug reactions occurred in 102 subjects during weeks 1 through 24 of the open trial. Most symptoms (75 percent) started during the first 4 weeks of treatment and lasted about 4 weeks. Symptoms related to the CVS were primarily palpitations and tachycardia. The most frequent NS symptoms were tremor, agitation, insomnia, increased sweating, and nervousness. Breum et al., in another clinical trial in which the effects of ephedrine plus caffeine (EC) were evaluated, conducted a randomized, double blind, controlled 15 week clinical trial comparing the effects of EC to that of dexfenfluramine (DF), a serotoninergic agonist, in the treatment of obesity (Ref. 113). Fifty four percent of the subjects in the EC group compared to 43 percent of the DF group experienced adverse reactions. The majority of these occurred within the first 4 weeks. At week one, 38 percent of the EC group subjects experienced adverse drug reactions compared to 30 percent in the DF group. NS effects (particularly insomnia and agitation) were statistically increased (p < 0.05) in the EC treatment group (46 percent) compared to the DF group (26 percent), whereas gastrointestinal adverse effects were significantly increased in the DF group. Eight percent of the EC group reported cardiovascular symptoms. All symptoms remitted after cessation of the trial drugs. The above studies demonstrate that adverse effects can occur with the use of ephedrine in the treatment of obesity even in carefully designed and conducted, physician-monitored clinical trials and even in persons prescreened to be in good health, free of known risk factors, and not using medications or other products known to adversely interact with ephedrine-like drugs. Furthermore, the study population of obese individuals is recognized to be less sensitive to the effects of sympathomimetic agents than the general population (Ref. 120). Certain of these studies also evidence that there is an increased frequency of adverse effects occurring in lean subjects, secondary to sympathetic stimulation, compared to obese subjects that is unrelated to dose per body weight (Ref. 119). Thus, these studies suggest that the general population may be more sensitive to the effects of ephedrine alkaloids than the obese population. There are a number of recognized limitations inherent in these published trials, including those associated with study design, methods, and conduct (e.g., small number of subjects enrolled in these trials, narrow targeted populations, short evaluation periods, and selective presentation of data are among the concerns) as are the multiple publications of the same data. Yet despite these factors, the adverse effects observed in these studies remain a cause for concern, although these factors make it difficult to identify subpopulations that may be particularly sensitive to the effects of ephedrine or to identify adverse effects that occur infrequently. These studies were carefully monitored, so that subjects were withdrawn from the study when adverse effects became evident. Therefore, although the observed adverse effects in these studies were not as severe or as serious as some observed with dietary supplement use (e.g., heart attacks, seizures, strokes), they are indicative of the potential for  therapeutic agent in the mid-1920's (Refs. 5 and 102). Two early studies by different investigators recommended a 10 mg initial oral test dose to assess the individual's sensitivity to sources of ephedrine (Refs. 5 and 102). Factors that appear to influence individual susceptibility to sympathomimetic agents are diverse (see Table 4) and are not yet well defined by biological bases. These factors include genetics, particularly those genes controlling metabolic functions; receptor numbers and types; gender; age; and certain physiological states or disease conditions (reviewed in Refs. 39 through 42). In addition, the dosage and duration of use may influence the effects seen with ephedrine alkaloids, as tachyphylaxis (i.e., decrease or diminution of some effect) is known to occur with chronic use of these agents (i.e., there are decreases in certain effects with chronic use that are thought to be due to occupation of all adrenergic receptor sites; discontinuation of ephedrines for a few days results in receptor availability and receptor mediated effects). An example of tachyphylaxis could be tremor or insomnia, which occurs soon after starting ephedrine alkaloid-containing products but which may resolve in certain individuals with continued use of ephedrine alkaloids. d. Clinical trials using ephedrine in the treatment of obesity. Although many dietary supplements containing ephedrine alkaloids are marketed for weight loss or energy purposes, there is a paucity of meaningful data on the safe use of these products for this purpose. A number of controlled clinical trials reported in the scientific literature evaluated the effects of pharmaceutical preparations of ephedrine, either singly or combined with caffeine or aspirin, on weight loss in the treatment of obesity (Refs. 105 through 119). While the primary purpose of these trials was to evaluate efficacy of ephedrine for purposes of weight loss in grossly obese individuals, these clinical trials also document that clinically significant adverse effects can occur in populations with no known risk factors with the use of ephedrine, and that synergistic adverse effects can result when ephedrine and caffeine are combined. The patterns and types of the adverse effects reported in these trials are consistent with the known effects of sympathomimetic agents, that is, they mainly involved NS and CVS effects. A summary of these studies follows. (In this document, the agency makes no evaluation or judgment of the effectiveness of the use of ephedrine in the treatment of obesity.)   Federal Register / Vol. 62, No. 107 / Wednesday, June 4, 1997 / Proposed Rules greater risk with continued use. Moreover, their occurrence is remarkable given the careful prescreening of study subjects such that high risk persons were not included in the study. The greatest limitation, however, is that these studies were designed to evaluate the effectiveness of ephedrine in the treatment of obesity. They were not designed to test the safety of the use of ephedrine in the obese, or any other population (Ref. 121), or to test its safety under the conditions under which marketed dietary supplements containing sources of ephedrine alkaloids are used. Therefore, these study results cannot be used to definitively demonstrate safety, or the lack of safety, of ephedrine alkaloidcontaining supplements for use by the general population. Nonetheless, despite the shortcomings of these studies, the results raise serious concerns about the safety of using ephedrine, from any source, including dietary supplements, in both obese individuals and the general public in nonmedically monitored situations. e. Other physiologic and pharmacologic effects. Some of the adverse events reported to FDA that were unrelated to the CVS and NS also bear a recognized relationship to the known physiologic and pharmacologic effects of ephedrine alkaloids. For example, urinary retention, particularly in males with no history of prostatic hypertrophy (enlargement of the prostate gland), has been associated with the use of ephedrine (Refs. 102, 103, and 122 through 124). Urinary retention has a well recognized relationship with urinary tract infections, which have been reported to FDA with the use of products containing ephedrine alkaloids. Myopathy (disease of muscle), besides being reported for the heart (Refs. 62 and 66 through 68), is also recognized to involve skeletal muscles and may result in acute renal failure (Ref. 125). Certain gastrointestinal adverse effects, including impaired colonic motility and ischemic colitis, have been associated with the usage of amphetamines (Refs. 102 and 126). Similarly, ischemic colitis has also been reported with the usage of a long-acting decongestant containing pseudoephedrine (Ref. 127). Additionally, acute hepatitis (inflammation in the liver) has been associated with the use of a Chinese medicinal product containing Ma huang (Ref. 128). Other types of adverse effects, such as the reports of dermatologic reactions, while not known to be related to the recognized physiologic or pharmacologic effects of ephedrine alkaloids, are consistent with adverse effects reported in published case reports. For example, there are more than 11 published case reports, at least 12 patients, of systemic dermatologic reactions, including rashes occurring in a particular distribution on the body, contact dermatitis (inflammation of the skin resulting usually from local contact with a substance), a toxic shock-like syndrome, angioedema (extreme swelling of tissues and structures of the body secondary to leaking of fluids from capillaries (small blood vessels)), and erythematous (reddish) rash and subsequent desquamation (loss of part of the skin surface) that occurred with the use of ephedrine or pseudoephedrine (Refs. 114 and 129 through 138). Concerns about toxicity to the fetus with maternal exposure to ephedrine alkaloids during pregnancy remain unresolved. Increased fetal heart rate has been associated with maternal use of pseudoephedrine (Ref. 139). In addition, the administration of intramuscular ephedrine to treat maternal hypotension has been associated with increases in fetal heart rate and beat-to-beat variability (cited in Ref. 139). Certain animal studies also raise concern about potential teratogenic effects that may be caused by the use of ephedrine during pregnancy (Refs. 140 through 143). Potential toxicity for a breast-fed infant whose mother is using a dietary supplement containing ephedrine alkaloids is unknown, but toxicity has been reported in a breastfed infant whose mother had been taking a long-acting oral decongestant containing d-isoephedrine for the relief of allergy symptoms (Ref. 144). Little is known about the potential consequences of long term use of ephedrine alkaloids, other than the risk of cardiomyopathy as stated above. Park et al., however, recently implicated adrenergic agents like ephedrine in the etiology of a type of lung cancer, particularly in persons simultaneously exposed to carcinogenic environmental factors such as smoking (Ref. 145). This report indicates the need for long-term followup to adequately assess the risks associated with product use, as well as the importance of particular group characteristics (e.g., smoking status) in evaluating risk. f. Traditional uses of botanical sources of ephedrine alkaloids: adverse effects. In the traditional medicinal use of Ephedra, the raw botanical was administered, either alone or more commonly combined with other specific botanicals, in the form of a water infusion (tea), three times a day.  30689  Traditional treatment was prescribed by a trained health practitioner based on the evaluation of a particular patient and was predominately for short term use. Commonly used dosages of the raw botanical ranged from 1.5 to 9 grams (g), generally averaging 5 to 6 g of Ephedra per dose (Refs. 14 and 146). Tyler has estimated that a tea made from 2 g of the raw botanical Ephedra (containing 1.25 percent ephedrine) will yield a dose of 15 to 30 mg ephedrine (cited in Ref. 147). Thus, use of 5 to 6 g of the raw botanical Ephedra, an average amount used in a tea could yield a dose of ephedrine ranging from approximately 38 mg to 75 mg. FDA has no knowledge of any systematic collection of morbidity and mortality data on individuals treated with Ephedra in traditional medicine. Ephedra was historically considered a medium or middle class herb, meaning that recognized toxicities could be associated with its use (Refs. 14, 146, and 148). Several reference texts, in fact, list precautions and contraindications for the use of the botanical Ephedra in traditional medicinal preparations (Refs. 14 and 146). Another reference warns against overdosage (Ref. 25). While there is a paucity of data in the scientific literature on the safety of the use of Ephedra, several scientific references report adverse effects associated with the use of Ephedra. One early study in the United States reported two cases of urinary retention in men aged 56 and 65 years. These men all noted bladder pain and difficulty in voiding which developed after one to three doses of a fluid extract of Ephedra. The symptoms resolved after the use of the extract was discontinued. More recently, a published case report notes the occurrence of erythroderma associated with the use of an herbal product containing Ma huang which was obtained from a Chinese herbalist for the relief of cold-like symptoms (Ref. 138). The woman who was the subject of this report had a history of similar episodes following usage of OTC cold preparations containing ephedrine alkaloids. These references document that adverse effects occurred with the traditional use of Ephedra, and that these effects are consistent with effects occurring with modern pharmaceutical preparations of synthetic ephedrine. 3. The Relationship is Temporally Correct One possible source of serious error in evaluating observational data, such as that found in FDA's postmarketing surveillance system, is the potential for inappropriately assuming that a cause and effect relationship exists between a   30690  Federal Register / Vol. 62, No. 107 / Wednesday, June 4, 1997 / Proposed Rules over 26 percent of AER's provided information suggesting successful dechallenge, and 4 percent of reports provided information of rechallenge, suggesting that the product was the direct cause of the adverse event. A number of the previously described cases are particularly good examples of positive dechallenge in that symptoms resolved spontaneously on cessation of use of the product without medical treatment (see Arms Nos. 10088, 11065, and 11112 in the Appendix to this document). Furthermore, some specific AER's suggest that a pattern of starting and stopping use of dietary supplements containing ephedrine alkaloids may increase an individual's susceptibility to experiencing adverse events as has been suggested in reviews of adverse events occurring with the use of phenylpropanolamine (Ref. 73). One case described above, ARMS No. 9552, in which a woman suffered a heart attack soon after she restarted using an ephedrine alkaloid-containing product, may be an example of such increased sensitivity. Thus, FDA tentatively concludes that there is evidence of dechallenge and rechallenge from the AER's that supports a causal relationship between the ingestion of ephedrine alkaloids and the types of CVS and NS and other effects observed with use of the ephedrine alkaloid-containing dietary supplement products. Additional support for this conclusion is also provided in the published clinical trials in the treatment of obesity described above. 5. A Biologically Plausible Explanation for the Adverse Events Considering the totality of the available information, FDA tentatively concludes that the available evidence strongly supports that the adverse effects that are occurring with the use of dietary supplements containing ephedrine alkaloids are caused by the ephedrine alkaloids. This tentative conclusion derives from the previous discussions in this document. The observed adverse effects predominately involve the CVS and NS and are consistent with the known physiological and pharmacological effects of ephedrine alkaloids noted in medical/ pharmacological texts. Furthermore, similar patterns of CVS and NS effects have been documented both in anecdotal reports in the scientific literature and in the published results of controlled clinical trials using pharmaceutical preparations of various ephedrine alkaloids. The available data further suggest that these types of adverse events should be anticipated and expected with the use of ephedrine alkaloid-containing products by the general population. D. Additional Concerns The agency is aware of a number of factors related to currently marketed dietary supplements that may contribute to the likelihood of adverse events but that the available data are inadequate to evaluate fully. These factors weighed heavily on the minds of many members of the Food Advisory Committee as they discussed the public health concerns associated with the use of these products. These factors include: (1) The size of the population that is susceptible to experiencing adverse events with the use of ephedrine alkaloids, because there are neither good data on the number and pattern of supplement users in the United States nor good data on the full range of characteristics that cause or increase risk. Nonetheless, the potential population at risk is quite large if one considers the following likely risk factors: (a) The large number of persons who have diseases or conditions, or who are at risk for such conditions, for whom the use of ephedrine alkaloid-containing dietary supplements is inappropriate (Table 5).  particular exposure and a particular adverse event without evaluating the true relationship of the adverse event to the exposure. Unless there are data that ensure that there is the correct temporal relationship between exposure and effect (i.e., that the adverse effects follow exposure), there is a potential for serious misinterpretation of data. To evaluate this potential source of serious error, FDA evaluated the AER's to determine whether there was clear evidence of the correct temporal sequence having occurred. FDA found evidence of the correct relationship in the AER's that it received (see, e.g., ARMS Nos. 10088, 8475, 9747, and 11112). Further support that the temporal relationship is correct can be found in clinical studies that described the pharmacological and physiological effects of different ephedrine alkaloids and in the clinical trials with obese subjects. 4. There is Other Evidence, Even in the Absence of Controlled Trials, Such as Evidence of Dechallenge That Suggests a Causal Relationship Between the Use of Ephedrine Alkaloid-Containing Dietary Supplements and Adverse Events Causality is most readily demonstrated in well-designed and conducted clinical trials, in which the multiple factors that may influence study results and interpretations can be controlled. However, evidence of causality can be inferred from observational studies, including individual case reports, particularly where there is evidence of positive dechallenge and rechallenge, that is, where, when the consumer stopped using the product, the signs and symptoms resolved or improved, and when the consumer began using the product again, the symptoms reoccurred. Although many of the AER's did not provide enough information to adequately evaluate these questions,  TABLE 5.--IDENTIFIABLE AT RISK POPULATION WITH USE OF EPHEDRINE ALKALOIDS Disease or condition Cardiovascular disease ............................................................................................................................

These variables include gender, age, genetics, certain physiologic states, and the use of certain products (e.g., foods and drugs) (Ref. 25). (2) The potential for interactive and unpredictable effects from the mixture of ephedrine alkaloids found in botanical sources, which may serve to increase the likelihood, frequency, or severity of an adverse event. Unlike drugs which contain only a single, wellcharacterized ephedrine alkaloid, botanical sources contain a mixture of these alkaloids. The potential for interactive effects among these alkaloids is likely but largely unknown (Ref. 25). (3) The potential for other ingredients in the dietary supplement products to interact with the ephedrine alkaloids to increase the likelihood or severity of an adverse event (Ref. 25). (4) The natural or formulation variations in levels and relative proportions of the ephedrine alkaloids in marketed dietary supplement products and the resultant risk for persons who can tolerate one level or mixture but who unknowingly are exposed to different levels or mixtures because they change brands, or because the composition of the brand that they typically use is altered (Ref. 25). (5) The formulations of the products themselves (including the numbers, types, and forms of ingredients used in the product and the form of the final product) may influence the likelihood, frequency, or severity of adverse effects because product characteristics may influence dissolution, absorption, bioavailability, and metabolism of active and inactive ingredients in the product and thus influence the effects of the product (Ref. 25). E. General Summary and Tentative Conclusions FDA has received more than 800 AER's involving more than 100 dietary supplement products. Among these products the most common and consistent finding is the presence of ephedrine alkaloids. The products associated with these adverse events are marketed in diverse formulations and for a variety of uses. Sympathetic nervous system and cardiovascular system stimulant effects account for the majority of the reported adverse events associated with dietary supplements containing ephedrine alkaloids. These effects include heart attack, stroke, seizure, chest pain, psychosis, anxiety, nervousness, tremor, and hyperactivity (Refs. 25 and 27). The type and patterns of these adverse effects are consistent with the CVS and NS effects known and expected to occur with the use of sympathomimetic agents, such as the ephedrine alkaloids. The known physiological and pharmacological activities of ephedrine alkaloids and the adverse events that have occurred in controlled clinical trials using ephedrine corroborate this conclusion. The biological plausibility of these types of adverse events occurring with the use of ephedrine alkaloids, the temporal relationship between the use of the dietary supplements and the onset of the adverse events, and the evidence of dechallenge and rechallenge also support a causal relationship between the use of ephedrine alkaloid-containing products and subsequent adverse events. Both the Working Group and the Food Advisory Committee reviewed the available data and information on the occurrence of adverse events associated with the use of dietary supplements containing ephedrine alkaloids in certain individuals. The Working Group was specifically asked whether the available information contains sufficient evidence to demonstrate that the use of dietary supplements containing ephedrine alkaloids may cause consumers to experience serious adverse events. The Working Group concluded that it was. Although not asked this question, those members of the Food Advisory Committee who addressed the question agreed with the Working Groups's conclusion. Thus, FDA tentatively concludes that there is a consistent, large, and growing body of evidence that establishes a causal association between the use of ephedrine alkaloids and subsequent adverse events. The agency also tentatively concludes that the use of ephedrine alkaloid-containing dietary supplements is associated with a serious and significant public health concern because of the nature of the adverse events and the size of the population at risk. III. The Proposed Regulation A. The Scope of This Proposal This proposal applies to dietary supplements containing one or more ephedrine alkaloids and related alkaloids, including those from the botanical species Ephedra sinica Stapf, Ephedra equistestina Bunge, Ephedra intermedia var., tibetica Stapf, Ephedra distachya L., and Sida cordifolia or their extracts.  30691  Conventional food products that contain ephedrine alkaloids, including snack bars, cookies, and beverages, are not covered by this proposal. Conventional food products are subject to section 409 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act) (21 U.S.C. 348) and, given the adverse events associated with the use of ephedrine alkaloids, these substances are unapproved food additives when used in conventional foods. Use of botanical sources of ephedrine alkaloids in traditional herbal therapies is beyond the scope of this proposal. Although several Ephedra species (including those considered as Ma huang) have been reported to have a long history of use in traditional Asian medicine for the treatment of the symptoms of colds, to relieve respiratory symptoms, and to regulate water metabolism (Refs. 4, 6, 14, and 146), products bearing claims evidencing that they are intended for therapeutic use are regulated as drugs under the act. This proposal also does not cover OTC or prescription drugs that contain ephedrine alkaloids. Ephedrine is approved as an active ingredient in oral OTC bronchodilator drugs for use in the treatment of medically diagnosed mild asthma (21 CFR 341.76). However, in the Federal Register of July 27, 1995 (60 F.R. 38643), FDA proposed to amend the final monograph for OTC bronchodilator drug products to remove the ingredients ephedrine, ephedrine hydrochloride, ephedrine sulfate, and racephedrine hydrochloride and to classify these ingredients as not generally recognized as safe and effective for OTC use. FDA issued the proposal to amend the final monograph for OTC bronchodilator products in response to a request from the U.S. Department of Justice, Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), to restrict OTC availability of ephedrine because of its illicit use as the primary precursor in the synthesis of the controlled substances methamphetamine and methylcathinone. The agency also issued the proposal because of new information that showed that misuse and abuse of OTC ephedrine drug products can cause potential harm, and because of comments made by FDA's Pulmonary-Allergy Drugs Advisory Committee and the Nonprescription Drugs Advisory Committee. FDA is currently evaluating public comments to that proposal and will be addressing this subject in a future issue of the Federal Register.   30692  Federal Register / Vol. 62, No. 107 / Wednesday, June 4, 1997 / Proposed Rules histamine at which FDA is likely to take action against the fish because it is adulterated (Ref. 151). Moreover, in  109.4(b) (21 CFR 109.4(b)), the agency has said that it will establish regulatory limits that represent the level at which an added poisonous or deleterious substance adulterates a food within the meaning of section 402(a)(1) of the act (21 U.S.C. 342(a)(1)). The agency has attempted to be flexible and practical in tailoring its strategy for dealing with public health risks, taking into account the nature and type of the risk and the potential effectiveness of various alternative approaches. In the case of ephedrine alkaloids in dietary supplements, there are many factors and underlying etiologies that can influence individual sensitivity to these substances. Some of these factors are easily identified or readily controlled; many are not. Factors that are known to influence the likelihood, frequency, and severity of adverse events associated with the use of sympathomimetic agents, including ephedrine alkaloids, include genetics, age (e.g., children and the elderly are at increased risk), preexisting conditions (e.g., kidney disease, heart disease, hypertension, diabetes, thyroid disease, glaucoma, and enlarged prostate), pregnancy, concurrent use of medications (e.g., MAOI, methyldopa), or excessive consumption (see Table 4) (Refs. 39 through 42, 152, and 153). Other factors that may increase an individual's susceptibility to experience adverse events with the use of ephedrine alkaloids include exercise, body size (i.e., lean and normal weight individuals appear to be more susceptible than obese individuals), and dietary intake (i.e., severe caloric and fluid restrictions increase the likelihood of adverse events) (Refs. 39, 42, 119, and 154 through 156). Significantly, however, many adverse events associated with ephedrine alkaloid-containing dietary supplements occur in individuals who have no apparent risk factors, or who are unaware that they are at risk. Additionally, approximately 40 percent of the reported adverse events occur with the first use or within 1 week of first use, providing little or no warning to consumers of potential risk (see Figure 3). The agency tentatively concludes, therefore, that neither disclosure of the presence of ephedrine alkaloids on the product label nor the use of a warning statement, alone, will be sufficient to protect consumers because many individuals are not aware, and are unable to determine, that they are at risk from consuming ephedrine alkaloids, and serious adverse events may occur on the first use or with very short-term use. Therefore, the agency has tentatively determined that several measures are needed if the observed adverse events associated with the use of ephedrine alkaloid-containing dietary supplements are to be effectively addressed. These measures are discussed below. C. Proposal for Dietary Supplements Containing Ephedrine Alkaloids 1. Dietary Ingredient Limit for Ephedrine Alkaloids: Per Serving Basis One possible strategy for addressing the significant number of adverse effects associated with ephedrine alkaloids in dietary supplements is to restrict the level of the ephedrine alkaloids in these products. In considering this possibility, FDA evaluated two issues: (a) Is there a level at which ephedrine alkaloids cause safety concerns; and (b) if there is, will restricting dietary supplements from containing ephedrine alkaloids at or above that level be adequate, alone, to protect the public health, or will additional steps be necessary. In considering these questions, FDA evaluated the evidence that provides information on the adverse effects of ephedrine alkaloids that is most relevant to the uses and formulations of marketed dietary supplement products: (a) The published findings from the clinical studies investigating the use of ephedrine for weight loss for the treatment of obesity, and (b) the numerous AER's associated with the consumption of dietary supplements containing ephedrine alkaloids. First, the agency reviewed clinical trials that have been performed to explore therapeutic uses for ephedrine alone and in combination with other pharmaceutical substances (see earlier discussion in section II.C.2.d. of this document (Refs. 105 through 119)). Information from these trials show that 20 mg ephedrine per dose can cause adverse events to occur in a significant percentage of obese persons (up to 60 percent) prescreened to be free of known risk factors while using these products for a relatively short time (i.e., most adverse events occurred during the first 4 weeks of use). Thus, these studies establish that 20 mg per serving of ephedrine presents potential risks for a subpopulation of morbidly obese persons but provide no information on risk at levels below 20 mg per serving for obese persons. These studies also provide no information on risk at levels below 20 mg per serving for use by persons in the general population (e.g., lean or moderately overweight persons), who are known to be more sensitive to  B. Rationale for the Proposal It is incumbent upon the agency to respond to the concerns raised by the number, seriousness, and pattern of adverse events associated with the use of ephedrine alkaloid-containing dietary supplements. Given the AER's, the case reports in the scientific literature, controlled clinical trials, published reports of adverse effects with traditional uses of ephedrine alkaloidcontaining botanicals, and other data, it is apparent that there are serious and well-documented public health risks attendant to the use of ephedrine alkaloids in marketed dietary supplement products, and that the agency needs to propose actions to address these risks. Over the years, FDA has employed a variety of strategies in addressing food ingredients that created significant public health risks. In cases where small subpopulations have faced serious, even potentially deadly, risks because of ingredients with allergic potential (e.g., nuts and shellfish), FDA has required that the presence of the allergen be declared on the food label so that consumers who are at risk can avoid products that contain the problem ingredient ( 101.4 (21 CFR 101.4)). In other cases where a food or food ingredient has presented special health risks to consumers under certain use conditions, the agency has required warning label statements to ensure that consumers are alerted to the potential health hazards associated with use of the product. For example, FDA has required a special warning statement to appear on the label of protein products intended for use in weight reduction, stating in part that very low calorie protein diets may cause serious illness or death ( 101.17(d) (21 CFR 101.17(d))). In other cases, e.g., the proposed regulations for poisonings in young children because of high intakes of iron-containing dietary supplements, the agency was concerned that, for high potency products, warning labels alone would not be effective in preventing serious harm. Therefore, the agency has decided to require, at least in some cases, warning labels plus special packaging requirements to reduce the risk of serious harm (Ref. 150). In other cases, where a substance contained in a food may be harmful to health, it has been the agency's policy to define a level at which the harmful substance may render the food adulterated. For example, to address the public health problem of histamine poisoning associated with the consumption of certain fish, the agency issued guidance on the level of   Federal Register / Vol. 62, No. 107 / Wednesday, June 4, 1997 / Proposed Rules sympathomimetic substances like ephedrine alkaloids than are the morbidly obese persons who constituted the study population (see section II.C.2.d. of this document). FDA is not aware of any well-designed and conducted studies that evaluate the risks of intakes of ephedrine levels below 20 mg per serving in any population group. Second, FDA, through its postmarketing surveillance program, has found consistent patterns of adverse events across a broad range of marketed dietary supplement products that contain a variety of ephedrine alkaloid levels per serving. FDA's laboratory analyses of the ephedrine alkaloid levels in the small number of available dietary supplement products that consumers who suffered adverse events turned over to the agency showed that these adverse events were related to ephedrine alkaloid levels from approximately 1 to over 50 mg per serving (Ref. 149). These data, as well as analytical data from samples collected from the marketplace after FDA received AER's from consumers who no longer possessed the product, show a pattern of clinically significant adverse events, including neuropsychiatric effects (e.g., severe depression, seizure), malignant (i.e., extremely high) blood pressure, and myocardial necrosis (i.e., death of the heart muscle) with subsequent cardiac arrest and death, with the use of ephedrine alkaloids at levels approaching and above 10 mg per serving (e.g., seven reports of clinically serious adverse events were associated with products that contained 10 to 15 mg per serving) (Ref. 149a). Clinically significant adverse events were also reported with the use of ephedrine alkaloids at levels that exceeded this range. FDA has also received a few reports of adverse events, some clinically significant, including tremor, extremely high blood pressure, severe headache, nausea, chest pain, increased heart rate, and insomnia, associated with the use of ephedrine alkaloids at levels below 8 mg (e.g., 2 to 8 mg ephedrine alkaloids per serving) (Ref. 149a). The true clinical significance of these levels of ephedrine alkaloids is difficult to interpret because of the lack of the data (e.g., too few reports with analysis to identify a pattern of clinically serious adverse events at any specific level). Thus, the available information from the AER's and the scientific literature does not provide sufficient data to adequately evaluate risk below approximately 10 mg per serving. Given the available evidence, it is difficult to ascertain whether there is a threshold level of ephedrine alkaloids below which the general population and susceptible individuals will not experience serious adverse events. The shape of an intake-response curve for any particular adverse effect related to ephedrine alkaloid intakes is not known. In the absence of data that allow a systematic evaluation of intakes of ephedrine and other related alkaloids below 10 mg per serving, it is not possible to adequately define or describe the potential risks and at-risk groups from ephedrine alkaloids. However, the available data, including the AER's and the known physiological and pharmacological effects of ephedrine, provide convincing evidence that clinically serious adverse events will occur at intake levels above 10 mg ephedrine alkaloids per serving. FDA recognizes, however, that this 10-mg level is also subject to some uncertainty because of such factors as intra-assay variabilities (i.e., difference in analytical results from one run to the next with the same method), natural variabilities in the alkaloid content of botanical ingredients, variations in formulation levels from batch to batch, and inaccuracies in the amounts reported to be taken by consumers. When these sources of variability are considered, given that they are likely to be additive, the range around the 10 mg per serving estimated intake can be expected to deviate by 10 to 20 percent. Thus, FDA tentatively concludes that the life-threatening adverse events associated with the use of ephedrine alkaloids can reasonably be expected to occur at intake levels as low as 8 to 9 mg ephedrine alkaloids per serving. However, given the limitations in the available data, the agency requests comments on whether it is more appropriate to focus on the 10 mg level. Based on the available evidence and the likely sources of measurement error around estimated intake levels, the agency tentatively concludes that the use of dietary supplements containing 8 mg or more ephedrine alkaloids per serving may render the dietary supplement injurious to health. The agency also tentatively concludes that consumption of dietary supplements that contain this level or more of ephedrine alkaloids presents a significant and unreasonable risk of illness or injury under the conditions of use recommended or suggested in the labeling or under ordinary conditions of use, and that, therefore, products that  30693  contain this or higher levels of ephedrine alkaloids are adulterated. 1 To reflect this tentative conclusion, FDA is proposing to adopt  111.100(a)(1) which states that dietary supplements that contain 8 mg or more ephedrine alkaloids (the total of ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, norpseudoephedrine, norephedrine, methylephedrine, methylpseudoephedrine and related alkaloids) per single serving shall be deemed to be adulterated under section 402(a)(1) and (f)(1)(A) of the act. FDA is proposing to adopt this provision under sections 402(a)(1), (f)(1)(A), and 701(a) (21 U.S.C. 371(a)) of the act. Under section 402(a)(1) of the act, a food, including a dietary supplement, is adulterated if it bears or contains any added poisonous or deleterious substance that may render it injurious to health. Section 402(f)(1)(A) of the act provides that a dietary supplement is adulterated if it, or one of its ingredients, poses a significant or unreasonable risk of injury or illness when used as directed or under ordinary conditions of use. Under section 701(a) of the act, FDA has authority to issue regulations for the efficient enforcement of the act. These sections authorize FDA to issue a regulation that establishes a level of ephedrine alkaloids that, the available evidence makes clear, will render a dietary supplement adulterated as a matter of law. FDA tentatively concludes that such a regulation will advance the purposes of the act in two significant ways. First, it will provide guidance to the dietary supplement industry as to a level of ephedrine alkaloids that can be used in their products with some confidence that such products will not be subject to regulatory action. Second, it will make clear that if products that contain higher levels of ephedrine alkaloids are marketed; such products will be considered unsafe and adulterated and will be subject to all the relevant sanctions under the act. Eight mg per serving and above represent levels at which the presence of ephedrine alkaloids in a dietary supplement may render the product injurious to health and presents a significant and unreasonable risk. FDA cannot say that it is a safe level, nor has 1 FDA has limited information on which ingredients dietary supplement manufacturers are likely to substitute for ephedrine alkaloids. Given this uncertainty, FDA cannot comment on the safety of potential substitutes. FDA notes that manufacturers bear the burden of ensuring that any ingredients that they may substitute for sources of ephedrine alkaloids meet all safety standards for dietary supplements.   30694  Federal Register / Vol. 62, No. 107 / Wednesday, June 4, 1997 / Proposed Rules CVS stimulatory effects of ephedrine and thus exacerbate the adverse effect. The agency requests comments on whether a separate dietary ingredient limit should be established for ephedrine in addition to ephedrine alkaloids, and if so, what that limit should be. 2. Proposed Compliance Procedures In proposed  111.100(a)(2), the agency states that it will use the high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method as specified in LIB No. 4053 to determine the level of ephedrine alkaloids in a dietary supplement. The agency developed this HPLC analytical method to identify and quantify ephedrine alkaloids from botanical sources. It was necessary for the agency to develop an analytical method because the official analytical methods used for the determination of ephedrine alkaloids in pharmaceutical dosage forms are unsuitable for botanical products. Current official analytical methods do not discriminate between ephedrine alkaloids and other alkaloids that may be in the botanicals (e.g., ephedroxane and methylbenzylamine) (Ref. 157). This HPLC method has made possible the resolution and quantification of the several different ephedrine alkaloids known to occur in the Ephedras and other botanicals, including ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, norephedrine, methylephedrine, methylpsuedoephedrine, norpseudoephedrine, and related alkaloids. This method is currently undergoing collaborative evaluation and testing. FDA strongly recommends that manufacturers also use this or other methods that the agency adopts, although manufacturers will be free to use any alternative method that they find appropriate. However, FDA will use whatever method it adopts in this proceeding as the basis for its enforcement actions, and this method will be the legally established method. Therefore, manufacturers would be advised to compare their method of choice to the HPLC method to ensure that the alternative method produces similar results. 3. Proposed Limit for Ephedrine Alkaloids: Frequency and Per Total Daily Intake Basis In addition to proposing a level for ephedrine alkaloids in dietary supplements at or above which their presence will render the product adulterated, the agency is proposing to address its concern that products containing ephedrine alkaloids below the dietary ingredient limit may be used in a manner that increases the likelihood, frequency, and severity of adverse events. Intake of multiple servings of ephedrine alkaloidcontaining dietary supplements, particularly when such intake occurs within a relatively short timeframe (e.g., hours or within a day), can result in an excessive level of ephedrine alkaloids in the body that will increase the likelihood of an acute adverse event and the severity of the event that occurs. Concern over the hazards of taking several servings of ephedrine alkaloidcontaining dietary supplements in a short period of time led several members of the Working Group and of the Food Advisory Committee to recommend that FDA limit the intake of dietary supplements containing ephedrine alkaloids to no more than four to five times per day and establish daily use limits, e.g., the amount of ephedrine alkaloids the consumer should not exceed in a day. In light of this, FDA evaluated the risks associated with different patterns of daily intake of ephedrine alkaloid-containing dietary supplements. The average plasma half-lives for pharmaceutical ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, and phenylpropanolamine are approximately 6 hours (range 3 to 11 hours), 6 hours, and 4 hours, respectively (Refs. 10 through 12, 20, and 46). Generally, this means that after one half-life (e.g., 4 to 6 hours) half of the ephedrine alkaloids still remain in the blood. More than 24 hours are needed for complete clearance of a single serving of ephedrine alkaloids from the body. Because ephedrine alkaloids remain in the body for hours, when additional servings of an ephedrine alkaloid-containing dietary supplement are consumed, the ingested alkaloids are additive to those already in the body. This process will result in an increase in blood and tissue concentrations of ephedrine alkaloids. Generally, the higher the blood and other body tissue levels of ephedrine alkaloids, the greater the likelihood and severity of adverse events (Ref. 46). Given the pharmacological evidence that average plasma half-lives of ephedrine alkaloids are approximately 4 to 6 hours, elevated blood levels of ephedrine alkaloids will be maintained if a serving is consumed every 4 to 6 hours. Because ephedrine alkaloids are stimulant substances, they can cause insomnia if taken close to sleeping hours. Thus, if 6 to 8 hours in a day are typically used for sleeping, there is a period of 16 to 18 hours per day in which consumers of ephedrinecontaining dietary supplements would  it been arrived at in a way that factored in some margin of safety. The evidence does not exist to establish a safe level. FDA notes that many members of the Food Advisory Committee stated that they were unaware of a basis for determining a safe level (Ref. 25). Thus, the agency is concerned about the potential for risk at levels below 8 mg per serving for individuals who are particularly sensitive to the effects of ephedrine alkaloids, or whose sensitivity could be increased through chronic use of these products or other processes (e.g., physical exercise). Given the seriousness of the public health concerns and the uncertainty surrounding the risks attendant upon consumption of ephedrine alkaloids below 8 mg per serving, the agency solicits comments, and asks that they include data, particularly clinical data, on the safety of the use of less than 8 mg of ephedrine alkaloids per serving in dietary supplements. Should data and information become available that demonstrate that the use of less than 8 mg of ephedrine alkaloids per serving in dietary supplements poses a hazard to the public health, or that the level of ephedrine alkaloids that will render a product adulterated is higher than 8 mg per serving, the agency will consider modifying  111.100 accordingly. At this time, the agency is not proposing a level at which ephedrine, as opposed to the mixture of ephedrine alkaloids found in products containing botanicals, may render a product adulterated, even though some members of FDA's Working Group and of the Food Advisory Committee recommended that the agency establish a separate level for ephedrine (Refs. 25 and 27). There is some reason to believe that ephedrine may be particularly significant in contributing to the occurrence of many of the cardiovascular effects seen in the reports of adverse events because ephedrine is often the predominant alkaloid in botanical sources. In addition, ephedrine is known to exhibit more intense cardiovascular effects relative to the other ephedrine alkaloids (Refs. 5 and 9 through 13). For example, serious adverse events have been reported with the use of dietary supplements containing less than 5 mg ephedrine. However, the available data are difficult to interpret because of the uncertainties about the potentially interactive effects of the other ephedrine alkaloids in the raw botanical or botanical extract and the presence of other physiologically and pharmacologically active ingredients in the dietary supplement products that may act to potentiate the overall NS and   Federal Register / Vol. 62, No. 107 / Wednesday, June 4, 1997 / Proposed Rules have interest in consuming this substance. By dividing the 16 to 18 waking hours in a day by the largest average half-life for ephedrine alkaloids (i.e., 6 hours), the results reveal the possibility of taking a maximum of three servings per day. Three servings of a dietary supplement that contains the proposed maximum per serving amount of ephedrine alkaloids (less than 8 mg) would yield a daily intake level of less than 24 mg ephedrine alkaloids. Thus, a dietary supplement product that contains ephedrine alkaloids and whose label or labeling instructs consumers to take 24 mg or more per day would present a significant and unreasonable risk of injury and illness under the conditions of use suggested or recommended in the labeling and thus would render the product adulterated under section 402(f)(1)(A) of the act. Similarly, an ephedrine alkaloidcontaining product whose label or labeling instructs consumers to take 8 mg or more during a 6-hour period would instruct consumers to consume an amount of ephedrine alkaloids that has been shown to cause injury. This labeling also would present a significant and unreasonable risk and render the product adulterated under section 402(f)(1)(A) of the act. FDA tentatively concludes that without a daily use limit, the per serving limit cannot be effective in reducing the potential for adverse events because consumers may unknowingly consume an excessive amount of ephedrine alkaloids by taking several servings of dietary supplements in a relatively short period of time. Therefore, FDA is proposing in  111.100(b) that the labeling of dietary supplements that contain ephedrine alkaloids shall not suggest or recommend conditions of use that would result in intake of 8 mg or more ephedrine alkaloids within a 6-hour period or a total daily intake of 24 mg or more of ephedrine alkaloids. FDA is proposing this regulation under sections 402(f)(1)(A) and 701(a) of the act to ensure that ephedrine alkaloidcontaining dietary supplements do not bear directions for use that will create a significant and unreasonable risk. In some cases, the label directions for use of dietary supplements containing ephedrine alkaloids can cause consumers to exceed the per serving limit or to consume servings more frequently than every 6 hours. For example, FDA would consider the following label instructions to increase the risk of adverse events: ``take what your body needs'' or ``take 1 tablet (containing 7 mg ephedrine alkaloids) per serving, not to exceed 3 tablets per day.'' In the later example, the consumer may believe that it is safe to consume 3 tablets (21 mg ephedrine alkaloids) at one serving or servings separated by less than 6 hours. Examples where the agency would not consider that the directions for use would cause consumers to exceed the per serving limit or take serving more frequently than every 6 hours include ``take 1 tablet per day,'' ``take 1 tablet every 6 hours, do not take more than 3 tablets per day,'' or ``take 1 tablet not more than every 8 hours, do not take more than 2 tablets per day.'' 4. Proposed Limitation on Duration of Use The available data suggest that some types of adverse events may be related to the duration of using ephedrine alkaloids. Long-term use of sympathomimetic agents, such as ephedrine alkaloids, even at relatively low levels, is related to serious adverse events, including cardiomyopathy (i.e., disease of the heart muscle) and myocardial necrosis (death of heart cells and tissue), that can result in death (Refs. 7, 16, 49, 51, and 52). The scientific literature establishes that use of ephedrine alkaloids for a period of several months or years can result in cardiomyopathy (Refs. 66 through 68). Similarly, fatal cardiomyopathies have been seen in the AER's associated with chronic use of ephedrine alkaloidcontaining dietary supplements at serving levels close to the dietary ingredient limit the agency proposed above (ARMS No. 11134 in Refs. 29 and 149a). Concern about these types of adverse events with the long-term use of ephedrine alkaloids led several members of the Working Group (Ref. 27) and of the Food Advisory Committee (Ref. 25) to recommend that, in conjunction with a per serving dietary ingredient limit, FDA require a statement on the label of ephedrine alkaloid-containing dietary supplements to warn consumers not to use the product for a period longer than 7 days. These members stated that a 7-day use limit is standard guidance for the use of pharmacoactive drug substances, including ephedrine alkaloids, and may reduce the occurrence of adverse events related to long-term use of ephedrine alkaloids (Ref. 25). Moreover, a 7-day limit on the use of ephedrine alkaloids is supported by the AER's data, which show that over 60 percent of the adverse events occurred when ephedrine alkaloid-containing dietary supplements were used for more than 7 days.  30695  For these reasons, FDA tentatively concludes that ephedrine alkaloidcontaining dietary supplements that do not bear the statement ``Do not use this product for more than 7 days'' present a significant and unreasonable risk of injury and illness under the recommended or suggested conditions of use. Therefore, under sections 402(f)(1)(A) and 701(a) of the act, to reduce the potential for adverse events occurring as a result of consumers using ephedrine alkaloids for more than a period of 7 days, FDA is proposing to require in  111.100(c) that the label of dietary supplements that contain ephedrine alkaloids state ``Do not use this product for more than 7 days.'' The agency notes that this warning focuses on duration of use, not on when reinstitution of use of ephedrine alkaloids is appropriate. FDA is not aware of definitive data on whether there is a period of time when the reinstitution of use of ephedrine alkaloids will not present a risk of adverse events. FDA solicits comments, particularly data, on this matter. In addition, FDA solicits comments on how consumers will interpret this label statement in terms of reintroducing dietary supplements containing ephedrine alkaloids in their diets. 5. Proposed Prohibition of Ingredients With Stimulant Effects As previously discussed, because the nature and patterns of adverse events observed in the AER's were consistent with the known physiological and pharmacological effects of the ephedrine alkaloids, the agency focused its evaluation on the ephedrine alkaloids. However, the majority of the adverse events that have been reported to FDA have involved the use of dietary supplements that contain ephedrine alkaloids in combination with other ingredients, some with known physiological or pharmacological effects, including kola nut, yohimbe, willow bark, senna, and Uva ursi (Ref. 164). In many cases, the AER's showed that more severe adverse effects (e.g., heart attack, stroke, seizure) occurred with the use of dietary supplements that contained ephedrine alkaloids at levels below 20 mg together with other ingredients than were noted in the scientific literature with the use of ephedrine at 20 mg (Ref. 149a). These observations suggest that the other ingredients may act, in combination with the ephedrine alkaloids, to produce more frequent, more severe, or potentially different patterns of adverse effects than those noted with the use of an ephedrine alkaloid alone.   30696  Federal Register / Vol. 62, No. 107 / Wednesday, June 4, 1997 / Proposed Rules effects include an increased frequency of certain signs and symptoms, e.g., increased heart rate, insomnia, nervousness, and increased blood pressure, that are considered characteristic of sympathomimetic stimulation. Other substances with stimulant effects in combination with ephedrine alkaloids may act to increase the likelihood of an adverse event. Yohimbine from the botanical yohimbe, in small doses, is reported to stimulate part of the nervous system and to cause elevated blood pressure, increased heart rate, tremor, and anxiety (Refs. 176 through 178). Because of their stimulant effects on the nervous system, combining sources of yohimbine with the ephedrine alkaloids may increase the likelihood, frequency, and severity of adverse events. Therefore, the agency tentatively concludes that, based on the available evidence, adverse events may be related to the interactive or additive effects of stimulant substances in combination with ephedrine alkaloids in dietary supplements. This tentative conclusion is supported by statements made by several members of the Food Advisory Committee at the August 27 and 28, 1996, meeting (Ref. 25). For these reasons, the agency tentatively concludes that any dietary supplement that contains ephedrine alkaloids in combination with ingredients that produce the aforementioned effects presents a significant or unreasonable risk of injury or illness under the conditions of use suggested in the labeling or under ordinary conditions of use and are adulterated. To eliminate this risk, under sections 402(f)(1)(A) and 701(a) of the act, FDA is proposing  111.100(d), which states that no ingredient, or ingredient that contains a substance, that has a known stimulant effect (e.g., sources of caffeine, yohimbine) may be included in a dietary supplement that contains ephedrine alkaloids. The agency is aware that several manufacturers and distributors of ephedrine alkaloid-containing dietary supplements also market caffeinecontaining dietary supplements that are intended to be used with a ``companion'' ephedrine alkaloidcontaining dietary supplement. The caffeine-containing dietary supplements are often promoted as ``boosters'' or ``enhancers'' for the ephedrine alkaloidcontaining product. Under these conditions of use, both the caffeinecontaining and the ephedrine alkaloidcontaining dietary supplement products present a significant and unreasonable risk of illness and injury under their labeled conditions of use and consequently are adulterated under section 402(f)(1)(A) of the act. The agency is concerned that many of the dietary supplements implicated in the AER's contained substances that are known to have physiological or pharmacological effects that could increase the risk of adverse events when taken in combination with ephedrine alkaloids. For example, substances that reduce renal clearance interfere with the elimination of ephedrine alkaloids from the body by the kidneys (i.e., renal excretion) (Refs. 180 and 181) and thus may increase the risk of adverse effects when consumed in combination with ephedrine alkaloids. These substances include salicin, which is found in the botanical commonly known as willow bark, and amino acids in high concentrations (Refs. 181 and 182). By reducing renal clearance, higher levels of ephedrine alkaloids are maintained in the blood for longer periods of time, thus prolonging the effects of ephedrine alkaloids. The maintenance of high blood levels of ephedrine alkaloids increases the likelihood of adverse events, particularly in those who may be sensitive to the effects of ephedrine alkaloids. In addition, consumers may experience adverse events if more ephedrine alkaloids are consumed while blood levels are maintained because the absorption of additional ephedrine alkaloids into the bloodstream will result in even higher blood and tissue concentrations of ephedrine alkaloids and in any effects that may follow. Generally, the higher the blood levels of ephedrine alkaloids, the greater the risk of adverse events and the greater the likelihood that the adverse effects that do occur will be severe (Ref. 46). Diuretics and laxative substances in an ephedrine-alkaloid-containing dietary supplement may also increase the likelihood, frequency, and severity of adverse events (Refs. 182 through 186). Uva ursi is a botanical diuretic contained in many ephedrine alkaloid products (Ref. 184). The compounds ursolic acid and isoquercetin found in Uva ursi are mild diuretics. The ephedrine alkaloids also exhibit diuretic effects (Ref. 4). For example, ephedrine has a mild diuretic effect, and pseudoephedrine has a marked diuretic effect. The use of a product that contains ephedrine alkaloids in combination with other substances with diuretic effects increases the likelihood and severity of consequent fluid and electrolyte imbalances, both of which could affect CVS and NS risks. Senna and Cascara are examples of botanicals that contain potent stimulant laxative substances called  Moreover, the clinically significant adverse events that occurred with amounts of ephedrine alkaloids below the 8 mg per serving limit may have been related to the compounding effects of ephedrine alkaloids in combination with other ingredients. Because of the known additive effects that occur when ephedrine alkaloids are combined with certain types of other ingredients, such as stimulants, proposed  111.100(a)(1), by itself, will likely not be effective in reducing the potential for adverse events. Certain types of other substances interact with the ephedrine alkaloids to increase the effects of the ephedrine alkaloids, thereby acting like more ephedrine alkaloids were contained in the product. For example, caffeine is a nervous system stimulant that can induce nervousness, insomnia, and tachycardia (increased heart rate) (Refs. 7, 165, and 166). Intake of toxic levels of caffeine can cause death resulting from CV stimulatory effects (Ref. 46). Various botanicals are known to be sources of caffeine, including green tea, guarana, yerba mate (also known as Ilex paraguariensis), and kola nut (Refs. 167 through 172). The scientific literature reveals that the frequency and severity of adverse effects increase when ephedrine alkaloids and caffeine are combined (Refs. 22, 73, 105, and 106). Recent clinical trials have focused on whether a combination of ephedrine and caffeine would be more effective in the treatment of obesity than ephedrine alone. The usual dosage of ephedrine and caffeine was 20 mg and 200 mg, respectively, given three times a day before meals. The results of these trials, certain of which were carefully designed and conducted to eliminate potential confounders to the interpretation of study results (e.g., concurrent medication usage, underlying diseases and conditions or other risk factors), indicate that the effects, including adverse effects, of combining ephedrine and caffeine are synergistic (Refs. 105, 173, and 174). Caffeine and ephedrine also appear to be synergistic in thermogenesis, i.e., they increase the rate of thermogenesis by influencing different parts of the metabolic pathways (Refs. 173 and 175). While the resulting effects of combining ephedrine and caffeine could have a potentially positive impact on thermogenesis because of their effects on metabolic pathways, it may also account for increased adverse effects seen with combinations of these agents because of increased sympathetic stimulation of other organ-systems (e.g., CVS and NS). The synergistic adverse   Federal Register / Vol. 62, No. 107 / Wednesday, June 4, 1997 / Proposed Rules anthraquinone glucosides (Refs. 185 through 187). Use of excessive amounts of stimulant laxatives can cause stomach cramps, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Chronic use may lead to laxative dependence, diarrhea, and, in severe cases, dehydration and electrolyte disorders (Ref. 188). Ephedrine is known to influence cellular potassium (an electrolyte) concentrations (Refs. 53 and 54). Use of laxative substances in combination with ephedrine alkaloids may act to increase the likelihood, frequency, and severity of adverse events. The agency requests comments, particularly data, on the interactive effects of other ingredients and the ephedrine alkaloids in dietary supplements. Based on the comments and data received by FDA, the agency may prohibit the use of ingredients that produce the aforementioned effects in a dietary supplement that contain ephedrine alkaloids. 6. Proposed Prohibitions on Claims As described previously in section II.C.1. of this document, FDA has received numerous reports of adverse events associated with ephedrine alkaloid-containing dietary supplements promoted for use for weight loss, increased energy, body building, enhanced athletic performance, increased mental concentration, and enhanced well-being and with products promoted to be used as an alternative to illicit street drugs. While many of the products that were associated with adverse events contained more than one type of claim or representation on their label or in their labeling, the majority of adverse events reported to FDA are related to the use of products promoted or used for weight loss or energy purposes. Although fewer of the AER's were associated with products promoted for body building and enhanced wellbeing, clinically serious adverse events, including seizure, heart attack, and death, have been reported to FDA that were associated with the use of products represented for these purposes. At least one death in a young man has been reported with the use of a product promoted as an alternative to an illicit street drug. In reviewing the AER's, it was evident that specific types of claims contained in the labeling of dietary supplements containing ephedrine alkaloids promoted different patterns of use. Claims such as weight loss and body building encouraged long-term use to achieve the product's purported effect (Ref. 189). In addition, claims of increased energy, increased mental concentration, or enhanced well-being, in a number of cases, encouraged shortterm excessive consumption to achieve more of the product's purported effect (Ref. 190). Finally, the agency found that claims that suggest that the product is intended to be used as a substitute for an illicit street drug fostered abuse. Because claims in product labeling may influence how a consumer uses the product, claims in product labeling are a condition of use for dietary supplements. Several Food Advisory Committee members identified a number of significant risks attendant to using dietary supplements containing ephedrine alkaloids for purposes such as weight loss, energy, or as an illicit street drug alternative, including adverse events that are associated with long-term use, excessive consumption, and abuse of ephedrine alkaloids (Ref. 25). Because the identified types of claims promote use patterns that are associated with adverse events, the agency has tentatively concluded that claim restrictions are necessary to maintain the integrity of the limit on the level of ephedrine alkaloids in dietary supplements that it is proposing in  111.100(a)(1) and of the other proposed restrictions on the conditions of use of these dietary supplements. a. Claims that promote long-term use. Claims in the labeling of dietary supplements that use of a product may result in effects such as weight loss or body building promote long-term use of the product because these effects cannot be achieved in a short period of time. Weight loss occurs when caloric intake is reduced or energy expenditure (e.g., exercise) is increased. To lose 1 pound (lb), approximately 3,500 kilocalories (kcal) must be expended by reducing caloric intake or by increasing energy expenditures (e.g., physical activity) or both (Ref. 191). Rapid weight loss is associated with health risks, including increased protein loss from the body stores and increased risk of gallstone formation (Ref. 27). In fasting, over 50 percent of rapid weight reduction is attributable to the loss of body fluids. Risks associated with rapid loss of fluids from the body include hypotension (i.e., reduction in blood pressure) and electrolyte disturbances. Steady weight loss over a longer period of time results in a true weight loss with a reduction of fat stores (Ref. 193). Guidelines recommend that a safe rate of weight loss is 1/2 to 1 lb per week (Ref. 194). Therefore, depending upon the amount of weight loss that the individual desires to achieve, weight loss programs may extend from weeks to months (Ref. 195). Long-term weight loss practices have been documented in the scientific  30697  literature. A survey of weight control practices among 1,431 adults indicated that the average respondent participating in the survey had a weight loss attempt lasting from 5 to 6 months and had averaged one attempt a year for the past 2 years (Ref. 196). In addition, approximately 30 percent of persons trying to lose weight were chronic dieters and had been on weight loss plans at least 1 year (Ref. 196). Thus, this survey indicates that common weight loss practices can be characterized as long-term in duration and recurrent in nature. Conversely, body building involves the building of lean muscle mass by strength and endurance training. The addition of muscle mass can be accomplished only through regular muscle work (weight training or similar conditions) coupled with a caloric increase (Ref. 197). To increase size and strength, a muscle must be exercised at 60 to 80 percent of its capacity several times a week. In addition, a gain of 1 lb of muscle requires about 2,500 extra calories, in addition to the calories needed for the training (Ref. 197). An increase of 700 to 1,000 calories (cal) to the daily diet should support a gain of 1 to 2 lb of lean muscle in 7 days (Ref. 197). Body building systems that include intensive physical training programs, controlled diet, and dietary supplementation purport to achieve results in 6 weeks (Ref. 198), and the individual must continue a training program to maintain or increase the muscle mass. As previously mentioned in section III.C.4. of this document, long-term use of ephedrine alkaloids, even at relatively low levels, is related to serious adverse events, including cardiomyopathy (i.e., disease of the heart muscle) and myocardial necrosis (death of heart cells and tissue), that can result in death. After reviewing the scientific literature and the AER's as well as recommendations by the Working Group and by the Food Advisory Committee, FDA has tentatively concluded that ephedrine alkaloid-containing dietary supplements must bear the statement ``Do not use this product for more than 7 days,'' and that those that do not present a significant and unreasonable risk of injury and illness under the recommended or suggested conditions of use. Significant and safe results from weight loss or body building should not and cannot be achieved within a period of 7 days. An individual could lose approximately 4 lb of body fat in 7 days under complete fasting conditions if the normal energy requirements are 2,000 cal per day. (This assumption is based   30698  Federal Register / Vol. 62, No. 107 / Wednesday, June 4, 1997 / Proposed Rules alkaloids that were promoted for one or more of these purposes. In a number of instances, the consumer took more than directed on the product label and experienced an adverse event (Ref. 190). Claims that promote excessive consumption, even for one or a very limited number of uses, are inconsistent with proposed  111.100 (a)(1) and (b), because they encourage the consumer to take more than directed in the conditions of use set out on the label so that the consumer can achieve the purported effect. In section II.C.2.a. and II.C.2.b. of this document, FDA described data from the clinical literature and AER's that show that consumption of an excessive amount of ephedrine alkaloids in a relatively short period of time is associated with serious adverse events, including seizure, psychosis, mania, heart attack, and death. The agency tentatively concludes that the potential for these serious adverse events to occur with excessive consumption of ephedrine alkaloids is a material fact with respect to consequences that may result from the use of a dietary supplement promoted for short-term effects that encourage excessive consumption, and therefore a material fact that must be disclosed on the label. FDA's authority to require disclosure statements in the labeling of dietary supplement products derives from sections 201(n), 403(a)(1), and 701(a) of the act. Section 201(n) of the act states, ``If an article (e.g., a food or dietary supplement product) is alleged to be misbranded because the labeling or advertising is misleading, then in determining whether the labeling or advertising is misleading there shall be taken into account (among other things) not only representations made or suggested by statement, word, design, device, or any combination thereof, but also the extent to which the labeling or advertising fails to reveal facts material in light of such representations or material with respect to consequences that may result from the use of the article to which the labeling or advertising thereof or under such conditions of use prescribed in the labeling or advertising thereof or under such conditions of use as are customary or usual.'' Under section 403(a)(1) of the act, a food is misbranded if its labeling is false or misleading in any particular. Thus, the omission of a material fact from the label or labeling would misbrand a product. These statutory provisions, combined with section 701(a) of the act, authorize FDA to issue a regulation designed to ensure that persons using ephedrine alkaloidcontaining dietary supplements will receive information that is material with respect to consequences that may result from the use of the supplement under its labeled conditions. Therefore, FDA is proposing in  111.100(f)(1) that the label or labeling for dietary supplements that contain ephedrine alkaloids that purport to be or are represented, either expressly or implicitly, to be used for short-term effects, such as increased energy, increased mental concentration, or enhanced well-being, must state ``Taking more than the recommended serving may cause heart attack, stroke, seizure, or death.'' However, given the significance and the potentially lifethreatening nature of the adverse events that may occur when individuals consume excessive amounts of ephedrine alkaloids, the agency requests comments on whether this statement should appear on the label of dietary supplements containing ephedrine alkaloids, regardless of any claims appearing on the label or in labeling. FDA wants to provide an approach to placement of this information that will give it a prominence that will ensure that it will be read and understood by consumers but that will result in its presentation only once on the label panel or on each page of the labeling. Because the consequences of excessive use of ephedrine alkaloids can be serious, the agency tentatively concludes that this information should be on the same label panel or on the same page of the labeling (i.e., the same field of vision) as the claim. However, FDA is proposing to provide for the use of one disclaimer on the label panel or on each page of labeling in situations in which multiple claims appear on the label panel or page of labeling where repetitive presentation of the disclaimer could be burdensome. FDA tentatively concludes that where the label panel or page of labeling contains multiple claims, and the relationship between each of those statements and the disclaimer can be made obvious, the disclaimer need only appear once on each label panel or in each page of labeling. FDA experience has been that one of the most effective ways of tying two label statements that are physically separate on the same panel is through the use of a symbol such as an asterisk. Symbols have been used within nutrition labeling since its inception in 1973 and have proven to be an effective way of relating labeling information to explanatory footnotes. For example, asterisks have been used adjacent to names of vitamins and minerals present at very low levels to refer the consumer to a footnote stating ``Contains less than  on the fact that 3,500 kcal must be expended to achieve 1 lb of weight loss.) As discussed above, however, this rate of weight loss is not safe or recommended. Regarding body building, lean muscle mass cannot be built in 7 days (Ref. 197). Moreover, the scientific literature evidences that the use of ephedrine alkaloids during intense physical activity, such as body building, increases the risks of serious adverse events. Use of ephedrine alkaloids during periods of intense physical activity results in enhanced or synergistic actions on the sympathetic nervous system. It is through such enhanced physiological processes that chronic effects on the heart, such as myocardial necrosis (i.e., death of heart cells and tissue), can occur with prolonged use of ephedrine alkaloids (Refs. 16 and 197a). Because safe and significant weight loss and body building cannot be achieved in a 7-day period, claims that promote these uses promote long-term use of ephedrine alkaloid-containing dietary supplements, which has been associated with serious adverse events. For this reason, FDA tentatively concludes that any claims that promote long-term use of ephedrine alkaloid dietary supplements, such as those for weight loss and body building, promote conditions of use that present a significant and unreasonable risk of illness and injury. Therefore, under sections 402(f)(1)(A) and 701(a) of the act, the agency is proposing in  111.100(e) to prohibit dietary supplements that contain ephedrine alkaloids from being represented, either expressly or implicitly, for use for longterm effects such as weight loss or body building. b. Claims that promote short-term excessive consumption. Many claims found on the labels of, or in the labeling for, ephedrine alkaloid-containing dietary supplements, including increased energy, increased mental concentration, and enhanced wellbeing, encourage the consumer to take more of the product than is indicated on the label to achieve more of the purported effect. Several members of the Food Advisory Committee stated that when a product is promoted to increase these types of effects, the claim encourages the consumer to exceed the labeled directions for use to gain more of the desired effects (Ref. 25). For example, if a product is promoted for energy, the consumer is encouraged to take more to gain greater energy. Many of the AER's received by the agency were associated with dietary supplements containing ephedrine   Federal Register / Vol. 62, No. 107 / Wednesday, June 4, 1997 / Proposed Rules 2 percent of the Daily Value (formerly the U.S. Recommended Daily Allowance).'' FDA is unaware of any data indicating consumer difficulties with such use of symbols. The use of symbols would also help differentiate between the label statements to which the disclaimer is referring and the other label claims to which the disclaimer does not apply (e.g., authorized health claims or nutrient content claims). The agency points out that the proposed requirements for the disclaimer also extend to labeling: There are potentially many vehicles (e.g., placards, pamphlets, catalogs, books) that would have to bear the disclaimer. The agency is concerned that the disclaimer be prominent in these forms of labeling. Even with the flexibility of the use of an asterisk to tie the claim and the disclaimer to a single claim, the disclaimer could be obscured in pages of text of a package insert, pamphlet, or book if it did not appear on the same page or panel (i.e., in the same field of vision) as the claim itself. Because of the variety of possibilities for the presentation of the disclaimer, the agency tentatively concludes that for labeling, as for labels, it is important that the disclaimer appear within the same field of vision, that is, on each package panel or page where a claim is made. Section 403(f) of the act requires mandatory label or labeling information to be prominently placed on the label with such conspicuousness (compared with other words, statements, designs, or devices, in the labeling) as to render it likely to be read and understood by the ordinary individual under customary conditions of use. In other instances where information must appear in a prominent and conspicuous manner on the product label, FDA has proposed that the information be ``in easily legible print or type in distinct contrast to other printed or graphic matter'' (e.g.,  101.13(d)(2)). Therefore, to be consistent with previous actions and to ensure that the information is presented in a way that makes it likely to be read, FDA tentatively concludes that the information be presented in easily legible print or type in distinct contrast to other printed or graphic matter. FDA has long held that accompanying information should be in a size reasonably related to that of the information it modifies (e.g.,  101.22(i)(2) and 102.5(b)(2)(ii)). More recently, this relative prominence has been expressed as a size no less than that required by  101.105(i) for the net quantity of contents statement, except where the size of the claim is less than two times the required size of the net quantity of contents statement, in which case the accompanying information can be no less than one-half the type size of the information modified, but no smaller than one-sixteenth of an inch (see e.g.,  101.13(g) (1) and (i)(2)). The agency also has long held that onesixteenth of an inch is the minimum type size for disclaimer statements, unless the package complies with  101.2(c)(5) (see e.g.,  101.13(g)(1) and (i)(2)). One-sixteenth of an inch is specified in  101.2(c) as the minimum type size for most other mandatory information on the principal display panel or information panel, e.g., designation of ingredients, name and place of business, and quantitative information for relative claims. Consequently, the agency tentatively concludes that the minimum type size for such information should be onesixteenth of an inch. Accordingly, FDA is proposing to provide for the disclaimer, as outlined above, in  111.100(f)(2). If FDA adopts  111.100(f)(2), the labeling of a dietary supplement that contains ephedrine alkaloids and that purports to be, or that is represented as, useful for short-term effects, such as increased energy, increased mental concentration, or enhanced well-being, would be misleading, and thus misbranded, if it does not include the disclaimer set out in  111.100(f)(1). The agency recognizes that most of the claims that will require the use of the disclaimer, if this proposal is adopted, will be statements that are made subject to section 403(r)(6) of the act. That provision also requires that a disclaimer accompany the statements. In the Federal Register of December 28, 1995 (60 FR 67176), FDA proposed requirements for the disclaimer that is required to accompany statements made under section 403(r)(6) of the act. FDA requests comments on how best to place the disclaimer proposed in this document in conjunction with the disclaimer required under section 403(r)(6) of the act on the label or in labeling of dietary supplements so that both disclaimers will be read and understood by consumers. c. Claims that suggest that the product is intended to be used as a substitute for an illicit street drug. FDA is aware that some ephedrine alkaloid-containing products are being promoted as alternatives or substitutes for such illicit street drugs as MDMA (4-methyl-2, dimethoxyamphetamine), a methamphetamine analogue. MDMA is also known as ``ecstasy,'' ``XTC,'' and ``X.'' The precursor of MDMA is MDA (3,4 methylene dioxyamphetamine), an  30699  amphetamine whose use results in destruction of serotonin-producing neurons that play a direct role in regulating aggression, mood, sexual activity, and tolerance to pain (Ref. 16). Many products claiming to be herbal alternatives to MDMA bear claims on their label or in the labeling that highlight these mood-or mind-altering effects. Such street drug alternative claims do not fall within the scope of the claims that Congress intended to permit on the labels or in the labeling of dietary supplements. The Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994 (the DSHEA) added section 201(ff) to the act (21 U.S.C. 321(ff)), which provides, in part, that the term dietary supplement means a product ``intended to supplement the diet'' that bears or contains one or more dietary ingredients. While Congress did not elaborate in the legislative history on what it intended the phrase ``intended to supplement the diet'' to mean, many of the congressional findings set forth in the DSHEA suggest that Congress intended dietary supplements to augment the diet to promote health and reduce the risk of disease. In using the term ``diet'' in section 201(ff) of the act, Congress did not define this term in either the act or the legislative history. The term ``diet'' is defined in Webster's Dictionary as ``an organism's usual food and drink'' (Ref. 200). Dorland's Medical Dictionary defines ``diet'' as ``the customary allowance of food and drink taken by any person from day-to-day, particularly one especially planned to meet specific requirements of the individual, and including or excluding certain items of food'' (Ref. 201). These definitions suggest that the diet is composed of usual food and drink that may be designed to meet specific nutritional requirements. Under section 201(ff) of the act, dietary supplements are food except for purposes of section 201(g) of the act and thus may be part of, or augment, the diet. These common sense definitions for the term ``diet'' do not encompass alternatives to illicit street drugs. Products promoted to be an alternative to or substitute for an illicit street drug are intended to be used for recreational purposes to effect psychological states (e.g., to ``get high'' or to promote feelings of euphoria). Illicit street drugs are not food or drink and thus, cannot supplement the diet. In addition, use of products claiming to be alternatives to illicit street drugs does not promote health or reduce the risk of disease, the intended use for dietary supplements suggested in the   30700  Federal Register / Vol. 62, No. 107 / Wednesday, June 4, 1997 / Proposed Rules observed (Ref. 149a). Although these AER's are not sufficient to support a lower per serving limit, they do provide cause for concern for lower per serving levels. To reduce the potential for adverse events to occur at these lower per serving levels, FDA tentatively concludes that a warning statement on the labels of dietary supplements containing ephedrine alkaloids is necessary, in conjunction with dietary ingredient limitations and other requirements proposed in this document, to protect the public health. FDA is therefore proposing in  111.100(g) to require that a specific warning statement appear on the labels of dietary supplements containing ephedrine alkaloids. FDA's authority to require label warning statements on dietary supplement products derives from sections 201(n), 403(a)(1), and 701(a) of the act. These statutory provisions authorize FDA to issue a regulation designed to ensure that persons using dietary supplements will receive information that is material with respect to consequences that may result from the use of a product under its labeled conditions. a. Caution statement suggested by industry. Several dietary supplement industry trade groups met with FDA on November 30, 1995, and suggested that dietary supplements containing ephedrine alkaloids bear a specific warning statement (Ref. 199). Representatives from the National Nutritional Foods Association (NNFA), the American Herbal Products Association (AHPA), the Nonprescription Drug Manufacturers Association (NDMA), and the Utah Natural Products Alliance (UNPA) (hereinafter referred to as the dietary supplement industry 2) recommended the following statement: CAUTION: Taking more than the recommended amount will not necessarily increase benefits. Begin use with one-half or less the recommended dose to assess your tolerance. (If Pertinent) Please note: This product contains caffeine and should not be taken by those wishing to eliminate caffeine from their diet. Seek advice from a health care practitioner if you are pregnant or nursing or if you are at risk or are being treated for high blood pressure, heart, thyroid or psychiatric disease, diabetes, depression, seizure disorder, stroke or difficulty in urination due to prostate enlargement. Consult your health care professional before use if you are taking an MAO 2 FDA is using this shorthand for convenience.

In fact, serious adverse events, including cardiac arrhythmia that resulted in death, are associated with the use and abuse of products promoted for use as an alternative to MDMA (see ARMS No. 10862 in Ref. 149a). Because alternatives to illicit street drugs are not intended to be used to supplement the diet, products that purport to be or that are represented, either expressly or implicitly, for use as an alternative to a street drug are not dietary supplements within the meaning of section 201(ff) of the act. Therefore, manufacturers, packers, and distributors cannot take advantage of the exemption for structure function claims from the drug definition in section 403(r)(6) of the act. Because these products are intended to be used to affect the structure and function of the body, they are drugs within the meaning of section 201(g)(1)(C) of the act. 7. Warning Label Statements Several members of the Working Group and of the Food Advisory Committee recommended that specific information be conveyed in a warning or cautionary statement for ephedrine alkaloid-containing dietary supplements (Refs. 25 and 27). Persons having certain diseases or taking specific medications known to interact with ephedrine alkaloids are at risk of suffering adverse events with the use of dietary supplements containing ephedrine alkaloids. Generally, use of ephedrine alkaloids at any intake level by these persons is contraindicated (Refs. 10 through 12, and 55). For these persons, a warning label statement can be a useful means of alerting them to potential consequences that can result from the use of the product. Table 5 identifies groups that are at risk if they use ephedrine alkaloids. In addition, many consumers who are unaware that they are sensitive to the effects of ephedrine alkaloids may not recognize the significance of early warning signs and symptoms as potential indicators of more serious side effects (e.g., dizziness or severe headache may be early symptoms of hypertension or stroke). Under these circumstances, a warning statement could provide information on what actions the consumer should take if certain symptoms occur. FDA has received several AER's, some clinically significant, that were associated with the use of dietary supplements containing ephedrine alkaloids at levels below the level proposed in  111.100(a)(1) where signs and symptoms including high blood pressure, chest pain, increased heart rate, severe headache, and nausea were  inhibitor or any other prescription drug. Discontinue use and consult your health care professional if dizziness, nausea, sleeplessness, tremors, nervousness, headache, heart palpitations or tingling sensations occur. NOT INTENDED FOR SALE TO OR USE BY PERSONS UNDER THE AGE OF 18. KEEP OUT OF REACH OF CHILDREN. DO NOT EXCEED RECOMMENDED DOSE. FDA has carefully considered proposing adoption of the statement suggested by industry. While the agency considers the industry suggestion to be a good starting point, FDA tentatively concludes that some changes are necessary in the statement if it is to fulfill its purpose of fairly warning consumers about the special risks attendant to use of dietary supplements that contain ephedrine alkaloids. b. Tentative conclusions. The dietary supplement industry suggested that the warning statement begin with the term ``caution.'' FDA, however, questions whether this term is adequate to convey the severity of the harm that can result from the use of the product. Because use of ephedrine alkaloid-containing dietary supplements has the potential to cause serious injury to certain subgroups of the population, the agency tentatively concludes that the use of the term ``WARNING'' is warranted. The term ``WARNING'' is commonly used to denote danger, and, therefore, the use of this term will communicate to consumers the harm that could result to the special populations that are the subject of the warning. The dietary supplement industry suggested that the statement include the instruction ``Seek advice from a health care provider if you are pregnant or nursing or if you are at risk or are being treated for high blood pressure, heart or thyroid disease, diabetes, difficulty in urination due to prostate enlargement.'' Several members of the Working Group and of the Food Advisory Committee recommended that a warning statement direct consumers who have certain diseases or conditions that increase the risk of adverse events not to use the product or to see a health care provider prior to using the product (Refs. 25 and 27). The feeling of these members was that a health care provider could assess the potential risks for the individual consumer if he or she uses the product. FDA concurs with this portion of the industry's labeling recommendation. As discussed in section II.C. of this document, based on the scientific literature and the known physiological and pharmacologic effects of ephedrine alkaloids, an individual who is pregnant or nursing, has high blood pressure, heart or thyroid disease, or difficulty in   Federal Register / Vol. 62, No. 107 / Wednesday, June 4, 1997 / Proposed Rules urination because of prostate enlargement has an increased risk for experiencing serious adverse effects with the use of ephedrine alkaloids. However, FDA also tentatively finds that the warning statement should be broadened to address other individuals who may place themselves at particular risk if they consume the product. The relevant scientific literature, case reports and AER's suggest that persons suffering from depression or other psychiatric conditions, glaucoma, or seizure disorders are also at increased risk of experiencing an adverse event if they consume ephedrine alkaloidcontaining products. Use of ephedrine alkaloids during pregnancy or while nursing can cause adverse effects in the fetus or the infant. Ephedrine alkaloids can cross the placental wall and can be absorbed by the fetus when taken by a pregnant woman (Refs. 10 through 12 and 55). Similarly, ephedrine is excreted in the breast milk and can be consumed by the nursing infant. The fetus, infants, and children are sensitive to the effects of ephedrine alkaloids and thus are more likely to experience adverse events (Refs. 39 and 41). Use of ephedrine alkaloids by persons with high blood pressure can result in blood pressure elevations or loss of adequate medical control of hypertension (Ref. 64) which increases the risk of serious consequences (e.g., stroke and heart attack) (Refs. 62 and 70). Because ephedrine alkaloids also interfere with the regulation of serum potassium levels (Refs. 53 through 55), individuals with heart disease who use ephedrine alkaloids are at greater risk of cardiac dysrhythmias (i.e., abnormal heart rhythms) (Refs. 18 and 56), myocardial ischemia (i.e., inadequate circulation of blood and oxygen to the heart muscle), and infarction (i.e., death or damage of heart cells, also called heart attack) (Refs. 57 through 61). With respect to thyroid disease, individuals with hyperthyroidism (resulting from increased secretion of thyroid hormone) show increased sensitivity to adrenergic agents, such as ephedrine alkaloids, which can result in thyroid storm with dire consequences (e.g., cardiac dysrhythmias, congestive heart failure, coma, and death) (Refs. 39, 41, 55, and 202). For persons with diabetes, use of sympathomimetics can result in an increase in blood sugar and loss of diabetic control (Refs. 29, 41, and 51). In addition, ephedrine can cause constriction of the urinary bladder sphincter and ultimately lead to dysuria (increased, painful, or difficulty in urination). This condition is not only associated with prostate enlargement or only seen in men. Published case reports and AER's received by the agency document the finding that urinary retention following the use of ephedrine alkaloid-containing products can occur in both females and males, including young boys without any history of prostate enlargement (see ARMS No. 10298 and 11164 in Ref. 149a and Refs. 102, 103, 123, and 124). Use of ephedrine alkaloids by persons suffering from depression or other psychiatric conditions increases the risk for the occurrence of serious adverse events, including psychosis and mania (Refs. 81 through 96, 98, 99, 109, and 220). Because ephedrine can cause an increase in intraocular pressure (i.e., pressure inside the eyeball), use of ephedrine alkaloids by persons with glaucoma will worsen this disease, which over time, can result in blindness (Refs. 39 and 41). Finally, persons with seizure disorders who use ephedrine alkaloids have an increased risk for experiencing a seizure (Refs. 63, 65, and 80). Because the nature of the risks associated with the use of ephedrine alkaloids for persons who have the diseases and health-related conditions listed above, it is important that these consumers be advised to consult a health care provider before using ephedrine alkaloid-containing dietary supplements. With regard to the statement in industry's suggested statement ``if you are at risk or are being treated for high blood pressure * * *,'' the agency considers it unlikely that consumers will be able to adequately evaluate their risk for developing the conditions listed in this statement. Most of these conditions are not self-diagnoseable. In addition, individuals who have a disease or condition listed in this statement, but who are not currently being treated, may believe that they are not at risk of experiencing an adverse event. Consequently, the agency tentatively concludes that the warning statement needs to include an instruction to consult a health care provider before using an ephedrine alkaloid-containing dietary supplement. The dietary supplement industry statement only instructs the consumer to consult his or her health care professional before use if he or she is taking an MAOI or any other prescription drug. FDA tentatively concludes that this statement should be broader because of the need for professional help in assessing the risks of ephedrine alkaloid intake with a range of conditions. However, people using MAOI drugs should not use ephedrine alkaloid-  30701  containing products at all. Several members of the Working Group and of the Food Advisory Committee recommended that the warning statement advise consumers not to use the dietary supplements containing ephedrine alkaloids if they are taking these types of drugs (Refs. 25 and 27). Because the use of MAOI drugs in combination with ephedrine alkaloids results in blood pressure elevations and increases the risk of serious consequences (e.g., stroke and heart attack), FDA is proposing to warn against use of ephedrine alkaloidcontaining products in this circumstance (Refs. 10 through 12, 39, 41, and 55). Because persons remain at risk while the MAOI drug remains in the body, FDA tentatively concludes that consumers need to be informed that it may take up to 2 weeks for the MAOI drug to clear the body (Refs. 203 and 204). Because MAOI drugs increase the effects of sympathomimetic agents, and consequently will increase the frequency and severity of adverse effects, persons taking such drugs should be given as much information as possible. The agency is concerned that some patients may not be fully informed about MAOI drugs, may not fully understand or remember all the information given to them, or with the passage of time, may forget or lose information that has been provided. Thus, the warning statement needs to be as informative as possible. Rather than include general language, such as ``any prescription drug'' in the warning statement, FDA tentatively finds that it is important to identify specific types of prescription and OTC drugs that contain ingredients that in combination with ephedrine alkaloids are known or expected to increase the likelihood, frequency, or severity of adverse effects. Therefore, FDA tentatively concludes that consumers need to be warned not to use ephedrine alkaloid-containing dietary supplement in combination with specific drugs, such as drugs for depression, psychiatric or emotional conditions (Refs. 10 through 12, 55, and 205); drugs for Parkinson's disease (Ref. 55); methyldopa (Ref. 206); or any product containing ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, or phenylpropanolamine (ingredients often found in allergy, asthma, cough/ cold and weight control products) (Refs. 180 and 207 through 209). FDA tentatively finds that the drug methyldopa needs to be identified on the label. It increases the pressor results of sympathomimetic agents, such as ephedrine alkaloids, resulting in hypertension (Ref. 206). FDA has   30702  Federal Register / Vol. 62, No. 107 / Wednesday, June 4, 1997 / Proposed Rules symptoms occur. A health care professional will be able to evaluate the significance of the signs and symptoms, determine the risks of more serious adverse events occurring, and prescribe any treatment that may be necessary. The effects, such as tremor, sleeplessness, and tingling sensations, that are included in the instruction suggested by the industry are not usually clinically serious and will likely cease once the product use is discontinued (Refs. 210). For these reasons, FDA tentatively concludes that the statement needs to include the instruction to ``Stop use and call a health care professional immediately if dizziness, severe headache, rapid or irregular heart beat, chest pain, shortness of breath, nausea, noticeable changes in behavior, or loss of consciousness occur.'' The dietary supplement industry suggested that the statement include a direction for the consumer not to exceed the recommended dose. Members of the Working Group and of the Food Advisory Committee recommended that the warning statement include a direction for the consumer not to exceed the recommended serving or dose (Refs. 25 and 27). The agency concurs with the industry's suggestion. FDA tentatively finds that this type of statement is necessary to provide information instructing the user not to consume the product excessively. Excessive consumption of ephedrine alkaloids is associated with adverse events, including heart attack, stroke, seizure, and death. Therefore, the statement is a material fact about the consequences of use of the product. However, FDA has used the term ``serving'' rather than ``dose,'' because the agency considers the term ``serving'' to be more appropriate for use on a food label. The dietary supplement industry suggested that the statement include the instruction that ``Taking more than the recommended amount will not necessarily increase benefits.'' Similarly, the Working Group suggested that the warning statement contain the instruction that ``Larger quantities may not be more effective.'' The agency is not aware of any data or other information that establishes that there are benefits from the use of dietary supplements containing ephedrine alkaloids. Therefore, the agency would be concerned about requiring a statement on the label that implies a judgment (that the product has benefits) that the agency has not made. While some questions can be raised in this regard under section 403(r)(6) of the act, the agency considers them to be moot because the instruction for the consumer not to exceed the recommended serving eliminates the need for the ``Taking more than recommended * * *'' statement. The dietary supplement industry suggested that the statement advise the consumer to: ``Begin use with one-half or less the recommended dose to assess your tolerance.'' The agency addressed limiting the levels of ephedrine alkaloids contained in dietary supplements in proposed  111.100 (a)(1) and (b). In addition, because of label space constraints, the agency is trying to keep the warning statement as short as possible. Therefore, FDA tentatively concludes that there is no reason to require inclusion of this information. The dietary supplement industry recommended the following in a caution statement, if appropriate for the product: ``This product contains caffeine and should not be taken by those wishing to eliminate caffeine from their diet.'' The Food Advisory Committee also suggested that other stimulants with their source, such as caffeine from Kola nut, be identified on the label of a dietary supplement containing ephedrine alkaloids. However, the agency is proposing to prohibit stimulant substances in combination with ephedrine alkaloids in dietary supplements. Therefore, FDA tentatively concludes that there is no reason to require the inclusion of such a statement. The dietary supplement industry recommended that the direction ``Not for use by persons under the age of 18'' be included in the warning statement. Several members of the Working Group and of the Food Advisory Committee suggested that the warning statement include a direction that the product is not intended for use by persons under the age of 18. The agency has received limited reports of adolescents abusing or misusing ephedrine alkaloid-containing dietary supplements. Moreover, the agency has stated elsewhere in this document that claims implying usefulness of these products as alternatives to illicit street drugs render the product an unauthorized drug. FDA considers that removal of alternative street drug claims from the labeling of dietary supplements will significantly reduce or eliminate the appeal of these products to adolescents and therefore is not proposing to require that this direction be included in the warning. However, the agency requests comments on whether the direction ``not for persons under the age of 18'' should be included.  reached a similar tentative judgment with respect to ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, and phenylpropanolamine because each of these substances, in combination with an ephedrine alkaloid-containing dietary supplement, could lead to an additive effect and consequently increase the risk of serious adverse events. While many consumers may not be familiar with the term ``ephedrine,'' ``pseudoephedrine,'' or ``phenylpropanolamine,'' they may be aware of the type of product being taken for a specific condition or ailment, e.g., allergy, asthma, cough/cold, and weight control products. The agency recognizes that because of the large number of drugs for depression, psychiatric or emotional conditions, and Parkinson's disease that are contraindicated for use with ephedrine alkaloids and the limited amount of space on the labels of dietary supplements, not all of them can be listed on the label. However, the conditions for which the consumer is taking the drug can be identified, using less label space. If consumers are unsure whether their drug may interact with the ephedrine alkaloids, they should be cautioned to check with their health care professional before using the dietary supplement. The dietary supplement industry suggested that the statement include the instruction ``Discontinue use and consult your health care professional if dizziness, nausea, sleeplessness, tremors, nervousness, headache, heart palpitations or tingling sensations occur.'' Several members of the Working Group and of the Food Advisory Committee also recommended that any warning statement include information on what actions the consumer should take if certain symptoms occur (Refs. 25 and 27). Signs and symptoms, such as dizziness, severe headache, rapid or irregular heart beat, chest pain, shortness of breath, nausea, sleeplessness, noticeable changes in behavior, or loss of consciousness are often early warning signs of serious illness or injury, including heart attack, stroke, or seizure. It is important that the consumer stop using the product if these signs or symptoms occur because continued use of the product may aggravate the adverse effects. The agency tentatively finds that the terms ``stop'' and ``call'' should be used for ``discontinue'' and ``consult,'' respectively, because they are more simple and direct terms. The proposed warning statement instructs the consumer to call a health care professional if any of the listed   Federal Register / Vol. 62, No. 107 / Wednesday, June 4, 1997 / Proposed Rules The industry group's statement included the instruction ``Keep out of reach of children.'' Children show increased sensitivity to the effects of sympathomimetic agents compared to adults (Refs. 39 and 41) and are, therefore, at increased risk for experiencing adverse events from the use of ephedrine alkaloids. The agency has limited data and information that dietary supplements containing ephedrine alkaloids are being given to, or are associated with accidental overdosage by, children. FDA requests comment, particularly data, on whether this statement is necessary to alert consumers to the fact that ephedrine alkaloid-containing dietary supplements should not be made available to children. c. The agency's proposal. Based on FDA's authority under sections 201(n), 403(a)(1), and 701(a) of the act, the agency proposes to require manufacturers to include the warning statement set out in  111.100(g)(1) in the labeling of their ephedrine alkaloidcontaining products. The agency tentatively finds that the warning statement is necessary to disclose material facts about the consequences of using the product, and that it will help to reduce the risk that some individuals will experience an adverse event from using this type of product. The agency solicits comments on all aspects of the warning statement, including data to support any specific instruction. The agency also solicits comments on approaches to shorten or simplify the warning statement. Because substances contained in ingredients (e.g., ephedrine alkaloids contained in Ephedra) are not required to be listed in the ingredient list on the label of dietary supplements, the agency is concerned that consumers and health care providers may not be aware that ephedrine alkaloids are contained in the product and thus may not necessarily recognize the seriousness of the symptoms listed in the statement, when they occur. FDA requests comments on whether the warning statement should disclose that ephedrine alkaloids are contained in the product. In addition, the agency is concerned that some AER's suggest that a pattern of starting and stopping use of dietary supplements containing ephedrine alkaloids may increase an individual's susceptibility to experiencing adverse events. FDA requests comments on whether the warning statement should disclose the possibility of increasing the risk of adverse events by a pattern of stopping and starting use. Based on the comments received by FDA, the warning statement proposed below may need to be modified. In an effort to promote uniformity in labeling, FDA is proposing to require that the warning statement appear on the labels of ephedrine alkaloidcontaining dietary supplements in the exact manner presented in proposed  111.100(g)(1), except when the disclaimer proposed in  111.100(f) appears on the same label panel as the warning statement, in which case the instruction ``Do not exceed recommended serving'' would not have to appear in the warning statement. However, the agency recognizes that other ingredients that may be used in ephedrine alkaloid-containing dietary supplements may have consequences of use that need to be disclosed on the label. The agency requests comments on how to allow for warning statements for other ingredients in conjunction with the ephedrine alkaloid warning statement on the label of dietary supplements. In addition, the agency solicits comments on the format of the warning statement to improve its clarity (e.g., should the statement be set out in bullets). d. Placement of warning statement on label. The agency intends to provide an approach to the placement of the warning label statement to give manufacturers flexibility to design their own label warning formats, while ensuring that consumers are given adequate notice of the information contained in the warning. Section 403(f) of the act requires that information appearing on the label or labeling be prominently placed and appear with such conspicuousness (as compared with other words, statements, designs, or devices, in the labeling) as to render it likely to be read by the ordinary individual under customary conditions of use. In the agency's rulemaking that mandated warning statements on certain protein products, the agency decided not to mandate specific requirements for type size and other format elements. However, the agency did require that the warning statement appear ``prominently and conspicuously on the principal display panel of the package label'' ( 101.17). In addressing the placement of the label warning, the agency noted that the seriousness and nature of the risks associated with the use of protein products in very low calorie diets was sufficient to require placement of the warning statement on the principal display panel ( 101.17). FDA tentatively concludes that the warning statement that it is proposing must appear prominently and conspicuously on the label of dietary  30703  supplements containing ephedrine alkaloids so that consumers are given adequate notice of the information contained in the warning. While the risks associated with the use of dietary supplements containing ephedrine alkaloids are serious, the agency is not proposing to require that the warning label statement for dietary supplements containing ephedrine alkaloids appear on the principal display panel. The agency recognizes that, because of the length of the required warning statement, in many cases it may be impracticable for the warning statement to appear on the principal display panel without interfering with the placement of other information that is required to appear on that panel. The requirement in the act for prominent display means that the warning statement must be presented on the label or labeling in a manner that renders it as readily observable and likely to be read. In this regard, the agency's experience with the graphic requirements for the new nutrition label has been that a box around required label information greatly increases the prominence of the information placed inside the box. Moreover, focus group discussions regarding warning labels show that messages put in a boxed area help consumers to distinguish the message from other information as well as draw attention to it (Ref. 210a). Therefore, FDA is proposing to require in  111.100(g)(3) that the warning statement for ephedrine alkaloidcontaining dietary supplements be separated from other information by a box. If FDA adopts these regulations, manufacturers will have the flexibility to design their own label and warning label format subject to  111.100(g)(3). Section 201(k) of the act defines the term ``label'' as ``a display of written, printed, or graphic matter upon the immediate container of any article'' and further states a requirement that ``any word, statement, or other information appear on the label shall not be considered to be complied with unless such word, statement, or other information also appears on the outside container or wrapper, if any there be, of the retail package of such article * * *.'' Thus, if FDA adopts its proposal to require that a warning statement appear on the label of ephedrine alkaloid-containing dietary supplements, the warning statement would also have to appear on the retail package of such a product, if that package is not the immediate container. FDA requests comments on these proposed requirements for placement of the warning statement.   30704  Federal Register / Vol. 62, No. 107 / Wednesday, June 4, 1997 / Proposed Rules applicable to humans, or whose results establish intake-response curves for ephedrine alkaloids in dietary supplements and that could be used to establish a level of ephedrine alkaloids that are safe for consumers to use in dietary supplements. The intakeresponse relationships between ephedrine alkaloids and their effects in humans are unknown for both botanical sources and marketed dietary supplement products containing ephedrine alkaloids. Moreover, because there are consumers who may be sensitive to the effects of ephedrine alkaloids because of a variety of factors that are not readily identifiable or predictable, a margin of safety based on classical toxicological principles likely cannot be determined. For these reasons, the agency tentatively finds that the use of a classical toxicological approach to determine a safe level of ephedrine alkaloids in dietary supplements is not a usable approach. Several members of the Food Advisory Committee recommended that FDA consider the risk associated with the use of dietary supplements containing ephedrine alkaloids in the context of any benefit that the consumer may receive from the use of these products (Ref. 25). In applying a risk-tobenefit calculation, a certain amount of risk may be accepted if there is a meaningful benefit to be gained by the consumer (Ref. 25). However, the Food Advisory Committee members were unable to identify a benefit for ephedrine alkaloids in terms of supplementing the diet (Ref. 25). Moreover, risk-benefit analysis is something that is done under the act for drugs, not food. Several members of the Working Group suggested that any limitations on the level of ephedrine alkaloids in dietary supplements be based on the use of pharmaceutical ephedrine in OTC oral bronchodilator drugs and the use of Ephedra in traditional herbal medicine (Ref. 27). Other members of the Working Group and several members of the Food Advisory Committee found difficulty in extrapolating from OTC drug data because the products, the populations using the products, and intended use of the products are dissimilar (Ref. 25). In addition, the latter members were concerned about the potential for adverse events to occur, particularly in populations sensitive to the effects of ephedrine alkaloids, if therapeutic levels of ephedrine are used in dietary supplements (Ref. 25). Several members of the Food Advisory Committee were also concerned about using data from the use of Ephedra in traditional herbal therapies to support the safety of the use of ephedrine alkaloids in dietary supplements because the therapeutic use of ephedrine alkaloids has traditionally not involved the same conditions, the same populations, or the same purposes as those under which dietary supplements are used (Ref. 25). The agency considered the applicability of OTC drug data and tentatively concluded that these data, which involve use in a restricted population (physician-diagnosed mild asthmatics) under limited directions for use (i.e., not to exceed 12.5 to 25 mg every 4 hours, not to exceed 150 mg in 24 hours) and with warnings and contraindications for use, has no application here. The determination of safety for drugs is based on a weighing of the proven benefits of the use of the product against the risks. This approach may not be used with foods under section 402(a) of the act. The only question for food use under this section is whether it will cause harm or not. While the concept of ``unreasonable risk'' as stated in section 402(f)(1)(A) of the act, may imply that some evaluation of effects, including risks and benefits, is appropriate for dietary supplements, it is not necessary to reach that question here, because, as stated above, there are no demonstrated benefits for ephedrine alkaloids. Moreover, the risks attendant on consuming dietary supplements containing levels of ephedrine permitted in oral bronchodilator drugs (12.5 to 25 mg ephedrine per dose) are manifest. In addition, there is no basis for extrapolating from data from a subgroup of the population, diagnosed asthmatics, who may be less sensitive to the effects of ephedrine (Ref. 25) than the general population, to the general population, among which a significant number of people are known or suspected of being very sensitive to ephedrine. Finally, the agency finds it inappropriate to extrapolate data from the use of OTC ephedrine-containing drugs because dietary supplements contain a mixture of several ephedrine alkaloids and a variety of other ingredients, including vitamins, minerals, other botanicals, and other physiological and pharmacologically active substances, while OTC drugs contain only a single ephedrine alkaloid. The presence of other alkaloids and substances in dietary supplements may act to increase the likelihood, frequency, and severity of adverse events from the use of these products. In fact, clinical studies show that adverse events are more likely to occur when ephedrine is combined with other substances, such as caffeine. Therefore, the fact that pharmaceutical ephedrine  In addition to this proposed regulation, the agency has issued proposed and final rules on dietary supplements, including premarket notification procedures for new dietary ingredients (61 FR 50774, September 27, 1996) and label warning statements and unit dose packaging requirements for iron containing dietary supplements (62 FR 2218, January 15, 1997). The agency has proposed to codify each of the proposed and final regulations in different parts of the Code of Federal Regulations. The agency believes that it would be easier for consumers as well as for the dietary supplement industry to find and use regulations for dietary supplements if they were consolidated into one part of the CFR. Accordingly, FDA is proposing to revise part 111 to consolidate the regulations for dietary supplements. FDA is proposing to change the title of part 111 from ``Current Good Manufacturing Practice for Dietary Supplements'' to ``Dietary Supplements.'' This is necessary to reflect that other regulations for dietary supplements in addition to regulations for current good manufacturing practice will be contained in this part. FDA is proposing to establish four subparts in part 111: Subpart A--General Provisions, Subpart B--Current Good Manufacturing Practice for Dietary Supplements, Subpart C--New Dietary Ingredients, and Subpart D--Restricted Dietary Ingredients. The labeling provisions for dietary supplements will continue to be placed in 21 CFR part 101. D. Other Approaches Considered by the Agency In choosing the proposed approach to limit the risks presented by ephedrine alkaloids in dietary supplements, the agency considered, but rejected, several other approaches. Because the act does not allow premarket review authority for dietary supplements, FDA has no data and information to establish conditions of use that will ensure the safe use of ephedrine alkaloidcontaining dietary supplements. Therefore, the only viable approach available to FDA is one in which the agency prohibits levels of a substance in, or conditions of use for, a dietary supplement that it can prove may render the product injurious to health or that present a significant or unreasonable risk of illness and injury under the conditions of use suggested or recommended in the labeling or under ordinary conditions of use. The agency is unaware of any classical toxicological studies whose results identify ``no adverse effect levels'' for ephedrine alkaloids directly   Federal Register / Vol. 62, No. 107 / Wednesday, June 4, 1997 / Proposed Rules has been approved by FDA for an OTC use does not provide assurance of safety for the use of ephedrine alkaloids in dietary supplements. The agency considered the applicability of traditional use of botanical sources of ephedrine alkaloids in establishing dietary ingredient levels for ephedrine alkaloids in dietary supplements. A history of long usage of a medicinal herb in traditional therapies does not provide an assurance of safety for a component of a dietary supplement because these conditions of use are so different. The history of use of Ephedra in traditional Asian medicine primarily for the treatment or relief of respiratory symptoms provides insufficient assurance that ephedrine alkaloids will not present a significant or an unreasonable risk of injury to consumers who use dietary supplement products containing ephedrine alkaloids to supplement the diet. Not only are dietary supplements marketed for different uses than the traditional use of Ephedra, most dietary supplements are marketed in a form that is different than the form in which it has been traditionally used, e.g., as a concentrated extract in capsules and tablets, in the presence of other substances rather than the raw botanical in a tea. FDA is not aware of any systematic collection of data related to adverse effects occurring in individuals treated with Ephedra in traditional medicine. However, several reference texts list precautions and contraindications for the use of the botanical Ephedra in traditional medicine preparations (Refs. 6, 14, and 146). Thus, FDA tentatively concludes that use of ephedrine alkaloids in traditional Asian medicine does not provide the basis on which to establish a safe level of use of ephedrine alkaloids in dietary supplements. IV. Analysis of Impacts FDA has examined the impacts of the proposed rule under Executive Order 12866 and the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601612). Executive Order 12866 directs agencies to assess all costs and benefits of available regulatory alternatives and, when regulation is necessary, to select the regulatory approach that maximizes net benefits (including potential economic, environmental, public health and safety, and other advantages; distributive impacts; and equity). Executive Order 12866 classifies a rule as significant if it meets any one of a number of specified conditions, including having an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or adversely affecting in a material way a sector of the economy, competition, or jobs, or if it raises novel legal or policy issues. If a rule has a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities, the Regulatory Flexibility Act requires agencies to analyze regulatory options that would minimize the economic impact of that rule on small entities. FDA finds that this proposed rule is an economically significant rule as defined by Executive Order 12866, and finds under the Regulatory Flexibility Act that this proposed rule will have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. Finally, FDA, in conjunction with the Administrator of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), finds that this proposed rule is a major rule for the purposes of congressional review (Pub. L. 104121). A. Market Failure The market failure addressed by this regulation is that some consumers may not have sufficient information on the health risks associated with dietary supplements containing ephedrine alkaloids to make informed choices concerning the consumption of these products, despite the presence of warning labels of various types on many of these products. Ordinarily, consumers would be expected to seek out and pay for the level of information they consider appropriate with respect to consumption decisions. However, the level of information currently utilized by consumers with respect to these products may be less than optimal because of consumer perceptions that products marketed as foods or derived from botanical sources are inherently safe, and the cost of generating evidence to evaluate the safety of these products may be quite high. In addition, the onset of the adverse health events associated with these products is frequently quite unexpected or occurs without identifiable risk factors, and consumers may have little or no opportunity to adapt their behavior based on experience with the risks of these products prior to suffering a severe adverse event. B. Regulatory Options FDA has the following primary options: 1. Take no action. 2. Take no regulatory action, but generate additional information on which to base a future regulatory action. 3. Take proposed action. 4. Take proposed action, but with a higher potency limit. 5. Ban dietary supplements that contain ephedrine alkaloids.  30705  6. Take proposed action, but do not require warning statement. 7. Require warning statements only. C. Benefits and Costs 1. Option 1--Take No Action By convention, the option of taking no action is the baseline in comparison with which the costs and benefits of the other options are determined. Therefore, neither additional costs nor benefits are associated with taking no action. Although no regulatory costs or benefits are generated if no regulatory action is taken, preventable adverse events will continue to occur if no regulatory action is taken. The number of such adverse events is expected to increase over time because the marketplace for these types of products has been increasing rapidly since the 1994 passage of the DSHEA, and the number of AER's associated with use of these products has also been increasing sharply over the last few years (Figure 1). 2. Option 2--Take No Regulatory Action, but Generate Additional Information on Which To Base a Future Regulatory Action FDA has the option of taking no regulatory action but generating additional information on which to base future regulatory action on this issue. The benefit of generating additional information is a reduction in the substantial uncertainty concerning the specific nature of the relationship of the adverse events associated with dietary supplements containing ephedrine alkaloids and, possibly, a more precisely targeted regulation. A more precisely targeted regulation could imply potency limits either higher or lower than the proposed potency limits, and either more or fewer ingredient and labeling restrictions than those proposed. The cost of generating additional information is the cost of whatever activity is undertaken to generate the additional information and the health cost of any adverse events to these products that would occur if regulatory action were delayed but that would not occur if regulatory action were not delayed. 3. Option 3--Take Proposed Action a. Benefits. The benefit of the proposed action is a potential reduction in the number or severity of adverse events associated with dietary supplements containing ephedrine alkaloids. The proposed rule consists of the following four actions: (1) Per day and per serving potency limits on total ephedrine alkaloids (TEA), (2) restrictions on caffeine and other   30706  Federal Register / Vol. 62, No. 107 / Wednesday, June 4, 1997 / Proposed Rules all ephedrine alkaloids from these products. First, the functional effect, as perceived by consumers, of removing all ephedrine alkaloids from a product is probably greater than the perceived functional effect of removing some of the ephedrine alkaloids and removing some ingredients that interact with those ephedrine alkaloids. Second, if only some firms remove ephedrine alkaloids from their products, relatively close substitutes will exist for the prior formulations of those products because other firms might not remove ephedrine alkaloids from their products. However, if all firms make the same changes in their products, then relatively close substitutes will not exist for the prior formulations of those products. Therefore, the proposed potency limits and other ingredient restrictions are estimated to reduce the number of people consuming these products by between 0 to 33 percent. The effect of the potency limits on the probability of an adverse event for those who continue to consume these products will be addressed later in this section. The proposed warning statement is also likely to reduce the number of people consuming these products because a few of the relevant products do not currently have warning statements, and because, in some cases, the proposed warning statement is more comprehensive, more focused, and more strongly worded than existing warning statements. The only information available on the effect of warning statements on sales concerns diet soft drinks containing saccharin. Following the introduction of warning statements relating to saccharin, annual sales of diet soft drinks containing saccharin were reported to be 15 percent below what they would otherwise have been (Ref. 212). The effect of the proposed warning statement for dietary supplements containing ephedrine alkaloids will probably be smaller than the effect of the saccharin warning label on diet soft drinks because most such supplements already have some type of warning statement. Therefore, the proposed warning statement will probably reduce the number of people consuming these products by 0 to 15 percent. The proposed label claim restrictions are also likely to reduce the number of people consuming these products by making the marketing of these products more difficult. The only information available on the potential effects of label claims on sales concerns ready-to-eat breakfast cereals. Following an advertising campaign relating bran consumption to a reduced risk of developing cancer, sales of high bran breakfast cereals were reported to have increased approximately 40 percent (Ref. 213). The effect of eliminating label claims on dietary supplements containing ephedrine alkaloids will probably be smaller because the claims involved are more general, and because other sources of information on the purported effects of ephedrine alkaloids are readily available or have been used recently enough that consumers are familiar with them. However, approximately 10 percent of the AER's involved supplements labeled as alternatives to street drugs. Assuming that consumers of these products will not purchase these products if they are not labeled as alternatives to street drugs, the labeling restriction will reduce expected adverse events by at least 10 percent. Therefore, the proposed restriction on label claims will probably reduce the number of people consuming these products by between 10 percent and 40 percent. In addition to these consumption effects, the proposed potency limits and ingredient restrictions will probably also decrease the likelihood that those who continue to consume these products will suffer an adverse event. FDA is not aware of clinical information, particularly evidence from well-designed and conducted human studies on the relationship between intakes of ephedrine alkaloids from botanicals and the probability of an adverse event. One method of approaching the estimation of the health benefits of reduced exposure to ephedrine alkaloids is to consider the proportion of adverse event reports that involve products with TEA levels greater than that allowed under the proposed potency limits. FDA was able to obtain information on the actual exposures associated with adverse events for 13 products that provided intakes of less than 20 mg TEA per reported use by multiplying the consumer's reported use level against an FDA product analysis result. These reports provided information on the lower end of the range of estimated intakes by consumers. Among these 13 reports of adverse events associated with intakes of less than 20 mg, 9 involved consumer intakes of between 8 mg and 20 mg/per serving. This approach suggests that the proposed potency limit might reduce the expected number of adverse events by at least 80 percent, although the actual reduction is probably higher because the 13 reports did not include the many adverse event reports that occurred at intakes above 20 mg TEA per serving. On the other hand, the actual reduction might also be lower because the 13 reports did not include  stimulants, (3) mandatory warning statement, and (4) labeling restrictions. To estimate the benefits of these actions, a percentage decrease in the current number of adverse events associated with dietary supplements containing ephedrine alkaloids will be estimated for each regulatory action listed above. The estimated effects of all proposed actions will then be combined to obtain a total reduction in the expected annual number of adverse events. This percentage reduction will then be applied to an estimate of the current number of such adverse events to obtain an estimated number of adverse events avoided per year. The estimate of the current number of adverse events will be based on, but not identical to, the current number of relevant AER's because of uncertainty over a number of issues including, for example, the degree to which the relevant adverse events are reported. These sources of uncertainty will be discussed in greater detail later. Each of the proposed actions may affect the number of adverse events by reducing the number of people who consume the relevant products or by modifying their use of these products in a manner that reduces the risk of an adverse effect. In addition, the potency limits and ingredient restrictions may affect the number of adverse events by reducing the probability that those who consume these products will suffer an adverse event. Each of these effects will be considered in turn, beginning with the effect of the proposed actions on the number of people who consume these products. The proposed potency limits and other ingredient restrictions may affect the number of people consuming these products because they may affect the value placed by consumers on the use of these products. Some information on the likely effect of the proposed potency limits on the consumption of these products comes from a report from one firm that marketed an ephedrine alkaloid-free substitute for a supplement that previously contained ephedrine alkaloids. The sales of the substitute product were reportedly approximately 33 percent lower than the sales of the ephedrine alkaloid-containing product (Ref. 211). In the absence of more specific information, it is reasonable to suppose that a given reduction in sales is associated with a proportionate reduction in the number of people consuming these products. It would not be reasonable to suppose the proposed potency limits and other ingredient restrictions would have a greater effect on the sales of these products than complete elimination of   Federal Register / Vol. 62, No. 107 / Wednesday, June 4, 1997 / Proposed Rules all adverse event reports that occurred at intakes below 20 mg TEA per serving. This approach to estimating the impact of the proposed potency limits assumes that the probability of an adverse event is related to intakes of TEA. If the probability of an adverse event is not related to TEA intake, then the potency limits may result in little or no reduction in the expected number of adverse event reports. For example, if individual sensitivities to ephedrine alkaloids are the major underlying factor in the reported adverse events, then it is possible that there may be no ``safe'' intake for these persons. Based on this information, all that can be said concerning the proposed potency limits is that they may reduce the expected number of adverse events by between 0 to 80 percent. The restriction on other stimulants, including caffeine, should also reduce the probability of an adverse event. Combinations of ephedrine alkaloids and caffeine, at sufficiently high doses, are associated with an increased probability of an adverse event. For example, one study found that 60 percent of the study subjects had an adverse reaction to a combination of 20 mg ephedrine and 200 mg caffeine, while only 44 percent had an adverse reaction to 20 mg ephedrine alone (Ref. 105). Thus, in this study, the presence of 200 mg caffeine appears to have increased the probability of an adverse event from consumption of 20 mg ephedrine by about 50 percent. Comparable information is not available on the effect of combinations of ephedrine and caffeine at lower levels of either ephedrine or caffeine. Similarly, no information is available on the effect of other stimulants or other ephedrine alkaloids. An informal review of 217 adverse event reports featuring dietary supplements suspected of containing ephedrine alkaloids found that 99 reports featured products for which labeled ingredient information was available. Of those reports, 70 percent involved products labeled as containing a source of caffeine. The levels of caffeine and ephedrine alkaloids in these products is not known. Assuming that these adverse event reports are typical of all relevant adverse event reports and that 50 percent of the reported adverse events to products labeled as containing caffeine may have been due to the presence of caffeine in conjunction with ephedrine alkaloids, the restriction on stimulants is estimated to reduce the expected number of adverse events by up to 35 percent. However, the impact of the proposed stimulant restrictions may be somewhat lower because the impact may depend on the levels of stimulants and ephedrine alkaloids involved, and the levels of stimulants and ephedrine alkaloids found in dietary supplements may be lower than the levels used in the study on which this estimate is based. In order to address this possibility, the restrictions on stimulants will be assumed to reduce the expected number of adverse reactions by 25 percent. In order to use the estimated risk reductions discussed above to derive an expected reduction in the number of adverse events, the current number of adverse events must be estimated. There are a number of issues involved in estimating the current number of adverse events based on the number of reported adverse events. The first issue is that the data base of over 600 AER's includes all reports thought to be related to the consumption of ephedrine alkaloidcontaining dietary supplements, even though the nature of the available evidence did not allow specific cause and effect determinations for the majority of individual reports. FDA, therefore, used additional information to provide assurance that the patterns of signs and symptoms associated with the ephedrine alkaloid-containing dietary supplements were likely due to the presence of ephedrine alkaloids in these products. One approach to addressing this issue is to examine the evidence for positive dechallenge and rechallenge when product use is discontinued and reinitiated, respectively. The relationship of the reported adverse events to the consumption of dietary supplements categorized as containing ephedrine alkaloids has been corroborated by dechallenge in about 27 percent of the AER's. Positive rechallenge was reported in about 4 percent of the AER's. The majority of AER's, however, lacked sufficient information to evaluate the presence or absence of dechallenge or rechallenge effects. Therefore, the number of cases in which dechallenge alone or in combination with rechallenge was tried but did not occur is not available; nor is there information on whether dechallenge and rechallenge would have occurred in the large number of reports which lack such information. It is possible that all cases might have been associated with positive dechallenge and rechallenge results if such information were available. On the other hand, a certain number of false reports might also be expected. The proportion of reported adverse events actually related to the consumption of dietary supplements suspected of containing ephedrine alkaloids is  30707  probably between 27 and 90 percent. Within this range, FDA believes the most likely value is around 80 percent and, therefore, tentatively assumes that 80 percent of the reported adverse events are actually related to the consumption of dietary supplements. FDA requests comments on this assumption. The second issue is the uncertainty that all 600 AER's involved products that actually contained ephedrine alkaloids. Confirmation of the presence of ephedrine alkaloids in problem products is not available in all cases. The likelihood of the presence of ephedrine alkaloids is based on the labeling of the products involved, FDA's own market survey (including laboratory analysis of 125 marketed products), and the similarity of the reported adverse events to the known effects of ephedrine alkaloids. The proportion of reported adverse events associated with dietary supplements that involve supplements containing ephedrine alkaloids is probably between 25 and 90 percent. Within this range, FDA believes the most likely value is around 80 percent and, therefore, tentatively assumes that 80 percent of the reported adverse events associated with consumption of dietary supplements involve supplements that contain ephedrine. FDA requests comments on this assumption. The third issue is that the actual number of adverse events is likely to differ from the reported number of adverse events because all adverse events are probably not reported. This issue is particularly important with respect to passive reporting systems that rely on the voluntary submission of data, such as the system used to gather the AER's relevant to this issue. Typical reporting rates for passive reporting systems addressed to adverse events associated with drugs are generally assumed to be on the order of 10 percent. Reporting rates are higher than usual if the potential health risks associated with a particular substance are widely publicized, if the adverse events are considered to be otherwise unusual, and if reports are gathered from a variety of sources. On the other hand, reporting rates would be lower than usual if consumers and physicians assume that dietary supplements are incapable of producing adverse events because they are not drugs or because they are ``natural.'' In order to incorporate this uncertainty, the reporting rate for the relevant adverse events is assumed to be 10 percent. Based on the current number of reported adverse events and the assumptions discussed above   30708  Federal Register / Vol. 62, No. 107 / Wednesday, June 4, 1997 / Proposed Rules myocardial infarctions, dysrhythmias, strokes, and cardiomyopathies. ``Serious NS'' refers to serious nervous system events, including seizures, loss of consciousness, vestibular events, and psychiatric events. ``Less clinically significant'' events may include certain types of dermatological events and gastrointestinal events. The second column is the average annual number of AER's from January 1993 to June 1996. Because the sales of these products is increasing rapidly, and the reports of adverse events are also increasing rapidly (see Figure 1), FDA believes that this is a conservative estimate of benefits. The 3-year average has been used rather than the growth trend because extrapolating short-term growth trends into the future can result in large errors. The third column is the estimated average annual number of adverse events over this time period based on what FDA believes are the most likely values for the relevant assumptions. The fourth column is the estimated reduction in adverse events from all proposed actions, given as a range from low to high. These estimated reductions are based on adding the effects of the proposed actions as summarized in Table 7. The low end of this range represents a 35 percent reduction in the estimated annual adverse events and the high end represents a 100 percent reduction. The estimates have been rounded to the nearest ten. The fifth column is the value of reducing the risk of particular adverse events such that one expected adverse event is avoided per year across the at-risk population, in thousands of dollars. The sixth column is the estimated value of the annual risk reductions for the various adverse events in millions of dollars, given as a range from low to high, rounded to the nearest million.  concerning the relationship between the number of reported adverse events and the underlying number of adverse events, the expected annual number of adverse events involving these products is approximately 1,100 cases. Applying the risk reductions discussed previously for the proposed actions implies a reduction in the health risks from these products such that the expected number of adverse events involving these products will be reduced by between approximately 400 cases and 1,100 cases per year. Based on published estimates of the value consumers might place on reducing the risk of the general types of adverse events involved, these benefits are valued at between $240 million and $670 million per year (Ref. 215). Table 6 summarizes these results. The first column is the type of adverse event. ``Serious CVS'' refers to serious cardiovascular system events, including  TABLE 6.--ESTIMATED VALUE OF ANNUAL RISK REDUCTION FROM PROPOSED ACTIONS Annual reported cases 1 Estimated annual cases 2 Value of estimated risk estiReduction in reduction per Value ofrisk mated estimated ancase reduction nual cases 3 ($ thou($ millions) 5 sands) 4 1040 60170 70190 2050 3080 210600 3901,110 5,000 837 1,483 3 775 0.4 NA 70190 50140 100280 0 2060 0 240670  Type of event  Death ..........................................................................................................

Trends in the data were not extrapolated because of the short timeframe involved. 2 Estimated annual cases are based on the following assumptions: (1) 80 percent of the reported adverse events involving the consumption of dietary supplements suspected of containing ephedrine alkaloids are actually related to the consumption of dietary supplements, (2) 80 percent of the supplements involved in the reported adverse events that are related to the consumption of supplements actually contain ephedrine alkaloids, and (3) 10 percent of adverse events to the dietary supplements containing ephedrine alkaloids are reported. Thus, the estimated number of annual cases is 0.8  0.8  10 times the number of annual reported cases. Considerable uncertainty exists with respect to the validity of the assumptions on which this estimate is based and the actual number of annual cases may be higher or lower than the estimate. 3 The low end of the range of the reduction in estimated annual cases represents a 35 percent reduction in estimated annual cases. The high end of this range represents a 100 percent reduction in estimated annual cases. The 35 percent and 100 percent estimates are based on adding up the estimated effects of the proposed actions, as indicated in Table 7. 4 The value of the risk reduction per case is based on published estimates of the value consumers place on reducing the risk of the general types of adverse events involved (Ref. 215). 5 The value of the estimated risk reduction is based on multiplying the risk reduction per case times the reduction in the estimated annual cases.

Costs. The primary social costs of the proposed actions are the compliance costs, which include the one-time costs associated with relabeling and reformulating the affected supplements and the recurring costs associated with testing for the level of ephedrine alkaloids in conjunction with future product reformulations or changes in ingredients, and the value of the utility losses to any consumers who do not value the reformulated supplements as highly as supplements currently found on the market. This cost must be considered somewhat paradoxical because the cause of this loss of value, the reduction or removal of ephedrine alkaloids, would also reduce or eliminate the risks associated with using these products. In addition, indirect social costs in the form of capital losses and temporary unemployment may arise from the distributive effects of the proposed action, which are discussed below. Some portion of the compliance costs will be borne by manufacturers and distributors of these products, and some portion will be passed on to consumers of these products. Costs borne by manufactures and distributors will be borne by the owners, stockholders, and employees of those firms. In addition to the potential impact of compliance costs, manufacturers and distributors of the dietary supplements containing ephedrine alkaloids will be adversely affected by the reduction in consumption of these products caused by the proposed actions. Also, manufacturers, distributors, and importers of raw or bulk Ma huang and other affected ingredients may be affected by these consumption effects. These effects are distributive effects rather than social costs because they do not involve the loss of productive resources, and because a loss of business in one sector of the economy is generally associated with an increase in business in competing sectors. However, as indicated above, social costs may be involved to the extent that otherwise productive capital investment is lost and temporary unemployment is generated. In addition, distributive effects are obviously very significant to the affected parties.  FDA has previously estimated the cost of relabeling all dietary supplements in the economic impact analysis for the proposal on nutrition labeling of dietary supplements that was published in the Federal Register of December 28, 1995 (60 FR 67184) (the December 1995 proposal). Total discounted labeling costs based on an 18 month compliance period were estimated to be between $52 and $85 million. This cost included recurring testing or analytical costs based on testing the nutrient content of each product an average of once every 5 years. Based on comments to the December 1995 proposal, these estimates were revised in the economic impact analysis of the final rule. The revised estimate was $194 million, with $91 million of these costs occurring in the first 18 months and the remainder being a discounted sum of future analytical costs. In order to use this estimate as a basis for estimating labeling costs for the current proposal, the previous estimate must be adjusted to account for the compliance period associated with this rule and the fact that not all dietary supplements contain ephedrine alkaloids. The proposed effective date of any regulation based on this proposal will be 180 days after the date of publication of the final rule. If the nutritional labeling rule had a compliance period of 180 days rather than 18 months, the total estimated labeling costs would have been $334 million, with $286 million of these costs occurring in the first 6 months. Adjusting the previous estimate to account for the fact that not all dietary supplements contain ephedrine alkaloids requires information on the proportion of dietary supplements that contain ephedrine alkaloids. The market surveys identified 125 dietary supplements suspected of containing ephedrine alkaloids. A public comment submitted to the Special Working Group of the Food Advisory Committee suggested the number of such products is at least 200 (Ref. 216). In the December 1995 proposal, the total number of dietary supplement products was estimated to be between 4,000 and 25,000. In the final rule entitled ``IronContaining Supplements and Drugs: Label Warning Statements and Unit-  Dose Packaging Requirements'' that published in the Federal Register of January 15, 1997 (62 FR 2218), this estimate was revised to 29,000. If 200 dietary supplements contain ephedrine alkaloids, then about 1 percent of the estimated total number of dietary supplements contain ephedrine alkaloids and the cost of changing the labels on dietary supplements containing ephedrine alkaloids would be about 1 percent of the costs estimated for changing the labels on all dietary supplements. Another method of estimating the proportion of dietary supplements that contain ephedrine alkaloids is to use sales data. This method is complicated by the fact that sales might not be evenly distributed across dietary supplements, implying that the proportion of dietary supplement sales accounted for by supplements that contain ephedrine alkaloids may not be the same as the proportion of dietary supplement products that contain ephedrine alkaloids. Ma huang and other ephedra products have been reported to represent 3.5 percent of individual botanical sales in selected health food stores, while individual sales of products containing single botanicals are estimated to make up about 53 percent of total botanical supplement use (Ref. 3). Information is not available on the proportion of products with multiple botanical ingredients that contain ephedrine alkaloids. Botanical supplement retail sales have been estimated to have accounted for approximately 26 percent of total dietary supplement retail sales in 1995 (Ref. 217). However, this estimate includes a number of product categories under dietary supplements that would not be considered dietary supplements under the legal definition of a dietary supplement. After adjusting for the definition of dietary supplements, supplements containing botanicals accounted for approximately 35 percent of dietary supplement retail sales in 1995. The definition of dietary supplement used in this estimate includes vitamins, minerals, and botanical (including herbal) supplements. If all supplements containing ephedrine alkaloids are characterized as   30710  Federal Register / Vol. 62, No. 107 / Wednesday, June 4, 1997 / Proposed Rules will either have to be reformulated or removed from the market. The number of dietary supplements containing ephedrine alkaloids has been estimated, above, to be between 200 and 5,000. Under this assumption, if all products were reformulated, the one-time cost of reformulating the affected products would be between $0.2 million and $25 million. The recurring costs associated with testing for ephedrine alkaloid levels in conjunction with future product reformulations was addressed in the labeling costs. Another cost associated with product reformulation is the cost of any inventory losses involving products produced prior to the publication of a final rule based on this proposal that cannot be sold by the date that final rule goes into effect. The proposed effective date of any final rule on this issue is 180 days after publication of the final rule. FDA has no information on the amount of inventory typically carried for these products, but tentatively assumes that 180 days will provide sufficient time to utilize existing stock. In addition to the compliance costs discussed above, the proposed action will also lead to utility losses for some consumers because it removes products with certain characteristics from the marketplace. Theoretically, the value of this utility loss is the difference in the value consumers placed on the eliminated products and the value of the products purchased in place of the eliminated products. Estimating this loss requires estimating demand curves for the eliminated products and for the products substituted for the eliminated products. Identifying likely substitutes for dietary supplements as currently formulated is complicated by the fact that a wide range of effects are attributed to these supplements, for example, energy, weight loss, body building, and increased mental concentration. However, little reliable information is available on the actual effects produced by these supplements. In addition, various other botanical substances exist that might be used in supplements to replace either some portion of the ephedrine alkaloids or the restricted ingredients and might produce effects that consumers may perceive to be similar to the effects that consumers attributed to these supplements as currently formulated. Finally, FDA has insufficient information to estimate demand curves for dietary supplements containing ephedrine alkaloids or potential substitutes for these products. Based on these considerations, FDA cannot place bounds on the value of the consumer utility losses that may be associated with this action. However, if substitute products could be identified, then the absolute price difference between the affected products and the substitute products would represent a lower bound on consumer utility losses. No comparable argument is available for the upper bound of the utility loss. In addition to compliance costs and utility losses, the proposed action will also generate distributive effects. The total reduction in the consumption of dietary supplements containing ephedrine alkaloids from all proposed actions including the potency limits, ingredient restrictions, labeling restrictions, and mandatory warning statement was estimated in the analysis of the benefits of this option to be between 10 percent and 33 percent. Total annual sales of supplements containing Ma huang have been estimated to be between $600 million and $700 million (Ref. 219). Therefore, sales of these products may be reduced by between $60 million and $230 million per year. Information is not available on the total annual sales of supplements containing sources of ephedrine alkaloids other than Ma huang. Countervailing effects may also take place which may reduce the impact of these negative distributive effects on affected firms. For example, the proposed rule may reduce the number of product liability lawsuits brought against manufacturers of dietary supplements containing ephedrine alkaloids. FDA has insufficient information on the current incidence or cost of these lawsuits to estimate the effect of this reduction, if any, on the negative distributive effects generated by consumption changes. Of course, distributive effects that are negative with respect to a given industry will be positive with respect to some other industry. Finally, social costs may be associated with these distributive effects. For example, some portion of the value of the capital invested in the production of these supplements may be lost and that loss might not be offset by other effects, such as an augmentation to the value of the capital invested in the production of substitutes. However, FDA has insufficient information to estimate the social costs that might be associated with these distributive effects. Under these assumptions, the proposed action will generate total compliance costs of between $3 million and $80 million, plus unquantifiable utility losses to consumers of these products. Between $3 million and $70 million of these costs will occur in the  botanical supplements, this information suggests that between 1 and 17 percent of dietary supplement use involves products that contain ephedrine alkaloids. If the proportion of dietary supplement products containing ephedrine alkaloids reflects the proportion of dietary supplement sales accounted for by products containing ephedrine alkaloids, then between 1 and 17 percent of the total number of dietary supplement products contain ephedrine alkaloids, or between 200 and 5,000 products. Based on the preceding information, labeling costs for this proposal are estimated to be between 1 and 17 percent of the costs previously estimated for changing the labels on all dietary supplements, after adjusting those costs for the length of the compliance period. Thus, total discounted labeling costs for this proposal are estimated to be between $3 million and $60 million, with between approximately $3 million and $50 million of these costs occurring in the first year and between a minimal amount and approximately $0.5 million in every year after the first year. If the proposed 180 day compliance period for making the proposed label changes coincided with some portion of the 18-month compliance period of the final rule requiring nutritional labeling of dietary supplements, then some portion of the combined labeling costs of the two regulations would be eliminated because some firms would be able to make both labeling changes during normally scheduled labeling changes. The degree of overlap of the compliance periods of these regulations depends on the date on which the final rule is published. If appropriate, this consideration will be addressed in the economic analyses of the final rule. Information is not available on the cost of reformulating the affected products. Reformulation may simply involve reducing the amount of the ingredient source of the ephedrine alkaloids and removing the restricted ingredients. One method of approaching this issue is to consider the types of personnel and the amount of effort that might be required for reformulation. A reasonable assumption is that it might take a scientist from 1 to 4 weeks to develop an acceptable reformulation. In this case, the cost of reformulating a product would be between $1,000 and $5,000, based on median weekly earnings data for 1994 and 50 percent overhead (Ref. 218). Many dietary supplements containing ephedrine alkaloids probably contain restricted ingredients or do not meet the proposed potency limits on TEA and   Federal Register / Vol. 62, No. 107 / Wednesday, June 4, 1997 / Proposed Rules first 6 months after publication of the final rule. In addition, the proposed action will produce distributive effects of between $60 million and $230 million per year and social costs might be associated with those distributive effects. Because the sales of these products are increasing rapidly, FDA believes that this is a conservative estimate of cost and distributive effects. Again, extrapolations have not been made on the growth trend because extrapolating short-term trends into the future can result in large errors. Costs and sales reductions of this magnitude may threaten the viability of many firms in this industry. If some of these firms go out of business, temporary unemployment of labor and permanent loss of capital resources may result. FDA has insufficient information to estimate these costs. 4. Option 4--Take Proposed Action, but With a Higher Potency Limit Another option is to take all proposed actions but adopt potency limits higher than the proposed potency limits. For example, some trade associations representing the dietary supplement industry have previously expressed support for potency limits of 12 mg/ serving and 50 mg/day TEA (Ref. 220). With respect to benefits arising from consumption effects (i.e., the likelihood of reducing the number or seriousness of adverse events), FDA has some information to estimate the effect of variations between the proposed potency limits and higher potency limits on the consumption effects associated with those limits. That is, of the 13 reports of adverse events for which exposure data for intakes less than 20 mg per serving were also available, 5 were in the range between 8 and 12 mg per serving intake. If consumption is sensitive to small changes in the potency limits, then higher potency limits would reduce the benefits resulting from consumption effects because higher potency limits would presumably have a smaller effect on the effects of these products than the proposed potency limits. Therefore, the effect of raising the potency limits on benefits arising from shifts in consumption will be to reduce those benefits below those generated under Option 3. Raising the proposed potency limits will not affect the one-time compliance costs but might reduce utility losses to consumers of these products and the distributive effects produced by consumption shifts. Again, these changes may occur because higher potency limits might have a somewhat smaller impact on the perceived benefits of these products than the proposed potency limits. However, as indicated above, FDA has insufficient information to estimate the effect of small changes in the potency limits on the consumption effects produced by those limits and cannot estimate the utility losses associated with various potency limits. 5. Option 5--Ban Dietary Supplements That Contain Ephedrine Alkaloids Based on the framework used earlier, banning dietary supplements that contain ephedrine alkaloids would lead to a somewhat higher lower bound on estimated benefits. In particular, banning these products would reduce the health risks from these products such that the expected number of adverse events are reduced by between approximately 120 cases and 1,400 cases per year. Banning dietary supplements that contain ephedrine alkaloids will not change the one time compliance costs estimated under Option 3 because all affected products were subject to reformulation and relabeling costs under Option 3. However, banning these products would decrease access to these products by consumers who may perceive benefits, thus substantially increasing the potential utility losses to consumers. With respect to distributive effects generated by consumption changes, the total reduction in the consumption of dietary supplements that now contain ephedrine would probably be approximately 33 percent under this option, that is, at the high end of the range of 10 to 33 percent estimated under Option 3. Therefore, sales of these products would be reduced by between $200 million and $230 million per year. Costs and sales reductions of this magnitude may threaten the viability of many of the firms producing these products. However, countervailing distributive effects are also possible in that some firms that currently produce dietary supplements containing ephedrine alkaloids may also produce or be able to produce substitute products. In that case, those firms would avoid some or all of the costs associated with producing dietary supplements containing ephedrine alkaloids. 6. Option 6--Take Proposed Action, but Do Not Require Warning Statement The purpose of the proposed warning statement is to focus existing warnings more precisely on the health risks posed by these products, particularly in cases where any use of these products may be contraindicated, and to add warnings to those products which do not already  30711  have warning statements. Even with the proposed potency limits and ingredient restrictions, some consumers may be at high risk of suffering an adverse event from consuming these products because of high individual sensitivity to these products, because of an increase in risk associated with simultaneous consumption of drug products, or because of an underlying health condition. Thus, the proposed warning statement is expected to have some benefit independent of the other proposed requirements. Eliminating the proposed mandatory warning statement will affect estimated labeling costs because, under this option, only those labels affected by the claims restrictions would have to be changed. However, the vast majority of the affected products have labels that would be affected by the claims restrictions. Among the products in the market surveys, 94 percent of the products investigated had one or more claims that would be restricted under this option. Thus, labeling costs under this option will be only approximately 6 percent lower than the labeling costs estimated for Option 3. Finally, under the framework developed earlier, this option will have little effect on the other costs and distributive effects estimated for the proposed action under Option 3 because of the influence of the other factors involved. 7. Option 7--Require Warning Statements Only Estimating the benefit of eliminating all proposed actions except the required warning statement involves a controversial value judgment concerning the evaluation of risks that are voluntarily accepted in the presence of the amount of information on those risks provided on the proposed warning statement. Under the assumption that any adverse events that may occur due to such behavior cannot represent net social costs, warning statements will eliminate all net social costs associated with these adverse events. This assumption is based on the notion that the proposed warning statement provides adequate information on the risks of consuming these products and the notion that if those consuming these products have adequate information on the risks involved, then their consumption decisions reflect their personal judgments concerning the relative value of the benefits and risks of consuming these products. If no existing warning statements provide adequate information while the proposed warning statement will   30712  Federal Register / Vol. 62, No. 107 / Wednesday, June 4, 1997 / Proposed Rules percent of those firms classified as small businesses. The proportion of dietary supplement manufacturers producing products containing ephedrine alkaloids is unknown. The two market surveys identified 85 manufacturers and distributors of dietary supplements suspected of containing ephedrine alkaloids. Assuming that the proportion of these firms that are small businesses is the same as the proportion of firms in the dietary supplement industry that are small businesses, 95 percent of these firms, or approximately 80 firms, are small businesses. Total compliance costs incurred by small businesses will be virtually equal to total compliance costs incurred by all businesses estimated earlier because the vast majority of the firms affected by the proposed action are small businesses. Relabeling, reformulation, and testing costs are fixed costs on a per product basis and will disproportionately affect small businesses. Total compliance costs of the proposed action were estimated to be between $3 million and $80 million, with between $3 million and $70 million of these costs occurring in the first 6 months after publication of the final rule. However, FDA has insufficient information to estimate the portion of these costs that will be borne by the owners, stockholders, and employees of these firms and the portion that will be passed on to consumers of these products through price increases. In addition, the proposed action will generate consumption shifts that were previously estimated to produce negative distributive effects of between $60 million and $230 million per year. Countervailing distributive effects are also possible. For example, the proposed rule may reduce the number of product liability lawsuits brought against manufacturers of dietary supplements containing ephedrine alkaloids. Based on reported annual retail sales of between $600 million and $700 million for products containing Ma huang, these costs and distributive effects may be significant. Most of the regulatory alternatives discussed earlier would reduce the impact of this rule on small businesses. The options of taking no action and taking no action other than generating additional information both reduce the impact on small businesses to zero. Requiring only warning statements would substantially reduce compliance costs to between $3 million and $60 million, with between $3 million and $50 million of these costs occurring in the first 6 months, and also substantially reduce negative distributive effects generated by consumption shifts to between $0 and $110 million per year. Taking the proposed action without requiring the warning statement would slightly reduce compliance costs to between $3 million and $80 million, with between $3 million and $70 million of these costs occurring in the first 6 months, but would not affect distributive effects because of the other factors influencing those effects. Taking the proposed action but raising the proposed potency limit to the level suggested by a trade group representing the dietary supplement industry would probably not significantly alter the impact of this rule on small businesses. Finally, banning dietary supplements containing ephedrine would not change reformulation or relabeling costs and would lead to distributive effects from consumption shifts in the range of $200 million to $230 million per year. This action would have the greatest negative impact on small businesses. VI. Conclusions The estimated benefits of Option 3, take the proposed action, are between $240 million and $670 million per year. The estimated quantifiable costs are between approximately $3 and $70 million in the first year, and between a minimal amount and about $0.5 million in every year after the first year. Thus, notwithstanding the considerable uncertainty concerning the marginal effectiveness of the individual requirements of the proposed rule, FDA is confident that it would generate benefits that far exceed the quantifiable costs. In addition to the quantifiable costs, however, the proposed action will also generate non-quantifiable utility losses for some consumers and distributive effects from consumption shifts with an estimated value of between approximately $60 million and $230 million per year, with possible countervailing distributive effects from a reduction of liability lawsuits. Social costs might be associated with these distributive effects. VII. Environmental Impact The agency has carefully considered the potential environmental effects of this action. Based on the available information, FDA has concluded that the action will not have a significant impact on the human environment, and that an environmental impact statement is not required. The agency's finding of no significant impact and the evidence supporting that finding, contained in an environmental assessment, may be seen in the Dockets Management Branch (address above) between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday (Ref. 221).  provide adequate information, then the social benefits of this option would be at least as great as the value of banning dietary supplements containing ephedrine alkaloids. On the other hand, if some existing warning statements already provide adequate information, then the benefits of this option would still be at least as great as the value of banning dietary supplements containing ephedrine alkaloids; however, the benefits of both options would be lower. Under the assumption that any adverse events that may occur due to such behavior represent social costs, eliminating all actions other than the proposed warning statement will substantially reduce the benefits from those estimated for Option 3. This assumption is based either on the notion that the level of information provided on the proposed warning statement is inadequate to ensure that consumers can make informed consumption decisions, or on the notion that public health risks require intervention even if those risks are voluntarily undertaken in the presence of adequate information on the benefits and risks of the relevant activity. Under this assumption, this option will reduce the health risks from these products such that the expected number of adverse events will be reduced by between 0 cases and approximately 210 cases per year. With respect to compliance costs, eliminating all actions except the warning statement would eliminate the costs associated with product reformulation and consumer utility losses. Finally, this option would substantially reduce the distributive effects of this action. Under this option, the estimated total reduction in the consumption of dietary supplements containing ephedrine alkaloids would be between 0 and 15 percent. Therefore, sales of these products would be reduced by between $0 and $110 million per year. A reduction in sales of this magnitude would threaten the viability of fewer firms than the proposed action, as estimated under Option 3. V. Regulatory Flexibility Analysis In the economic impact analysis for the December 1995 proposal, FDA estimated the number of dietary supplement manufacturers to be between 150 and 600, with the majority of those firms being small businesses. Based on additional information, these estimates were revised in the economic impact analysis of the final rule on nutritional labeling. The revised estimate was 500 to 850 firms, with 95   Federal Register / Vol. 62, No. 107 / Wednesday, June 4, 1997 / Proposed Rules The agency will reevaluate its environmental decision if new information is received suggesting that the action would have significant environmental effects.

GX261-32-0939132	"Testimony of Sidney M. Wolfe, MD Director, Public Citizen Health Research Group, Washington DC Before Senate Governmental Affairs Committee, Subcommittee on Oversight of Government Management Hearing on Dangers of Ephedra October 8, 2002 Senator Durbin and members of the Subcommittee, thank you for the opportunity to testify on this important topic. Your hearing is essential because of the extreme, reckless negligence exhibited by dietary supplement companies who continue to sell ephedra-containing products and because of the industryenfeebled Department of Health and Human Services, including the FDA, that has thus far allowed the companies to get away with continuing to manufacture and push these deadly drugs.  The US Military Puts the HHS and the FDA to Shame From 1997 through part of 2001 , there have been 30 deaths among active duty personnel in the armed forces (Army, Air Force, Navy and Marines) in people who were using ephedra alkaloids. All were between the ages of their early 20's and early 40's and had been in good health prior to their deaths. There was no other explanation for their deaths. Since then, there have been three additional deaths associated with the use of ephedra products in the Army alone.1 Partly as a result of these 33 deaths and other serious, non-fatal adverse events in the military associated with ephedrine, in July of this year memos were sent to all Army and Air Force military exchanges and commissaries worldwide stating that by the end of August (2002), all ephedra-containing products should be removed from the shelves in these military posts for six months until the results of the HHS ephedra review are released. According to a recent Army/Air Force bulletin, from Fort Monroe, Va. (August 19, 2002)--""Training and Doctrine Command has joined with Forces Command in asking the Army Air Force Exchange Service to remove products containing ephedra, a compound normally found in diet products."" It is extremely important that in explaining the basis for issuing this order, Dr. DeKonning, an army physician, stated that ""The sale of ephedra-containing products by facilities on TRADOC [training and doctrine command] installations is seen by our soldiers as an affirmation that their use is safe and acceptable.,,2 The U.S. Marine Corps had earlier--in February 2001--banned the sale of ephedra-containing products on its military bases: ""The Commandant of the Marine Corps banned the sale of dietary supplements containing ephedra alkaloids, or ephedrine, at Marine Corps Exchange stores worldwide as of February 1 .3   Sixteen months ago, the Canadian government warned Canadians ""not to use products containing the herb Ephedra"" because such products ""may cause serious, possibly fatal, adverse effects."" On January 9 of this year, Health Canada requested a recall of all ephedra products ""with labeled or implied claims for appetite suppression, weight loss promotion, metabolic enhancement, increased exercise tolerance, body-building effects, euphoria, increased energy or wakefulness, or other stimulant effects."" In answering the questions you have provided me, I will add, to the published references in our petition, information obtained since it was filed  What is the basis for our September, 5, 2001 HHS petition (filed with Dr. Ray Woosley, now of the University of Arizona) to ban the manufacture and sale of all ephedra-containing dietary supplements? The answer to this question must start out with two other questions: Do drugs which are related to epinephrine (adrenaline) such as ephedrine, phenylpropanolamine, amphetamines and similar drugs cause an increase in blood pressure, constriction of blood vessels, an increase in heart rate or an increase in cardiac arrhythmias? The answer is unequivocally yes, and this has been known for decades. Is there evidence that these drugs can cause strokes and heart attacks in people because of causing an increase in blood pressure, constriction of blood vessels, heart rate or cardiac arrhythmias? In addition to the section in our petition presenting evidence for cardiovascular toxicity of ephedra (see appendix), we have obtained a copy of an internal March 28, 2000 FDA memo from Dr. Janet Woodcock, Director of the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (COER) in response to being asked to review the strength of the evidence linking ephedra with life-threatening cardiovascular events and strokes. After a review by COER's Office of Postmarketing Drug Risk Assessment (OPDRA) , Dr. Woodcock concluded that ""...at least 108 of the reports [clinically significant cardiovascular and central nervous system adverse event reports] OPDRA analyzed provide very strong evidence in support of a causal relationship between EADS [ephedra alkaloidcontaining dietary supplements] and the adverse events, particularly in light of the known pharmacodynamic effects of ephedrine alkaloids.,,4  What is the incongruity in FDA banning PPA (phenylpropanolamine) allowing ephedra to stay on the market?  but  Given that there are now more reported cases of death, heart attacks, stroke and other adverse effects associated with ephedra than with PPA at the  2   time of its ban, the situation represents a dangerous deja vu. We are now, with ephedra, where we were 10 years ago with PPA: clear, unequivocal evidence of danger but a time-delaying ""need"" by the industry to conduct studies. (FDA unfortunately bought into the need for a case control study on PPA 10 years ago). With PPA, dozens or more lives were lost and many people permanently disabled between the time the FDA clearly should have acted and when they finally got the drug (PPA) off the market. To repeat this fatal mistake with ephedra is to fail to learn the lessons of history.  Since we have petitioned the FDA to ban other weight loss products such as Meridia (sibutramine, Abbott), what benefit/risk analysis should be applied to weight loss products? Over 30 years ago, in June 1968, FDA Medical Officer Dr. Robert O. Knox refused to approve the New Drug Application (NDA) for a diet drug. This disapproval touched off a dispute between the FDA and the drug's manufacturer, A.H. Robbins, that eventually led to the drug's approval and Dr. Knox's transfer to another area within the Agency. His reason: obesity is a chronic disease and there is no evidence that these drugs affect the course of the disease over the long term. The drug Dr. Knox refused to approve was fenfluramine (Pondimin), a drug that ultimately became the ""fen"" portion of the notorious ""fen/phen"" combination, the portion that was removed from the market on September 15, 1997 because it caused heart valve damage and a potentially fatal adverse reaction of the lungs known as primary pulmonary hypertension. At the time of our petition to ban Meridia on March 19th of this year, there were 19 reported cardiovascular deaths in people using the drug, again, far fewer than the number with ephedra. The fact that there is no evidence of long-term benefit with either drug and there is evidence of shorter-term risk means that the benefit/risk ratio for both is extremely unfavorable to patients. Discuss what is known about the dosages taken by those experiencing serious adverse effects from ephedrine/ephedra. Is there a safe dose? In a recent published review of FDA adverse reaction reports by researchers from New England Medical Center in Boston, in 36 of 37 patients with heart attacks, strokes or sudden deaths, the use of ephedra (ma huang) was reported to be within the manufacturers' dosing guidelines.5 There are also a number of reports in which a so-called pharmacologic autopsy--post-mortem measurement of urine, blood and tissue levels--found low levels of ephedra consistent with recommended use. Given that there is no standardization of the amount appearing in the product and, more importantly, that there is enormous variation from person to person in sensitivity to such drugs, no dose is the only safe dose.  3   Discuss the effects that additional compounds such as caffeine have on the safety profile of ephedra, given that it is usually sold in combination with such stimulants. Both caffeine and ephedra can stimulate the sympathetic nervous system so their combined use increases the cardiovascular risks. In addition, the frequent use of these products in the context of exercise, also a stimulant to the sympathetic nervous system, makes for a triple dose of stimulation--in combination with ephedra and caffeine--which probably accounts for the growing number of deaths while young, otherwise healthy people are exercising.  In July 1995, according to the agency, ""FDA proposed banning OTC bronchodilators containing ephedrine, ephedrine hydrochloride, ephedrine sulfate, and racephedrine hydrochloride because of abuse and misuse. According to the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, ephedrine is being used to make illegal drugs. And, the FDA has found that some drug manufacturers promote ephedrine for unapproved uses, such as weight control and muscle enhancing."" The fact that the FDA has not finalized this proposed ban of ephedrine in OTC products should not be used as an excuse for the failure to ban dietary supplements containing ephedra. The proposed OTC ban is still in the works. This is not and has never been a question of scientific or medical evidence. It is a question of politics, and the extraordinarily dangerous political cowardice of the FDA and HHS Secretary Thompson in the face of massive lobbying by ephedra-makers in Washington. Is the FDA still part of the Public Health Service or is it a drug sales promoting adjunct to the pharmaceutical and dietary supplements industries? De facto drug pushers include those who refuse to use their legal authority to remove a well-documented hazard to the public health from the market. There is no doubt that these products will be banned in the United States. The question is not whether, but when. Delaying tactics such as the Rand review are costing lives as the day of reckoning for ephedra is thereby delayed. There are few issues that the AMA and Public Citizen agree on. Tobacco and ephedra are two of these. The FDA has been rejecting the opinions of its own consultants and staff (such as Dr. Woodcock) on the dangers of ephedra alkaloids.  4    Appendix The FDA funded the review by Benowitz, which found hypertension to be the most common manifestation of ephedrine alkaloid dietary supplement toxicity. 6 Zahn reports a 21-year-old man presenting to the emergency department with a blood pressure of 220/110 after ingesting herbal ecstasy, a common name for an ephedrine alkaloid dietary supplement.? Sixty-nine cases of ephedrine alkaloid dietary supplement associated stroke are represented in the SN/AEMS data set. Ephedrine alkaloid dietary supplements account for 81 % of all dietary supplement related strokes. Alarmingly, stroke has been reported with the use of an ephedrine alkaloid dietary supplement in an individual of exceptional health without any other known risk factors for a cerebrovascular accident. Bruno et al. report three separate incidences of stroke associated with the use of street drugs containing ephedrine exclusively9 and the Hemorrhagic Stroke Project documented the increased susceptibility to stroke found in women using phenylpropalamine (PPA), a metabolic breakdown product of ephedrine and another member of the ephedrine alkaloid family.1o A vasculitis-like beading pattern of the cerebral arteries is a common factor to many of the ephedrine alkaloid stroke reports. 11,12,13 The following chart shows the ephedrine and amphetamine.

Zahn reports ventricular arrhythmia temporally associated with a patient's use of an ephedrine alkaloid dietary supplement.14 The patient stabilized after emergent treatment with lidocaine. Such ventricular arrhythmia may easily degenerate into ventricular fibrillation and cardiac arrest as described by Haller and Benowitz.15 In the over the counter medication market, ephedrine alkaloid based cold medications have been shown to induce arrythmias. Pseudoephedrine, at recommended doses, was implicated in causing an arrhythmia in a healthy man with no known risk factors.16 Onuigbo's case report of arrhythmia in a pregnant woman shows that unwittingly combining sympathomimetics places patients at perilous risk.17 The fact that all of the cases of arrhythmia resolve and fail to recur in the absence of the offending agent is compelling evidence in favor of ephedrine alkaloid's causal  role. Coronary vasospasm due to the ingestion of sympathomimetics has been shown to result in chest pain and myocardial infarction / heart attack. Ephedrine alkaloid dietary supplements contributed to 88 reports of chest pain and 32 cases of myocardial infarct / heart attack in the SN/AEMS data set. Traub reports a 19year-old male bodybuilder who suffered an inferolateral myocardial infarction after using the recommended dosage of an ephedrine alkaloid dietary supplement.18 This patient had no known risk factors for heart disease and no significant findings on cardiac catheterization. In a controlled cross-sectional study of chest pain admissions at a pediatrics emergency department, James found that ephedrine exposure was associated with chest pain in adolescents.19 Wiener describes a 28-year-old man with no known cardiac risk factors who suffered a myocardial infarct after taking the recommended dose of a pseudoephedrine decongestant.2o This apparently inherent ability of ephedrine alkaloids to provoke chest pain and induce myocardial infarction in healthy patients is of particular concern because of the implications for vulnerable patients using other medications or with previously undiagnosed underlying medical conditions. Note that some of these adverse cardiovascular events can occur at the recommended dose.  1 Telephone conversation with Mike Heath, Pharm.D.

I would like to get the meeting started.  I am Michael Wolfe, and I am the Chair of this advisory committee for the FDA, and before we get started, I wanted to just briefly make a couple of comments about this meeting.     This meeting is a little difference than certainly some of the ones that I have attended, in that we are not really discussing any specific agent.  Rather, we are discussing general policy regarding trying to provide guidance for the FDA for future studies that will look at chemoprevention for colorectal cancer.     We will have speakers this morning discussing the problem of pathophysiology and other aspects, and we will be having different representatives from the public speaking as well, and we will also have a discussion in the afternoon to very specific questions to be answered, and to be discussed at great length.     This meeting is a little different than most meetings as I mentioned, but this actually more resembles an NIH consensus meeting, but it is not an NIH consensus meeting.      It may resemble it, but it is not, and we have to keep that in mind when we go through our discussion.       This is FDA, where the goals are different, although we certainly hope that NCI is represented here, and will help in the future should some specific recommendations be made, and certain studies be done.     Before we get started in the actual meeting, I would like to go around the table and have the people sitting at the table introduce themselves, and we will start with Dr. Houn.     And also before I forget, when you do speak, when all speakers speak, please turn your microphone on, and when you are done, please turn it off to avoid feedback.     DR.

Dr. Raczkowski will begin the discussion now.  Oh, I'm sorry, but before Dr. Raczkowski, Tom Perez will give his opening statement.     DR. PEREZ:  Good morning.  The Food and Drug Administration has prepared general matters waivers for the following special government employees who are participating in today's meeting of the Gastrointestinal Drugs Advisory Committee Meeting being held by the Center for the Drug Evaluation and Research:     Dr. Curt Furberg, Dr. Byron Cryer, Dr. Joel Richter, Dr. Robert Levine, Dr. Scott Lippman, Ms. Nancy Roach.     The waivers permit them to participate in the Committee's discussions and standards, and study designs of clinical trial testing, efficacy, and safety of chemopreventive agents that are being developed to gain FDA approval.     And reducing the risk of sporadic colorectal at the adenomatous polyps, and sporadic colorectal cancer.  A copy of these waiver statements may be obtained by obtaining a written request to the FDA's Freedom of Information Office, located in Room 12830 of the Parklawn Building.     In addition, we would like to disclose that Dr. David Metz, Dr. Ronald Fogel, and Ms. Susan Cohen, have reported interests that are exempt pursuant to 18 U.S.C. 208(B)(2).     Dr. Michael Camilleri, Dr. Maria Sjogren, and Dr. Michael Wolfe did not require a general matters waiver because it has been determined by the agency that they have no financial interests that could be affected by the committee's discussions.     Unlike issues before our committee in which a particular product is discussed, issues of broader applicability, such as the topic of today's meeting, involve many industrial sponsors and academic institutions.     The committee members have been screened for their financial interests as they may apply to the general topic at hand.  Because general topics impact on so many institutions, it is not prudent to recite all potential conflicts of interest as they apply to each member.       The FDA acknowledges that there may be potential conflicts of interest, but because of the general nature of the discussion before the committee these potential conflicts are mitigated.     With respect to FDA's invited guests, we would like to disclose that Drs. Bernard Levin, John Baron, and Anil Rustgi, and Dr. David Ransohoff, have reported financial interests in firms which could be affected by the committee's discussions.     Lastly, we would like to note for the record that Dr. George Goldstein is participating in this meeting as an industry representative, acting on behalf of regulated industry, and as such he has not been screened for any conflicts of interest.       With respect to all other participants, including the open public hearing, individuals, we ask in the interest of fairness that they address any current interest or previous involvement with any firm whose product could be affected by the committee's discussions today.  Thank you.     CHAIRMAN WOLFE:  Thank you, Tom.  Now, Dr. Raczkowski will give the opening comments.       DR. RACZKOWSKI:  Mr. Chairman, members of the Gastrointestinal Drugs Advisory Committee, and invited speakers and guests, ladies and gentlemen, I am Victor Raczkowski, the Acting Director of the Division of Gastrointestinal and Coagulation Drug Products in the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research.       And on behalf of the FDA, I welcome you to this meeting of the Gastrointestinal Drugs Advisory Committee.  At the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research in FDA, we have an important public health mission.       Our mission in the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research is to make safe and effective drugs available to the American Public.  But what does safe and effective mean?  What are safe and effective drugs?     In short, a safe and effective drug is one in which the benefits exceed the risks under its labeled conditions for use.  So at today's advisory committee, we will keep coming back to several of these themes; the safety of the drug, the effectiveness of the drug, the benefit risks of the drug, and the appropriate conditions for use of the drug.       But the specific purpose of today's meeting is to discuss standards in the design of clinical trials intended to test the efficacy and safety of chemopreventive agents that are being developed to gain FDA approval in reducing the risks of sporadic colorectal cancer.       At FDA, we work with the pharmaceutical industry and with academia in the design, analysis, and interpretation of clinical trials.  As such, the FDA is seeking practical advice on how clinical trials should be designed for chemopreventive agents for colorectal cancer.     We at the FDA can then use this practical advice to give guidance to the pharmaceutical industry and to academic investigators on how to proceed with clinical trials.  That is a big order, and we have a full day ahead of us.     As a prelude to the Committee's deliberations this afternoon, we have invited several distinguished experts to speak this morning on several topics of interest.     First, Dr. Rustgi will discuss the epidemiology and mechanisms of colorectal cancer.  Dr. David Lieberman will then talk about colorectal cancer screening and surveillance.       Next, Dr. Bernard Levin will give us an overview of chemoprevention trials; and finally, Dr. Mark Avigan, of the FDA, will summarize some issues surrounding the benefit risk assessment of chemopreventive agents for colorectal cancer.     We hope to get all four of these presentations in before the mid-morning break.  And after the break, we will have time to ask clarifying questions of the presenters, and then to complete the morning, we will hear from members of the public who have requested time to present their views to the committee.     And then after lunch, we will return for the committee's deliberations over the questions that the FDA has prepared for it.  We plan to adjourn at 5:30.  Now, that is a lot to accomplish in a day, and so we are asking for your assistance in helping to keep us on track in the discussions that we will be having today.     In concluding my comments, I would like to emphasize four points.  First, today's discussion is not intended to be a discussion of the general merits of chemoprevention.  We would all agree that prevention of cancer would be a public health benefit if it can be done with minimal risks.     Or stated differently, the prevention of cancer would be a good thing overall if the benefits exceed the risks, and if we can describe how the drug should be used.       So instead of a general discussion of chemoprevention, the discussion today is intended to focus on chemoprevention in a particular clinical setting, the prevention of colorectal cancer.     In this clinical setting, the prevention of colorectal cancer, the widespread availability of colonoscopic screening and surveillance poses somewhat unique challenges to the pharmaceutical industry, or to researchers wishing to develop drugs in this area.     As will be elaborated upon by Dr. Avigan of the FDA, colonoscopy is not a procedure used for screening and diagnosis, but colonoscopy with polypectomy also is used therapeutically to remove colonic lesions before they progress.     As a therapeutic procedure then, colonoscopy with polypectomy complicates designs of clinical trials of drugs because the procedure itself often prevents colorectal cancer.     The procedure itself then achieves the intended goal of drug therapy.  And in doing so the procedure significantly complicates the design of clinical trials in this area.       Second, the FDA called today's advisory committee meeting to obtain practical recommendations on how to design clinical studies of chemopreventive agents for colorectal cancer.     As such, we are asking practical study design questions of the committee; what are appropriate end points for clinical trials, what populations should be enrolled in trials; how big of an effect size in clinical trials are clinically meaningful, how should safety be evaluated in clinical trials.     But given the availability of colonoscopy and polypectomy, we seek your comments also on what you think the most appropriate public health use would be of chemopreventive agents being developed for colorectal cancer.       So as you listen to Dr. Avigan's talk this morning, please give some thought as to whether it is in the general interests or the greatest interests of the public health to develop chemopreventive agents as adjunct to colonoscopy and polypectomy, and if so, how can that be done practically.     Or is it in the greatest interests of the public health to develop chemopreventive agents as alternatives to colonoscopy and polypectomy.  And if so, how can that be done practically.       Or finally is it in the greatest interests of the public health to develop chemopreventive agents specifically for those individuals who are either unable or unwilling to undergo colonoscopic screening or surveillance.     And again if so how can that be done practically.  Third, today's advisory committee meeting is not focused on any particular drug or drug class.       Rather, as I have said, we intend for today's meeting to be focused on more or less generic clinical trial issues that could be applied to any drug under development in this area.     So if a particular drug or drug class is discussed today, we ask that it be done in a way that illustrates a particular issue or articulates a principle of clinical trial design.       At today's meeting we are not so much interested in debating the merits or lack of merits of any particular drug, or any particular drug class.  And finally today's meeting is about chemoprevention of sporadic colorectal cancer.       Today's discussion is not about familial adenomatous polyposis.  Thank you, and I look forward to a very interesting and stimulating day.     CHAIRMAN WOLFE:  Thank you, Dr. Raczkowski.  Our first guest speaker will be Dr. Anil Rustgi, who is a T. Grier Miller Associate Professor of Medicine and Genetics, and Chief of the Division of Gastroenterology, University of Pennsylvania.     He will be speaking on the epidemiology and mechanisms of colorectal cancer.  Anil.     DR. RUSTGI:  Thanks, Michael, and I would like to thank the FDA for inviting me.  I have a tall task to cover the salient features of the epidemiology of sporadic colorectal cancer, and to touch upon some of the underlying genetic mechanisms.       Many of the pioneers of epidemiology and chemoprevention of colorectal cancer are in the audience, and so my apologies in advance to them if I mis-speak at all.       Apart from providing some introductory remarks about these two areas, I hope then to serve as a transition to the subsequent three talks, and as a platform for this discussion as well.       We often think of colorectal cancer as a primary problem in the United States, but when one reflects upon it, it is indeed a problem throughout the world, and there are approximately 900,000 cases as of at least six years ago throughout the world representing nearly 10 percent of all new cases of cancer.     The incidence rates vary tremendously on a geographic basis, the highest being in North America, Western Europe, and Australia, New Zealand, and Japan.  The lowest being in certain parts of South Asia and Northern Africa.     And this plot argues cogently that there are environmental factors, especially dietary in nature, that provide a predilection for this variation.  In terms of mortality, there are approximately 550,000 deaths related to colorectal cancer, and those mortality rates don't vary too much from country to country where colorectal cancer is a problem.     So within the United States, colorectal cancer is the third leading cause of cancer in men, as well as in women.  Next slide.     And indeed it is the second overall leading cause of cancer related deaths in the United States, account for 10 to 11 percent of all cancer related mortality.     This figure varies from year to year, but there are approximately 130,000 to 140,000 new cases of colon cancer every year in the United States, with about 56 to 57,000 deaths related to colorectal cancer, either the primary problem, but especially metastic complications to the lung and liver.     Probably as a result of screening and surveillance, both the incidents and mortality rates have been decreasing for colorectal cancer, especially in the last decade.  And a point that I will be elaborating upon in subsequent discussions.  Next slide.     So if one looks at the average annual age-specific incidence and mortality rates of colorectal cancer in the early '90s, and this is from the SEER data, one notices a key feature.  That with increasing age, incident increases in men and women, and not surprisingly mortality increases, especially above the age of 50.     And there is discordance in the mortality rates based upon ethnic groups.  But mortality rates are much higher in African-Americans than those of white Americans.  Next slide.     So the key feature in sporadic colorectic cancer is that the predisposing factor is sporadic adenomatous polyps.  And indeed one can overlie the graphs for prevalence of sporadic adenomas with that of instance of colorectal cancer.       Such that the prevalence of adenomas above the age of 50 is believed to be on the order of 25 to 50 percent, representing a compendium of a great deal of literature.     And the lifetime risk of cancer at age 50 years, and that is for average risk of women is five percent, and that for average risk of males is six percent.  And that the persons with advanced adenomas are at grave risk for colorectal cancer.  Next slide.     So what are the risk factors for colorectal cancer apart from age that I have already mentioned?  The other is a personal history of adenomas, as well as a personal history of colorectal cancer.  I alluded to dietary factors in the United States and worldwide, and that includes high fat and possibly fiber, although this is come under greater scrutiny in recent years.     Inflammatory bowel disease, where the risk is linked to the extent of disease, as well as the duration of disease, especially in the setting of ulcerative colitis, a family history of colorectal cancer, as well as the hereditary colon cancer syndromes.  Next slide.     So that risk of colorectal cancer then varies depending upon the particular factor that one looks at.  So if there is a personal history of colorectal neoplasia, it is believed that that risk increases to about 20 percent, and for inflammatory bowel disease, there is a wide range, primarily due to a wide body of studies, and that may be as high as 40 percent.       But in the inherited from of colon cancer, hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer, that risk approaches 80 percent.  And as you know for FAP, it approaches 95 to a hundred percent.  Next slide.     So if we look at the familial risk for colorectal cancer, and here I wish to emphasize that obtaining family history is imperative, and that approximate lifetime risk increases with the nature of the family history.     So that it is around 8 percent for one first degree and two second degree relatives, and if one has two first degree relatives, that risk approaches 17 percent.  Next slide.     So it is worth emphasizing the inherited forms of colon cancer because they have provided a lot of insights into the genetic basis of colorectal cancer, and indeed this has served as a paradigm for cancer biology and genetics in general.       So while approximately 75 or 80 percent of all colorectal cancers may be sporadic in nature, or ostensibly sporadic in nature, probably on the order of 20 percent is familial.     And the best known syndrome of an inherited basis is hereditary non-polyposis colon cancer, which accounts for approximately 3 to 5 percent of all colon cancer, that varies from country to country.      FAP represents about one percent, and the rare syndromes, and these are the hamartomatous polyposis syndromes, predominantly in the pediatric and adolescent population, that account for perhaps less than .1 percent.  Next slide.     So FAP an inherited form of colon cancer, in which the hallmark feature is hundreds to thousands of polyps throughout the colon, with an estimated penetrance of greater than 90 percent.  This impressionistic depiction that didn't turn out too well is meant to highlight these patients have a sea of polyps.     And unless the colon is removed by surgical needs in his or hers teens or twenties, then nearly a hundred percent of these patients will develop colon cancer, and these patients have an association of extracolonic cancers, predominantly benign in nature, but certainly malignant lesions can be found, especially in the upper-GI tract.  Next slide.     So the genetic basis of FAP has been elucidated over the last 15 years or so, starting out with cytogenetic reports, the genetic linkage analysis, to about 11 years ago, where the gene was identified by two different groups as being the APC, or adenomatous polyposis colite tumor suppressor gene, on chromosome 5q.     About a third of the patients have a de novo germ line or inherited mutations, and the remaining two-thirds have some family history.  Most families have unique mutations.  In other words, there doesn't tend to be a hot spot in the mutations, in contrast to ras mutations in sporadic colon cancer.     And about 95 percent of these mutations lead to a stop code on, and therefore, a truncated protein that has been exploited, in terms of genetic testing.  And indeed, depending upon the location of the mutation, there can be some correlation with phenotypic characteristics, especially with ocular findings, as well as desmoid tumors.  Next slide.     So this is a schematic of the gene itself.  It is a rather large gene compromising 15 exons, and  encodes a protein of about 310 kiloDaltons.  The gene ubiquitously expressed, but for reasons unclear when mutations do occur in this gene on inherited or germ line basis, the phenotypic features are site specific, especially in the colon.     Arguing for other factors, especially modifier loci, in the germ line that may be affecting the phenotypic manifestations.  Nevertheless, in FAP patients, the mutations have a broad spectrum.     But about a third-to-a-half of them are found in exon 15, and again, these lead to stop codons and truncated protein, so that there is a spectrum in the molecular mass of the protein from anywhere from 80 kiloDaltons to about 240 kiloDaltons.     There is a variant of FAP called attenuated FAP, in which these patients have perhaps 10, 20, or up to a hundred polyps with a later onset and presentation of the polyps, as well as colorectal cancer, that can be associated with upper GI lesions.     And the mutational spectrum is quite fascinating, in that they are found either at the amino terminus or the five prime end, leading to a very short protein that is unstable in nature, or at the extreme, three prime end.  And that can also be exploited from a genetic testing viewpoint.  Next slide.       So the indications for APC gene testing are those patients in whom you find have FAP or attenuated FAP, and much work has been done by Frank Giardiello, in terms of predictive testing for FAP in the blood relatives of persons with FAP or known APC mutations.  Next slide.     So let me turn your attention now to the most common known inherited form of colon cancer, and that is called HNPCC; early onset, but later than FAP.  Typically, these patients are in their mid-forties.       There is a predilection for occurrence of the adenomas, which can number up to a hundred, but typically much fewer in the approximal colon,  Perhaps 70 percent are in the approximal colon, and the remaining can be found in the distal colon as well.     And these are the hallmark features of what is called Type-1 HNPCC, and Type-2 HNPCC, shares the features of Type-1, except as accompanied by a number of extra colonic cancers, especially endometrial and ovarian in women.     And in men and women, especially gastric and pancreatic, as well as in the small bowel.  When there is the presence of sebaceous skin tumors, that variant is called miratora syndrome.  Next slide.     So the definition for HNPCC is one that has been in evolution over the last 11 years, and I won't really belabor that too much, except that about 11 years ago there was some uniform criteria that were adopted, called the Amsterdam criteria.     Suffice it to say thee have been modified to incorporate genetic criteria, the so-called modified Amsterdam criteria.  And there are complimentary criteria called the Bethesda criteria.     But as a platform for the definition of HNPCC for both clinical and genetic studies, these criteria include three or more relatives with verified colorectal cancer.     One case being a first degree relative of the other two, spanning two generations; one case before age 50, and exclusion of FAP.  And what we all encounter in our genetics clinics is not so much HNPCC patients, which are fairly straightforward and definitely FAP patients, which are easily defined, but those families that may have some of the features of HNPCC, but don't fulfill the criteria.     And at the current time it behooves us to treat such individuals and families as having HNPCC until more genetic definitions are forthcoming for other forms of inherited colon cancer.  Next side.     So the genetic features of HNPCC, like FAP, there is an autosomal dominant inheritance, and the penetrance is about 80 percent, and not as high as FAP.  The genes, unfortunately, have led to a complicated analysis of HNPCC.     In contrast, FAP, there is one gene that defines the disease in HNPCC, and there is a compendium of genes, and these are called the DNA mismatch repair genes, of which there are at least six that are known, likely more than exist.  And all of these genes are located on different chromosomes.  Next slide.     So if you look further at HNPCC, the vast majority of kindreds that have been studied in Japan, the United States, and especially Finland, are due to mutations in MSH2 or MLH1, accounting for about anywhere from 50 to 70 percent.       But what that tells us is that a third of these families have mutations in genes that have yet to be identified, and do not involve DNA mismatch repair genes that are rarely mutated.  Next slide.     So as I alluded to earlier, there are extra colonic cancers that can be found in HNPCC, and that risk increases with age.  Obviously, the greatest being for a colorectal cancer, but second being with endometrial and the others that are listed here for you representing a spectrum of sights.  Next slide.     And so what is the genetic phenomenon that is observed in HNPCC, which has been elucidated by several groups?  And the key underlying disorder is what is called microsatellite instability.     So what happens is that many genes across the genom have mononucleotide, dinucleotide, and trinucleotide repeats, and if errors occur during DNA replication that can be either spontaneous or through some external insults, such as UV light, or a chemical carcinogen, then DNA mismatch repair enzymes have the ability to repair these mismatches.       But if there are mutations in those genes, they are unable to repair the mismatches, and errors then occur in DNA repair that are transmitted to daughter cells and other progenitor cells.     And that creates a phenomenon, or engenders a phenomenon of microsatellite instability, which in- turn engenders mutations and key targeted genes that have these mononucleotide and dinucleotide repeats, such that nearly a hundred percent of HNPCC tumors, whether colonic or extracolonic, have evidence of microsatellite instability at multiple loci.     And indeed routine MSI assays are available, so that one can test for evidence of microsatellite instability in a tumor of an effected with HNPCC or whom you suspect to have HNPCC.     And then this serves as the basis then for doing genetic testing, especially in MLH1 and MSH2.  I should add parenthetically that about 15 percent of sporadic colorectal cancers have microsatellite instability.     So you see a confluence of information from the genetic basis of colorectal cancer to sporadic colorectal cancer.  Next slide.     So in terms of genetic testing for HNPCC susceptibility, most centers will first look for evidence of microsatellite instability, and if that is found, and that is relatively straight-forward, then that serves as an impetus to look for mutations in two of the mis-match repair genes.     And it is only helpful if there is a positive result.  If there is a negative result, then you still have to continue close clinical screening and scrutiny because of one-third of patients you won't find a gene mutation.  Next slide.     So while understandably the focus over the last 15, and especially 10, years has been on FAP and HNPCC from a genetic basis, and then translating that into genetic testing and predictive markers, as well as chemoprevention, I wish to emphasize that really the vast majority of familial forms of colorectal cancer are not under the perview of FAP and HNPCC.     And it is estimated by many that perhaps 20, if not 25, percent of all colorectal cancers annually form or come under this umbrella.  The age of onset may be typical of sporadic colorectal cancer, but it may be earlier.     There will be a huge spectrum of the extent of family history, and there are multiple causes, and these individuals likely will have few to no adenomas.  One thing that we are intensibly investigating is the potential link of familial colorectal cancer in the setting of breast cancer, something that epidemiologically is quite controversial.     Another thing that is being done by Sandy Markowitz and Bert Vogelstein is SID pair studies across the country.  And hopefully these sorts of studies will lead to the discovery and identification of different genes that are responsible for other forms of familial colorectal cancer, and will hopefully influence then epidemiology, and especially chemoprevention approaches in the future.  Next slide.     So while we have learned a tremendous amount from the inherited basis of colorectal cancer, an equal amount has been gleaned from mouse models of colon cancer.     Certainly there are other animal models of colon cancer, especially in the application of chemical carcinogens to rats.  But I am going to just highlight mouse models that have been genetically engineered, such that genes that have been identified as associated with the progression from normal colon polyp to cancer are targeted or ablated in embryonic stem cells of mice.       So that the phenotypic manifestation that has been observed with several of these model, and indeed there are several, is a recapitulation of either FAP or to a lesser extent, HNPCC.     And the classic one is where the gene that is responsible for FAP has been disrupted, and there are about six such models available.  These mice develop not only colonic polyposis, but predominantly small bowel polyposis, as well as demonstrate evidence of extra colonic features.     A molecule that is in the TGF-beta signaling pathway, SMAD has been ablated, and those mice develop polyps and cancer.  Interestingly enough when each of the six mismatch repair genes is disrupted in the germ line of mice, there is rarely a recapitulation of the polyposis phenotypic HNPCC, these mice either develop a spectrum of lymphomas or sarcomas.     Or when cross-bred into the APC background, then there is an acceleration of the polyposis. Recently a couple of groups have targeted ras to colonocytes and about 80 percent of the mice developed polyps and cancer.     So much has been learned about the genetic basis of colon cancer through these mouse models, and indeed these have been used intensively to study the feasibility of chemopreventive agents in the preclinical setting.  Next slide.     So this paradigm is well known to you and championed by the Vogelstein group about 11 years ago, and modified over time.  And that the progression from normal epithelium to different stages of adenoma and eventually to cancer, represents an accumulation of key genetic alternations.     And this is intrinsically bias, because it only takes into account those genetic alterations that are frequently observed, and does not take into account certain biochemical abnormalities that have been studied over the last couple of decades.       But suffice it to say that the key genetic alteration underlying FAP is felt to be perhaps the initiating event in the transition from normal epithelium to a hyperproliferative epithelium.     In fact, studies have shown that perhaps 75 to 80 percent of diminutive polyps harbor APC mutations, and about 40 to 50 percent of small to moderate sized adenomas harbor mutations in the K-ras oncogene, which occur at discreet points in codons 12 and 13.     And that intermediate to late adenomas in cancers have a deletion on chromosome 18q.  Initially this was felt to involve the deleted and colon cancer gene.       But now it is clear that it is molecules, the SMAD molecules in the TGF beta signaling pathway that are mutated here, and a later event is p53 mutation, and then when the cancer leaves its primary site to metastasize to lymph nodes and distant organs, other alterations occur, especially in metastasis suppressor genes, and more recently a gene with phosphatase activity was identified.     And this paradigm has been exploited by pathologists, as well as in terms of molecular diagnosis to see if these changes can be detected in the stool of patients at risk for colon cancer.     These alterations, as well as other genetic alterations are being pursued to see if they can be detected in the peripheral blood of patients at risk for colon cancer.  That remains a tall order at the current state.  Next slide.     So the sporadic adenomas polyp does take time to develop, perhaps up to 10 years, and perhaps less.  Not all polyps develop into cancer as you know, perhaps 8 to 10 percent do, and that the risk factors for the polyp to cancer progression are predicated upon the size of the polyp, as well as the histology of the polyp.  Next slide.     So we often talk about surrogate markets for chemoprevention, and focus upon polyp, in terms of our ability to effect the size of the polyp, as well as the number of polyps.       And what I would emphasize is that the transition for understanding the feasibility of chemopreventive agent occurs naturally from preclinical settings, especially in the genetically engineered mouse models, to the inherited forms of colon cancer.     And then eventually as is the focus for today's discussion, to the sporadic or general population.  While understandably it is important to look at the size and number of polyps, I would like to emphasize that there are other biomarkers to investigate in the  normal colonic mucosa, as well as the polyp.     And these can be looked at at the DNA, RNA, and protein level by a number of different techniques related to proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, and this has served as the basis for intensive investigation by both companies and investigators to apply microarrays or functional genomics.       Finally, looking at biomarkers in the stool and blood remains currently investigational.  Next slide.  So I will conclude to highlight the risk factors for colon cancer.     Think of it as a partition between inherited forms and acquired, especially sporadic adenomas polyp.  The genetic basis for colon cancer includes obviously FAP and HNPCC, but yet to be defined forms.     The transition from normal polyp to sporadic polyp, to colon cancer, involves different pathways, and that one needs to emphasize pre-clinical models for colon cancer, in terms of testing feasibility.  Next slide.     And that the applications of chemoprevention initially occur in animal models, to the inherited forms of colon cancer, and that the determination of the efficacy of chemoprevention involves a whole panel of surrogate markers.  So I will conclude there and thank you for your attention.     (Applause.)     CHAIRMAN WOLFE:  Thank you, Dr. Rustgi.  We will have time for questions for all the speakers after the break.  Our next speaker will be Dr. David Liberman, who is a Professor of Medicine, and Chief of the Division of Gastroenterology at the Oregon Health Sciences University.     He is also President of the American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy, and he will be speaking on colorectal cancer screening and surveillance.  David.     DR. LIEBERMAN:  Good morning, and thank you for the invitation to participate in this meeting.  I am going to address the subject of screening and surveillance in the average risk population.  If I could have the first slide.     And I want to begin by highlighting I think what we have learned over the last decade, and that is that this progression as Dr. Rustgi eloquently described from normal colon, to advanced adenoma, to cancer, which may be mediated by many events, can be interrupted.  Next slide.     Now, we can interrupt this if we can identify patients that have advanced adenomas and remove these adenomas.  We now have evidence that we could actually prevent cancer with colonoscopic polypectomy.  Next slide.     So as we think about these screening tests, I believe that we have to look at a higher bar than we have traditionally looked at.  When screening was first introduced in the late 1970s, the goal was early cancer detection, hoping to detect lesions at an early incurable stage.     I think we now have to look at screening and all the screening tests that we have available to us from the perspective of prevention.  Next slide.  And with that in mind, we have a large list of screening recommendations that have come from a variety of different bodies, advisory and expert bodies, that have reviewed them.       The two most commonly used tests are the fecal occult blood test, and sigmoidoscopy, but other tests have also been recommended, and the most current recommendations include a menu, if you will, of all of these options.     So I would like to review these options briefly with you.  Next slide.  First, the fecal occult blood test.  We have for this test several randomized control trials which have all demonstrated the same thing, and that is that cancers that are detected in screening populations are detected at an early stage compared to unscreened populations.     And that that has translated into a mortality reduction which in the studies has ranged from 15 to 33 percent.  There are some differences between these trials, but they all show the same trend.       The test is relatively easy to perform, and it can be completed by primary care providers, making it very attractive.  Next slide.     The problems with this test are that it has relatively poor sensitivity for one time testing, and I will show you some data from the cooperative study later, but basically what we found in that study was that the detection of advanced neoplasia with one-time testing was only 24 percent.     And that is an important limitation, which means that for this program to be effective, it has to be repeated on a regular basis, probably annually to be effective based on the studies that are available, and that is a big problem, because compliance with repeat testing and clinical studies, and in real life clinical practice is quite poor.     In addition, although this test on the surface appears to be very inexpensive.  There are many hidden costs built into the evaluation of these tests, and repeating the tests and developing programs for setting up repeat testing that create increased costs.  Next slide.     Sigmoidoscopy, which is the other most commonly used screening test, the evidence in favor of it comes from case control studies, and not randomized control trials.  But they are well done and demonstrated at a 60 percent reduction in colorectal cancer mortality in that portion of the colon that was examined with the sigmoidoscope.  Next slide.     The advantages for this are that we can not only detect early cancers, but we can also detect advanced adenomas, which could be removed in leading the cancer prevention.       It can be performed by primary care providers and non-physicians.  The limitations are that it only examines one-third of the colon, and therefore approximal lesions may not be detected.  Next slide.     In the VA cooperative study that we completed over the last few years, we performed screening colonoscopy in a large cohort, over 3,000 asystematic men, between the ages of 50 to 75, with a goal of determining how many patients with advanced neoplasia would be detected with either a fecal occult blood testing or a sigmoidoscopy.     And what we found was that sigmoidoscopy, if you use sigmoidoscopy alone, and we assumed that if any adenoma was found in the lower part of the colon that would lead to a full colonoscopy, the detection rate was 70 percent of patients with advanced adenomas.     For fecal occult blood testing we found as I mentioned earlier that the detection rate was only 24 percent, and of course this highlights an important limitation of one-time testing, which is not what has been recommended.     And finally for combined testing, we found that if you had combined the fecal occult blood testing and sigmoidoscopy there would have been a detection rate of 76 percent, meaning that about a quarter of the patients with advanced neoplasia would not be detected with one-time testing.  Next slide.     The other recommended tests include a barium enema, and for this I can't present any data because there is none in the screening population.  We do have some evidence from the national polyp study thought that tells us what about 50 percent of patients that have adenomas greater than one centimeter are not detected with barium studies.     And I think this is an important limitation since we know that this population of patients does have a higher risk of either having a malignancy in the polyp or developing malignancy.  Next slide.     Now, we have some other potential ways of imaging the colon which are not in the standard recommendations, but which are currently under study.  Virtual imaging of the colon with CT scanning as shown in this slide, and this is an endoscopic picture of a polyp, and unfortunately this does not project well.     But this is a virtual image of the polyp using CT colography, and on the next slide, is an image of another polyp using MR technology.  So clearly these imaging modalities have the ability to visualize polypoid growths in the colon.  Next slide.     And perhaps their most attractive feature is their name.  The concept of virtual really appeals to the public, as opposed to real.  And so if that gets people into getting screened, that is not a bad thing necessarily.     The tests so far, and these modalities are still under study, seem to suggest that the sensitivity for large polyps is reasonably good, somewhere between 65 and 95 percent, depending on the study.  It can be performed very rapidly.     The problems with this I think that require further evaluation are summarized in the limitations here.  The cost effectiveness is very uncertain, and the analyses that have been done so far suggest that  it is not likely to be cost effective, because this modality is so expensive, and patients who are found to have polypoid growths are going to need to go on and have colonoscopy examinations.       The false/positive rate obviously increases the cost, and this includes the detection of small polyps that may not be neoplastic, like hyperplastic polyps, which can be detected with these tests, and that leads to what I described here as the small polyp dilemma, that the radiologist suggests that these can be ignored, although I think most clinicians will have a difficult time ignoring them.     There is some minor patient discomfort with this, and right now this requires -- the CT colography requires a full prep of the colon.  That may be changed over time, but right now I think this modality still requires further study before it should be implemented.  Next slide.     Finally, the idea of screening with colonoscopy has emerged over the last few years, and we have known for a long time that this is probably the most effective test for identifying polypoid growths in the colon, and then actually removing them.     And we have some indirect evidence for effectiveness of colonoscopy, and its obvious limitations relate to risk cost and resources.  Next slide.     The data that exists right now for screening colonoscopy comes from several sources, but these are the two largest trials that have been published to date in which large asystematic populations have been screened.     This is over 5,000 patients with colonoscopy, and in experienced hands these data suggest that the majority, or by far the majority of these exams can be complete, and the detection rate for advanced neoplasia in these two studies was quite high, suggesting that there would be a reasonably high yield of identifying patients with lesions that might be considered clinically important.  Next slide.     The evidence for effectiveness as I mentioned is indirect, and it comes from I think three major sources.  Next slide.       From the National Polyp study, we have evidence that in patients who underwent a complete colonoscopy with polypectomy, that the expected incidence rates of cancer were sharply reduced over the next six years, from between 76 and 90 percent.  Next.     From a study performed by Joe Selby in Oakland, using sigmoidoscopy, they concluded that sigmoidoscopy, which is an endoscopic exam of the distal colon, reduced mortality in that portion of the colon that was examined.     If we extrapolate those results, and we say, well, what if more colon was examined, could you further reduce mortality, I think that is a reasonable, plausible, assumption that perhaps would provide a little bit more evidence that a more complete exam of the colon would be more effective.     And finally in the next slide we have studies from the fecal occult blood test trials which suggest that screened patients had a reduced mortality, which was demonstrated early on, but later were also found to have reduced incidents.     And the authors attributed this to the detection and removal of polyps with colonoscopy.  Remember that all the patients in these trials had colonoscopy as their primary evaluation for a positive screening test.       So colonoscopy was probably what reduced mortality in these studies.  So again these are direct randomized control trials or case control studies, but they provide some evidence that colonoscopy could be very effective.  Next slide.     So in summary what we found in the VA cooperative study, and I think what has been known epidemiologically, is that the prevalence of advanced neoplasia increases with age.     That the prevalence of approximal advanced neoplasia increases with age.  The more patients with advanced neoplasia go undetected with fecal occult blood testing and sigmoidoscopy as they age, and this was a finding that was not unexpected from the VA study, but it suggested that these tests are not going to be quite as effective as we get older because of this increased approximal advanced neoplasia.       And finally that colonoscopy might be a more effective screening test, which is what the VA study demonstrated, after the age of 60.  Next slide.   Now, whatever method that we choose to use for screening, whether it is FOBT, sigmoidoscopy, colon imaging, fecal markers, or a colonoscopy, it is going to lead to a colonoscopy.     So we are going to have a lot of colonoscopy, and that is going to result in the detection of polyps which is going to lead to surveillance colonoscopy afterwards.  Next.     So I think that I want to conclude by talking about several issues that I think come out of the screening studies, and that is the question of what to do about surveillance, and what about risk cost and resources if we are going to be doing all this colonoscopy.  Next.     Regarding surveillance, we have the following recommendations that really are based more on expert consensus than they are on evidence.  And that is that most patients who have had adenomas detected should have follow-up colonoscopy at about 3 years, although for patients with only small adenomas perhaps a longer interval is quite safe.       As I said these data really come from expert consensus.  What is interesting is that surveillance, when you look at the programmatic costs of all the programs that I just outlined, surveillance is actually pretty costly.       It represents about 20 to 50 percent of the cost of the colon screening program.  And if you look at what the patients that are subsequently undergoing surveillance, if we took the VA cooperative study data, and we asked that among the patients with neoplasia, and these are all the patients that had neoplasia in that study, we had 10.6 percent that had advanced lesions.     But that meant that 72 percent had only small adenomas less than one centimeter as their primary lesion.  And we do have some evidence that this group of patients may not be at particularly increased risk for subsequent cancer greater than the population at large, and do these patients all need to have surveillance.     And so I think we need further study on this.  But obviously if we had some form of intervention that would reduce the rate of these patients appearing for surveillance, that that could have an impact on cost.  And theoretically that is one way that chemoprevention might play a role.  Next slide.  So I think we have pretty good evidence that surveillance has an important impact on the cost of screening programs.       That it is going to have a huge impact on available resources for screening.  If we do more screening, we are going to end up doing more surveillance.     And that is going to stretch the resources that we have available to perform screening examinations.  There is evidence that the risk may be low for patients with small adenomas, and we need more evidence to make us confident that we don't need to do surveillance in this group.  And perhaps it could be modified or reduced with chemoprevention.  next slide      The risk of colonoscopy has come from a variety of sources, mostly from surveys.  I will present you the data from the VA cooperative study that we just published this month in  Gastrointestinal Endoscopy .       In almost thirty-two hundred examinations in patients who with a mean age of 63, and on to the next slide, and we found the following major complications.  the overall definite complication rate, or in other words, complications that were clearly related to the colonoscopy, was 0.3 percent.     And almost all of those were related to performance of polypectomy.  The vast majority were bleeding after a polypectomy, that resulted in either hospitalization, transfusion, or surgery.       There were some important cardiopulmonary complications associated with it.  So this is not a trivial procedure, and there is risk associated with it.  If we just look at the diagnostic studies.  In other words, where no polypectomy was performed, the overall complication right here was only 0.1 percent.     And if we add up all these complications, and those that were definitely related, and those that might have been, the overall complication rate is 0.5 percent.     So we have a significant complication rate most often associated with polypectomy.  Next slide, please.     If we compare that to prior studies, it is actually a little bit lower than has been reported previously.  This is a compilation of significant bleeding from prior studies, and the VA studies at the low end of this, and for perforations, this is the rate that has been reported.     We didn't have any, but obviously perforation can occur as a risk.  The means of controlling risk right now are improving training and performing quality improvement.  But obviously if we didn't have to do as much polypectomy, which is the primary source of this risk, we could modify this risk and potentially have fewer complications.  Next slide.     The other question that is often raised about screening is can we afford it.  Next slide.  And I would twist this question around and ask can we afford not to screen.       We know that when cancer occurs in patients  that there is a cost of cancer care, and the current estimates in the United States range somewhere between 50 and 80 thousand dollars for each case of cancer that is detected.       But in addition there is emotional costs, and of course there is this missed opportunity that we have for prevention.  The next slide.  If we compare the cost of cancer screening to other things that we do in medicine, such as colon screening, whichever way you do it, seems to compare very favorably.  So this is looking at the cost per added year of life, which is a common way of looking at cost effectiveness, and comparing colon screening with other things that we do, including hypertension management, mammography, and cholesterol management.     And as you can see, colon screening seems to compare favorably to other things that we do in medicine that we consider standard of care.  So I would twist the argument around and say that we can probably afford that we need to consider screening, and that costs are really cost effective.       And in fact, if we can actually prevent a lot of cancers, either with screening or chemoprevention, that it may even be cost saving.  Next slide.     The last point that I want to make is related to the resources for screening.  If we actually did achieve high rates of screening in the United States, and by the way the current screening rates in the United States are somewhere between 40 and 50 percent, compared to mammography and cervical cancer screening rates of 60 to 75 percent, we might have a problem.  And this has been cited by a number of experts that the new demand for colonoscopy as a result of screening might completely overwhelm the capacity that we have.  Next slide.     One way of looking at this, and this is only one perspective, is if we take a look at what we are doing colonoscopy for now.  This is some data that we generated from an NIH funded National endoscopic database.       Now, this is a data repository in which 80 practice sites around the United States send endoscopic data to Portland, Oregon.  It goes into a repository and we are able to take snapshots of what happens when procedures are performed, and why they are performed.     So this represents data from two years, from 2000 and 2001, and about 50,000 colonoscopy examinations that were performed during that time.  And this is a breakdown of the indications.       If we look just at the screening indications in yellow, you can see that they account for right now a relatively small percentage of the procedures as they are indicated here.       If you look at some of the other indications though and you ask could we actually shift some of these resources into screening, some of the patients that are currently getting evaluations for bright red blood, pain, diarrhea, or even polyp surveillance, if they were undergoing screening examinations, you might not need to have these examinations.       So I think there is potential when you look at this overall current utilization of colonoscopy for shifting resources, and making more colonoscopy resources available for screening.  Next slide.     And one example of that is related to surveillance.  I showed you data from the VA study before suggesting that 72 percent of asymptomatic men in our study had only small tubular adenomas, with a low associated risk of cancer.       If we could shift some of these resources from surveillance to screening, we may get much more bang for our buck.  Next slide.     And potentially we could even out this little slide here.  So that the demand and the capacity issues, the capacity could be increased by shifting resources, and perhaps improving efficiency in the way that we deliver our colonoscopic resources.  So the next slide.     So to summarize the screening guidelines, we have among the screening modalities that have been offered, randomized control studies for fecal occult blood testing, a potential mortality reduction in the 20 to 50 percent range, but some problems.     That it is not a very good cancer prevention test, and that it needs to be repeated.  For sigmoidoscopy evidence is case control, and we have the potential mortality reduction of 50 to 55 percent, but we are going to miss patients with proximally neoplasia.     Imaging studies.  We have really no evidence right now.  We can only guess at potential mortality reduction, and there is going to be cost issues.  For colonoscopy, the evidence is indirect.       We have the potential here though for much cancer prevention, and therefore much more mortality reduction, but it is invasive and higher risk.  Next slide.     Now, as we look at this paradigm and think about how chemoprevention might affect screening, and going to the next slide, one of the most obvious ways that we would like to see it affected would be to impact these two areas here, the progression.       And we know that adenomas are very common, but if we could interrupt the progression to advance the adenoma, or to advance the adenoma to cancer, that would be extremely attractive.       And obviously if there is a direct pathway from normal to cancer, we would like to interrupt that.  This pathway here, this normal to adenoma, is potentially interruptable with chemoprevention.       The question would be is that important, and that is going to be an important subject for discussion here today.  I would argue that it could be because the vast majority of patients that we find with adenomas end up having small tubular adenomas as I demonstrated.     If we could reduce the burden of this, it would reduce the burden of polypectomies that need to be performed, and therefore the risk.  It would also reduce potentially the need for surveillance in this population of patients.       And then finally, chemoprevention could obviously have an impact here on surveillance of patients that are found to have adenomas, and perhaps reduce the burden and the need for surveillance.  Next slide.     So to summarize, I think we have evidence currently that screening can be very effective in reducing mortality and potentially preventing cancers.  However in 1999, only 44 percent of adults, age 50 and older, had at least one of the recommended tests at the appropriate interval.       So we have a big problem with compliance that I think creates obstacles to achieving effectiveness of screening programs.  For many of these patients screening may never been something that they choose to have, and perhaps other methods of preventing cancer need to be considered, and at least in a complimentary way with screening or perhaps instead of screening for those that don't want it.  Next slide.     And finally I think the challenges regarding screening for the future are summarized on this slide, and obviously it would be ideal not to screen everybody, but to only screen those patients most likely to develop cancer.     Dr. Rustgi presented some elegant data about how we might do that in the future but certainly risk stratification would be important.  If we could identify risk factors, we could also develop risk reduction strategies.     Developing new tools for screening.  You have genetic markers, and circulating proteins, or new imaging, may be important.  But the bottom line for screening is going to be whatever tests we end up using, we are going to have to get the public to buy into it.  Thank you very much.     (Applause.)     CHAIRMAN WOLFE:  Thank you, David, most importantly for an outstanding lecture, and secondly, for getting us back on schedule.  Our next speaker will be Dr. Bernard Levin, who is the Vice President for Chemoprevention, and Professor of Medicine at the University of Texas, M.D. Anderson Cancer Center.     And Dr. Levin will speak on the overview of chemoprevention trials.  Bernie.       DR. LEVIN:  Mr. Chairman, members of the G.I. Advisory Panel, invited guests, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to compliment the FDA on engaging us in this dialogue, because I think this is a very important topic which requires a considerable amount of attention and will undoubtedly lead to a quite intense debate.     Over the past decade or two, we have learned much about carcinogenesis as a chronic disorder, and more specifically in the colon, about the implications of the dysplasia-Carcinoma sequence.     Eloquent molecular studies and endoscopic studies have contributed to this.  In the discussion today about chemoprevention, it will reflect the work that has been done in a collaborative way between investigators at academic institutions, the National Cancer Institute, industry, and in many ways represents a synthesis of a great deal of this information.     And I think it is a very exciting time to be looking at the issue of chemoprevention.  Whereas, a lot of efforts have been focused on the treatment of established cancer, I think we are now beginning to understand the importance of trying to evaluate the possibilities of intervention at the earliest possible stages.  Next slide, please.     With advancing knowledge, we have begun to define targets for chemoprevention, and they include genetic mutations, about which you have heard, potential growth factors, and other resectors, and key enzymes, including the cyclooxygenase enzymes 1 and 2.   Next slide, please.     With specific attention to the anterior plastic effect of aspirin like drugs, a number of Cox-dependent and independent mechanisms have been developed.  Cyclooxygenase 1 and 2, and its role in prostaglandins metabolism has now been well defined.     There are also important known cyclooxygenase targets, including the PPARs, and these are all interacting to influence apoptosis, proliferation, angiogenesis, and carcinogen activation, and eventually the process and development of neoplasia and cancer.     We have learned a lot about the possibilities of how to intervene in these various pathways, both at the in vitro level, in animal models, and now beginning in human trials.  Next slide, please.     There is a considerable amount of evidence suggesting epidemiologically that long term use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, Cox inhibitors, reduce colorectal neoplasia.     And in a most recent study from Spain, a 79 percent reduction in the relative risk.  Next slide, please.     This observational data is also extended to cancer incidents, both in prospective and retrospective trials.  Next slide, please.  And also in mortality, cancer-associated mortality.  This body of data is extremely consistent, and crosses different countries, and across genders, and across different time points.  Next slide, please.     We also know that the Cox-2 inhibitor has been shown experimentally to inhibit tumor multiplicity in one of the models that has been mentioned earlier by Dr. Rustgi, and comparing a Cox-2 inhibitor with the more traditional non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug.     This effect is seen both in the early treatment, as well as in the late treatment of animals who have this genetic lesion.  Next slide, please.     Cyclooxygenase-2 as a molecular target has been found to be over-expressed in human neoplasia, both in pre-invasive neoplasia, and invasive neoplasia, in the upper digestive tract, gastrointestinal tract, the colon and rectum, consistent studies both in early and late neoplasia.  As well as other organ sites.  Next slide, please.     In a study that was done in collaboration with the National Cancer Institute, St. Marks Hospital, Pharmacia, Searle, and M.D. Anderson Cancer Center,   Cyclooxygenase-2 was shown at a dose of 400 milligrams twice a day to reflect a change in both number and size of adenomas, in a group of patients treated for six months who had familial adenomatous polyposis.     This subsequently led to approval by the Food and Drug Administration of celeboxib as a pharmacological adjunct in the management of patients with familial adenomatous polyposis.  Next slide, please.     As you heard there are a number of potential end-points for understanding and evaluating the mechanisms of treatment with chemopreventive agents, and they include adenoma number, adenoma size, and other markers, including cellular markers, and molecular markers, and now with genome array or proteomics array, and other biochemical markers.       I am going to focus now on adenomas.  Next slide, please.  And already mentioned by Dr. Lieberman, in the results of the national polyps study intervention, where it was shown that there was a substantial reduction in the number of observed cancers in this group of patients followed for approximately seven years in this report.     And compared with those expected from SEER, St. Mark's, and Mayo Clinic data.  These are not concurrent controls, however.  Next slide, please.     Now, to turn to the current sporadic intervention trials, sporadic adenoma intervention trials, these have several characteristics.  They are international, multicenter, and placebo controlled, and they are aimed at the secondary prevention of sporadic colorectal adenomas.     I am going to summarize three of these.  The rofecoxib study began in 2000, April, and includes approximately 2000 patients from 110 centers, and is comparing placebo with rofecoxib 25 milligrams a day.     Colonoscopic evaluation is performed at one year and three years, and the primary end point is the number of adenomas observed at each time point.  Next slide please.     The National Cancer Institute study of sporadic adenomas is being conducted in conjunction with Pharmacia, begin in late 1999, and has enrolled almost 2000 patients from a hundred centers, comparing placebo with 200 milligrams twice a day, and 400 milligrams twice a day of celecoxib.     Colonoscopy is performed after 1 and 3 years, and the primary end point is again the number of adenomas.  Next slide, please.     An industry supported study by Pharmacia began in March 2001, and fifteen hundred patients have been enrolled and randomized.  The placebo is compared to 400 milligrams daily, and colonoscopy is performed at 1 year and 3 years, with a primary end point being the number of adenomas.  Next slide, please.     A little more detail on this study.  The primary objective in more detail is to evaluate whether celecoxib is safe and effective in reducing the occurrence of new adenomas in subjects who have previously undergone a polypectomy.     And with secondary objectives the number of adenomas, and the histopathologic grade, and the size of the colorectal adenomas at 1 and 3 years.  Next slide, please.     Inclusion criteria include age 30 and older, attention being given to the endoscopic quality of the examination, with photography of the cecum; measurement by forceps or slide ruler of the lesion, has to be over six millimeters as a single lesion, or more than one polyp of any size based on risk modeling data.     People included have to abstain from long term NSAIDs or COX-2, with the exception of low dose aspirin.  Next slide, please.     There is stratification for low dose aspirin use into celecoxib, placebos, or no aspirin use, and again in to celeboxib or placebos.  Next slide, please.     As an example of how these studies are constructed, here is the study time line overview with the time provided for the initial enrollment of the colonoscopy and polypectomy approximately 120 days, with a placebo lead-in period, then randomization, and then surveillance at 1 year and 3 years after randomization.  Next slide, please.     Under development are a number of other chemopreventive agents which may be of interest to you.  They include COX inhibitors and other agents, and these studies are being carried out at a number of institutions, both at the National Cancer Institute, and by industry, and at university centers in this country and abroad.     And they include nimesulide, deoxycolic acid, meloxicam, and nabumetone, and other agents include some of the statins, matrix of metalloproteinase inhibitors, growth factor receptor kinase inhibitors, and others.       These are in the preclinical phases.  In phase one and two, they include combinations of non-steroidals, and difluromethylornithine, as well as other agents.     And then further Phase 3 studies have already alluded to a couple of these, but they include studies of aspirin, as well as ursodiol, sulindac sulfone, and selenium, and very few studies have made it to Phase 4, and perhaps calcium is just one example.  Next slide, please.     The potential role of interactions of these combinations is now under study, and this is one example of the use of COX inhibitors and difluromethylornithine in animal models of colorectal cancer prevention.     And these are being studied now for the first time in human studies of colon, as well as esophageal premalignancy.  Next slide, please.     To give some examples of current NCI sponsored prevention trials with COX-2 inhibitors being conducted at a variety of centers, including those that have been completed.       That one, including those that are under study on familial polyposis, hereditary non-polyposis colon cancer, sporadic adenomas, and this is the study that I alluded to, the NCI study led by Dr. Monica Bertagnolli, and another sporadic trial led by David Alberts, combining selenium with celecoxib.  Next slide, please.     These are some of the trials looking at extracolonic sites, including esophageal, Barrett's dysplasia, and another esophageal study, prostate cancer, superficial bladder cancer, actinic keratosis, and basis cell neva syndrome.     These agents mostly COX-2 inhibitors with a primary goal of looking at dysplasia as a marker, and regression of such lesions.  And they are mostly in Phase 2, and some in Phase 1 as well.  Next slide, please.     And there are additional trials on patients who have undergone resection of lung cancer, and those with lung dysplasia, and breast cancer is looking now at a marker of rectal neoplasia, aberrant crypt foci, as well as some other miscellaneous lesions.     So there is a variety of trials underway both in the colon and extra colonic sites.  Next slide, please.     I would like to address for a moment the possible roles of a chemopreventive agent in the management of colorectal neoplasia.  Clearly improvement of quality of life is most important, and to do this, we want you to reduce neoplasia incidents in mortality.       These agents may have effectiveness in delaying or complimenting initial screening, by complimenting endoscopic surveillance as we have heard from Dr. Lieberman, and by improving effectiveness.     And even in the best of hands there is a 10 to 15 percent mis-rate of adenomas, usually small ones, and more particularly flat adenomas.  It would be ideal to reduce procedure related morbidities and inconveniences, in terms of the time of the procedure, the sedation required, and thus the complications.     And possibly in the future to prolong and to examine intervals.  In very highest patients, particularly those with inherited defects, spare or delay primary prophylactic polypectomy, or second recolorectal surgeries, such as those associated with the duodenum, by inhibiting or retarding extracolonic neoplasia.  Next slide, please.     There are tensions to be considered in the evaluation.  Scientific rigor demands that we be accurate, and reproducible, and we can quantify the benefits, and that we can with considerable accuracy, provide predictive insurance.     On the other hand, in the discussion of trials of chemoprevention, there are issues of scientific practicality, and the time taken, and the number of people who are willing to enroll in such studies, the financial underpinning of such studies, and a moving landscape of early detection, screening, and other factors.  Next slide, please.     Intermediate end-points need to be considered broadly and an example from cardiovascular disease, which is described in the FDA and the Endocrinologic and Metabolic Drugs Advisory Committee, is an interesting one and may have application in the considerations that we have today.     This committee previously recommended, and the Food and Drug Administration concurred, that approval of lipid-altering agents should be based on a drug's biochemical efficacy and decreasing serum lipids.     Attempts to establish clinical efficacy and the prevention of coronary artery disease or other manifestation of atherosclerosis, would require prolonged observations, and hamper research and development of this class of drugs.  Next slide, please.     As we consider the development of chemopreventive drugs in populations at risk.  We can look at the general population, and where we have heard there is an approximate 40 percent incidence of adenomas, and where we might want to think about a primary prevention.     And there might include dietary and other lifestyle factors, including possibly calcium folate and physical activities, and other factors.  We want to focus here on the least harmful, if at all, and what to be assured that this applies to the greatest population.       Moderate risk individuals might be those with current or prior adenomas, people who have had a previous cancer, and where the lifetime risk is greater than the standard risk, which is approximately 5 percent, and here it is about double or triple.     And secondly prevention may be most important, including some of the kinds of agents that I have already described.       And then finally the high risk groups, with inherited disorders, require their own special attention, and again both surgical and pharmacological management have their roles.  The last slide, please.     I would like to refer you to a recent American Association of Cancer Research Task Force document, which is actually included in some of the material that you received, where very thoughtful conclusions were reached about the value of risk reduction trials.     And to quote from this, ""In colorectal cancer risk reduction trials, the adenoma is a disease end-point, a point of clinical intervention and risk, and perhaps an ideal goal might be in initial studies to show a 30 percent relative reduction in adenoma incidents.""     ""But other potential clinical benefits might include a decrease in the number of polypectomies and procedure related risks, a delay in time to adenomas, which malignant potential, particularly advanced adenomas, an increase in intervals between surveillance procedures, as well as organ preservation.""  Thank you for your attention.     (Applause.)     CHAIRMAN WOLFE:  Thank you, Dr. Levin.  Our next speaker will be Dr. Mark Avigan, who is a Medical Officer in the Division of Gastrointestinal and Coagulation Drug Products, Center for Drug Evaluation and Research.     Dr. Avigan will speak on benefit and risk analysis for chemoprevention of sporadic colorectal cancer.     DR. AVIGAN:  Thank you.  My name is Mark Avigan, and before I came to the FDA, I served on the faculty at Georgetown as a Board Certified gastroenterologist.  Now, approval of drugs by the FDA for the chemoprevention of colorectal cancer depends on adequate controlled clinical trials, which demonstrate a favorable benefit risk assessment in defined populations of patients.     Today, in order to develop a conceptual approach to the development of a benefit risk analysis of chemopreventive agents for the prevention of colorectal cancer, which I will refer to in my subsequent slides as CRC, I intend to touch on the following areas.     First, there are important public health concerns surrounding the addition of chemopreventive agents to the mix of other cancer prevention strategies which we heard about today, including colonoscopic screening and surveillance.     Second, there are important issues that must be taken into account, which are fundamental to a useful efficacy and safety analysis of chemopreventive agents.  These include a discussion about the value of adenomas as efficacy endpoints, and the parameters of an adequate safety analysis.     I shall highlight criteria for FDA approval of two agents for the prevention of specific neoplasms before listing unresolved issues concerning the chemoprevention of sporadic colorectal cancer that need to be addressed today by the committee.     As a public health matter, it is essential that chemopreventive treatment does not displace colonoscopic screening and surveillance if the suppression of cancer by the agent is not as effective as the screening program.     Patients treated with a chemopreventive agent who mistakenly decides to avoid colonoscopic examinations of an impression that they are not necessary may be subjected to a worsening of their cancer risk.       Finally, because only a small proportion of treated patients would be destined to develop colorectal cancer, the risk attached to treat it with a chemopreventive agent of many outweigh the theoretical benefit to a few.     What are potential clinically meaningful benefits from drug administration?  There are three basic categories of possible benefits, depending on whether patients undergo colonoscopic screening and surveillance.     The first is adjunctive cancer prevention, in which the drug should provide an additive effect in the reduction of risk for colorectal cancer, or colorectal cancer mortality to the standard colonoscopic screening and surveillance.     In some cases it might be justified to relax screening and surveillance guidelines, enabling an older age of initial screening, and/or increased time intervals between examinations without a worsening of cancer risk.     The second is alternative cancer prevention, in which the chemopreventive agent is substituted for colonoscopic screening and surveillance.  For those who would otherwise be colonoscoped, elimination of screening and surveillance must not compromise cancer risk.     In some cases, alternative treatment might be justified because of an advantage in the drug safety profile, compared to colonoscopy, without compromise of cancer risk, and something which Dr. Lieberman alluded to before.     Finally, there are patients who are unable or unwilling to comply with colonoscopic guidelines, and in this group the benefit of cancer risk reduction must outweigh the risk of developing serious drug adverse events.  Next slide.     Clinical study designs for the evaluation of chemopreventive agents must be compatible with the intended treatment indications.  In planning a suitable analysis of efficacy in clinical trials, the following elements must be taken into consideration.     First, the study population.  This can either be comprised of individuals who are at normal or increased risk for the development of sporadic colorectal cancer.     Second, the planned end-points of the study should be considered.  These can be clinically significant end-points, such as cancer, or surrogates, such as small adenomas.       Third, background management and treatment must be considered.  For example, colonoscopy has a profound impact, both on the monitoring of end points and the potential benefit of the test agent.     In addition, medications with possible chemopreventive properties such as low-dose aspirin, may influence the benefit of the study drug.  Finally, a sufficient duration of treatment must be planned that will allow detection of a meaningful change, either pre-malignant or malignant lesions.     Results of short term studies cannot determine whether adenoma suppression and responders is durable.  This can only be illuminated by studies of sufficient duration.     If surrogate measurements are used as primary end points, they must reliably predict cancer risks or be validated by measurements of cancer or cancer mortality.     The following elements must be taken into account if incidents of colorectal adenoma reoccurrence after baseline colonoscopic removal of polyps is used as a surrogate for a cancer risk.  First, the probability that a small adenoma, less than half a sonometer in diameter, contains high grade dysplasia, or malignant changes in individuals not treated with a chemopreventive agent in the U.S. is less than one percent.       Second, the average transition time from small adenoma to invasive cancer has been estimated to be greater than 10 years.  Finally, in the national polyp study, despite reduction of recurrent cancer risk after a cleaning colonoscopy, and that is the baseline colonoscopy, the percentage of patients with recurrent small or medium adenomas without advanced pathological features was over 30 percent.       Therefore, although colonoscopic screening and surveillance effectively prevents most malignant lesions, the recurrence of adenomas is common.  Next slide.     The study size that is needed to measure efficacy of a drug depends on the incidence of neoplasms in the treated population.  In familial adenomatous polyposis, in the absence of prophylactic proctocolonectomy as we heard from Dr. Rustgi, the cumulative lifetime risk of adenomas approaches a hundred percent.     It is not very different than the risk to develop cancer.  In contrast though, the prevalence of sporadic adenomas approaches 50 or 60 percent in the background geriatric population.     The cumulative lifetime incidence of colorectal cancer is only 6 percent.  Because of their high incidence in polyposis patients, the number of patient years needed to detect, say, a 50 percent reduction of either adenomas or cancer, is estimated to be in the range of 2,000.     Likewise, the number of required patient years to measure a 50 percent reduction of sporadic adenomas is approximately 3,000.  In contrast, because of the relatively lower incidence of sporadic cancer in the background population, the number of patient years needed to measure the same degree of cancer suppression is in excess of 30,000.     This requirement for a large study holds true even in the absence of any prevention or screening strategies.  Next slide.     As Dr. Lieberman described earlier in his presentation, an important advance in the quest towards reduction in incidents of colorectal cancer mortality has been the institution of guidelines for screening and surveillance colonoscopy in both normal and increased risk groups in the U.S.     These are based on the following elements.  First, the national polyp study has demonstrated that 3 years after a cleansing colonoscopy with endoscopic inspection of the colorectal surface and excision of polyps at baseline, the incidents of cancer was reduced by 76 and 90 percent, compared to two reference populations.     Second, approximately 95 percent of colonoscopies performed by competent endoscopists resulted in examination of the entire colon rectum and successful removal of histopathologically advanced pre-malignant polyps.       Finally the serious adverse event rate linked to colonoscopic examinations is between approximately .1 percent and .3 percent as we heard.  This is relatively low.     The effectiveness and safety of colonoscopic screening surveillance, borne out by these observations, establish an important benchmark for other prevention modalities.  Next slide.     In clinical practice, a meaningful benefit of cancer risk reduction that is linked to the administration of a chemopreventive agent, may not be achieved if there is one or more of the following.       First, poor compliance during long term chronic administration of a drug.  Second, lack of sufficient duration of the treatment of patients.  Third, rebound of adenomas neoplastic growth despite continued chemoprevention treatment.     And finally administration of ineffective doses or reserval of efficacy due to other concomitant medications or medical conditions.  Next slide.     To address the safety analysis of chemopreventive agents, I will briefly touch on the following issues.  First, the appropriate population in which an analysis of risk that includes drug toxicity should be performed.     Second, I will point to a number of examples of drug classes which may have important chemopreventive properties, but which also may be tied to significant safety issues.     These include non-selective, non-steroidal, anti-inflammatory agents, including aspirin and COX-2 inhibitors.  Finally, to sort through offsetting benefit of cancer prevention versus risk attached to treatment, the issues of power calculations and study design will be raised.     It needs to be emphasized that the targeted patient population for chemoprevention will encompass a very large segment of the geratic community, which may be especially susceptible to severe clinical manifestations of drug toxicity.       In addition, because of the high frequency of co-administration of multiple medications in this group, significant drug-drug interactions may occur.   The incidents of drug related toxicity may increase after chronic administration.       An example might be drug related serious thrombotic cardiovascular events, which may be more prone to develop as a result of long term treatment.   Finally, chronic treatment of with a chemopreventive agent may slow the macroscopic appearance of adenomas polyps, but not affect progression towards dysplasia and cancer.       It is not inconceivable that individuals chronically treated with a chemopreventive agent may exhibit a higher probability of developing malignancy associated with microscopic and small adenomas lesions than non-treated subjects.       Such outcomes can only be determined by studies with long term treatment protocols.  Next slide, please.  Recently, a number of studies have concluded that administration of certain non-selected, non-steroidal agents, or COX-2 inhibitors, may suppress adenomas polyps and cancer.     Each of these classes of drugs are associated with potential advantages and disadvantages regarding their safety profiles.  These may have a strong impact on their overall benefit as cancer prevention agents.     For example, a number of studies have suggested that the overall benefit of aspirin is strongly affected by the relatively high annual rates of serious upper-GI treatment complications, which individuals over the age of 65, may be as high as 16 per 10,000 patient years.     In the calculation of overall benefit of aspirin administration, consideration for possible concomitant prevention of cardiovascular events must also be given.  In the case of COX-2 inhibitors, concern has been raised about the possibility of drug related serious cardiovascular events linked to treatment.       For example, in the Vioxx GI Clinical Outcomes Research study, commonly known as VIGOR, in which the mean duration of treatment of approximately 8,000 randomized patients was 9 months, treatment with 50 milligram doses of rofecoxib was associated with an MI rate of 74 per 10,000 patient years, compared to only 15 per 10,000 in the control naprosyn 500 milligram bid treatment group.     Regardless of whether the excess of Mis is due to toxicity of rofecoxib, or alternatively a protected effect of naprosyn, further study of such adverse drug events is essential in order to establish a benefit risk analysis in chemopreventive treatment for the elderly.  Next slide.     It is expected that the context of current standards of care in the U.S. for eradication or for an indication of colorectal cancer chemoprevention, the incidence of drug associated serious adverse events and mortality should be small enough to be overshadowed by the benefit of a chemopreventive agent related reduction and cancer-linked mortality, and/or serious complications associated with colonoscopy.     Clinical studies should be powered to adequate measure these effects.  In clinical studies, the statistical power for safety end point measurements is a function of both the number of treated patients and the duration of treatment.       Therefore, cancer chemoprevention studies must contain adequate numbers of patients.  An adequately powered analysis of subsets of patients is needed to ensure the number of preventive colorectal cancer cancers will exceed the number of patients who will get serious adverse events.       Remember, for indication of cancer prevention, a lot of healthy people without illness will be treated and exposed to a drug.  In some instances, to maximize the safety outcomes and mortality analysis treatment of an extended duration will have to be analyzed.  Next slide.     For each of the previously mentioned reasons to treat with a chemopreventive agent shown on the left side of the slide, there are distinct possible benefits as rates can be estimated.     First, we could think about adding chemoprevention to the presently recommended regime of colonoscopy as an adjunct.  In this case, there would be little benefit from preventing cancers that are already prevented by colonoscopy.     The benefits should come from preventing those cancers that are missed by the procedure.  Assuming colonoscopy misses precancerous lesions in one patient in four, and that all of these would develop into cancer, the rate is about 4 per 10,000 patient years, or perhaps 11 per 10,000 in higher risk patients.     Second, we might think eventually replacing the recommended regime of colonoscopy as an alternative.  In this case, there would be an additional benefit of avoiding the cost, discomfort, and possible adverse consequences of the procedure.     We estimate that the serious adverse event rate for colonoscopy to be at .3 percent.  So, for three colonoscopies per lifetime, and that is just a padunct figure, the adverse event rate approximates 3 per 10,000 patients.       When this possible benefit is added to the total chemoprevention benefit, it could be as high as 7 per 10,000 in normal risk, and 14 per 10,000 in higher risk patients.     Here we are oversimplying of course counting cancers and serious adverse events as equal, and leaving out other less serious consequences of the procedure.     These two possible regimes of adding on to or replacing current practice are extremes of course.  We might also imagine something in between, where patients treated with chemopreventive agents still undergo colonoscopy, but less frequently.     Thirdly, there may be a population who would comply with a regime of chemoprevention, but not colonoscopy.  For such individuals, the reference therapy is nothing at all, and preventing any cancers is a benefit.       Whether it would also have been prevented by colonoscopy is irrelevant, because these individuals are not having a screening procedure.  We estimate the background rate of cancer distributed between ages 40 and 80 in untreated patients is approximately 15 per 10,000 patient years, or 45 per 10,000 in higher risk patients.      As a general rule if drug related serious adverse events are above the rates of the benefits of treatment, then approval is difficult to justify.  Next slide.  I want to thank Dr. Thomas Permutt, a mathematical statistician in our biometrics group, who helped us develop the next few slides.       Another way of looking at these figures is in terms of the number needed to treat.  That is, as I showed you in the previous slide, if the rate of colorectal cancer is 15 in 10,000 per year in normal risk, people who altogether avoid colonoscopy, and we are able to eliminate the cancers by chemoprevention, we need to treat about 700 people for a year for each case of cancer prevented.       The number needed to treat would be a little less for higher risk groups, and a little more for prevention that was less than perfectly effective.  But it still is going to be in hundreds or thousands, regardless of these variables.       This means of course that if there are any risks associated with the preventive agent, we need to expose some hundreds or thousands of people to these risks to reap the benefit in a single patient.       This is the main difference between treating a frank disease at one end of the spectrum, and preventing a rare disease at the other.  In treating sick people, we may hope that therapies will be effective.  If not in all patients, then perhaps in a half, or a quarter, or a quarter, or even in ten.     Furthermore, we would be able to observe whether the therapy was effective or not and discontinue it when it was not.  So the number needed to treat for many therapeutic products might even approach one.     This means that the risk of therapies largely are borne by the patients who benefit, and it can often be weighed against observable benefits for those patients.     Here in contrast the risk, if there is any, will be born principally by the hundreds of patients who do not benefit, rather than the one who does.  The treated population as whole will still be better off though if the risk is not too great.     How confident can we be about how big the risk is.  Well, it depends on the kind of risk we are talking about.  Next slide.  Consider first the possibility of rare idiosyncratic adverse events.  Suppose we study 10,000 subjects for a year on a drug, and 10,000 on placebo.     And suppose we see no cases of something rare, and let's say aplastic anemia.  We can be pretty confident that the risk of aplastic anemia on drug is not more than 3 in 10,000.  At worse then, this risk would be in the same order of magnitude as the benefit.  Next slide.     On the other hand, suppose in the same subjects we see 100 myocardial infarctions on placebo, and 100 on the active drug.  There is no evidence at all of the drug effective, but the 95 percent competency rule for difference in rates is plus or minus 14 in 10,000.     Even if we eliminated every one of the 15 cases of colorectal cancer in the 10,000 subjects that are treated with a chemopreventive agent, we would not know whether 14 of the Mis in that group are caused by the drug, or are merely part of the background rate.     Of course, if the Mis are induced by the drug, then we would be causing about one MI for every cancer prevented at a rather high price.  A one year study in 10,000 patients is thus incapable of distinguishing between no harm at all and a harm that dwarfs the benefit.     In fact, to discriminate between an excess risk of 15 drug related Mis in 10,000 treated subjects from adverse events that are merely part of a background rate of one in a hundred, we would require about 70,000 patient years per treatment group.       Of course, we approve drugs all the time without being able to confidently rule out either idiosyncratic risk or subtle changes in ordinary risks.       Again, the main difference here is the number needed to treat.  Normally, we have to weigh adverse events against frequent benefits for therapeutic drugs treating active disease.       Here with a preventive drug, we have to weigh rare adverse events against benefits that are also relatively rare.  Therefore, in contrast to familial adenomatous polyposis, the maximum benefit of sporadic colorectal cancer suppression is limited to a small percentage of both normal and increased risk patients who are treated with chemopreventive agents.     Since colonoscopy is effective, the benefit of adjunctive treatment is reduced when colonoscopic screening and surveillance is performed.  Similarly the size of the benefit may be influenced by co-administration of drugs for other indications that would have chemopreventive properties.     An example might be low dose aspirin.  A benefit risk assessment of chemopreventive agents requires accurate measurement of serious adverse events linked to the drug.       To this end, studies that are adequately powered for safety must be performed.  Critical determinants of required numbers of patients enrolled in each treatment arm are the background serious adverse event rates, and treatment duration.     In the elderly, when certain background and serious adverse event rates are high, as in the case of thrombotic cardiovascular events, very large numbers of treated patients must be analyzed.       If drug related serious adverse events increase over time and treatment studies with an adequate duration of treatment to determine cumulative adverse event rates must also be performed.     Now, what is the FDA track record for approval of chemopreventive agents so far?  Based on results of the breast cancer prevention trial, which enrolled over 13,000 patients, tamoxifen has been approved by the FDA for the reduction in breast cancer incidents in high risk women.       The trial was designed with a primary objective to determine whether after five years of treatment there is a reduction in the incidence of this lesion.     The approval was linked to a 44 percent reduction in the incidence of invasive breast cancer after a median follow-up of 4.2 years.  Because in the tamoxifen treatment group of 6,500 women, there were 70 less invasive cancers in the comparable placebo group, and the number needed to treat to gain a benefit was approximately one in a hundred.     Of course, it is difficult to compare the numbers needed to treat between the tamoxifen trial and colorectal cancer prevention trials since the end point in the former case was invasive breast cancer, and there is no analogous intermediate treatment, such as colonoscopy, which can be used for breast cancer prevention.     Celeoxib has been granted accelerated approval status for the reduction of adenomas colorectal polyps in familial adenomatous as an adjunct to usual care that includes endoscopic surveillance and surgery.     Accelerated approval is considered for serious or life threatening illness when there is a meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing treatments.     Furthermore, a surrogate measure may be acceptable as a primary end point if it is likely to predict a clinical benefit.  As stated in the labeling, it is not known whether there is a clinical benefit from a reduction in the number of colorectal polyps in hereditary polypolous patients.     Or whether celecoxib treatment beyond six months is safe or effective.  The approval is contingent upon performance of Phase IV studies to verify, and assess clinical benefit, and measure long term safety outcomes.     The decision of accelerated approval for this indication is taking into account the very high likelihood of the development of tumors in young patients with familial polypopous.     As I mentioned, management of hereditary polypopous patients includes prophylactic polypectomy, whose timing might be influenced by treatment with a chemopreventive agent.      So therefore it should be emphasized that both the rationale and the benefit risk analysis, which are linked to the administration of the chemopreventive agent in the management of familial adenomas polyposis patients are very different considerations that underlie treatments in the prevention of sporadic colorectal cancer.     To date, no agents have been approved by the food and drug administration for the chemoprevention of sporadic colorectal cancer.  What are the essential requirements for evidence of effectiveness and safety of agents for this indication?     How do current guidelines for colonoscopic surveillance affect these benchmarks?  The agency is seeking advice from the advisory committee to address the following issues surrounding studies.       First, clarification of significance of clinical benefits linked to a chemopreventive agent.     Second, clinical design requirements that include definitions of which patients should be enrolled, the role of surrogate end points, such as adenomas polyps in measurements of clinical benefit.     The duration of treatment and adequate power for safety.  These should be consistent with the specific clinical benefit that is intended.  Third, data analysis requirements that include approaches to study dropouts and uncontrolled safety information.     Finally, requirements to generate a useful benefit risk analysis.  Thank you.     (Applause.)     CHAIRMAN WOLFE:  I am going to exercise the Chair's preoperative, and change the schedule slightly.  We are 15 minutes ahead of schedule, and so while the lectures are fresh in our minds, we will open the floor now for questions regarding the various presentations.     And I will start off while people are formulating their questions, and I would like to ask Dr. Lieberman a couple of questions.  The most important complication that we have to work out with any procedure or any screening device is mortality, and you didn't mention mortality in the VA cooperative study.       I am not sure that there was any mortality, but can you discuss mortality in various series, and I have a second question for you, too, which is unrelated to mortality.     And that is how do you assess size, and how do you take into account the incredible variability among different observers with regard to the size of the polyp?     DR. LIEBERMAN:  Okay.  First, let me address mortality.  In the published studies to date, the mortality rates have been estimated to be .001 to .003 percent, or roughly 10 percent of the rates have complications that I cited.     These deaths have been attributed to the primary complication, either the bleeding event leading to surgery and mortality that way, or a cardiopulmonary event.     In the VA study there were three deaths within 30 days of the procedure, none of which were directly attributable to the procedure.  So, to answer that question.  The second question, Mike, was?     CHAIRMAN WOLFE:  About polyp size, because as we all know when people do an endoscopy there is a very significant different in observer estimation of the size of polyps.       DR. LIEBERMAN:  I think as Dr. Levin pointed out in some of the studies that are being done right now, and in our study as well, we recognized the difficulties with estimation of size, and required some sort of quantitative measurement either at the time of the procedure itself, where a biopsy forceps is opened next to the polyp and a photograph taken, and that is what we did in the VA study.       Or there is an actual measurement once the polyp is removed prior to pathology.  We don't know the accuracy of performing that latter approach, and actually we are evaluating that in the VA study right now at a couple of the sites.       CHAIRMAN WOLFE:  And polyps do shrink when you cut out their blood supply.      DR. LIEBERMAN:  Reportedly, they do, and although there are a couple of our investigators that wanted to take a look at that since we have both measurements, and so we can actually look at that.       CHAIRMAN WOLFE:  One last quick question.  So am I to assume that if you are to recommend later on that we do look at a polyp as a surrogate that you will also recommend that polyp size be measured by some kind of open forceps, or some other equally accurate or semi-accurate measurement?     DR. LIEBERMAN:  I would argue that if polyp size is going to be an important end point that you have to have some methodology for measuring it.  In our study, we did -- because one of the end points of our study were adenomas greater than one centimeter, we felt that we had to have some kind of quantitative measurement.     CHAIRMAN WOLFE:  And before we go on to further questions, also one last point that I do want to make, which is that Dr. Lieberman discussed other possible methods for screening, but the assumption today will be colonoscopy will be used as the gold standard, and anything else at this point is either substandard or experimental.  So we will be discussing only colonoscopy today.  Dr. Kramer.     DR. KRAMER:  I don't know if the information or the answer to this is known, but several, or two or three of the speakers mentioned that a particular target population for study would be those who refuse to undergo colonoscopy.     And if that is your target population, to me at least that might enter some complexities in getting the study done.  For example, people who refuse one medical procedure that are ""no compliers"" may be non-compliers more generally.     And, secondly, I would like to know if there is information on subsequent compliance to other interventions in people who specifically colonoscopy.  The second issue is when you are designing the study, to what lengths must you go to convince non-compliers?     If introduces a potential -- I don't want to say conflict of interest, but the additional complexity that if it is in your interests to get non-compliers, you have to be very careful exactly how non-compliant they are, and to what lengths you need go to convince them that they should not be in the study in the first place, and that they should have gotten a colonoscopy.     CHAIRMAN WOLFE:  Dr. Kramer, that is a very important question and so important in fact that we will be discussing this in the afternoon.  It is one of our specific questions, and what the committee and the guests are charged to discuss.     So I would like to hold the answer to that question, because it really isn't for any specific person.  It is a very important question, and again we will be discussing it.       Before any other questions, I should remind you all that when you do start speaking, please identify yourself.  It does help in the transcripts.     DR. BARON:  I have one comment and one question. My name is John Baron from Dartmouth Medical School.  First, regarding polyp size.  Many studies, and probably most, show that once the histology of the lesion is taken into account, size becomes much less important in consideration of its potency as a risk factor or its appropriateness as an end point.       So in somewhat more sophisticated analyses, size really diminishes in its magnitude of importance.  The question that I have for Dr. Avigan is in the tamoxifen studies, you mention the benefit for breast cancer that tamoxifen brings.       I am curious, but I can't remember what the benefit or risks of tamoxifen with regard to coronary artery disease are, and in your slide immediately preceding that, you mentioned that that sort of thing is likely to be an important issue.       So I am curious whether when you considered tomoxifen that you took into account the coronary artery disease experience of the patients.       DR. HOUN: Did you want to answer this?  NCI ran this.       DR. KRAMER: I can give a little bit of information.  Since tamoxifen does lower lipids, the initial sense was that it might decrease cardiovascular disease, and that cholesterol was felt to be a possible surrogate for a health outcome.       It turned out that in the breast cancer prevention trial that even though lipids were lower, and cholesterol was lower, there was no difference; no decrease, but no increase in the instance of cardiovascular disease.     DR. BARON:  So from the FDA's perspective then, do you believe that the possibility of a harm from tamoxifen with regard to vascular disease was ruled out in the manner that you described previously?     CHAIRMAN WOLFE:  Dr. Geller would like to answer the question.     DR. GELLER:  In the tamoxifen study, the age distribution of the women was lower than one would wish to see a cardiovascular benefit.  So the sample size was in essence too small given the age distribution to see a cardiovascular benefit.     DR. BARON:  But I am referring to Dr. Avigan's slide, and in which he said that -- I mean, he actually imposed quite a high barrier for chemoprevention studies, implying not only does the point estimate for harm have to be obviously in a neutral or positive direction, but that the lower bound of the possible harm has to not be large.     DR. HOUN:  I think that the --     DR. BARON:  And I am curious, and I am just exploring this.     DR. HOUN: I think with tamoxifen, because the agent has been around for 30 years, the trial was in some sense reassuring in that the serious adverse event profile, in terms of endometrial cancer risk, DVTs, PEs, was not unexpected.      And especially in this new population, in terms of women who are cancer free at this point in time and high risk for cancer, but cancer free.  I mean, it was reassuring to know.     So in terms of the data from that trial, I don't think we saw any signal to be concerned about.  That is unknown from the safety profile of a drug that has been around for 30 years.      DR. AVIGAN:  I would just add that two of the other points that I tried to make was that there really is no -- just as a concept, there really is no intermediate or other intervention, except for treatment, and which makes it different.     And the endpoint in that study really was invasive cancer.  Again, that's not a quantitative comparative criteria, but it is a qualitative assessment of that consideration for approval.     DR. METZ:  Just one question for Dr. Rustgi and Dr. Levin, who both suggested that perhaps reduction in polyp size might be an important outcome to look at.       And Dr. Avigan raised the exact opposite point, and that perhaps a smaller polyp might be just as risky, in terms of its ultimate development, and you would need to follow these patients for an extended period of time.     Now, clearly this is one of the big questions that we are dealing with, but I was wondering if perhaps Drs. Rustgi and Levine could suggest something to the surrogate that we could actually consider, such as biomarkers that might change.     CHAIRMAN WOLFE:  Before we go any further, this is a discussion for the afternoon, and I was actually going to mention that before you raised this, because size should not be dismissed at this point.  It is a point of discussion.     And Dr. Avigan is not only a gastroenterologist, but he is a pathologist also, and the point that we may be sacrificing a reduction in size for a change in the biology is a more aggressive nature.     And that has to be discussed in the afternoon, and so I would rather hold off that discussion when we have that specific question in the afternoon.     MS. COHEN:  Dr. Avigan, considering a patient who comes into your office, and I am asking what is the best thing to do, and I want to know how -- and maybe this is suspect and might have polyps.  But what is the best way to identify the polyp?     Secondly, if you give me a CPA, how do you know whether it is effective or not?  How do I find out if it is effective?  And I hate to be pragmatic, but in health insurance it might determine which treatment that I get?     DR. AVIGAN:  Well, thank you for the question.  I would actually defer part of it to Dr. Lieberman, because I think he did talk about the effectiveness of colonoscopy.     But I think that as just a general principal for a gastroenterologist seeing patients, and dealing with patients where there is an uncertainty principle about whether they do or do not have a lesion lurking somewhere in their colon, and that one would not know for sure, or not with certainty not well developed unless one looked.     And essentially at this time from what we have heard, the best way to look is by colonoscopic examination.  And then in addition to the examination, you have the option of the excision of the polyp.       CHAIRMAN WOLFE:  Does anyone want to add anything to that?     DR. LIEBERMAN:  No.     MS. COHEN:  My other question was that if I took a CPA, how do you follow that, and how do you know whether it has been effective or not?  What method do you use?     DR. AVIGAN:  I think that is the sort of million dollar question in some respects, and the recommendation of the physician would be driven by the data of the efficacy of the drug, which is what we are prospectively talking about.  That is, what are the standards of study design.       DR. KRAMER:  A million dollars may be a little bit too conservative.     DR. CRYER:  Byron Cryer.  I have a question actually for Dr. Levine.  Given that one of our principal responsibilities is to determine to what extent the reductions in these intermediate end points, such as polyps, correlates with reductions in other clinical consequences, such as colorectal cancer, and I would like to come back to a comment that you alluded to which was the effect of celecoxib, and FAP.     So we know that you were a critical investigator, and an important investigator, in the celecoxib FAP trial.  And you alluded to the point that in the Phase IV experience of FAP that those investigations are ongoing.     I was wondering what you might be able to tell us specifically about reductions in colorectal cancer in that Phase IV experience.       DR. LEVIN:  Thanks, Byron.  That is a critical question because the FDA obviously is interested in that.  To date, we don't have data yet from that experience, and it is going to take a while to accumulate that.  Obviously, that will be of long term interest.     DR. FURBERG:  Another question for Dr. Levin.  You reviewed the ongoing secondary prevention trials, and you presented us the efficacy outcomes, and you left out the safety outcomes, and if you could summarize those, and also indicate if possible the power that you have to detect the adverse effects.     DR. LIEBERMAN:  Clearly, what we are looking at is a common event in a -- or a relatively common event in a population that are asymptomatic.  It is of critical importance to examine safety issues.     All the studies which I am aware of, major studies, have data safety and monitoring boards which are independent of the primary investigators, and are very well aware of the issues regarding not only gastrointestinal safety, but also cardiovascular risk.     And it is obviously too early to comment on actual data because of the incompleteness of the studies have not actually reached even the one year mark.     Most of the individuals included clearly have not, but clearly independent data safety and monitoring is vital to the future of these studies, and is being examined by these groups.       So I think that can be reassuring, but I cannot give you any data to date.     DR. FURBERG:  I didn't ask for data, and you didn't really answer my question.       DR. LEVIN:  Because data is not yet available.     DR. FURBERG:  No, but the committee can only look at the data that you are collecting, and I want to know what data are you collecting.  What is your definition of safety in the trials?     DR. LEVIN:  Detailed evaluations of pre-inclusion history, as well as adverse events, both significant and not significant, are accumulated in these studies.      There is frequent investigation or interrogation with monitors, and physician -- outpatient physician data is looked at by the monitors.  So I think I can be reasonably reassuring that this is an object of critical evaluation.     I would be glad to provide to you, subject to availability, and probably not today, of the forms that are being used for this kind of evaluation.     DR. FURBERG:  That would be helpful.  Thank you.     CHAIRMAN WOLFE:  Dr. Kramer.     DR. KRAMER:  So this perhaps is a corollary question, but much of what we -- and this is Barry Kramer by the way.  I wanted to direct this to Bernard Levin, and it is perhaps a follow-on to the last question.       As we are struggling all day today with whether or not we can rely on surrogates of benefit, and yet I don't know what is built into such studies for surrogates at harm.       I assume we are looking for medical harms, but that may put the downside of treatments at a disadvantage if we will only accept medical harm, but we would accept surrogates of medical benefit in order to determine the outcome of the trial.       Are there any built in surrogates of harm in any of these trials?     DR. LEVIN:  I can only comment with some precision on two of the trials.  The surrogates that you might expect would include biochemical markers of harm, such as blood count or biochemistry profiles, and those would be surrogates of harm that clearly are being looked at.       Certain other events would be further examined if there was any kind of clinical reason for expecting there to be an explanation for symptoms.  So these individuals are followed quite closely, and are monitored for global events, as well as specific hematological and biochemical events.     CHAIRMAN WOLFE:  Dr. Lippman, did you have a comment?     DR. LIPPMAN:  Yes.  I would like to just get a clarification from Dr. Avigan and his presentation from the gastroenterologist in the group.  When you went through the calculations, and the mathematical model, you clearly were using as a disease cancer, and talked about the benefits of that statistically.     And I guess one of the issues that we will discuss here is what is a disease, and so my question is small adenomas if you do a colonoscopy, are those not removed by polypectomy?  Are they treated differently than the large ones?     DR. AVIGAN:  I think that they are generally removed, and Dr. Lieberman might mention that, but I guess what the subtext of your question is, is it a adenomas disease, as opposed to a sort of pre-disease state.       And I think that actually is one of the issues that we will be dealing with in our discussion.     DR. LIPPMAN:  I think it is extremely important when you look through your calculations.  Clearly the IEN task force, that AACR that Dr. Levin referred to, the whole movement in the field is that these types of lesions are diseases.     And if they are being treated surgically by polypectomy, that would sort of reemphasize that they are diseases.     DR. AVIGAN:  I would just follow up and just point out again the fact that as was mentioned by Dr. Lieberman, that most adenomas do not go beyond the state of early or premalignant lesions, and that the other point about that which must be considered is that in the geriatric population, adenomas probably occur in at least half the population.     So that I think that that is a spin on whether we call it a disease or not.     DR. LIPPMAN:  Right.  And just one last thing on this.  I do think that if you are telling me that these are treated differently by the gastroenterologist, then I think we can deal with it.     But if they are treated, and if they are removed, then until we know that we can leave them and not treat them, I think we have to deal with them as a disease.       CHAIRMAN WOLFE:  David.     DR. LIEBERMAN:  Let me just make a brief comment.  I think that although it is very true that most adenomas do not evolve into advanced adenomas or cancers, most GI physicians accept the polypectomy hypothesis as compelling.     And therefore most of us do when we encounter an adenoma remove it at the time of colonoscopy.       CHAIRMAN WOLFE:  I don't think there is -- there is very few gastroenterologists who don't take out polyps.  We see them and we take them.       DR. LIEBERMAN:  That's correct.     DR. GELLER:  Nancy Geller.  I have a question about trial design.  In the PRESAP study, I don't understand the role of the surveillance colonoscopy at year one relative to the end point.     DR. LEVIN:  This was built in to determine if in fact there was significant benefit within a rapid period of time that perhaps could not have been anticipated.       This would have a significant impact on the expected outcome, and would also potentially if a very significant impact, might have some implications for subsequent management.       This was discussed extensively in the formulation of this trial.  And while it is a 3 year trial, and the analysis will be done formally at the 3 year end point, the possibility, perhaps remote, that we might achieve a significant gain within a shorter period of time was one that we didn't want to overlook.     CHAIRMAN WOLFE:  Dr. Fogel.     DR. FOGEL:  Ron Fogel, and I have a question for Dr. Lieberman.  Can you comment on the missed polyp rate at colonoscopy and the implications of that for further studies?     DR. LIEBERMAN:  This is David Liberman.  I cannot respond to that directly from the VA study.  I can cite two other studies in which there were back to back colonoscopies performed; one from the early 1990s, and one from the later 1990s.      In both cases, small polys were commonalist, ranging anywhere from about 20 to perhaps 25 percent.  Large polyps were rarely missed in both of these studies.       So I would suggest that colonoscopies are extremely accurate for detection of large, meaning greater than one centimeter, lesions.  And they commonly miss small adenomas.     And going back to the previous question, I think that is one of the reasons that a lot of the prevention studies are designed with that one year colonoscopy.       It is not only to detect an early effect, but it is also to eliminate the possibility that there were polyps missed on the first colonoscopy.     DR. LIPPMAN:  Scott Lippman.  I would just like to pick up another, I think, really excellent point that Dr. Avigan made in his slide, but I would like to extend it.     And he talked about the celecoxib study, and that it may not be permanent, but even a delay of the onset of these kinds of procedures would be important.  And I would just like to extend that that is an excellent point to the entire field.      Clearly we would like long term studies that go on for 30 years and can delay things forever.  But I think even short term intervention was a positive effect.  That delays the onset of some of these neoplastic processes, and it could be of tremendous clinical benefit.     So again it is a concept that we will talk about more later, but I wouldn't just use that for the FAP argument.  It applies to all of them and deals with the issue of treatment duration and benefit.     CHAIRMAN WOLFE:  Just before we go any further, remember just to reinforce this, this is FDA and not NIH, and we have to take into account the difference, and how displays will be designed, and recommendations we will be making, and how long the study can be.     Additionally, this point will be discussed later in some of the questions with regard to intervals for colonoscopy, and whether they can be changed with regard to what parameters are being followed.  And Dr. Cryer was going to be next.     DR. CRYER:  I actually have a follow-up question on the PRESAP study design, again for Dr. Levin.  Given that one of the arms of the study is a combined use of celecoxib and aspirin, and given that aspirin a chemopreventive effect, I would ask you to look ahead to the data analysis in the arm of individuals who receive celecoxib and aspirin.     And I would ask how would you separate out the effect of one from the other, and would you anticipate that both would be necessary, both aspirin and celecoxib, in such patients for such an indication?     DR. LEVIN:  We are very mindful of the fact that cardioprotective doses of aspirin are fairly ubiquitously used in the population.  Hence, the reason for stratification.       We were able to based on the statistical power of the study to sort out the therapeutic effect or effectiveness of the combination of aspirin and celecoxib, versus celecoxib alone, compared to placebos.     So while I obviously do not have the information now, the possibility in my mind will exist that there are individuals, particularly in the older age groups, who will benefit from cardioprotective doses of aspirin, which may be subclinical in their benefits, in terms of prevention of adenoma reoccurrence, or colorectal cancer mortality carried out over a long period of time.     But who nevertheless may benefit from chemopreventive effects.  So we will have the ability to determine that on a short term basis, and over the long term, it is conceivable to me that both types of agents, a low dose aspirin, and a chemopreventive agent, would be of benefit.       So at this point it is impossible to tell you whether we will see that, but clearly that is in the back of our minds in designing the study in that way.      CHAIRMAN WOLFE:  Dr. Geller and then Dr. Goldstein, and then Dr. Camilleri.     DR. GELLER:  I will begin by adding to Dr. Levin's comments, and by stratification of the study, like is compared to like, and so in the aspirin users group you are still comparing celecoxib to placebo.     But in that case, it is the additional benefit, and in the non-aspirin users -- again, it is like to like.  So that by stratification, he has really taken care of that, and by looking at the subgroup separately, you can get at the end of the trial an estimate of the benefit in each group.     So then that would give the estimate of the benefit beyond aspirin, and the stratification was exactly the right thing to do to answer your question.   And I wanted to ask a question about grading of adenomas.  We haven't really had too much in the way of details.       So if we wanted to distinguish between those with malignant potential, and those with not, is there anything that you can tell us?  And I don't even know who the question is addressed to.     DR. LIEBERMAN:  This is David Lieberman, and I can make a brief comment about that.  And there was earlier comments, and perhaps Anil would want to comment on this as well.       Clearly, histology is important, and we know that there is a relationship between the severity of the histology and the mutations and genetic changes that we see in these lesions.     And therefore their likelihood to progress to malignancy.  So if we move down the chain from cancer to an adenoma with high grade dysplasia, that is clearly a lesion that may progress to evasive cancer; and down to the next level of histology, which would be an adenoma with various histology.     And which seems to be in most of the studies associated with a higher risk than an adenoma that is a tubular adenoma.  Size alone, as has already been alluded to, seems to be associated with risk, but very often there is a concomitant association with advanced histology.  Others may want to comment on that.     DR. LEVIN:  May I comment on that, please?  In the studies that have been done, and so this is a practical example, all the lesions are examined, and they are taken out by polypectomy, and they are put in individual bottles, and examined by a study pathologist on-site.     They are also examined by central pathology, so that there is uniformity of decision making about the histological subclassification.  And then in doubt, a reference pathologist is used.       So I think there is some rigor about how to classify these adenomas.  As I mentioned earlier, and David Lieberman has again emphasized, the size is looked on as one of the factors that needs to be taken into consideration, and perhaps as a follow-up on what John Baron said, in terms of a national polyps study, Dr. Enzaba looked at the risk ratios, odds ratios, of the findings at baseline colonoscopy.     And I am not going to give you the confidence intervals, but greater than six millimeters was associated with a 1.24 greater incidence, over one centimeter, 1.68, and an important finding of two lesions or more associated with 2.32.     CHAIRMAN WOLFE:  Anil, did you want to make a comment about this?     DR. RUSTGI:  I would just underscore the need for reliance on histopathology over size, and I think that practicing gastroenterologists can reenforce that.  I think in terms of the correlation of histopathology with the whole spectrum of genetic alterations that remains predominantly investigational.     I would draw an analogy from a therapeutical viewpoint for Stage 2 or Duke's B colon cancer, in which there is an effort to stratify patients with certain types of genetic alternations who might then benefit from chemotherapy.     So the hope is that histopathology can be correlated with certain genetic alternations, and then those patients can be stratified for certain types of chemopreventive approaches perhaps more effectively.      CHAIRMAN WOLFE:  We are going to take a break now.  We have actually go on longer than I thought, and we will come to questions after the break.       And I anticipate also that we will probably be breaking for lunch a little earlier.  Therefore it is 10:32, and we will meet back here at exactly 10:45.  Before we break, could all the members and the guests come forward.  I want to ask a couple of quick questions of everybody.     (Whereupon, at 10:34 a.m., the meeting was recessed and resumed at 10:51 a.m.)     CHAIRMAN WOLFE:  I would like to get started again, and I would like to continue with the questions.   So again we will open the questions up from the members and from the invited guests, and then we will have the open forum.  I think that Dr. Goldstein was next.     DR. GOLDSTEIN:  This morning's discussion seemed to omit one area that I think we need to pay attention to, and that is the epidemiologic data, current data, and prospective data, of course, in the area of the safety of the currently proposed CPAs.      Each day there are a million or more epidemiologic events, such as the one that Ms. Cohen hypothesized between her and her doctor.  And I think there is considerable data available on these, and I wonder if it could be made available to the members of the panel.     The current safety data and I will grant you that it is not perhaps directly related to this particular disorder for the various COX inhibitors.  But I think it is something that is germane to the discussion of safety, and that data does exist.     CHAIRMAN WOLFE:  It is germane.  However, this is -- remember that the purpose of this meeting is not to discuss COX-2 inhibitors, nor any other specific agent.       And for that reason, we are going to discuss safety concerns during the afternoon when we discuss all the various questions that are being raised, and that are being opposed officially to us.     So with regard to specific agents, I don't think you could get them from -- I am sure that Dr. Levin has them, and Dr. Lieberman probably has them as well.  But I would like to hold that off, because again this is a generic meeting, and we are talking about drug X.     We know what class if this comes along five years from now.  We never heard of it, and we never heard of the class, and how will we propose and how will we design a study, and how will we help the FDA work with the agency, with a company, to design this study.  So let's hold off on that.     Actually, I think next was Dr. Camilleri.     DR. CAMILLERI:  Thank you.  I would like to address two issues.  The first pertains to the comment made by Dr. Scott Lippman pertaining to if a gastroenterologist sees a polyp, does the gastroenterologist automatically take that polyp out, because you are using that as a means to in a way define the broad spectrum of a disease.       I would submit to you that maybe this is a minority opinion, but there are many gastroenterologists around the country who will apply a risk benefit to the individual patient.       For example, if one sees a 2 to 3 millimeter polyp in the colon on a 75 or 80 year old, I think many gastroenterologists will apply clinical sense and look at the risk benefits, even though it is very small, of a hemorrhage or a perforation from a polypectomy using a snare.     Therefore, I think we need to more broadly look at the question that you posed, sir, in relation to does every polyp have to come out, and does every polyp require prevention.  And then I would like to make a question after that general comment.       DR. LIPPMAN:  That is an excellent comment, and as I thought I mentioned, I am not a gastroenterologist.  I am a medical oncologist, and so I was really asking the question, because I don't know.  And I think if we agree that certain polyps should not be removed, then maybe we should change the screening guidelines.       So whatever we define as something that we treat surgically with polypectomy is what we should be talking about as end points for prevention.     CHAIRMAN WOLFE:  Just one second.  We are talking about again prevention, and the whole idea of the 75 to 80 year olds, or 90 year olds with a polyp also pertains to using aspirin or any other drug for cardioprophylactic, and if you are going to aspirin or any other drug for a cardioprophylactic, are you going to cardiac prophylaxis for a myocardial infarction with aspirin.     And so that is almost the same question, and so in a way let's --     DR. CAMILLERI:  Well, with all due respect to the chair, I think the question pertained to defining a disease by the decision taken by a gastroenterologist to take it out.  I have never been taught that that is the way you define a disease.     But I think that the other point that I would like to raise pertains to the clinical significance of the Steinbach study to which Dr. Bernie Levin referred.     And I wondered if I could ask Dr. Levin to help me as a gastroenterologist and also as somebody who is trying to advise the agency on the optimal designing of clinical trials.     What is the clinical significance of a 30 percent reduction of the number of polyps, and a 5 percent significance or reduction in the size of a polyp, which were the major changes in that model which I think serves us in today's discussion very well, because one might take the liberty of thinking about FAP as an accelerated course in the molecular events that might be pertinent to sporadic colorectal cancer.     So I think in order to help us understand what might be the appropriate end points, could you help us interpret what it means when there is a 30 percent reduction in the number of polyps, and a five percent reduction in the size.  Thank you.     DR. LEVIN:   Thank you, Dr. Camilleri.  Michael, the demonstration in the FAP trial of a benefit of the administration of celecoxib also was backed to some extent by a earlier study by Dr. Frank Giardiello of Sulindac, and by a significant other evidence, some of which I presented, and some of which is well known, pre-clinical, and animal, and then finally human.       So it rests on a body of evidence that is entirely consistent with the intervention.  Specifically, this was a proof of principle,and it was a demonstration, perhaps for the first time, that a chemopreventive agent with probably many sites of action in the gastrointestinal tract, could have the potential for benefit.     I believe that the FDA acted wisely in saying it was a pharmacological adjunct.  It did not replace surgical management and never will in that level of benefit.     It possibly allows for a delay in the timing of surgical intervention.  It also opened the possibility of having a benefit in the upper gastrointestinal tract, and in a paper that is either in public press or is about to be finally published, there was also some benefit on the adenomas and the duodenum, which has even more significance, because of the unfortunately outcome of major surgical intervention in the duodenum and biliary axis.     So to answer your question in summary, I believe it was a step forward in defining what might be one of the desired end points, but in itself only leads to more questions and further studies.     DR. CRYER:  This is Bryon Cryer and I have a question for Dr. Lieberman.  In thinking about this issue of the potential for chemopreventive agents to increase the time interval between colonoscopies, I wonder whether you have some insight into the following, which is for X increase in interval between colonoscopies, what number of patients might that increase access to colonoscopy for based upon any of your studies or any of the data that are out there?   If you could give us some guidance.     DR. LIEBERMAN:  I can only give you some crude ideas about this.  We currently -- well, if I understand your question correctly, you are really dealing with resources and capacity that we have for performing a colonoscopy?     DR. CRYER:  That's correct.     DR. LIEBERMAN:  And the estimates that we have right now is that they are somewhere about 4-1/2 million colonoscopies performed in the United States right now.  I showed you some data showing you the potential for the current indications for those.     And obviously if we can shift some of those current resources in the screening, we create more available resources for a colonoscopy.  And if we can extend or can expand the interval between screening events or surveillance events, we further expand that capacity side of that equilibrium that I showed you.     I think it is possible to do both, and that is both shifting and in extending the intervals between events that are needed.     DR. CRYER:  Right.  So specifically I am interested in some guidance on actual time intervals and to what extent would an increase in time interval actually increase that capacity?  Do we have any data that might be able to guide us in that way?       DR. LIEBERMAN:  I am not personally aware of such data.  I mean, you can model that kind of data.  We published -- Doug Rex and I published a small paper in  Gastrointestinal Endoscopy  a few months ago that outlined the potential impact of these shifts, and estimated that were we to do the shifting that I just suggested that we would probably still need an increase in capacity to offer a colonoscopy to 60 percent of the inherent population of about 750,000 new procedures.     I don't know if that answers your question or not.       CHAIRMAN WOLFE:  So right now there is no hard data or there is no estimates.     DR. LIEBERMAN:  There certainly are no hard data that I am aware of.     CHAIRMAN WOLFE:  Dr. LaMont.      DR. LAMONT:  Tom LaMont.  I have a question for Bernard Levin and perhaps for Mark Avigan, and it relates to how you handle potential confounders for colorectal cancer risks, and specifically the ones that I am thinking about are folic acid, which has been shown in a big study to have a fairly impressive effect on reducing mortality, and also alcohol, which has the opposite effect.     And in a recent paper that I have seen that has not been published yet, that it showed that in patients who don't drink much or none, and who do take supplemental folate, it had a profound effect on reduction of colorectal cancer.     So a lot of doctors already are giving patients folic acid.  So I guess my question is -- and like the aspirin question that you had, how do we factor these other variables?  And there is probably more than those two as well.     DR. LEVIN:  In the course of obtaining the data on the patient, any medications, including over-the-counter ones, are asked about.  So to the extent that most multi-vitamin preparations contain 400 micrograms a day of folic acid, we will have that information.     Of course, this is a randomized control trial.  So we would hope that the events would be equally distributed, and including the ingestion of supplemental medications, such as folate, and including habits, dietary habits, such as alcohol use.     The dynamic nature of this of course is very important.  It may be evolving over time, and it is something that we will need to be sure of that we are asking about in any future designs or studies, and we may need to be even more explicit than we are.     But I believe that both the design of the study and the questionnaires are addressing that to a considerable extent even currently.       CHAIRMAN WOLFE:  Dr. Richter.       DR. RICHTER:  Joel Richter, Cleveland.  David --   David Lieberman, I think that all of us in gastroenterology feel like we are spending a lot more time on polyp surveillance when we ought to be spending more time on screening and you emphasized it.     And you emphasized in your presentation there are really recommendations for colonoscopic surveillance programs which are really based on societal opinions rather than hard data.     Is there any plan in the near future to -- my guess is probably to extend these intervals and to rationalize them more, or are we still going to be dealing with opinions, suggesting that one small tubular adenoma means that you are married to a colonoscopy every -- in some places every three years, and other places five years?     CHAIRMAN WOLFE:  I am going to answer that question because we are not going to answer that question right now.  That is part of our charge for the afternoon for the discussion to see whether or not these trials may lead to an increase in the interval if it is possible to look at that question.       So again we will be looking at this in the afternoon.  So I would like to now, unless there is any more pressing questions of the speakers very specifically, I would like to move on to the open forum.       And our first speaker in the open forum will be Dr. Robert Sandler, of the University of North Carolina, and I would like to remind people in the open forum to state their affiliation, and whether or not they are representing any firm or any potential conflicts they may have.     DR. SANDLER:  Good morning.  I am Robert Sandler, and I am a Professor of Medicine and Epidemiology at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill.       I am a gastroenterologist and for the past 15 years, I have been conducting studies on the epidemiology and prevention of colorectal cancer.  I have been an investigator in a number of chemopreventions studies.       For example, I was an investigator in John Baron's calcium and aspirin studies, and I am an investigator in the Merck-sponsored Vioxx study, and I am the study chair of a randomized trial using aspirin to prevent adenomas in cancer patients.       I am also a consultant to Merck, and Merck is compensating me for my time today.  And what I would like to do is to to discuss some of the design considerations and implications for chemoprevention studies.     Next slide.  And the way that I propose to organize my talk is to pose a series of questions that I will answer, and there is three important points that I would like you to take away from these questions.     The first is that adenomas are appropriate end points for chemoprevention studies.  Secondly, that a three year interval would be a logical interval for a chemoprevention study, and most importantly that an effective chemopreventive agent would have implications as an adjunct to colonoscopy.  Next slide.     So the first question is colon cancer a preventable disease, and we know that when people migrate from a low incident country, such as Japan, to a high incident country such as the United States, the rates of disease go up within one generation.       In fact, the highest rates in the world are seen in Japanese men living in Hawaii, and that implies that there is something in the environment that is responsible for colon cancer.       In fact, experts have estimated that between 80 and 90 percent of colon cancers is caused by something in the environment, and that means that if we could figure out what it is in the environment that is responsible, we could prevent 80 to 90 percent of colon cancer.     And it is this information that underlies the concept of chemoprevention.  Colon cancer is preventable.  Next slide.     Well, in order to prevent colon cancer the most logical way to test an agent would be to conduct a randomized trial, and what I have done in this slide is that I have sketched the architecture for all randomized trials, and the two parts of this that I would like to discuss today are the intervention into how long should we conduct this study, and information from that might come from how quickly the agent might work, and whether there is rebound or tachyphylaxis.     And the other important point that I would like to talk about are appropriate end points.  Next slide.   If we wanted to test an agent to prevent colon cancer the most obvious end point would be colon cancer, but there are practical implications to trying to use colon cancer as an end point for a chemoprevention study.     First of all, it takes decades for colon cancer to develop, and none of us is patient to conduct a study that lasts that long.  Secondly, colon cancer is relatively uncommon, which would make the sample size for a prevention trial prohibitive.  And finally there are ethical complexities to using cancer as an end point.     Gastroenterologists in this country remove polyps, even small polyps, and by removing those polyps, we lower the cancer risk sufficiently so that it would be ethically impossible to use cancer as an end point.  Next slide.     Well, if we can't use cancer as an end point, perhaps we could find some surrogate end point instead, and as you heard earlier this morning, in a task force from the  American Association for Cancer Research , recently published a paper in the  Journal of Clinical Cancer Research , in which they discussed the concept of using intraepithelial neoplasia as an important target for accelerated new agent development.     And these intraepithelial neoplasia are pre-cancerous lesions, and adenomas are one variety of IEN.  Next slide.       The authors of this article concluded that IEN, and you can substitute adenoma, that IEN that is a disease, and the treatment provides clinical benefit.     They went on further to say that reducing IEM burden is an important and suitable goal for medical intervention to reduce cancer risks and that achieving   prevention and regression of IEN confers and constitutes benefit to subjects and demonstrates the effectiveness of a new treatment agent.  Next slide.     What I would like to do next is to spend some time reviewing with you the information on which we could argue that adenomas are an approximate end point.  Some of these points have been made earlier.     So, for example, the pathology of cancer and adenomas are similar.  Adenomas are displastic lesions, and there are nuclear and cytological abnormalities that are seen in adenomas that we also see in cancer.     And sometimes when we remove a small cancer we will find a remnant of the adenoma from which it arose.  Secondly, as you have also heard, the molecular biology is similar.  There are certain genetic abnormalities that we have known about for more than a decade that are found in adenomas and also found in cancer.       The experience that FAP patients is informative.  Those patients universally develop cancer supporting the idea that those adenomas in the FAP patients when on to cause cancer.     And importantly there are three large trials that have important implications.  So, for example, in the National Polyp Study, patients were randomized to two surveillance intervals and all polyps were removed.     And as you heard the observed number of cancers was lower than the number expected.  And we could quibble about how much lower that risk was, but it is very clear from that study that removing adenomas, even small adenomas, reduce the risk of cancer.     Secondly, the Telemark study randomized people to get sigmoidoscopy or no sigmoidoscopy and followed them over time.  Those with sigmoidoscopy had polyps removed, and at the conclusion of the study those who had been randomized with sigmoidoscopy were substantially less likely to develop colorectal cancer.       And finally the Minnesota Fecal Occult Blood Testing Study randomized patients to screening with FOBT, and the screened group were less likely to get cancer and less likely to die from cancer.       So what is important here is that this body of evidence clearly demonstrates that eliminating adenomas reduces the risk of cancer.       And this is no longer a hypothesis, and this is no longer a theory.  This is a fact. If we can eliminate adenomas, then we can reduce the risk for cancer.  Next slide.     Now, if we can use adenomas as an end point, how quickly might we see an effect.  This is a randomized study that John Baron reported in  The New England Journal , and those who were randomized to the calcium group enjoyed a 19 percent decrease in the number of polyps, and a 24 percent decrease in the number of polyps.     Now, this particular study featured two colonoscopes; one colonoscopy at one year, and a second at four years.  And what you can see is that as early as one year there was a statistically significant decrease in the number of polyps, and that same risk estimate persisted at the four year interval.     Simply demonstrating that in a relatively short time, within one year, we are able to demonstrate the benefit of a particular chemopreventive agent.  Next slide.     Now, if an agent decreases cancer or an adenoma risk, is there a risk of rebound, and this is a study for familial polyposis.  The patients were randomized to sulindac or placebo, and the treatment continued for 9 months.     And when the treatment stopped, you can see that the number of adenomas in the sulindac group increased, but the curves are parallel.  There was no evidence of rebound.  Next slide.     And finally there is a concern about tachyphylaxis.  In a very important paper that was published in the  Journal of Gastroenterology  this month that followed a group of patients with familial polyposis who were treated with sulindac long term.  Next slide.     And what the study showed was that the following.  This is the mean number of polyps and the percent reduction, and you can see that at the end of 12 months there was a 76 percent reduction in the number of polyps.     And at the time of the last follow-up, which was on average 63.4 months later, there was a 74 percent decrease in polyps, and in fact 50 percent of the subjects were polyp free.     What this study suggests is that an agent that was then shown to have benefit over the short term had a long duration of benefit.  Next slide.     Now, perhaps the hardest question is how long should we conduct this study.  And as you have heard a multi-disciplinary group developed guidelines for surveillance colonoscopy.  Next slide.     And the guidelines for patients with polyps are shown here, and so persons in whom a large or multiple adenomas polyps are found and removed, should have an examination 3 years after the initial interval.     And the interval for subsequent exams depends on the type of polyps that were detected.  Based on this I would make the following arguments in support of using a three year interval for a study.     First of all, a three year interval is the current standard of clinical practice from these evidence based guidelines.  Secondly, a three year interval is a decision point.  We make decisions about future colonoscopies based on what we find at three years.     Thirdly, and it is not on this slide, if we wait for 3 years, a sufficient number of events will happen so that we can statistically demonstrate a difference between groups.       And more importantly if we conduct a study for three years, patients are more likely to comply with the study.  If we extend the study to 4, or 5, or 6, or 8 years, patients are likely to drop out, and their drop out will erode our ability to demonstrate an effect.     And finally, and most importantly, this three year interval is a standard that has been adopted for all of the chemoprevention studies that are currently in the field and for all the chemoprevention studies that have been finished.     So I would argue that a 3 year interval would be appropriate.  Next slide.  So what are the implications of all of this?  Because virtually all colorectal cancers develop from adenomas, preventing adenomas will prevent cancer.  Next slide.       So if we had an effective chemopreventive agent, first of all, it would supplement the benefit of colonoscopy.  And I don't think that any of us are talking about chemopreventive agents as a replacement, but rather as an adjuvant to colonoscopy.       And the reason that we need an adjuvant to colonoscopy is because we miss polyps.  You have heard this morning that the mis-rate ranges between 15 and 25 percent, and that is in the best hands, and it could be higher than that, and we also miss cancers.     So the benefit of colonoscopy derives from the fact that we remove the polys that we see.  And there is no benefit from the polyps that we miss.  And most importantly, and this may be the most important point that I will make, is that we don't do anything to alter the underlying risk.       So taking out a polyp is like putting our finger in the dike, and it would be much more logical if we could strengthen the dike so that new leaks would not develop.       So the first benefit would be to supplement the benefits of colonoscopy.  Secondly, an effective agent in theory would decrease the number of polyps, and decrease the size of the polyps.       So that when we see a polyp, we use a snare, and we use an electrocautery, and there is a little bit of smoke, and at the end you can see the cautery burn with an artery in the middle of it.       But if that doesn't hold there is a risk of bleeding, and that cautery can weaken the wall, increasing the risk of perforation.  So removing large polyps is not completely safe.     If we could make the polyps smaller, then we have a safer examination.  So the consequences of having an effective agent would be safer examinations, less frequent exams, and fewer cancers.  Next slide.     So to answer all of the questions that have been posed at the beginning colorectal cancer is a preventable disease.  Adenomas are important surrogate end point biomarkers for chemoprevention studies.     Treatment effects may be detected at one year or even sooner, and there is no evidence of rebound attack ortachphylaxis from the studies that we have available.     A three year duration is sensible based on the opinions of experts and current clinical practice, and treatment could provide benefit by increasing the screening interval, thereby decreasing the associated morbidity and lowering health care costs.  Thank you.     (Applause.)     CHAIRMAN WOLFE:  Dr. Sandler has the only slide presentation, I believe, and so do we have any questions for Dr. Sandler?  Yes, Dr. Lippman.       DR. LIPPMAN:  Just a clarification.  On the slide, you had duration of effects, and how long was the treatment interval?  Was that the 9 month of treatment?  Do you recall that?     DR. SANDLER:  As long as they were followed.  They were followed for different intervals.     DR. LIPPMAN:  How long was the treatment is my question.       DR. SANDLER:  The average was 63.5 months     DR. LIPPMAN:  So they were treated for the entire period of time?     DR. SANDLER:  They continued on treatment, and so it was a long term follow-up study of patients treated continually.     DR. RANSOHOFF:  David Ransohoff.  Bob, do you want to comment on -- you said that adenomas could be an end point.  Do you want to comment on what type of adenomas, and do you have thoughts about small versus large, versus advanced or is it any?     The other thing is you talked a little bit about rebound, and a 3 year time horizon for studies.  Do you have thoughts about whether rebound ought to be looked for after a 3 year period?     DR. SANDLER:  Well, as far as the first question, it seems to me that since we don't know which adenomas are going to go bad, that any adenoma would be an end point.       So an end point then is confirmed by a couple of pathologists would seem to be a reasonable interval.  I think that one thing you could see from some of the slides that I showed was that the polyp number actually goes down so that these chemopreventive agents aren't only preventing new polyps, but they are making polyps shrink.     And I think if you have seen it effective in one year, and you continue the therapy for three years, I think you have effectively ruled out rebound.     CHAIRMAN WOLFE:  Dr. Goldkind.     DR. GOLDKIND:  Yes, Dr. Sandler, can you explain how a study of three years can drive or produce a data driven algorithm to extend the interval between screening when the current recommendations would be three years for particular kinds of polyps, wouldn't you need a longer study to know how you might impact that subsequent period?     DR. SANDLER:  Well, I would argue without data that if you performed a three year colonoscopy and saw no polyps with some chemopreventive agent that there is evidence that no polyps have developed in a three year interval, and it would probably be safe to extend it to five years.       Whenever you go beyond the data, you are speculating.     DR. RANSOHOFF:  Well, I guess that is the point.  Wouldn't you want your data to go a little bit beyond current recommendations if you want a data drive decision?  Because otherwise it would continue to be speculation?     DR. SANDLER:  I agree.     CHAIRMAN WOLFE:  Dr. Cryer.     DR. CRYER:  So, Dr. Sandler, central to your argument is the fact that prevention of adenomas prevents cancer, and as you very nicely reviewed for us the gastroenterology sulindac paper.  However, one point that you didn't comment on was that there was one patient in whom polyps are reduced to zero, both at 12 months and in the long term, who subsequently developed colorectal cancer on sulindac.     So how does that observation modify your contention?     DR. SANDLER:  Well, you raised a comment before, and the problem with the FAP patients is that it is not a perfect model, because every single cell in their colon is at risk, and I am not sure that the biology that we see in FAP is exactly what we see in the patients with sporadic cancers.     So there is always the risk that you won't have complete protection and the cancer may arise, but I would point out some of the epidemiology data that Dr. Levin showed, where on balance the end stage is a class decrease the risk of cancer.     There may be the occasional breakthrough, but on balance across the population I think there would be a net benefit.     CHAIRMAN WOLFE:  Dr. Furberg.     DR. FURBERG:  Well, Dr. Sandler, you told us about some trials that have shown that calcium supplementation and sulindac reduce the occurrence of polyps and that that is an important outcome.  Is that correct?     DR. SANDLER:  Yes.     DR. FURBERG:  I would like to raise an ethical issue.  How can you from now on then do any placebo control trials and withhold treatment that is beneficial, and so beneficial that with sulindac that you can reduce it by two-thirds?     How can you have patients sign an informed consent and not inform them that they have an effective treatment available, and you are going to withhold that in your design?     And this question also goes to Dr. Levin for his three trials that he is involved with, secondary prevention trials, placebo control.  How is that ethically possible?     DR. SANDLER:  Well, actually there are no randomized trials in sporadic cancer patients.  So there is no evidence whatsoever that makes sulindac the standard of practice for the spread of cancers.     There is no ethical ambiguity there whatsoever.     DR. FURBERG:  We are going to be discussing this question in the afternoon with concomitant medication, and how we factor them in, or if this is indeed a question that these studies can even be done because of studies that you presented.     So that is a discussion for this afternoon.  First, Dr. Metz and then Dr. Lippman.     DR. METZ:  Well, Bob, thanks for that presentation.  I just wanted to clarify one point.  Are you suggesting that the end point for these trials should be a secondary prophylaxis and appearance of new lesions of the clearance of the colon; is that correct?     DR. SANDLER:  Yes      DR. METZ:  Thanks.     DR. LIPPMAN:  I just would like to address Dr. Cryer's comment about the breakthrough case, and I think as Dr. Levin really nicely showed, is that we are at a place with chemoprevention now where we were with chemotherapy decades ago.       We look at single agents, and we are trying to establish evidence of activity.  But one thing that we know very clearly now from very eloquent molecular studies is that there are multiple pathways to cancer, and so I think with sulindac or some of the other agents, that if we show a 30 or 40, or 50 percent reduction of that, the next direction is combinations, which Dr. Levin showed, to sort of block other pathways.       So I would not consider that a negative.  I mean, I would be shocked if any of these agents were a hundred percent effective knowing how complicated and how many pathways there are to cancer.     CHAIRMAN WOLFE:  Unless there are any more pressing questions, I would like to move on.  Barry, do you have something?     DR. KRAMER:  I have a question about end points.  So if one were trying to design a trial that would allow you to lengthen the intervals of colonoscopy, what would be the end point in the trial?     What would you suggest?  Would it be the reduction in the number of polyps or would it be on a per person basis?  Would it be the number of people with zero polyps at the subsequent follow-up that would allow you to decrease the frequency?     How would you make those decisions, size or whatever?     CHAIRMAN WOLFE:  Dr. Sandler, just make this brief, because this is again part of our discussion this afternoon.     DR. SANDLER:  Number.     CHAIRMAN WOLFE:  That is very brief, and very good.     DR. SANDLER:  Number of polyps per patient.     CHAIRMAN WOLFE:  Polyps per patient.  Thank you, Dr. Sandler.  Our next speaker is Ms. Sylvia Kleiman.     MS. KLEIMAN:  I am going to defer to Priscilla Savary.     MS. SAVARY:  Hi, I am Priscilla Savary, and I am with the Colorectal Cancer Network, and we are a patient advocate network, providing support and advocacy, and we do prevention programs with the general public.     Just on a couple of points that we felt that we wanted to make sure that were kept in mind.  The background paper that we had reviewed for this meeting, I appreciate this meeting.  There has been a lot of very, very good questions, and a lot of very good points made, and I do have a document to leave with you on what our points are.     We want to make sure that the general public population is well represented in the samples.  As we all know frequently in clinical trials, they are largely men, and not representing the women, and the cultural differences, and the ethnicity differences.     And so this is a really important point to us; that whatever clinical trial design comes out of this that it is imperative that those things are taken into consideration, and the studies are made to represent the general public.     We do want to bring to light, or we want to make the point again about even if all we find is that it increases the time between when polyps start to grow and when they start to become cancerous.       This enlarges the window that allows us to detect the polyps, and allows us to detect early cancers.  And so just increasing that window will save an extraordinary number of lives.  I think the background paper was a little too low on its percentages.       It talked about 6 percent of Americans will get colorectal cancer, and 2.6 will die of it.  I am hesitant about that 2.6, because colorectal cancer is nearly 60 percent death rates right now.       The Colorectal Cancer Network would like to also note that we are not expecting this to replace colonoscopies.       This is a tool, as was pointed out by Dr. Sandler, will increase the amount of time between colonoscopies, which also allows us to screen people more appropriately with less capacity in the field.     I do hope that we will not -- that any clinical trial design will not limit the study to people who are 50 and over, because there is an increasing number of people who are showing up with no family history and they have colon cancer under the age of 50.      We have a growing database of people who fit that.  It is only 600 people that we have collected now, but that is over a one year period.  And out of the almost 10,000 people that we dealt with last year, 10,000 patients, 600 of them were under 50, with no family history.     And so it is very important that the clinical trials design does not limit itself just to people 50 and over.  And I thank you very much.     CHAIRMAN WOLFE:  Thank you.  Are there any other persons who would like to speak?  I thought you deferred your comments?     MS. KLEIMAN:  First we heard the professional people all morning, and then we heard Priscilla, who was very expert, and now you are going to hear from an very inexpert patient, patient advocate, who is also a representative of the Colon Cancer Network.       The point that I want to make is that at another conference, I heard about DNA testing done with a slight blood test, and another one done with --     CHAIRMAN WOLFE:  Was it a stool DNA sample?     MS. KLEIMAN:  Yes, the stool sample, thank you.  If we could find out, and my thinking is, if you can find out with these two tests who are liable to get cancer before anything develops, and that can be done with a blood test at a very early age, then they can go right to colonoscopy to eliminate or check it.   And that was my question, and I thank you.     CHAIRMAN WOLFE:  Thank you very much.  Any other persons?  And again for those who would like to speak from the floor, I would ask the same of you that I would ask of the people on the panel, that we keep redundancies to a minimum.       Again, please identify yourself and your affiliation.     DR. HAWK:  My name is Ernie Hawk, and I am the Chief of the GI Cancer Prevention Group in the Division of Cancer Prevention at the National Cancer Institute.  I have no affiliations with drug companies other than working as partners and trying to develop the field.     There is a few -- I think I asked for five minutes, and I only learned that this possibility was available this morning about 3 hours ago, and so my remarks are somewhat disorganized perhaps, but I will try to organize them briefly and make five key points.     And I will speak for myself.  I don't think I am a maverick within the Division of Cancer Prevention, but when asked if my reviews reflect the Institute's 5,000 or so employees, I would not go that far.       First of all, with regard to continuity of disease, I think a lot has been said about that.  Dr. Sandler very eloquently pointed out the genetic, the epidemiologic, the other relevant data that are available, both in the setting of free of intervention, as well as intervention with non-steroidal anti-inflammatories that support that concept.     And I will just point out that in addition I support that view, and in addition there are other areas of carcinogenesis, both in animal models, as well as within human models, in the context of drug development, as well as independent of drug developments, support that view as well.       And in particular the FDA has awarded its approval for agents in skin cancer treatment of actinic keratoses.  So they certainly in that context, in a context where they are easily removable by surgical means, as are polyps, have approved agents for that indication.     And there are other examples as well, but I won't belabor the point.  The second major point that I would make is the issue of feasibility, and highlight the issue of feasibility that was raised earlier.     I was involved in the Secretary's initiative to promote colon cancer screening last week, and so certainly in my role at the NCI, I support both approaches.  I think the point of this discussion is to try to expand options, as opposed to limit them.  That is certainly how I view it.     And given the 80 to 90 million Americans that are at risk for colon cancer now, and the infeasibility frankly of doing colonoscopic screening on all of them, I would expand the options that you presented this morning, in terms of limiting it to a discussion of colonoscopy alone.     I certainly support that viewpoint, in terms of efficacy.  However, there is no way that we are going to be able to screen the population effectively now using that modality alone, and so we are dependent upon using other modalities.       And as you know the penetrance of those in the population is rather low.  Therefore, I think that all the points that Dr. Lieberman made, in terms of decreasing the potential for this approach, to decrease costs, and increase the efficacy of screening, lengthen surveillance intervals, and perhaps reallocate resources from surveillance back towards screening, would all be money well spent.     My third major point has to do with responding to a question from Dr. Furberg earlier this morning about safety.  In our trials, we conduct approximately 15 or so trials of this type, adenoma prevention trials, and they are funded purely with public funds, as well as some collaboratively with industry.     I will say that the industry collaborative trials at least meet and in most cases exceed the safety parameters that the public funds are able to support in any of these trials.     That is appropriate because many of those agents have increased risks associated with them as well.  But the sort of monitoring that is going on in the co-funded studies, where we are working closely with a collaborative partner, involve things such as every 6 to 12 week phone calls from study nurses to patients, specifically soliciting information on a range of toxicities.       And so I think while the trials aren't designed to show benefits, in terms of reducing or improving the safety, clearly we are developing data in the most rigorous manner possible in order to answer those questions in the context I think of these trials.     Next, I want to point out that colonoscopy, which we pretty much all agree upon as being a very effective strategy, both for screening, as well as intervention, would not meet in some ways in my view the criteria that are being imposed upon chemoprevention, perhaps that is appropriate because the risks are not as great as well.     But there are no data as was pointed out earlier for randomized controlled trials.  We sponsored a meeting last year of international experts that felt that was an infeasible approach to show reductions in cancer instance, or cancer mortality in a randomized controlled screening trial.     So I think the day when that is possible is gone.  I personally welcome that, because I think the feasibility and importance of colonoscopic screening is obvious.       So again the point is that I would not want to enter into a scenario where we are creating a higher standard than we have for our current standard of care.       And then finally I wanted to address the issue of the developmental pathway, which we are here to try to elaborate and fill out in terms of details.  Our approach at the NCI has been guided obviously by investigator initiated opportunities, but also by directed contracts arising from the NCI.       The approach that we have taken to this is solicit input from active physicians working in the field, as well as patient care groups, including the Colon Cancer Alliance, the Hereditary Colorectal Cancer Association, in the design of our trials.     And in putting all of that together, we have come up with a body of trials that Dr. Levin elaborated for you, not exhaustive, but at least some of the examples, in terms of the one year and two year end point, and that short of thing.     So at the time when the time when the trials were initiated, those represented what we felt were the best current standards for the field.  That being said, you will notice that many of them were allocated as Phase III trials.     Well, since there is no approved data, we don't know what Phase III is in many regards.  We have been doing what we feel are Phase III trials, but based on adenoma end points.  But I guess that is the point of this meeting, is to decide definitively.     But we do feel that the involvement of the FDA in this process is welcome and important.  This field will develop.  Chemoprevention will develop with or without regulatory oversight, and drug approvals, and that sort of thing.       It will develop slower and based predominantly on public funding in the absence of a developmental path that might lead to ""drug approvals"" for new agents.     And it will do so probably less well in my view than it will with the FDA's active participation in that process.  And so I am hoping that we get to the point where we can all agree upon a process that allows for FDA oversight and approval, and yet sustains the ability to do the sort of research, and to attract, but private as well as public, dollars.  That's it and thank you.     CHAIRMAN WOLFE:  Thank you.  Any other comments?  Yes, Dr. Gordon.     DR. GORDON:  Hi, I am Gary Gordon and I am a medical oncologist, who has an interest in cancer prevention.  I am a former employee of Pharmacia and Searle.       So in that sense, I have worked for a pharmaceutical company that has interests in this area.  I have also served as co-chair of the task force that you have heard about this morning, the American Association of Cancer Research Task Force on the Prevention and Treatment of Intraepithelial Neoplasias.     And I just wanted to again thank the committee for embarking on this, because I think it is an important discussion to have to move this field forward, both from the AACR point of view, as well as the industry point of view.       And I don't want to belabor the points that have been made by others here, but clearly the findings of the task force were that intraepithelial neoplasias is a process that disease evolves from normal tissue through intraepithelial neoplasias to cancer.     That adenomas are on that causal pathway to colorectal cancer, and that as we have heard by several speakers this morning that by affecting adenomas that one can reduce the risk of cancer.     And in fact the task force was more specific in their recommendations, saying that a 30 percent reduction in the number of adenomas would be significant.     I think to address some of the comments that Dr. Avigan made this morning, I don't think the task force in any way viewed the development of chemopreventive agents or agents that would treat or prevent intraepithelial neoplasias as only having one or two outcomes; either as adjuncts, or to supplant.     But rather viewed it more as an evolutionary process, where perhaps initially it would be in conjunction with current methods for screening, and then evolve to potentially increasing screening intervals, or even potentially if the agents were effective enough to reduce the need for those sorts of procedures.  And that will conclude my remarks.     CHAIRMAN WOLFE:  Thank you, Dr. Gordon.  Any other comments from the public?     DR. KELLOFF:  I am Gary Kelloff, and I am at the Cancer Institute, and I ran the chemoprevention branch of the NCI for 10 years, and for the last year I have been in the Division of Cancer Treatment and Diagnosis.     I have served on advisory committees for industry, including Pharmacia, Novartis, and Ilex.  I am not here on their behalf, nor am I retained today for this activity.       I am here out of my long interest in chemoprevention drug development, and I don't want to reiterate a lot of the excellent points that have already been made by Dr. Levin, and Dr. Sandler, and Dr. Hawk, and Dr. Gordon.     There are a few things that I think though I would like to mention.  We have heard attention between screening and drug intervention.  I really think that in the setting that we find chemoprevention drug development that none of us that have been thinking about this for a long time are in any way advocating that one would be an alternative to the other.     In fact, all of the trial designs that any of us have been involved in designing and entertaining have it within the setting of colonoscopy, or the standard of colonoscopy follow-up has not been changed.     So that we could have a standard of care as the background and get new information that would give us the scientific data that we are all looking for to support development of these efficacious drugs.     So I don't see it as attention or an alternative.  As a matter of fact, I believe that if chemoprevention drugs are approved and have a label out there that you would find all of those people, that is, the 85 percent that need colonoscopy that are not getting it, would be reading labels and would be realizing that something needs to be -- that they need to be doing more about their own self-help, and to be seeking that kind of care.     I think that the fact that we have an effective screening procedure is diluted by the fact that we still have 130,000 colon cancers in the U.S., and 55,000 cancer deaths, and only 15 percent compliant users, and 20 percent miss-rates.     And that says to us that more needs to be done, and all of us have a first dictum of first do no harm.  That is what we walk around thinking about in the medical procession.       But sometimes more harm is done from non-proactive action, and that cues up what is needed for drugs and certainly I applaud the FDA today and the four colleagues that are here, in terms of taking up this hard issue, and having some very key questions to chew on this afternoon.     I think on the safety efficacy equation, I think on the efficacy side that we have not seen anything more compelling for disease prevention than the setting of colon cancer.  And as our colleagues said, this is not about the generality of chemoprevention, but it is about colon.     But make no mistake.  Colon cancer and the scientific rationale is strongest for this target organ than any, and you have heard the eloquent presentation of molecular mechanisms of genetic progression, a la Vogelstein, of the extensive epidemiology of 15 years or so with some of the agents.     And the animal efficacy, and although we all take this with a grain of salt as we approve clinical agents for clinical use, the animal models are getting better and better, and the genes that cause human cancer are in these animals.     You can stop these intervention trials at the polyp end points, and they go away, or you can keep the animals going, and they don't have invasive colon cancer.       And then we are already in the clinical intervention trials for the germ line lesions.  They are very high risk and high penetrant cohorts, and about 85 percent or so are sporadic adenomas and sporadic colon cancer, and have the same APC gene mutated.     So we feel that the compelling efficacy is out there, and that as the trials come in that efficacy is not going to be a question relative to the polyp end point.     And one says then, well, is the polyp end point an effective and adequate surrogate.  Our position, and I co-chaired the task force at AACR, and that document that you have there today, is that polyp is first a disease because our subspecialists, all of you around the table are treating it as a disease because you take it out when you see it.     And therefore we always think of cancer as this bleeding mass in emergency.  We should not have our thinking altered by the fact that it is the cancer end point that we are not so necessarily worried about here if we have a disease that needs treatment before the cancer end point.     We also have very strong evidence that you really don't get invasive cancer unless it goes through a polyp intermediate, and that is true for 85 or 90 percent of the polyp that you can see.     And I suspect that most of the rest are flat mucosa with this displastic nuclide that don't pouch up as a polyp, but if you had a biopsy, you would find the generality of this phenomenon to be probably very, very compelling, and very few exceptions.     We always have the situation that not all polyps go to cancer.  We all realize that, and that is true of every epithelial sheet that humans have at cancer risk, and epithelial accounts for 80 or 85 percent of the cancer burden.     And in this document, you have not only looked at polyp as the prototype, but high-grade PIN, cervical intraepithelial neoplasia, and down the line the nine target organs.     The science is there, and the precancerous lesion is a disease that needs treatment and is being treated.  It is an obligate precursor to evasive disease, and it is the highest risk factor that we can find in these people other than rare germ line lesions.     So we think from an efficacy side that it is not a question.  From a safety side, we believe that as long as the trials are put in the context of standard care, and all of the care is given with colonoscopy screening; that is, the standard of care out there, that as drugs go forward, and as approvals are gone, and as labeling is put forward, that it should be in the standard of care with colonoscopic screening, with really no change in that.     It really gets down to the chronic safety database of the drugs, and that is where the safety risk is, and that will be a subject of a lot of discussion this afternoon.      The only last question that I would pose, and I commend Mark for an excellent overview, is the number that stuck with me, which is that you have to treat 700 to prevent one cancer, and I asked him during the break the assumptions, and this is a subject for this afternoon.     But I suspect that if you look at the people that would be prescribed or approved to get a drug under a labeling approval, that I would ask the question another way.     If you took all people with a one centimeter polyp, whether on a stock or a sessile polyp and ignore grade, does that number from 700 to 1 go down?  It goes down to probably less than a hundred to one I would guess, but I don't know what that number is.     So the last question I would ask is if you take out an adenoma that is a polyp, and you have a risk of 30 percent of getting another one, are you a healthy person, because absent invasive bleeding masses and cancer, people have treated themselves and the doctors have treated them, except for the enlightened ones that are taking these lesions out as healthy people.     And I suggest that they are not healthy, and that using these precancerous lesions as end points ought to be of paradigm and prototype to move the field ahead.  Thank you.       CHAIRMAN WOLFE:  Thank you.  Any other comments from the public?  Before we break for lunch, just a couple of comments.       It is 11:45 and we will meet back here promptly at 12:45, and the other is that there is a table downstairs reserved for panelists.  So we should proceed directly down there.  And again we will begin again promptly at 12:45.  Thank you.     (Whereupon, at 11:49 a.m., a lunch recess was taken.)                                                  A-F-T-E-R-N-O-O-N  S-E-S-S-I-O-N    (12:57 p.m.)     CHAIRMAN WOLFE:  Would Dr. Avigan please introduce the questions for the afternoon.  For the members of the panel, the questions are in your packet, but they will also be on the screen on an individual basis.     DR. AVIGAN:  Okay.  I am just going to read the questions as they are written, and with no commentary.  Thank you.  For individuals who are able and willing to undergo colonoscopic screening or surveillance, is either partial and/or complete suppression of colorectal adenomatous polyp a clinically meaningful benefit.  Why or why not?     And if adenomatous polyp suppression is not a clinically meaningful benefit, what additional information would be needed to demonstrate that partial or complete suppression of polyps is of clinical benefit in such individuals.     Question Number 2.  A chemopreventive agent that suppresses polyp growth may in theory cause polys to become resistant to drug effects.  Additionally, it may preferentially allow small invasive lesions to go undetected on colonoscopy, while large indolent lesions are identified and removed.     If polyp suppression is used as an end point in the clinical trials of a chemopreventive agent, (a) how long should the trial be.     (b) what should the time interval be between colonoscopic evaluations;      (c) what end points and follow-up are needed to rule out possible resistance to drug effects, differential identification, and removal of large indolent lesions;      (d) how should a rebound withdrawal effect be studied.     Question Number 3.  Given that mortality and invasive colorectal cancer incidents rates are gold standards for demonstrating clinical benefit, what is the relative importance of other study end-points in clinical trials of chemopreventive agents such as (a) length and interval between, or replacement of colonoscopic screening or surveillance.     (b) reduction in the number of procedural complications; and (c), other clinically meaningful outcomes.     Question Number 4.  Should the results of clinical trials and individuals at high risk for colorectal cancer be generalized to individuals at normal risk for colorectal cancer.  Why or why not.     Please specify the criteria that should be used to classify risk in clinical trials of chemopreventive agents.     Question Numer 5.  Should clinical trials of chemopreventive agents be required to include substantial numbers of individuals with particular demographic or baseline characteristics, such as age, race, and sex; or on particular concomitant therapies, such as nonsteroidal, anti-inflammatory agents?     Question Number 6.  In randomized placebo controlled clinical trials of chemopreventive agents used as an adjunct to colonoscopic screening or surveillance, what would represent a clinically meaningful effect size for (a) reduction of benign adenomas;      (b) reduction of premalignant lesions; (c) reduction of colorectal cancer; (d) increase in the time interval between colonoscopies; and (e), reduction of complications.     Question Number 7.  How should drop-outs and censored patients be analyzed.       Question Number 8. What is your advice concerning the safety evaluation of a drug proposed as a chemopreventive agent in an at-risk population without active disease.     And Question Number 9, the final question, for partial or complete suppression of adenomatous polyps, (a) should the proportion of the patients who experience the clinically meaningful benefit of polyp suppression exceed the proportion of patients who experience serious adverse events;     (b) if yes, should the study be powered accordingly; why or why not; and finally, (c) in order to ensure long term safety of chemopreventive agents, what should the length of the clinical trials be.     CHAIRMAN WOLFE:  Thank you, Mark.  Dr. Raczkowski.      DR. RACZKOWSKI:  I will keep my comments very brief.  I think you can see by the questions and the breadth of the questions some of the areas that we are interested in pursuing.     And as I mentioned this morning, we are primarily interested in some practical advance on the specifics of clinical trials, such as the end points, and how big an effect size would be considered clinically meaningful, study populations, issues of analysis, and how to evaluate safety.  And with that, we welcome your input.     CHAIRMAN WOLFE:  Before we get started, I looked at these questions yesterday, and I grouped them in a slightly different order because of the relationship of some of the questions to the others.     So we will start with number one, and then we will go to number six, and then it will be three, two, four, five, seven, eight, nine.  So it is just slightly out of order, but I think 1 and 6 are very closely related, and I thought 3 should come before 2.     And again I will read the question before and then I will call on specific people to start the discussion, and again I urge you to say what you need to say, but again keep redundancy to a minimum.     So the first question is that for individuals who are able and willing to undergo colonoscopic screening or surveillance, is either partial and/or complete suppression of colorectal adenomatous polyps a clinically meaningfully benefit; why or why not.     If adenomatous polyp suppression is not a clinically meaningful benefit, what additional information would be needed to demonstrate that a partial or complete suppression of polyps is a clinical benefit in such individuals.  I would like to call on Dr. Ransohoff to start the discussion.     DR. RANSOHOFF:  Well, I think some of the considerations in looking at this question are -- and just to answer this literally -- that if you had complete suppression of all polyps forever, that is a no-brainer, and you really would have some important information if that happened, because we think that cancers come from polyps.     From what we know, however, any intervention will produce suppression of some polyps at best, and I think the kind of information that would be useful to me, or that we ought to consider if you just get partial suppression is do we look at all polyps as an outcome, or do we need to look at size, or other things that make the surrogate more proximate to the outcome, which is really one of the themes of the whole discussion.     In my view, I think that large polyps are arguably more important than small polyps, and for outcomes ought to be focused on, and again this is just a starting place for discussion.     But the reason for doing that -- there is two reasons.  One is that we know something about the natural history of large polyps.  It is not a lot, but we know something.     The Stryker study in 1987 that looked at lesions seen at barium enema that were not intervened on, showed a rate of about 1 percent to become cancerous.  It is the natural large lesions.       We don't even known the histology of those, but that is some of the little natural history that we have, that large lesions do bad things over time.  So we know more about their natural history than we do about small polyps.      For most small polyps, because of all of the things that have been said, we know that they can't -- that most of them don't progress.  The other thing is that if we use small polyps as an outcome, we have the problem of missing polyps being seen at one year or three years, which introduces noise.     One last comment before I stop is that another    -- I think that a case can be made to use advanced neoplasms as an outcome.  It is something that David has used in his study, and Tom Imperiale used in his study.       But the reason that we use advanced neoplasm as a surrogate outcome is that it is more common than cancer, which is really the outcome that we want to find.       And I think even in thinking about advanced neoplasms, and we have talked about them today as though they are evil actors.  We really do not have any descriptive data identifying their natural history.  And I think I will stop.     CHAIRMAN WOLFE:  Dr. Metz.     DR. METZ:  Thank you.  I would agree with what was said before.  Unfortunately, I think we are stuck with the standard of care here, and that we have to do secondary prevention trials.     And in the real world, we can't leave a polyp in, and I agree that the larger polyps are the concerning ones.  So I am not going to retract what I have said before, except to agree with Dr. Raczkowski.     But I would suggest that because of that, I think we need to have a longer interval, because I am not so sure that if I find a three millimeter polyp pitch up, even if we have a one year screening colonoscopy to make sure that nothing was missed early.     But if you have a 3 millimeter polyp pitch up at 3 years is that going to be of real relevance.  If you have a 5 millimeter, or a 7 millimeter, or 9 millimeter, the big lesions are the ones that would be concerning to me.     So I would be concerned that we at least have a longer follow-up if we are going to use a surrogate end point like this.  And I think I will leave it at that.     CHAIRMAN WOLFE:  I am going to make some comments myself, and we will open it up for everybody else, but I said not to be redundant, but I am going to have to be redundant to some extent.       Please keep in mind again that this is FDA, and so we have to keep in mind that there is going to be a commercial interest in some regard, and we have to keep that in mind when we talk about designing or helping to design trials, or give advice regarding the design of a trial.     So there has to be a time limit of some sort, and we have to pick parameters and here the question being asked is an entire reduction necessary, or elimination necessary or reduction okay?     My comments that I am going to make is that a polyp, and which has been said, and I am just going to reiterate it, is a neoplasm.  It is a new growth.  It is abnormal.     And we don't know what any of these agents will do to the biological behavior.  We know that size is probably the most important determinant whether a neoplasm will become malignant or not.  It is not the only determinant.       And so I think in my view this question is that is complete elimination necessary?  I don't think so.  The reduction I think is very important.  I think in a trial like this, because it is a trial, it needs to be removed.       And it needs to be examined for its mitotic index, and for any other pathological indices which would be deemed appropriate for this type of study.      DR. RANSOHOFF:  If we are looking for practical things, Bob Sandler showed that after 3 years, after 1 year and 3 years, you can find reduction.     And I would ask if you can find that, and if you find no rebound for some period after that, would that be one appropriate kind of outcome to consider?  Would that be helpful to people in thinking about time frames?     DR. LIPPMAN:  I think related to that comment, and picking up on your point, since we really don't know enough about -- I mean, size is important, but some small lesions are biologically aggressive.     That the initial studies need to be -- well, I would think that they would need to be more broad-based, unless the gastroenterologists around the room can tell me what size polyp they feel comfortable watching and not removing.     And until we get to that point, I think we need to do the studies more broad based, and we need to include studies of histology and biology on the resected polyps so that we can answer these questions about how aggressive the polyps are that we are removing and so on.     CHAIRMAN WOLFE:  I will make one comment.  We had a little discussion, Dr. Camilleri and I did, and those things that are a hundred percent or zero percent.  Of course, I am not going to take out a polyp from someone who is sick and has a systemic illness, and would be at risk for taking out a small polyp.       I am not sure I would do a colonosopy on that person either though.  So, in general, however, I think we will all agree that in general when we see a polyp, we take it out.     Yes, there are circumstances where we are not going to, but in most cases, we will.  Now, if I am wrong, and if that is the wrong assumption, please say that.  But for most, they probably will, and besides that for a trial we would.     I think for a trial this is different.  We are talking about again looking at the number, size, and the biological behavior.       DR. METZ:  I think the reason to potentially go a little longer than three years is that it just gives you one point in time.  I think that a one year colonoscopy, although it might give you some information, is really primarily being done to make sure that nothing was missed at the first colonoscopy.     And I don't think you can base anything on your one year data.  If you could see a trend that goes from time baseline to time 3 years, to the next scope, which I am not saying necessarily needs to be 6, 7, or 8, or maybe 5 is fine, or maybe 4 is fine, and you can show a trend, then I think that would be strong information.     And it would also answer the question of tolerance and the question of rebound that has been brought up.       CHAIRMAN WOLFE:  Let's stick to the question, which was one of the reasons that I picked number 6 after number 1, because question 6 addresses time interval.       So let's stick to number one for now, and we will take that into consideration for number six.  Barry.     DR. KRAMER:  I am hearing some implicit assumptions, and I just want to be sure that they are more explicit.  So if we decide that it is the proportion of polyps that counts, and not disappearance of polyps, then obviously we are treating each individual polyp, as opposed to individual patients.       We have changed the unit of end point, although as I pointed out before, we may not necessarily be changing the unit of toxicity, because it is the patient and not the individual polyp that experiences the toxicity.       But having done that, what polyps go into the denominator?  For example, flat or depressed adenomas, would they be part of the number that is counted?  If so, can we accurately identify them?       Do we know their natural history well enough to count them as part of a trial, or is it only big polyps?     CHAIRMAN WOLFE:  Before you go any further, we are not supposed to do much in the way of voting here, but I think there is one aspect that needs to be clarified right now.       Again, we are talking about trials, and not clinical practice.  In a trial would anybody leave a polyp in, or should all polyps come out?  Again, does anybody here think that we can just look at them and not take them out?     So we are all saying that all -- I'm sorry, but are you saying that they can all stay in?     DR. BARON:  Well, there are trials that have been conducted in which there are disappearance studies that both have been done before.  I think it is plausible that some could be done in the future.     They are done on smaller polyps, but to make a blanket statement that you would leave them in or wouldn't, I think that may be misleading, Mr. Chairman.       I would recommend that you define the type of trial that you are doing when you pose the question.     CHAIRMAN WOLFE:  The question that we are discussing today is chemoprevention.  If we are talking about preventing polyps from occurring, then the --     DR. BARON:  But there are chemoprevention polyp disappearance studies.     CHAIRMAN WOLFE:  But that's treatment.  Once you see a polyp and you think it is disappearing or it is going away, that's treatment.  It is not prevention.      DR. BARON:  Yes, but for example, in Norway there were studies where some polyps were left in, and they looked for both the regression of the existing polyps, and the occurrence of new polyps.       The other issue related to this is that I think we are making a false distinction between the event of having a polyp and the condition is something that Dr. Sandler referred to.     The thing that we are really treating is carcinogenesis.  The carcinogenesis is manifest because of raised lesions, flat lesions which are suspicious for other reasons, or potentially in some of our studies -- in some of our studies I found adenomas in random biopsies, adenomatous tissue.     And so the idea of an end point in these studies needs to be broadened to include anything taken out of the bowel of the patients.  Endoscopists will occasionally take a bite of something that just looks funny, and it is not a polyp, and it is not a raised excrescence.     But it is something that needs to be taken into account, and so I think the terms of your questions are very important as you pose them in order to get meaningful answers.     CHAIRMAN WOLFE:  So you are saying that any neoplasia, any new growth, should be taken out?     DR. BARON:  In the conventional chemopreventive study, for secondary prevention the colon is cleaned, and then new polyps are looked for.  There are versions of chemopreventive studies in which polyps may be left in place, and these are unknown histology, and raised mucosal lesions.     And then after a period of time they are removed, and that is a legitimate design, with the goal of investigating polyp regression.       CHAIRMAN WOLFE:  Dr. Goldstein.     DR. GOLDSTEIN:  Given the trend of the discussion so far, I would think there would be a very significant problem with ethics committees in that kind of situation.       And that kind of problem not only would affect recruitment, but the -- shall I say the interest in actually going ahead with a study that allowed that to happen, and I think you would have a problem.      DR. RANSOHOFF:  David Ransohoff.  I am not sure exactly where the conversation is going, but I think we ought to be careful not to give too much life or power to small polyps, and more than they deserve.     The reason that we take small polyps out when we are there is because the patient has been prepped, and the patient has been sedated, and we are there, and they are relatively easy to take out.     There may be some circumstances where we don't, but if we were serious about treating small polyps in the United States, we would be recommending colonoscopy on everybody, and for that reason we don't do that.     And so although polypectomy is surgery, I have never thought about what we do as being surgery as eloquent as that.  I don't think that makes it a disease, and I think we really have to keep in perspective that just because we take something out and treat it doesn't mean that it is important.     We are doing it for a variety of reasons.     CHAIRMAN WOLFE:  Please, again remember what we are talking about.  We are talking about in a trial.  Are we taking them out for the purpose of a trial, and for designing a trial.  That is what we are talking about.     We are not talking about what we do in clinical practice.     DR. FOGEL:  Mr. Chairman, I have a question about the patient population that we are talking about.  Are we talking about individuals who have had a polyp and then entered the study, and so this is a prevention of secondary polyps?     Or are we looking at a population that is at average risk, and has never had a polyp, and presents for this screening study?  I think the answer to that will impact what we say.     CHAIRMAN WOLFE:  That is actually not one of the questions specifically I don't think, Mark, because we are looking at where a person who has had a polyp is not an average risk.  They are a high risk.     DR. RACZKOWSKI:  Well, I think we are interested hearing about the patient populations that would be appropriate, and there is a question about patient populations.     I think the intent of this question really is just to get people's input on whether a polyp in and of itself is considered -- the removal of that is considered clinically meaningful, and is it simply the proportion of polyps that are removed in a patient, or in a given patient should that person be polyp free?     In other words, if a patient had three polyps and you removed one, is that a clinical benefit, or would you expect a clinical benefit to be manifest by removal of all of the polyps in that particular patient, or prevented in that particular patient.     CHAIRMAN WOLFE:  Dr. Kramer.     DR. KRAMER:  That comment helps me focus my question, because as it is written, it says that you are asking what would constitute a clinically meaningful benefit.       So to help me answer that, I would like to know from the gastroenterologists if you were confident that an intervention, after you cleaned -- and taking from what you said, Mike, you clean the colon completely.       If you were confident that you could decrease the number of polyps in each person by 20 percent or 30 percent, but nevertheless every person still showed up with a polyp, would that allow you to confer at least one clinical benefit?       That is, delay your endoscopy by some period of time.  I would like to know the answer to that.  If you knew that instead of five polyps would come back, three would come back, would you delay your endoscopy by an additional period of time?     CHAIRMAN WOLFE:  I personally wouldn't.  Joe.     DR. RICHTER:  No, I think the only end point if you are talking about the issue of being able to do this secondary thing, and extend your endoscopic surveillance and save money that way, because you are going to spend money one way to hopefully save in the other way.     And it is only going to be that you eradicate the polyps.  Anything else is really -- there still would be a surveillance program, unless maybe you did the situation that David is talking about, and study that subset of patients who have more higher profile polyps.     That is, large polyps, one sonometer or more, that have a tubulovillous component, and then when you are looking at 3 years or at 5 years, you find that there is only small polyps, and a decreasing number of polyps, and those only have a tubular form, that might be important.     But unless you eradicate the polyps so that you don't see anything, I don't think any gastroenterologist would be comfortable of extending the surveillance program.     CHAIRMAN WOLFE:  Dr. Lippman first.     DR. LIPPMAN:  Yes.  I will give you the short answer to 3(a) on this.  I think the issue of increasing the intervals that we are talking about here is really not on the table, certainly not at this point in my view.     I mean, that has to be shown.  I mean, once you establish some efficacy of the agent, then you could do a study to see if changing the interval has an effect.  I think the issue here, and that's why I keep hitting this issue of what would you feel comfortable leaving, is that if polyps are removed, for whatever reason when you are in there, I am presuming that the gastroenterologist feels that they are doing some benefit to that person, and not just because they are there.     Now, if I am wrong, correct me, because there is toxicity to that, and there is expense to that, and there is a lot of issues to do this.  So I guess what I am trying to get at is if polyps are something that we feel or the gastroenterologist feels needs to be treated, and you have an agent that decreases polyps 50 percent.     And so instead of 10 every 3 years, they are getting 5, removing 5 less polyps, is that of any benefit to someone, in terms of potential adverse complications, or costs, or others.     DR. METZ:  Can I respond to that?  I think the issue not so much is that you are going to have five chances of closing a perforation or a bleed, as opposed to 10 chances.  I am not looking at it in that sense.       What I am saying though is that if 3 years down the pike after you run the agent, you find fewer polyps of smaller size, that to me suggests that you are making an impact on the ultimate outcome.     I would not stretch out my surveillance until the next few studies have been done to show me that in fact that does translate into a better outcome.       DR. LIPPMAN:  I agree completely, and that's why the issue of increasing intervals in surveillance is a third or fourth generation study, and that has to be studied separately.       I would not feel comfortable based on activity in a trial like this doing that, but again if you decrease in number, you are decreasing the size, and presumably you are decreasing the potential complication and cost to the patient, and that is what I am trying to clarify.     CHAIRMAN WOLFE:  It actually could be the same study if the study is extended.  If the study is extended, and it is like two colonoscopies, 3 and 5 years, and you see that is how the original study was done, was to go from 1 to 3 years weren't they?  Dr. Ransohoff, weren't you involved in those studies?     DR. RANSOHOFF:  No, I think you are probably talking about the National Polyp Study, and they just did prolonged follow-up to make the first decision about extending --     CHAIRMAN WOLFE:  That's what I am saying, about a prolonged follow-up and you see that one did not have any benefit over three.  Isn't that the way that it was done?     DR. RANSOHOFF:  That was a clinical trial to look at one and three, and they found no difference between either group.     CHAIRMAN WOLFE:  So if a study is done here with a chemopreventive agent, and there is no advantage doing 3 over 5, for example, then that would provide evidence that you could potentially in the same trial -- well, that is one of the next questions.     DR. RANSOHOFF:  But wouldn't you need to -- just so that I can understand.  Wouldn't you need to have a study that one arm was designed with the active agent and long interval and the other arm was a standard interval?      I mean, wouldn't you need to do that study to really answer that question?  And I don't know how that could be done within the studies that we are talking about.     CHAIRMAN WOLFE:  Dr. Goldstein.     DR. GOLDSTEIN:  A quick comment.  Not only would it be interesting to see the reaction of ethics committees, but I can only imagine the agonies of writing an informed consent form which says something like we may leave a polyp in.  Or two.       CHAIRMAN WOLFE:  Dr. Furberg.      DR. FURBERG:  I think the question has broader implications.  It is very difficult from a design point of view to just look at efficacy.  You really need to weigh efficacy versus safety.      If you lower the bar, and you can claim success, and if you reduce a frequency of polys just by a tiny bit, the trials that you are going to do will involve just a few hundred patients followed for a couple of years, which is inadequate for a safety evaluation.     So you really need to weigh the two and set the bar a little bit higher, and so you get good safety information, which is equally important.     CHAIRMAN WOLFE:  Ms. Roach.     MS. ROACH:  When I was thinking about the informed consent myself, and there is information in the packet that talked about the impact of the chemoprevention agents on polyp development that sometimes led to flat lesions, or smaller polyps.     And if I was reading something like that, and it said, well, we are really looking for big polyps and we are giving you something that will make the big polyps maybe be smaller, but we are not that worried about small polyps.     This is just this inherent contradiction that I don't think is going to be very clear to people.       CHAIRMAN WOLFE:  Dr. Baron.     DR. BARON:  Yes, I would like to sort of make the conversation a little more practical, in the context of trials.  In these studies, in the National Polyp Study, or any of the chemoprevention trials that have been described here, all the end point polyps are small.       The median size of the end point polyp is 3 millimeters, 3 or 4 millimeters.  There is a practicality issue that is quite serious if the only end point of relevance is defined as a polyp of, say, over one centimeter.     In these populations under colonoscopic surveillance, they are very, very uncommon.  That may or may not be a problem.  I think it is not a problem because of what I said earlier, that histology really dominates size.       And that really needs to be kept in front of us as we go ahead.  There is practical experience in several chemoprevention trials regarding what histology means in the context of these interventions.     So in the studies that we have done that have shown positive benefit, and that is aspirin and calcium, we have found that the benefit is roughly two or three-fold increased when you look at tubulovillous or cancer.     Consequently, for example, for calcium, we see an 18 to 20 percent benefit for all adenomas, and 40 or 50 percent benefit for tubulovillous or cancer.  And evidence like that provides a very good context to understand how calcium is affecting the whole process of carcinogenesis.     But it would be very impractical and a large mistake to say that only large polyps could be useful as end points in chemoprevention trials of this sort.     CHAIRMAN WOLFE:  Can I try to translate your answer if you don't mind?  And if I am wrong, please tell me.  To translate what you are saying, you are saying that every polyp is an important polyp in a trial like this.     That you are saying that your answer for number one, for the first part of question number one, is complete suppression isn't the only answer.  Other parameters are important, and that means we have to take the polyps out and examine them microscopically.     DR. BARON:  I think that is right.  Just as in blood pressure, you don't say the blood pressure medication is a failure if it doesn't reduce everybody to a blood pressure of 110 over 60.     And in this circumstance, if you reduce the number of adenomas in a meaningful way, and particularly if you can reduce the advanced histologic features, then with that proviso I would agree with your clarification.       CHAIRMAN WOLFE:  Scott.       DR. LIPPMAN:  And I don't want to be redundant, but since we are not voting, I just want to say that I agree with that completely.  I think until we know more about the biology of these adenomas, for the reasons that you have raised, I would count them all.     But I would based on current level of science include pre-specified secondary analyses that include what we would consider more aggressive by histology and so on.     And clearly if we had the unexpected finding, and I don't know if any of this that has been shown in chemoprevention, but the hypothetical that somehow you are accelerating the more advanced ones, you would be able to detect that.       So although it is a hypothetical concern, I know of no data at all in chemoprevention that that has been shown.     CHAIRMAN WOLFE:  But you still agree that it needs to be -- that this is a hypothetical that we need to look at?     DR. LIPPMAN:  Oh, absolutely.  I think we should look at it in these studies, but as John said, I would use all of them as the primary end points, and do the biology, and have pre-specified secondary analysis based on what we know, like histology, which we think is associated with more aggressive disease.     CHAIRMAN WOLFE:  Dr. Camilleri.     DR. CAMILLERI:  I am still struggling with trying to decide what is the most appropriate primary end point though.  Dr. Kramer has asked us to consider the complete disappearance of polyps, and perhaps the proportion of patients who have complete disappearance of polyps would be a more meaningful end point in the context of prevention, rather than in a therapeutic mode.     If we consider today's agenda pertains to chemoprevention, I wonder whether the discussion should at least consider the point that you raised, Dr. Kramer, because to my mind, for instance, a 20 percent difference in the proportion of people who are completely cleared or don't develop anything after an initial and complete clearance of the colon, that would be a very significant difference in my opinion.     CHAIRMAN WOLFE:  Dr. Geller.     DR. GELLER:  I think that is a wonderful end point, but I think it may be a premature one.  I think we are at a point now where from what I have heard today that we take these individuals, and we clean them out, and we put them on -- we randomize them to a chemoprevention agent, versus control, and possibly placebo.       We treat for a certain period of time, and we may do intermediate colonoscopies to make sure that we did a good job the first time.  And then at the end of the day, which will be from what I hear here 3 or 4 years after initiation of therapy, we look again.     And what we find is the end point.  Now, it could be that the proportion is totally disease free, and it could be something to do with the quantity of disease rather than the number of polyps, or it could be if you wish a number of polyps over a certain size.     But I think I heard that that is not going to yield too many end points.  So I wonder at this point if the size of the tumor, the total tumor bulk, the total bulk of adenomas, is measured somehow and seems to be the right end point, with other end points as secondary end points, with plans for the future once we know some more about histology, genetics, or whatever.  And possible end points for the future.     CHAIRMAN WOLFE:  Dr. Kramer.     DR. KRAMER:  And so per your instructions, I am trying to think from the standpoint of FDA; that is, what would get something on to the market for some indication.       So in that vain, I am ont sure exactly how to judge the maturity of an end point, because in order to judge the maturity of the end point, you really have to know what the natural history of that end point is.     And do we know the natural history better of having zero polyps or the natural history of having a proportion less polyps, and I don't know.  I can easily envision that if you were confident that you would have zero polyps, a lot more people with zero polyps, it would immediately translate into medical action.  That is, you would not have to do as many endoscopies.     But I am not sure that you could make the same decision if every person had 20 percent fewer polyps on subsequent follow-up.  So I don't know how to judge, quote, the maturity of that as an end point.     CHAIRMAN WOLFE:  Dr. Lippman.     DR. LIPPMAN:  Well, Barry, I think natural history would be very important and help us think whether possibly this is preventing cancer.  But still the point is that if these lesions -- and I am not calling them a disease, as Mike and I worked that out at lunch, and I won't use the disease word -- that these things are being treated.     And if they ar larger there is a higher complication rate.  So again I think that everything that we are talking about here is on the causal pathway to cancer.  I don't think you have to know the exact natural history to do it if you think then treating this particular abnormality.     And if it is smaller, then there is less complications is of value, and in terms of the issue of prevention, one of the things that has really haunted chemoprevention and cancer, and different than in heart disease, for instances, is this idea that prevention has to be a hundred percent complete forever.       And it is not the case for heart disease prevention.  We use that same term, and so again we will decide what we think a cut-off is, 25 or 30 percent, and that is meaningful, but I don't think we should all of a sudden redefine prevention in the context of chemoprevention different than what we do for every other disease.     DR. BARON:  I would just like to tell Barry that in fact both calcium and aspirin do increase in an proportional manner the number of patients that have no polyps by 20 to 25 percent, and will decrease the proportion with any advanced histology by 40 or 50 percent.     CHAIRMAN WOLFE:  Let's try to cut this a little bit if we can, as we are getting a little bit repetitious.  But we are all agreeing that in this type of trial, a chemoprevention trial, that every polyp that would be seen subsequent to starting the trial would be taken out.  Does everybody agree with that?     So then we are also saying that since that is taken out that the complete suppression is not necessarily the goal, but it is the ideal idea, but not necessarily the goal.  So we would also look at the histology of it.  Is that a consensus of this question?     Okay.  All other guidelines afterwards will be decided from the results of the trial.  Is that what we discussed, and is that our consensus?     DR. GELLER:  In particular I don't want to specify the end point of the trials.  I think the end point that Barry is proposing is perfectly find if somebody wants to take that on, but I think also a lesser -- one of lesser clinical significance for now could well be acceptable.     CHAIRMAN WOLFE:  Okay.  Dr. Avigan and Dr. Raczkowski, does that give you guidance for question number one?     DR. AVIGAN:  I would just as an addendum ask what the committee and the panelists think about rates of recurrence of polyps on an individual, rather than on a lesion, basis, because we have seen protocols where what is being scored are individuals who have polyps, versus individuals who do not have polyps at the follow-up exam.     Does the committee feel that this kind of end point is as stringent as the one that they have just described?     CHAIRMAN WOLFE:  You will have the answer inherently by seeing the polyps that are present.  If they don't have polyps, they don't have polyps.  If they have polyps, they do, and we will take them out.  No?     DR. FURBERG:  I think it is a very important question.  I think the unit of anality should be the patient.  We are not just looking at lesions.  If you look in the cardiovascular field and the coronary arteries, and you remove one plaque and leave four in there, one good have you done?     You really have to consider the patient as a unit.     DR. BARON:  This is John Baron, and this is sort of a false issue, because all the studies to date have been analyzed both ways.  You analyze the proportion of patients free of neoplasia, and in plus on type models you analyze the multiplicity.       And it is very easy to do both, but you have to do both.  Once you do one, you don't necessarily have the other.       DR. LIPPMAN:  And I think they usually correlate.      DR. KRAMER:  But again I am trying to think like I am in the FDA, although I am not qualified to be in the FDA, but that is a key question, because yes you look at both, but once you come to the point of saying it is on the market or its not, you approve -- unless both give you statistically significant end points, the question is which one do you go with, and that is another way of saying how do you power the trial, and how many people do you need in the trial.     Okay.  Let me propose this then.  I would like to propose that the primary end point should be the patient free of polyps, and the second end point should be a reduction in the number of polyps, and also inherently we will assume -- well, we can't assume, because that's why we are studying it -- an improvement in the biology of the polyp.     So that is our primary goal, the reduction and a complete suppression of polyps.  Is that the desired primary end point?     DR. CRYER:  Mr. Chairman, this is Bryon Cryer.  I would just question whether your suggested primary goal is a feasible primary goal, because if you look at the data that currently exists on the effects of  chemoprevention agents, very few of them achieve that goal.       I mean, most of them are just looking at partial regression, and polyps, and so I don't know that we would ever be able to feasibly accomplish a study in which we have looked for complete regression.     DR. LIEBERMAN:  I agree with that.  I think that if we accept that the polyp bearing population has a greater risk of developing cancer than the non-polyp bearing population, then it seems to me that a reduction in the burden, which could be quantitatively in numbers or qualitatively in histology, is a desirable end point.     And I think holding it to the highest standard of complete elimination, I agree that is probably not going to be feasible.     DR. BARON:  As I understand what complete elimination means, it is a complete elimination in some patients.  So what I think the chair was referring to was a positive study would be a study in which the proportion of patients with no polyps at the end of the study is increased, and that is definitely a feasible end point, because it has been achieved.     But I think what you may be referring to is a hundred percent efficacy; that is, in every single patient, and that is a different issue.     CHAIRMAN WOLFE:  I was referring to exactly -- and thank you for the clarification, and we have clarified each other now.       DR. LIPPMAN:  But I do believe that they are both viable end points, but I would reverse what is primary and what is secondary, because different than heart disease -- you know, this is a multi-focus process.       I mean, when you treat someone's cholesterol, that represents the whole body and the risk, but each individual area and polyp is its own independent risk of cancer and being treated independently.     So I think your point is a very valid one, and should be a major pre-specified secondary endpoint, but I would use polyp burden as the primary end point.     MS. COHEN:  I want to make sure that I understand what you are saying, that you should not attempt to cure every polyp that you see if they are endenomatous, or anything else, but you should take 80 percent or 90 percent?       That's very cynical.  I should think that you would want to do the best you can, and you are not going to be totally effective, but the highest level is what you should hope to achieve.  And if you don't, that's too bad, but you have tried.  But that is very cynical for the patient.     CHAIRMAN WOLFE:  Dr. Geller.     DR. GELLER:  I am suggesting that wise minds may disagree on this issue of primary end point.  I think we have two and I think they are both acceptable, and I think let the trial designer choose which is primary and which is secondary.     CHAIRMAN WOLFE:  FDA, do you want us to make a recommendation which should be primary and which should be secondary or are you happy with just saying they are primary and secondary, and you choose the order?     DR. RACZKOWSKI:  No, I think we have heard enough on this particular issue.  It does sound like that there is some diversity of opinion.  Thank you.     CHAIRMAN WOLFE:  We will move on to Question Number 6.  In randomized placebo controlled clinical trials of CPAs uses an adjunct to colonoscopic screening or surveillance, what would represent a clinically meaningful effect, size, for (a) reduction of benign adenomas,     (b) reduction of pre-malignant lesions; (c) reduction of colorectal cancer; (d) increase in the time interval between colonoscopies; and (e) reduction of complications associated.     I would like to start with Dr. Levin to answer this question.     DR. LEVIN:  Mr. Chairman, I am going to start with 6(a), and I would like to use two sources for the response.  The first is the document that is referred to in the general  Clinical Cancer Research  by the IEN Learned Committee.     And it states that a 30 percent reduction in the number of adenomatous polyps found in patients treated with an intervention agent, compared with placebo three years after an initial polypectomy, would be consid"

However, it has been proposed that the drug's therapeutic activity in schizophrenia is mediated through a combination of dopamine Type 2 (D2) and serotonin Type 2 (5HT2) receptor antagonism. Antagonism at receptors other than D2 and 5HT2 may explain some of the other effects of RISPERDAL. RISPERDAL is a selective monoaminergic antagonist with high affinity (Ki of 0.12 to 7.3 nM) for the serotonin Type 2 (5HT2), dopamine Type 2 (D2), 1 and 2 adrenergic, and H1 histaminergic receptors. RISPERDAL acts as an antagonist at other receptors, but with lower potency. RISPERDAL has low to moderate affinity (Ki of 47 to 253 nM) for the serotonin 5HT1C, 5HT1D, and 5HT1A receptors, weak affinity (Ki of 620 to 800 nM) for the dopamine D1 and haloperidol-sensitive sigma site, and no affinity (when tested at concentrations >10-5 M) for cholinergic muscarinic or 1 and 2 adrenergic receptors. Pharmacokinetics Absorption Risperidone is well absorbed. The absolute oral bioavailability of risperidone is 70% (CV=25%). The relative oral bioavailability of risperidone from a tablet is 94% (CV=10%) when compared to a solution. Pharmacokinetic studies showed that RISPERDAL Orally Disintegrating Tablets are bioequivalent to RISPERDAL Tablets. Plasma concentrations of risperidone, its major metabolite, 9-hydroxyrisperidone, and risperidone plus 9hydroxyrisperidone are dose proportional over the dosing range of 1 to 16 mg daily (0.5 to 8 mg BID). Following oral administration of solution or tablet, mean peak plasma concentrations of risperidone occurred at about 1 hour. Peak concentrations of 9-hydroxyrisperidone occurred at about 3 hours in extensive metabolizers, and 17 hours in poor metabolizers. Steady-state concentrations of risperidone are reached in 1 day in extensive metabolizers and would be expected to reach steady state in about 5 days in poor metabolizers. Steady-state concentrations of 9-hydroxyrisperidone are reached in 5-6 days (measured in extensive metabolizers). Food Effect Food does not affect either the rate or extent of absorption of risperidone. Thus, risperidone can be given with or without meals. Distribution Risperidone is rapidly distributed. The volume of distribution is 1-2 L/kg. In plasma, risperidone is bound to albumin and 1-acid glycoprotein. The plasma protein binding of risperidone is 90%, and that of its major metabolite, 9-hydroxyrisperidone, is 77%. Neither risperidone nor 9-hydroxyrisperidone displaces each other from plasma binding sites. High therapeutic concentrations of sulfamethazine (100 g/mL), warfarin (10 g/mL), and carbamazepine (10 g/mL) caused only a slight increase in the free fraction of risperidone at 10 ng/mL and 9-hydroxyrisperidone at 50 ng/mL, changes of unknown clinical significance. Metabolism Risperidone is extensively metabolized in the liver. The main metabolic pathway is through hydroxylation of risperidone to 9-hydroxyrisperidone by the enzyme, CYP 2D6. A minor metabolic   NDA 21-444 Page 5 pathway is through N-dealkylation. The main metabolite, 9-hydroxyrisperidone, has similar pharmacological activity as risperidone. Consequently, the clinical effect of the drug (i.e., the active moiety) results from the combined concentrations of risperidone plus 9-hydroxyrisperidone. CYP 2D6, also called debrisoquin hydroxylase, is the enzyme responsible for metabolism of many neuroleptics, antidepressants, antiarrhythmics, and other drugs. CYP 2D6 is subject to genetic polymorphism (about 6%-8% of Caucasians, and a very low percentage of Asians, have little or no activity and are ""poor metabolizers"") and to inhibition by a variety of substrates and some nonsubstrates, notably quinidine. Extensive CYP 2D6 metabolizers convert risperidone rapidly into 9hydroxyrisperidone, whereas poor CYP 2D6 metabolizers convert it much more slowly. Although extensive metabolizers have lower risperidone and higher 9-hydroxyrisperidone concentrations than poor metabolizers, the pharmacokinetics of the active moiety, after single and multiple doses, are similar in extensive and poor metabolizers. Risperidone could be subject to two kinds of drug-drug interactions (See Drug Interactions under PRECAUTIONS). First, inhibitors of CYP 2D6 interfere with conversion of risperidone to 9hydroxyrisperidone. This occurs with quinidine, giving essentially all recipients a risperidone pharmacokinetic profile typical of poor metabolizers. The therapeutic benefits and adverse effects of risperidone in patients receiving quinidine have not been evaluated, but observations in a modest number (n70) of poor metabolizers given risperidone do not suggest important differences between poor and extensive metabolizers. Second, co-administration of known enzyme inducers (e.g., phenytoin, rifampin, and phenobarbital) with risperidone may cause a decrease in the combined plasma concentrations of risperidone and 9-hydroxyrisperidone. It would also be possible for risperidone to interfere with metabolism of other drugs metabolized by CYP 2D6. Relatively weak binding of risperidone to the enzyme suggests this is unlikely. Excretion Risperidone and As illustrated by solution to three 70% in the urine its metabolites are eliminated via the urine and, to a much lesser extent, via the feces. a mass balance study of a single 1 mg oral dose of 14C-risperidone administered as healthy male volunteers, total recovery of radioactivity at 1 week was 84%, including and 14% in the feces.  The apparent half-life of risperidone was 3 hours (CV=30%) in extensive metabolizers and 20 hours (CV=40%) in poor metabolizers. The apparent half-life of 9-hydroxyrisperidone was about 21 hours (CV=20%) in extensive metabolizers and 30 hours (CV=25%) in poor metabolizers. The pharmacokinetics of the active moiety, after single and multiple doses, were similar in extensive and poor metabolizers, with an overall mean elimination half-life of about 20 hours. Special Populations Renal Impairment In patients with moderate to severe renal disease, clearance of the sum of risperidone and its active metabolite decreased by 60% compared to young healthy subjects. RISPERDAL doses should be reduced in patients with renal disease (See PRECAUTIONS and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION).   NDA 21-444 Page 6 Hepatic Impairment While the pharmacokinetics of risperidone in subjects with liver disease were comparable to those in young healthy subjects, the mean free fraction of risperidone in plasma was increased by about 35% because of the diminished concentration of both albumin and 1-acid glycoprotein. RISPERDAL doses should be reduced in patients with liver disease (See PRECAUTIONS and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). Elderly In healthy elderly subjects, renal clearance of both risperidone and 9-hydroxyrisperidone was decreased, and elimination half-lives were prolonged compared to young healthy subjects. Dosing should be modified accordingly in the elderly patients (See DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). Race and Gender Effects No specific pharmacokinetic study was conducted to investigate race and gender effects, but a population pharmacokinetic analysis did not identify important differences in the disposition of risperidone due to gender (whether corrected for body weight or not) or race. Clinical Trials Short-Term Efficacy The efficacy of RISPERDAL in the treatment of schizophrenia was established in four short-term (4 to 8-week) controlled trials of psychotic inpatients who met DSM-III-R criteria for schizophrenia. Several instruments were used for assessing psychiatric signs and symptoms in these studies, among them the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS), a multi-item inventory of general psychopathology traditionally used to evaluate the effects of drug treatment in schizophrenia. The BPRS psychosis cluster (conceptual disorganization, hallucinatory behavior, suspiciousness, and unusual thought content) is considered a particularly useful subset for assessing actively psychotic schizophrenic patients. A second traditional assessment, the Clinical Global Impression (CGI), reflects the impression of a skilled observer, fully familiar with the manifestations of schizophrenia, about the overall clinical state of the patient. In addition, two more recently developed, but less well evaluated scales, were employed; these included the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) and the Scale for Assessing Negative Symptoms (SANS). The results of the trials follow: (1) In a 6-week, placebo-controlled trial (n=160) involving titration of RISPERDAL in doses up to 10 mg/day (BID schedule), RISPERDAL was generally superior to placebo on the BPRS total score, on the BPRS psychosis cluster, and marginally superior to placebo on the SANS. (2) In an 8-week, placebo-controlled trial (n=513) involving 4 fixed doses of RISPERDAL (2, 6, 10, and 16 mg/day, on a BID schedule), all 4 RISPERDAL groups were generally superior to placebo on BPRS total score, BPRS psychosis cluster, and CGI severity score; the 3 highest RISPERDAL dose groups were generally superior to placebo on the PANSS negative subscale. The most consistently positive responses on all measures were seen for the 6 mg dose group, and there was no suggestion of increased benefit from larger doses. (3) In an 8-week, dose comparison trial (n=1356) involving 5 fixed doses of RISPERDAL (1, 4, 8, 12, and 16 mg/day, on a BID schedule), the four highest RISPERDAL dose groups were generally superior to the 1 mg RISPERDAL dose group on BPRS total score, BPRS psychosis cluster, and CGI severity score. None of the dose groups were superior to the 1 mg group on the PANSS negative subscale. The most consistently positive responses were seen for the 4 mg dose group.   NDA 21-444 Page 7 (4) In a 4-week, placebo-controlled dose comparison trial (n=246) involving 2 fixed doses of RISPERDAL (4 and 8 mg/day on a QD schedule), both RISPERDAL dose groups were generally superior to placebo on several PANSS measures, including a response measure (>20% reduction in PANSS total score), PANSS total score, and the BPRS psychosis cluster (derived from PANSS). The results were generally stronger for the 8 mg than for the 4 mg dose group. Long-Term Efficacy In a longer-term trial, 365 adult outpatients predominantly meeting DSM-IV criteria for schizophrenia and who had been clinically stable for at least 4 weeks on an antipsychotic medication were randomized to RISPERDAL (2-8 mg/day) or to an active comparator, for 1 to 2 years of observation for relapse. Patients receiving RISPERDAL experienced a significantly longer time to relapse over this time period compared to those receiving the active comparator. INDICATIONS AND USAGE RISPERDAL (risperidone) is indicated for the treatment of schizophrenia. The efficacy of RISPERDAL in schizophrenia was established in short-term (6 to 8 weeks) controlled trials of schizophrenic inpatients (See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY). The efficacy of RISPERDAL in delaying relapse was demonstrated in schizophrenic patients who had been clinically stable for at least 4 weeks before initiation of treatment with RISPERDAL or an active comparator and who were then observed for relapse during a period of 1 to 2 years (see Clinical Trials, under CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY). Nevertheless, the physician who elects to use RISPERDAL for extended periods should periodically re-evaluate the long-term usefulness of the drug for the individual patient (See DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). CONTRAINDICATIONS RISPERDAL (risperidone) is contraindicated in patients with a known hypersensitivity to the product. WARNINGS Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS) A potentially fatal symptom complex sometimes referred to as Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS) has been reported in association with antipsychotic drugs. Clinical manifestations of NMS are hyperpyrexia, muscle rigidity, altered mental status, and evidence of autonomic instability (irregular pulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, diaphoresis and cardiac dysrhythmia). Additional signs may include elevated creatinine phosphokinase, myoglobinuria (rhabdomyolysis), and acute renal failure. The diagnostic evaluation of patients with this syndrome is complicated. In arriving at a diagnosis, it is important to identify cases in which the clinical presentation includes both serious medical illness (e.g., pneumonia, systemic infection, etc.) and untreated or inadequately treated extrapyramidal signs and symptoms (EPS). Other important considerations in the differential diagnosis include central anticholinergic toxicity, heat stroke, drug fever, and primary central nervous system pathology. The management of NMS should include: 1) immediate discontinuation of antipsychotic drugs and other drugs not essential to concurrent therapy; 2) intensive symptomatic treatment and medical monitoring; and 3) treatment of any concomitant serious medical problems for which specific   NDA 21-444 Page 8 treatments are available. There is no general agreement about specific pharmacological treatment regimens for uncomplicated NMS. If a patient requires antipsychotic drug treatment after recovery from NMS, the potential reintroduction of drug therapy should be carefully considered. The patient should be carefully monitored, since recurrences of NMS have been reported. Tardive Dyskinesia A syndrome of potentially irreversible, involuntary, dyskinetic movements may develop in patients treated with antipsychotic drugs. Although the prevalence of the syndrome appears to be highest among the elderly, especially elderly women, it is impossible to rely upon prevalence estimates to predict, at the inception of antipsychotic treatment, which patients are likely to develop the syndrome. Whether antipsychotic drug products differ in their potential to cause tardive dyskinesia is unknown. The risk of developing tardive dyskinesia and the likelihood that it will become irreversible are believed to increase as the duration of treatment and the total cumulative dose of antipsychotic drugs administered to the patient increase. However, the syndrome can develop, although much less commonly, after relatively brief treatment periods at low doses. There is no known treatment for established cases of tardive dyskinesia, although the syndrome may remit, partially or completely, if antipsychotic treatment is withdrawn. Antipsychotic treatment, itself, however, may suppress (or partially suppress) the signs and symptoms of the syndrome and thereby may possibly mask the underlying process. The effect that symptomatic suppression has upon the longterm course of the syndrome is unknown. Given these considerations, RISPERDAL (risperidone) should be prescribed in a manner that is most likely to minimize the occurrence of tardive dyskinesia. Chronic antipsychotic treatment should generally be reserved for patients who suffer from a chronic illness that (1) is known to respond to antipsychotic drugs, and (2) for whom alternative, equally effective, but potentially less harmful treatments are not available or appropriate. In patients who do require chronic treatment, the smallest dose and the shortest duration of treatment producing a satisfactory clinical response should be sought. The need for continued treatment should be reassessed periodically. If signs and symptoms of tardive dyskinesia appear in a patient treated on RISPERDAL, drug discontinuation should be considered. However, some patients may require treatment with on RISPERDAL despite the presence of the syndrome. Cerebrovascular Adverse Events, Including Stroke, in Elderly Patients with Dementia Cerebrovascular adverse events (e.g., stroke, transient ischemic attack), including fatalities, were reported in patients (mean age 85 years; range 73-97) in trials of risperidone in elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis. In placebo-controlled trials, there was a significantly higher incidence of cerebrovascular adverse events in patients treated with risperidone compared to patients treated with placebo. RISPERDAL has not been shown to be safe or effective in the treatment of patients with dementia-related psychosis.   NDA 21-444 Page 9 Potential for Proarrhythmic Effects Risperidone and/or 9-hydroxyrisperidone appear to lengthen the QT interval in some patients, although there is no average increase in treated patients, even at 12-16 mg/day, well above the recommended dose. Other drugs that prolong the QT interval have been associated with the occurrence of torsades de pointes, a life-threatening arrhythmia. Bradycardia, electrolyte imbalance, concomitant use with other drugs that prolong QT, or the presence of congenital prolongation in QT can increase the risk for occurrence of this arrhythmia. PRECAUTIONS General Orthostatic Hypotension RISPERDAL (risperidone) may induce orthostatic hypotension associated with dizziness, tachycardia, and in some patients, syncope, especially during the initial dose-titration period, probably reflecting its alpha-adrenergic antagonistic properties. Syncope was reported in 0.2% (6/2607) of RISPERDAL treated patients in Phase 2-3 studies. The risk of orthostatic hypotension and syncope may be minimized by limiting the initial dose to 2 mg total (either QD or 1 mg BID) in normal adults and 0.5 mg BID in the elderly and patients with renal or hepatic impairment (See DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). Monitoring of orthostatic vital signs should be considered in patients for whom this is of concern. A dose reduction should be considered if hypotension occurs. RISPERDAL should be used with particular caution in patients with known cardiovascular disease (history of myocardial infarction or ischemia, heart failure, or conduction abnormalities), cerebrovascular disease, and conditions which would predispose patients to hypotension, e.g., dehydration and hypovolemia. Clinically significant hypotension has been observed with concomitant use of RISPERDAL and antihypertensive medication. Seizures During premarketing testing, seizures occurred in 0.3% (9/2607) of RISPERDAL-treated patients, two in association with hyponatremia. RISPERDAL should be used cautiously in patients with a history of seizures. Dysphagia Esophageal dysmotility and aspiration have been associated with antipsychotic drug use. Aspiration pneumonia is a common cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with advanced Alzheimer's dementia. RISPERDAL and other antipsychotic drugs should be used cautiously in patients at risk for aspiration pneumonia. Hyperprolactinemia As with other drugs that antagonize dopamine D2 receptors, risperidone elevates prolactin levels and the elevation persists during chronic administration. Tissue culture experiments indicate that approximately one-third of human breast cancers are prolactin-dependent in vitro, a factor of potential importance if the prescription of these drugs is contemplated in a patient with previously detected breast cancer. Although disturbances such as galactorrhea, amenorrhea, gynecomastia, and impotence have been reported with prolactin-elevating compounds, the clinical significance of elevated serum prolactin levels is unknown for most patients. As is common with compounds which increase prolactin release, an increase in pituitary gland, mammary gland, and pancreatic islet cell hyperplasia and/or neoplasia was observed in the risperidone carcinogenicity studies conducted in mice and rats (See CARCINOGENESIS). However, neither clinical studies nor epidemiologic studies conducted to date have shown an association between chronic administration of this class of drugs and tumorigenesis in humans; the available evidence is considered too limited to be conclusive at this time.   NDA 21-444 Page 10 Potential for Cognitive and Motor Impairment Somnolence was a commonly reported adverse event associated with RISPERDAL treatment, especially when ascertained by direct questioning of patients. This adverse event is dose-related, and in a study utilizing a checklist to detect adverse events, 41% of the high dose patients (RISPERDAL 16 mg/day) reported somnolence compared to 16% of placebo patients. Direct questioning is more sensitive for detecting adverse events than spontaneous reporting, by which 8% of RISPERDAL 16 mg/day patients and 1% of placebo patients reported somnolence as an adverse event. Since RISPERDAL has the potential to impair judgment, thinking, or motor skills, patients should be cautioned about operating hazardous machinery, including automobiles, until they are reasonably certain that RISPERDAL therapy does not affect them adversely. Priapism Rare cases of priapism have been reported. While the relationship of the events to RISPERDAL use has not been established, other drugs with alpha-adrenergic blocking effects have been reported to induce priapism, and it is possible that RISPERDAL may share this capacity. Severe priapism may require surgical intervention. Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura (TTP) A single case of TTP was reported in a 28 year-old female patient receiving RISPERDAL in a large, open premarketing experience (approximately 1300 patients). She experienced jaundice, fever, and bruising, but eventually recovered after receiving plasmapheresis. The relationship to RISPERDAL therapy is unknown. Antiemetic Effect Risperidone has an antiemetic effect in animals; this effect may also occur in humans, and may mask signs and symptoms of overdosage with certain drugs or of conditions such as intestinal obstruction, Reye's syndrome, and brain tumor. Body Temperature Regulation Disruption of body temperature regulation has been attributed to antipsychotic agents. Both hyperthermia and hypothermia have been reported in association with oral RISPERDAL use. Caution is advised when prescribing for patients who will be exposed to temperature extremes. Suicide The possibility of a suicide attempt is inherent in schizophrenia, and close supervision of high-risk patients should accompany drug therapy. Prescriptions for RISPERDAL should be written for the smallest quantity of tablets, consistent with good patient management, in order to reduce the risk of overdose. Use in Patients with Concomitant Illness Clinical experience with RISPERDAL in patients with certain concomitant systemic illnesses is limited. Caution is advisable in using RISPERDAL in patients with diseases or conditions that could affect metabolism or hemodynamic responses. RISPERDAL has not been evaluated or used to any appreciable extent in patients with a recent history of myocardial infarction or unstable heart disease. Patients with these diagnoses were excluded from clinical studies during the product's premarket testing. The electrocardiograms of approximately 380 patients who received RISPERDAL and 120 patients who received placebo in two double-blind, placebo-controlled trials were evaluated and the data revealed one finding of potential concern, i.e., 8 patients taking RISPERDAL whose baseline QTc interval was less than 450 msec were observed to   NDA 21-444 Page 11 have QTc intervals greater than 450 msec during treatment; no such prolongations were seen in the smaller placebo group. There were 3 such episodes in the approximately 125 patients who received haloperidol. Because of the risks of orthostatic hypotension and QT prolongation, caution should be observed in cardiac patients (See WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS). Increased plasma concentrations of risperidone and 9-hydroxyrisperidone occur in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance <30 mL/min/1.73 m2), and an increase in the free fraction of risperidone is seen in patients with severe hepatic impairment. A lower starting dose should be used in such patients (See DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). Information for Patients Physicians are advised to discuss the following issues with patients for whom they prescribe RISPERDAL: Orthostatic Hypotension Patients should be advised of the risk of orthostatic hypotension, especially during the period of initial dose titration. Interference W ith Cognitive and Motor Performance Since RISPERDAL has the potential to impair judgment, thinking, or motor skills, patients should be cautioned about operating hazardous machinery, including automobiles, until they are reasonably certain that RISPERDAL therapy does not affect them adversely. Pregnancy Patients should be advised to notify their physician if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during therapy. Nursing Patients should be advised not to breast-feed an infant if they are taking RISPERDAL. Concomitant Medication Patients should be advised to inform their physicians if they are taking, or plan to take, any prescription or over-the-counter drugs, since there is a potential for interactions. Alcohol Patients should be advised to avoid alcohol while taking RISPERDAL. Phenylketonurics Phenylalanine is a component of aspartame. Each 2 mg RISPERDAL Orally Disintegrating Tablet contains 0.56 mg phenylalanine; each 1 mg RISPERDAL Orally Disintegrating Tablet contains 0.28 mg phenylalanine and each 0.5 mg RISPERDAL Orally Disintegrating Tablet contains 0.14 mg phenylalanine. Laboratory Tests No specific laboratory tests are recommended. Drug Interactions The interactions of RISPERDAL and other drugs have not been systematically evaluated. Given the primary CNS effects of risperidone, caution should be used when RISPERDAL is taken in combination with other centrally acting drugs and alcohol.   NDA 21-444 Page 12 Because of its potential for inducing hypotension, RISPERDAL may enhance the hypotensive effects of other therapeutic agents with this potential. RISPERDAL may antagonize the effects of levodopa and dopamine agonists. Chronic administration of clozapine with risperidone may decrease the clearance of risperidone. Carbamazepine and other enzyme inducers: In a drug interaction study in schizophrenic patients, 11 subjects received risperidone titrated to 6 mg/day for 3 weeks, followed by concurrent administration of carbamazepine for an additional 3 weeks. During co-administration, the plasma concentrations of risperidone and its pharmacologically active metabolite, 9-hydroxyrisperidone, were decreased by about 50%. Plasma concentrations of carbamazepine did not appear to be affected. The dose of risperidone may need to be titrated accordingly for patients receiving carbamazepine, particularly during initiation or discontinuation of carbamazepine therapy. Co-administration of other known enzyme inducers (e.g., phenytoin, rifampin, and phenobarbital) with risperidone may cause similar decreases in the combined plasma concentrations of risperidone and 9-hydroxyrisperidone, which could lead to decreased efficacy of risperidone treatment. Fluoxetine: Fluoxetine (20 mg QD) has been shown to increase the plasma concentration of risperidone 2.5-2.8 fold, while the plasma concentration of 9-hydroxyrisperidone was not affected. When concomitant fluoxetine is initiated or discontinued, the physician should re-evaluate the dosing of RISPERDAL. The effects of discontinuation of concomitant fluoxetine therapy on the pharmacokinetics of risperidone and 9-hydroxyrisperidone have not been studied. Lithium: Repeated oral doses of risperidone (3 mg BID) did not affect the exposure (AUC) or peak plasma concentrations (Cmax) of lithium (n=13). Valproate: Repeated oral doses of risperidone (4 mg QD) did not affect the pre-dose or average plasma concentrations exposure (AUC) of valproate (1000 mg/day in three divided doses) compared to placebo (n=21). However, there was a 20% increase in valproate peak plasma concentration (Cmax) after concomitant administration of risperidone. Drugs that Inhibit CYP 2D6 and Other CYP Isozymes Risperidone is metabolized to 9-hydroxyrisperidone by CYP 2D6, an enzyme that is polymorphic in the population and that can be inhibited by a variety of psychotropic and other drugs (See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY). Drug interactions that reduce the metabolism of risperidone to 9hydroxyrisperidone would increase the plasma concentrations of risperidone and lower the concentrations of 9-hydroxyrisperidone. Analysis of clinical studies involving a modest number of poor metabolizers (n70) does not suggest that poor and extensive metabolizers have different rates of adverse effects. No comparison of effectiveness in the two groups has been made. In vitro studies showed that drugs metabolized by other CYP isozymes, including 1A1, 1A2, 2C9, MP, and 3A4, are only weak inhibitors of risperidone metabolism. Drugs Metabolized by CYP 2D6   NDA 21-444 Page 13 In vitro studies indicate that risperidone is a relatively weak inhibitor of CYP 2D6. Therefore, RISPERDAL is not expected to substantially inhibit the clearance of drugs that are metabolized by this enzymatic pathway. However, clinical data to confirm this expectation are not available. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenesis Carcinogenicity studies were conducted in Swiss albino mice and Wistar rats. Risperidone was administered in the diet at doses of 0.63, 2.5, and 10 mg/kg for 18 months to mice and for 25 months to rats. These doses are equivalent to 2.4, 9.4, and 37.5 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) (16 mg/day) on a mg/kg basis or 0.2, 0.75, and 3 times the MRHD (mice) or 0.4, 1.5, and 6 times the MRHD (rats) on a mg/m2 basis. A maximum tolerated dose was not achieved in male mice. There were statistically significant increases in pituitary gland adenomas, endocrine pancreas adenomas, and mammary gland adenocarcinomas. The following table summarizes the multiples of the human dose on a mg/m2 (mg/kg) basis at which these tumors occurred. Multiples of Maximum Human Dose in mg/m2 (mg/kg) Lowest Highest Effect Level Effect Level 0.75 (9.4) 0.2 (2.4) 1.5 (9.4) 0.4 (2.4) 0.2 (2.4) None  Tumor Type Pituitary adenomas Endocrine pancreas adenomas Mammary gland adenocarcinomas Mammary gland neoplasm, Total  Species mouse rat mouse  Sex female male female  rat rat rat  female male male  0.4 (2.4) 6 (37.5) 1.5 (9.4)  None 1.5 (9.4) 0.4 (2.4)  Antipsychotic drugs have been shown to chronically elevate prolactin levels in rodents. Serum prolactin levels were not measured during the risperidone carcinogenicity studies; however, measurements during subchronic toxicity studies showed that risperidone elevated serum prolactin levels 5 to 6 fold in mice and rats at the same doses used in the carcinogenicity studies. An increase in mammary, pituitary, and endocrine pancreas neoplasms has been found in rodents after chronic administration of other antipsychotic drugs and is considered to be prolactin-mediated. The relevance for human risk of the findings of prolactin-mediated endocrine tumors in rodents is unknown (See Hyperprolactinemia under PRECAUTIONS, GENERAL). Mutagenesis No evidence of mutagenic potential for risperidone was found in the Ames reverse mutation test, mouse lymphoma assay, in vitro rat hepatocyte DNA-repair assay, in vivo micronucleus test in mice, the sex-linked recessive lethal test in Drosophila, or the chromosomal aberration test in human lymphocytes or Chinese hamster cells. Impairment of Fertility Risperidone (0.16 to 5 mg/kg) was shown to impair mating, but not fertility, in Wistar rats in three reproductive studies (two Segment I and a multigenerational study) at doses 0.1 to 3 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) on a mg/m2 basis. The effect appeared to be in females, since impaired mating behavior was not noted in the Segment I study in which males only were treated. In a subchronic study in Beagle dogs in which risperidone was administered at doses of 0.31 to 5 mg/kg, sperm motility and concentration were decreased at doses 0.6 to 10 times the MRHD on a mg/m2 basis. Dose-related decreases were also noted in serum testosterone at the same doses. Serum   NDA 21-444 Page 14 testosterone and sperm parameters partially recovered, but remained decreased after treatment was discontinued. No no-effect doses were noted in either rat or dog. Pregnancy Pregnancy Category C The teratogenic potential of risperidone was studied in three Segment II studies in Sprague-Dawley and Wistar rats (0.63-10 mg/kg or 0.4 to 6 times the maximum recommended human dose [MRHD] on a mg/m2 basis) and in one Segment II study in New Zealand rabbits (0.31-5 mg/kg or 0.4 to 6 times the MRHD on a mg/m2 basis). The incidence of malformations was not increased compared to control in offspring of rats or rabbits given 0.4 to 6 times the MRHD on a mg/m2 basis. In three reproductive studies in rats (two Segment III and a multigenerational study), there was an increase in pup deaths during the first 4 days of lactation at doses of 0.16-5 mg/kg or 0.1 to 3 times the MRHD on a mg/m2 basis. It is not known whether these deaths were due to a direct effect on the fetuses or pups or to effects on the dams. There was no no-effect dose for increased rat pup mortality. In one Segment III study, there was an increase in stillborn rat pups at a dose of 2.5 mg/kg or 1.5 times the MRHD on a mg/m2 basis. In a cross-fostering study in Wistar rats, toxic effects on the fetus or pups, as evidenced by a decrease in the number of live pups and an increase in the number of dead pups at birth (Day 0), and a decrease in birth weight in pups of drug-treated dams were observed. In addition, there was an increase in deaths by Day 1 among pups of drug-treated dams, regardless of whether or not the pups were cross-fostered. Risperidone also appeared to impair maternal behavior in that pup body weight gain and survival (from Day 1 to 4 of lactation) were reduced in pups born to control but reared by drug-treated dams. These effects were all noted at the one dose of risperidone tested, i.e., 5 mg/kg or 3 times the MRHD on a mg/m2 basis. Placental transfer of risperidone occurs in rat pups. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. However, there was one report of a case of agenesis of the corpus callosum in an infant exposed to risperidone in utero. The causal relationship to RISPERDAL therapy is unknown. RISPERDAL should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Labor and Delivery The effect of RISPERDAL on labor and delivery in humans is unknown. Nursing Mothers In animal studies, risperidone and 9-hydroxyrisperidone are excreted in milk. Risperidone and 9hydroxyrisperidone are also excreted in human breast milk. Therefore, women receiving risperidone should not breast-feed. Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in children have not been established. Geriatric Use   NDA 21-444 Page 15 Clinical studies of RISPERDAL did not include sufficient numbers of patients aged 65 and over to determine whether or not they respond differently than younger patients. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between elderly and younger patients. In general, a lower starting dose is recommended for an elderly patient, reflecting a decreased pharmacokinetic clearance in the elderly, as well as a greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy (See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). While elderly patients exhibit a greater tendency to orthostatic hypotension, its risk in the elderly may be minimized by limiting the initial dose to 0.5 mg BID followed by careful titration (See PRECAUTIONS). Monitoring of orthostatic vital signs should be considered in patients for whom this is of concern. This drug is substantially excreted by the kidneys, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function (See DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). ADVERSE REACTIONS Associated with Discontinuation of Treatment Approximately 9% (244/2607) of RISPERDAL (risperidone)-treated patients in Phase 2-3 studies discontinued treatment due to an adverse event, compared with about 7% on placebo and 10% on active control drugs. The more common events (0.3%) associated with discontinuation and considered to be possibly or probably drug-related included: Adverse Event Extrapyramidal symptoms Dizziness Hyperkinesia Somnolence Nausea RISPERDAL 2.1% 0.7% 0.6% 0.5% 0.3% Placebo 0% 0% 0% 0% 0%  Suicide attempt was associated with discontinuation in 1.2% of RISPERDAL-treated patients compared to 0.6% of placebo patients, but, given the almost 40-fold greater exposure time in RISPERDAL compared to placebo patients, it is unlikely that suicide attempt is a RISPERDAL related adverse event (See PRECAUTIONS). Discontinuation for extrapyramidal symptoms was 0% in placebo patients, but 3.8% in active-control patients in the Phase 2-3 trials. Incidence in Controlled Trials Commonly Observed Adverse Events in Controlled Clinical Trials In two 6 to 8-week placebo-controlled trials, spontaneously-reported, treatment-emergent adverse events with an incidence of 5% or greater in at least one of the RISPERDAL groups and at least twice that of placebo were: anxiety, somnolence, extrapyramidal symptoms, dizziness, constipation, nausea, dyspepsia, rhinitis, rash, and tachycardia. Adverse events were also elicited in one of these two trials (i.e., in the fixed-dose trial comparing RISPERDAL at doses of 2, 6, 10, and 16 mg/day with placebo) utilizing a checklist for detecting adverse events, a method that is more sensitive than spontaneous reporting. By this method, the following additional common and drug-related adverse events occurred at an incidence of at least 5% and twice the rate of placebo: increased dream activity, increased duration of sleep, accommodation   NDA 21-444 Page 16 disturbances, reduced salivation, micturition disturbances, diarrhea, weight gain, menorrhagia, diminished sexual desire, erectile dysfunction, ejaculatory dysfunction, and orgastic dysfunction. Adverse Events Occurring at an Incidence of 1% of More Among RISPERDAL-Treated Patients: The table that follows enumerates adverse events that occurred at an incidence of 1% or more, and were at least as frequent among RISPERDAL-treated patients treated at doses of 10 mg/day than among placebo-treated patients in the pooled results of two 6 to 8-week controlled trials. Patients received RISPERDAL doses of 2, 6, 10, or 16 mg/day in the dose comparison trial, or up to a maximum dose of 10 mg/day in the titration study. This table shows the percentage of patients in each dose group (10 mg/day or 16 mg/day) who spontaneously reported at least one episode of an event at some time during their treatment. Patients given doses of 2, 6, or 10 mg did not differ materially in these rates. Reported adverse events were classified using the World Health Organization preferred terms. The prescriber should be aware that these figures cannot be used to predict the incidence of side effects in the course of usual medical practice where patient characteristics and other factors differ from those which prevailed in this clinical trial. Similarly, the cited frequencies cannot be compared with figures obtained from other clinical investigations involving different treatments, uses and investigators. The cited figures, however, do provide the prescribing physician with some basis for estimating the relative contribution of drug and non-drug factors to the side effect incidence rate in the population studied.   NDA 21-444 Page 17 Table 1.

Incidence of Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events in 6- to 8Week Controlled Clinical Trials1 Body System/ Preferred Term 1  RISPERDAL 10 mg/day 16 mg/day Placebo (N=142) (N = 324) (N = 77)  2  Events reported by at least 1% of patients treated with RISPERDAL 10 mg/day are included, and are rounded to the nearest %. Comparative rates for RISPERDAL 16 mg/day and placebo are provided as well. Events for which the RISPERDAL incidence (in both dose groups) was equal to or less than placebo are not listed in the table, but included the following: nervousness, injury, and fungal infection. Includes tremor, dystonia, hypokinesia, hypertonia, hyperkinesia, oculogyric crisis, ataxia, abnormal gait, involuntary muscle contractions, hyporeflexia, akathisia, and extrapyramidal disorders. Although the incidence of 'extrapyramidal symptoms' does not appear to differ for the '10 mg/day' group and placebo, the data for individual dose groups in fixed dose trials do suggest a dose/response relationship (See DOSE DEPENDENCY OF ADVERSE EVENTS).  Dose Dependency of Adverse Events Extrapyramidal Symptoms: Data from two fixed-dose trials provided evidence of dose-relatedness for extrapyramidal symptoms associated with risperidone treatment. Two methods were used to measure extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) in an 8-week trial comparing 4 fixed doses of risperidone (2, 6, 10, and 16 mg/day), including (1) a parkinsonism score (mean change from baseline) from the Extrapyramidal Symptom Rating Scale, and (2) incidence of spontaneous complaints of EPS: Dose Groups Parkinsonism EPS Incidence Placebo 1.2 13% Ris 2 0.9 13% Ris 6 1.8 16% Ris 10 2.4 20% Ris 16 2.6 31%  Similar methods were used to measure extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) in an 8-week trial comparing 5 fixed doses of risperidone (1, 4, 8, 12, and 16 mg/day): Dose Groups Parkinsonism EPS Incidence RIS 1 0.6 7% Ris 4 1.7 12% Ris 8 2.4 18% Ris 12 2.9 18% Ris 16 4.1 21%  Other Adverse Events: Adverse event data elicited by a checklist for side effects from a large study comparing 5 fixed doses of RISPERDAL (1, 4, 8, 12, and 16 mg/day) were explored for doserelatedness of adverse events. A Cochran-Armitage Test for trend in these data revealed a positive trend (p<0.05) for the following adverse events: sleepiness, increased duration of sleep, accommodation disturbances, orthostatic dizziness, palpitations, weight gain, erectile dysfunction, ejaculatory dysfunction, orgastic dysfunction, asthenia/lassitude/increased fatigability, and increased pigmentation. Vital Sign Changes: RISPERDAL is associated with orthostatic hypotension and tachycardia (See PRECAUTIONS). Weight Changes: The proportions of RISPERDAL and placebo-treated patients meeting a weight gain criterion of 7% of body weight were compared in a pool of 6- to 8-week, placebo-controlled trials,   NDA 21-444 Page 19 revealing a statistically significantly greater incidence of weight gain for RISPERDAL (18%) compared to placebo (9%). Laboratory Changes: A between-group comparison for 6- to 8-week, placebo-controlled trials revealed no statistically significant RISPERDAL/placebo differences in the proportions of patients experiencing potentially important changes in routine serum chemistry, hematology, or urinalysis parameters. Similarly, there were no RISPERDAL/ placebo differences in the incidence of discontinuations for changes in serum chemistry, hematology, or urinalysis. However, RISPERDAL administration was associated with increases in serum prolactin (See PRECAUTIONS). ECG Changes: The electrocardiograms of approximately 380 patients who received RISPERDAL and 120 patients who received placebo in two double-blind, placebo-controlled trials were evaluated and revealed one finding of potential concern; i.e., 8 patients taking RISPERDAL whose baseline QTc interval was less than 450 msec were observed to have QTc intervals greater than 450 msec during treatment (See WARNINGS). Changes of this type were not seen among about 120 placebo patients, but were seen in patients receiving haloperidol (3/126). Other Events Observed During the Pre-Marketing Evaluation of RISPERDAL During its premarketing assessment, multiple doses of RISPERDAL (risperidone) were administered to 2607 patients in Phase 2 and 3 studies. The conditions and duration of exposure to RISPERDAL varied greatly, and included (in overlapping categories) open-label and double-blind studies, uncontrolled and controlled studies, inpatient and outpatient studies, fixed-dose and titration studies, and short-term or longer-term exposure. In most studies, untoward events associated with this exposure were obtained by spontaneous report and recorded by clinical investigators using terminology of their own choosing. Consequently, it is not possible to provide a meaningful estimate of the proportion of individuals experiencing adverse events without first grouping similar types of untoward events into a smaller number of standardized event categories. In two large studies, adverse events were also elicited utilizing the UKU (direct questioning) side effect rating scale, and these events were not further categorized using standard terminology (Note: These events are marked with an asterisk in the listings that follow). In the listings that follow, spontaneously reported adverse events were classified using World Health Organization (WHO) preferred terms. The frequencies presented, therefore, represent the proportion of the 2607 patients exposed to multiple doses of RISPERDAL who experienced an event of the type cited on at least one occasion while receiving RISPERDAL. All reported events are included, except those already listed in Table 1, those events for which a drug cause was remote, and those event terms which were so general as to be uninformative. It is important to emphasize that, although the events reported occurred during treatment with RISPERDAL, they were not necessarily caused by it. Events are further categorized by body system and listed in order of decreasing frequency according to the following definitions: frequent adverse events are those occurring in at least 1/100 patients (only those not already listed in the tabulated results from placebo-controlled trials appear in this listing); infrequent adverse events are those occurring in 1/100 to 1/1000 patients; rare events are those occurring in fewer than 1/1000 patients.

Postintroduction Reports Adverse events reported since market introduction which were temporally (but not necessarily causally) related to RISPERDAL therapy, include the following: anaphylactic reaction, angioedema, apnea, atrial fibrillation, cerebrovascular disorder, including cerebrovascular accident, hyperglycemia, diabetes mellitus aggravated, including diabetic ketoacidosis, intestinal obstruction, jaundice, mania, pancreatitis, Parkinson's disease aggravated, pulmonary embolism. There have been rare reports of sudden death and/or cardiopulmonary arrest in patients receiving RISPERDAL. A causal relationship with RISPERDAL has not been established. It is important to note that sudden and unexpected death may occur in psychotic patients whether they remain untreated or whether they are treated with other antipsychotic drugs. DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE Controlled Substance Class RISPERDAL (risperidone) is not a controlled substance. Physical and Psychologic Dependence RISPERDAL has not been systematically studied in animals or humans for its potential for abuse, tolerance, or physical dependence. While the clinical trials did not reveal any tendency for any drugseeking behavior, these observations were not systematic and it is not possible to predict on the basis of this limited experience the extent to which a CNS-active drug will be misused, diverted, and/or abused once marketed. Consequently, patients should be evaluated carefully for a history of drug abuse, and such patients should be observed closely for signs of RISPERDAL misuse or abuse (e.g., development of tolerance, increases in dose, drug-seeking behavior).   NDA 21-444 Page 22 OVERDOSAGE Human Experience Premarketing experience included eight reports of acute RISPERDAL overdosage with estimated doses ranging from 20 to 300 mg and no fatalities. In general, reported signs and symptoms were those resulting from an exaggeration of the drug's known pharmacological effects, i.e., drowsiness and sedation, tachycardia and hypotension, and extrapyramidal symptoms. One case, involving an estimated overdose of 240 mg, was associated with hyponatremia, hypokalemia, prolonged QT, and widened QRS. Another case, involving an estimated overdose of 36 mg, was associated with a seizure. Postmarketing experience includes reports of acute RISPERDAL overdosage, with estimated doses of up to 360 mg. In general, the most frequently reported signs and symptoms are those resulting from an exaggeration of the drug's known pharmacological effects, i.e., drowsiness, sedation, tachycardia, and hypotension. Other adverse events reported since market introduction which were temporally, (but not necessarily causally) related to RISPERDAL overdose, include prolonged QT interval, convulsions, cardiopulmonary arrest, and rare fatality associated with multiple drug overdose. Management of Overdosage In case of acute overdosage, establish and maintain an airway and ensure adequate oxygenation and ventilation. Gastric lavage (after intubation, if patient is unconscious) and administration of activated charcoal together with a laxative should be considered. Because of the rapid disintegration of risperidone orally disintegrating tablets, pill fragments may not appear in gastric contents obtained with lavage. The possibility of obtundation, seizures or dystonic reaction of the head and neck following overdose may create a risk of aspiration with induced emesis. Cardiovascular monitoring should commence immediately and should include continuous electrocardiographic monitoring to detect possible arrhythmias. If antiarrhythmic therapy is administered, disopyramide, procainamide and quinidine carry a theoretical hazard of QT-prolonging effects that might be additive to those of risperidone. Similarly, it is reasonable to expect that the alpha-blocking properties of bretylium might be additive to those of risperidone, resulting in problematic hypotension. There is no specific antidote to RISPERDAL. Therefore, appropriate supportive measures should be instituted. The possibility of multiple drug involvement should be considered. Hypotension and circulatory collapse should be treated with appropriate measures, such as intravenous fluids and/or sympathomimetic agents (epinephrine and dopamine should not be used, since beta stimulation may worsen hypotension in the setting of risperidone-induced alpha blockade). In cases of severe extrapyramidal symptoms, anticholinergic medication should be administered. Close medical supervision and monitoring should continue until the patient recovers. DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Usual Initial Dose RISPERDAL (risperidone) can be administered on either a BID or a QD schedule. In early clinical trials, RISPERDAL was generally administered at 1 mg BID initially, with increases in increments of 1 mg BID on the second and third day, as tolerated, to a target dose of 3 mg BID by the third day. Subsequent controlled trials have indicated that total daily risperidone doses of up to 8 mg on a QD regimen are also safe and effective. However, regardless of which regimen is employed, in some patients a slower titration may be medically appropriate. Further dosage adjustments, if indicated, should generally occur at intervals of not less than 1 week, since steady state for the active metabolite would not be achieved for approximately 1 week in the typical patient. When dosage adjustments are necessary, small dose increments/decrements of 1-2 mg are recommended.   NDA 21-444 Page 23 Efficacy in schizophrenia was demonstrated in a dose range of 4 to 16 mg/day in the clinical trials supporting effectiveness of RISPERDAL; however, maximal effect was generally seen in a range of 4 to 8 mg/day. Doses above 6 mg/day for BID dosing were not demonstrated to be more efficacious than lower doses, were associated with more extrapyramidal symptoms and other adverse effects, and are not generally recommended. In a single study supporting QD dosing, the efficacy results were generally stronger for 8 mg than for 4 mg. The safety of doses above 16 mg/day has not been evaluated in clinical trials. Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of RISPERDAL in pediatric patients have not been established. Dosage in Special Populations The recommended initial dose is 0.5 mg BID in patients who are elderly or debilitated, patients with severe renal or hepatic impairment, and patients either predisposed to hypotension or for whom hypotension would pose a risk. Dosage increases in these patients should be in increments of no more than 0.5 mg BID. Increases to dosages above 1.5 mg BID should generally occur at intervals of at least 1 week. In some patients, slower titration may be medically appropriate. Elderly or debilitated patients, and patients with renal impairment, may have less ability to eliminate RISPERDAL than normal adults. Patients with impaired hepatic function may have increases in the free fraction of risperidone, possibly resulting in an enhanced effect (See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY). Patients with a predisposition to hypotensive reactions or for whom such reactions would pose a particular risk likewise need to be titrated cautiously and carefully monitored (See PRECAUTIONS). If a once-a-day dosing regimen in the elderly or debilitated patient is being considered, it is recommended that the patient be titrated on a twice-a-day regimen for 2-3 days at the target dose. Subsequent switches to a once-a-day dosing regimen can be done thereafter. Directions for Use of RISPERDAL Orally Disintegrating Tablets RISPERDAL Orally Disintegrating Tablets are supplied as blister packs of 4 tablet units each. Tablet Accessing: Do not open the blister until ready to administer. For single tablet removal, separate one of the four blister units by tearing apart at the perforations. Bend the corner where indicated. Peel back foil to expose the tablet. DO NOT push the tablet through the foil because this could damage the tablet. Tablet Administration: Using dry hands, remove the tablet from the blister unit and immediately place the entire RISPERDAL Orally Disintegrating Tablet on the tongue. The RISPERDAL Orally Disintegrating Tablet should be consumed immediately, as the tablet cannot be stored once removed from the blister unit. RISPERDAL Orally Disintegrating Tablets disintegrate in the mouth within seconds and can be swallowed subsequently with or without liquid. Patients should not attempt to split or to chew the tablet. Maintenance Therapy   NDA 21-444 Page 24 While there is no body of evidence available to answer the question of how long the schizophrenic patient treated with RISPERDAL should remain on it, the effectiveness of RISPERDAL 2 mg/day to 8 mg/day at delaying relapse was demonstrated in a controlled trial in patients who had been clinically stable for at least 4 weeks and were then followed for a period of 1 to 2 years. In this trial, RISPERDAL was administered on a QD schedule, at 1 mg QD initially, with increases to 2 mg QD on the second day, and to a target dose of 4 mg QD on the third day (see Clinical Trials, under CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY). Nevertheless, patients should be periodically reassessed to determine the need for maintenance treatment with an appropriate dose. Reinitiation of Treatment in Patients Previously Discontinued Although there are no data to specifically address reinitiation of treatment, it is recommended that when restarting patients who have had an interval off RISPERDAL, the initial titration schedule should be followed. Switching from Other Antipsychotics There are no systematically collected data to specifically address switching schizophrenic patients from other antipsychotics to RISPERDAL, or concerning concomitant administration with other antipsychotics. While immediate discontinuation of the previous antipsychotic treatment may be acceptable for some schizophrenic patients, more gradual discontinuation may be most appropriate for others. In all cases, the period of overlapping antipsychotic administration should be minimized. When switching schizophrenic patients from depot antipsychotics, if medically appropriate, initiate RISPERDAL therapy in place of the next scheduled injection. The need for continuing existing EPS medication should be re-evaluated periodically.

GX251-65-12941071	"Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality  Evidence Report/Technology Assessment Number 76  Ephedra and Ephedrine for Weight Loss and Athletic Performance Enhancement: Clinical Efficacy and Side Effects Summary  Overview At the direction of the funding agencies (the National Institutes of Health Office of Dietary Supplements (ODS), the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM), and the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ)), and in consultation with our Technical Expert Panel, we addressed research questions regarding the efficacy of herbal ephedra and ephedrine for weight loss and athletic performance through a comprehensive literature review and synthesis of evidence. We assessed the safety of these products through review of clinical trials. Meta-analysis was performed where appropriate. In addition, we reviewed herbal ephedra- and ephedrine-related adverse events reports on file with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), published case reports, and reports to a manufacturer of ephedracontaining products. It is expected that the results of this review will be used to direct further research.  Reporting the Evidence The following questions were provided to us by the funding agencies and guided this evidence report. Weight Loss 1. What is the evidence for efficacy of ephedracontaining dietary supplement products in weight loss, over a sustained period of time? 2. Can efficacy for weight loss be attributed to ephedra alone, or ephedra in combination with other ingredients (e.g., caffeine)? 3. Does ephedra have additive effects with other agents? 4. What dosage levels of ephedra are necessary to achieve weight loss?  Athletic Performance 1. What is the evidence for efficacy of ephedracontaining dietary supplement products in terms of energy enhancement and enhancement of athletic performance, over a sustained period of time? 2. Can efficacy for energy enhancement and enhancement of athletic performance be attributed to ephedra alone, or ephedra in combination with other ingredients (e.g., caffeine) that produce energy enhancement and/or enhancement of athletic performance? 3. Does ephedra have additive effects with other agents? 4. What dosage levels of ephedra are necessary to achieve energy enhancement and enhancement of athletic performance? Safety Assessment 1. Does use of ephedra-containing dietary supplement products over a sustained period of time increase the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) or other serious and lifethreatening events in specific populations? 2. What populations are at risk of CVD and other life-threatening events through use of ephedra over a sustained period of time? 3. Can the risk for adverse events in these populations be attributed to ephedra alone, or in combination with other ingredients (e.g., caffeine)? 4. Does ephedra have additive effects with other agents? 5. What dosage levels of ephedra produce risk of CVD or other life-threatening events?  U.S. DEP AR TMENT OF HEAL TH AND HUMAN SERVICES  Public Health Ser vice   6. Do ephedra-containing dietary supplement products alter physiologic markers of cardiovascular function? 7. What are the metabolic actions of ephedra, so as to explain its beneficial and adverse effects? In addition to answering these 15 questions about ephedracontaining dietary supplement products, we were also asked to synthesize the available information on the same questions for the purified alkaloid, ephedrine. After searching published reports, journal articles, conference presentations, and various sources of unpublished studies, we identified 52 controlled clinical trials of ephedrine or herbal ephedra for weight loss or athletic performance in humans. The FDA provided us with copies of over 1,000 adverse event reports (AERs) related to herbal ephedra and 125 AERs related to ephedrine. These reports often included interviews with patients and/or family members, extensive medical records, and copies of product labels. We identified 65 case reports in the literature and received a disk of 15,951 reports containing 18,502 cases from Metabolife, a manufacturer of ephedra products.  Methodology Efficacy. Data for the efficacy analysis were abstracted from reports of controlled trials onto a specially designed form containing questions about the study design, the number of patients and comorbidities, dosage, adverse events, the types of outcome measures, and the time from intervention until outcome measurement. We selected the variables for abstraction with input from the project's technical experts. Two physicians, working independently, each extracted data from the same reports and resolved disagreements by consensus. In selecting studies for the meta-analysis of weight loss efficacy, we considered only those trials of at least 8 weeks treatment duration. Our technical expert panel judged that shorter treatment durations were insufficient to assess weight loss. In selecting studies on athletic performance, we found that these studies varied widely with respect to intervention. Because of this heterogeneity, we compared and contrasted these studies in a narrative review, rather than performing a statistical synthesis. The effects of ephedra/ephedrine on weight loss were examined in six different types of comparisons: (1)ephedrine versus placebo; (2) ephedrine plus caffeine versus placebo; (3) ephedrine plus caffeine versus ephedrine; (4) ephedrine versus other active treatment; (5)ephedra versus placebo; and (6) ephedra plus herbs containing caffeine versus placebo. The last comparison subgroup contained only a single trial; thus, effect sizes were estimated only for the first five. The effect size was calculated by dividing the outcome of a study (e.g., difference in weight loss per month between the two groups) by its standard deviation, which produces a unitless measure that is useful when comparing studies that assess outcomes (such as weight) that are similar but are measured differently (e.g.,  weight loss in pounds versus change in body mass index). Effect sizes were pooled separately for each of the five comparison subgroups. In addition, we used meta-regression to conduct a cross-subgroup synthesis on the effect sizes of the subgroups with a placebo comparison: ephedrine versus placebo; ephedrine plus caffeine versus placebo; and ephedra plus herbs containing caffeine versus placebo. Safety. We reviewed each report of a controlled trial (regardless of treatment duration) for data on adverse events. Adverse events were recorded onto a spreadsheet that identified each study arm, the description of the adverse event as listed in the original article, and the numbers of subjects and adverse events in each arm. We then compared event rates in the ephedra or ephedrine groups to those in the placebo groups. We conducted a meta-analysis on those adverse event symptoms for which appreciable numbers of events were noted in the controlled trials. Adverse event reports compiled by the FDA concerning ephedra or ephedrine were also reviewed by our physician reviewers. Within the time and resource constraints of this report, we reviewed all available reports of death, myocardial infarction (heart attack), cerebral vascular accident (stroke), seizure, and serious psychiatric illness filed prior to September 30, 2001. We also reviewed published case reports as well as event reports filed with Metabolife, a manufacturer of ephedracontaining products. After screening, all case reports were subjected to a review. Based on input from our technical expert panel and the literature on methods to assess adverse event reports, we identified three important criteria for inclusion of such reports: 1. Documentation of an adverse event that met our selection criteria. 2. Documentation that the person having the adverse event took an ephedra-containing supplement or ephedrine within 24 hours prior to the event (for cases of death, myocardial infarction, stroke, or seizure). 3. Documentation that alternative explanations for the adverse event were investigated and were excluded with reasonable certainty. We classified cases that met all three of these criteria as ""sentinel events."" Cases in which the event might have had other possible causes but the pharmacology of ephedrine could have contributed were classified as ""possible sentinel events."" Cases of death, myocardial infarction, cerebral vascular accident, and seizure were reviewed by internists, with additional review (as indicated) by a cardiologist, neurologist, or rheumatologist. Psychiatric cases were reviewed by a psychiatrist specializing in addictions and a psychologist with expertise in substance abuse. The criterion for use within 24 hours was not required for psychiatric cases.  2   Findings Efficacy for Weight Loss. We identified 44 controlled trials that assessed use of ephedra or ephedrine used for weight loss. Of these, 18 were excluded from pooled analysis because they had a treatment duration of less than 8 weeks. Six additional trials were excluded for a variety of other reasons. Of the remaining 20 trials included in the meta-analysis, only five tested herbal ephedra-containing products. Together, these 20 trials assessed 678 persons who consumed either ephedra or ephedrine. The majority of studies of both ephedra and ephedrine are plagued by methodological problems (particularly, high attrition rates) that might contribute to bias. These methodological limitations must be considered when interpreting any conclusions regarding the efficacy of these products. Nevertheless, the evidence we identified and assessed supports an association between short-term use of ephedrine, ephedrine plus caffeine, or dietary supplements that contain ephedra with or without herbs containing caffeine and a statistically significant increase in short-term weight loss (compared to placebo). Adding caffeine to ephedrine modestly increases the amount of weight loss. There is no evidence that the effect of ephedra-containing dietary supplements with herbs containing caffeine differs from that of ephedrine plus caffeine: Both result in weight loss that is approximately 2 pounds per month greater than that with placebo, for up to 4 to 6 months. No studies have assessed the long-term effects of ephedracontaining dietary supplements or ephedrine on weight loss; the longest duration of treatment in a published study was 6 months. Efficacy for Physical Performance Enhancement. The effect of ephedrine on athletic performance was assessed in seven studies. No studies have assessed the effect of herbal ephedra-containing dietary supplements on athletic performance. The few studies that assessed the effect of ephedrine on athletic performance have, in general, included only small samples of fit individuals (young male military recruits) and have assessed the effects only on very short-term immediate performance. Thus, these studies did not assess ephedrine as it is used in the general population. The data support a modest effect of ephedrine plus caffeine on very short-term athletic performance. No studies have assessed the sustained use of ephedrine on performance over time. The only study that assessed the additive effects of these agents reported that ephedrine must be supplemented with caffeine to affect athletic performance. Safety Issues. The data on adverse events were drawn from clinical trials and case reports published in the literature, submitted to the FDA, and reported to Metabolife, a manufacturer of ephedra-containing supplement products. The strongest evidence for causality should come from clinical trials; however, in most circumstances, such trials do not enroll sufficient numbers of patients to adequately assess the possibility of rare outcomes. Such was the case with our review  of ephedrine and ephedra-containing dietary supplements. Even in aggregate, the clinical trials enrolled only enough patients to detect a serious adverse event rate of at least 1.0 per 1,000. For rare outcomes, we reviewed case reports, but a causal relationship between ephedra or ephedrine use and these events cannot be assumed or proven. Evidence from controlled trials was sufficient to conclude that the use of ephedrine and/or the use of ephedra-containing dietary supplements or ephedrine plus caffeine is associated with two to three times the risk of nausea, vomiting, psychiatric symptoms such as anxiety and change in mood, autonomic hyperactivity, and palpitations. The majority of case reports are insufficiently documented to make an informed judgment about a relationship between the use of ephedrine or ephedra-containing dietary supplements and the adverse event in question. For prior consumption of ephedra-containing products, we identified two deaths, three myocardial infarctions, nine cerebrovascular accidents, three seizures, and five psychiatric cases as sentinel events; for prior consumption of ephedrine, we identified three deaths, two myocardial infarctions, two cerebrovascular accidents, one seizure, and three psychiatric cases as sentinel events. We identified 43 additional cases as possible sentinel events with prior ephedra consumption and seven additional cases as possible sentinel events for prior ephedrine consumption. About half the sentinel events occurred in persons aged 30 years or younger. Classification as a sentinel event does not imply a proven cause and effect relationship. We did not assess the plethora of additional symptoms that have been reported in the published literature and the FDA Medwatch file for ephedra-containing dietary supplements and ephedrine products.  Future Research Our analysis of the evidence reveals numerous gaps in the literature regarding the efficacy and safety of ephedracontaining dietary supplements. First, long-term assessments of the effectiveness of herbal ephedra or ephedrine for promoting weight loss are lacking. We identified no study with a treatment duration longer than 6 months. To improve health outcomes and reduce the risk of morbidities associated with being overweight, sufficient weight loss (5 to 10 percent of body weight) and long-term weight maintenance are necessary. Therefore, the benefit of ephedrine or herbal ephedracontaining dietary supplements for health outcomes is unknown. Evidence regarding the effect of herbal ephedra or ephedrine on physical performance that reflects its use in the general population (repeated or long-term use by a representative sample) is also needed. In order to assess a causal relationship between ephedra or ephedrine consumption and serious adverse events, a  3   hypothesis-testing study is needed. Continued analysis of case reports cannot substitute for a properly designed study to assess causality. A case-control study would probably be the study design of choice.

GX261-52-5386202	Chapter 5. Conclusions Efficacy The efficacy of herbal ephedracontaining dietary supplements has not been extensively studied in randomized clinical trials. We identified no clinical trials of herbal ephedracontaining dietary supplements that assessed their effect on athletic performance and only five clinical trials that assessed their effect on weight loss. Many more studies assessed the effects of ephedrine on weight loss; however, studies of the effects of ephedrine on athletic performance are still relatively sparse. The majority of studies--of both ephedra and ephedrine--are plagued by methodological problems known to be associated with bias, particularly high attrition rates. All of the conclusions on efficacy need to be considered with these methodological limitations in mind. Given the above considerations, the evidence we identified and assessed supports the following conclusions:  Weight Loss  The short-term use of ephedrine, ephedrine plus caffeine, or the assessed dietary supplements containing ephedra and herbs with caffeine is associated with a statistically significant increase in short-term weight loss (compared to placebo). There are no studies assessing the long-term effects of the use of ephedra-containing dietary supplements or ephedrine on weight loss or maintenance. In order to improve health outcomes and reduce the risk of morbidities associated with being overweight, long-term weight maintenance is necessary. There are no data to indicate that the effects of ephedrine plus caffeine are different from the effects of ephedra-containing dietary supplements with caffeine-containing herbs. The effect of either ephedra-containing dietary supplements with caffeine-containing herbs or ephedrine plus caffeine is a weight loss that is approximately two pounds per month greater than that of placebo, for up to four to six months in duration. As a percentage of pretreatment weight, the weight losses in these studies average between 5 percent and 11 percent in the treatment groups. The only two studies that compared ephedrine plus caffeine to prescription weight loss pharmaceutical products reported no differences in effectiveness between products, but these studies were statistically underpowered to detect differences of moderate size. The addition of caffeine to ephedrine is associated with a statistically significant increase in short-term weight loss. 201               One study of ephedra without caffeine-containing herbs reported a statistically significant increase in short-term weight loss that was comparable to the effects reported by four studies of ephedra with caffeine-containing herbs. The data suggest a dose-response relationship with respect to ephedrine and weight loss. All published studies on herbal ephedra and weight loss have used a medium dose of ephedra per day; consequently, no dose-response analysis is possible.     Athletic Performance   There are no studies assessing the effect of herbal ephedracontaining dietary supplements on athletic performance. The few studies that assessed the effect of ephedrine on athletic performance did so only in small samples of mostly fit individuals (young male military recruits) and only on very short-term immediate performance. This model does not reflect the use patterns in the general population. These data support a modest effect of ephedrine plus caffeine on very short-term athletic performance. No studies assessed the effect of the sustained use of ephedrine on performance over time. It is probable that ephedrine alone, without the addition of caffeine, has little or no effect on athletic performance. In the data we reviewed, the smallest dose of ephedrine that produced a measurable effect on athletic performance was 0.8 mg per kg of body weight. However, the effect of smaller doses has not been assessed. Higher doses produced unacceptable gastrointestinal side effects.      Adverse Consequences The data we reviewed on adverse consequences came from both clinical trials and case reports submitted to the FDA. The strongest evidence of causality should come from clinical trials; however, in most circumstances, such trials do not enroll sufficient numbers of patients to adequately assess the possibility of rare outcomes. Such was the case with our review of ephedrine and ephedra-containing dietary supplements. For rare outcomes, we reviewed case reports. However, we could not determine definite causality from case reports. With these considerations in mind, the evidence we identified supports the following conclusions:  There is sufficient evidence from short-term controlled trials to conclude that the use of ephedrine and/or the use of ephedra or ephedrine plus caffeine is associated with two to three times the risk of nausea, vomiting, psychiatric symptoms such as anxiety and 202   change in mood, autonomic hyperactivity, and palpitations. It is not possible to separate out the contribution of caffeine to these events.  There were no reports of serious adverse events in the controlled trials of ephedrine or ephedra, but these studies are insufficient to assess adverse events that occurred at a rate of less than 1.0 per 1000. A large number of adverse event reports regarding herbal ephedracontaining dietary supplements have been filed with FDA. The majority of FDA case reports are insufficiently documented to make an informed judgment about the relationship between the use of ephedra-containing dietary supplements and the adverse event in question. A very large number of adverse events were reported to one manufacturer of ephedracontaining dietary supplements. Nearly all of the case reports were too poorly documented to permit us to make any judgments about the potential relationship between ephedra use and the event. We identified two deaths, three myocardial infarctions, nine cerebrovascular accidents, three seizures, and five psychiatric cases as sentinel events with prior ephedra consumption; and three deaths, two myocardial infarctions, two cerebrovascular accidents, one seizure, and three psychiatric cases as sentinel events with prior ephedrine consumption. Classification as a sentinel event does not imply a proven cause and effect relationship. We identified 43 additional cases as possible sentinel events with prior ephedra consumption and seven additional cases as possible sentinel events with prior ephedrine consumption. About half of the sentinel events occurred in persons aged 30 years or younger. Scientific studies (not additional case reports) are necessary in order to assess the possible association between consumption of ephedra-containing dietary supplements and these serious adverse events. Given the rarity of such events, a properly designed case control study would be the appropriate next step. Such a study would need to control for caffeine consumption.             203
GX037-71-16627718	"U.S. Food and Drug Administration    FDA Consumer magazine    May-June 2001     Table of Contents   Updates   Topics for This Issue:       New Drugs for Glaucoma     FDA Proposes Rule on Gene Therapy, Xenotransplantation     Warning for Women on Blood-Thinner Therapy     Femara Approved as First-Line Breast Cancer Therapy     New Drug Fights Invasive Fungal Infection     Warning for Pregnant Women on HIV Therapy     FDA Publishes Human Cell and Tissue Products Regulation     Weekly Prozac Dosage: Treatment Alternative for Depression     New Schizophrenia Drug     New Drugs for Glaucoma     The Food and Drug Administration has approved two new drugs for the management of glaucoma. Glaucoma is the second leading cause of blindness in the United States and the leading cause of irreversible blindness in the world.     Glaucoma is characterized by an increase in the pressure within the eyeball from a fluid within the eye called the aqueous humor. This increase in eye pressure, if left untreated, damages the optic nerve and leads to blindness.     Lumigan (bimatoprost ophthalmic solution) and Travatan (travoprost ophthalmic solution) are new treatment options for people who cannot tolerate or who have not responded well to other medications that lower eye pressure. In studies of patients with elevated eye pressures, Lumigan and Travatan showed similar effects for lowering intraocular pressure. Both drugs, which are in the form of eye drops, work by increasing the drainage of aqueous humor out of the eye.    ""Glaucoma is a serious eye disease affecting some two million older Americans,"" said Health and Human Services Secretary Tommy G. Thompson. ""Early detection of glaucoma and management of raised eye pressure can usually prevent vision loss. These new drugs provide additional treatment alternatives to preserve vision as well as preserve an individual's quality of life.""    Side effects associated with Lumigan and Travatan may include redness of the eye, gradual darkening of eye color, darkening of eyelid skin, and increased thickness, number, and darkness of eyelashes.    Allergan Inc. of Irvine, Calif., will market Lumigan. Alcon Laboratories Inc. of Fort Worth, Texas, will market Travatan.     FDA Proposes Rule on Gene Therapy, Xenotransplantation      The Food and Drug Administration has proposed new requirements that would give consumers increased access to information on clinical trials involving gene therapy or xenotransplantation. The rule, proposed Jan. 17, would ensure that people participating in clinical trials involving these technologies are fully informed of the risks, as well as the opportunities for curing a disease or reducing its symptoms.    Gene therapy and xenotransplantation have the potential to alleviate suffering and save lives. But they also hold unique risks for individuals who participate in the studies. Gene therapy is an experimental technique that treats disease by replacing defective genes or inserting new ones. Xenotransplantation refers to transplanting tissues or organs from animals into humans.     The FDA is proposing to make available information about side effects, including deaths, seen during clinical trials. But the names of study participants and proprietary commercial information would remain confidential.     The proposed rule also would ensure that FDA policies for public access to information on gene therapy and xenotransplantation studies are compatible with those of other government agencies that oversee these types of research. The 90-day comment period for the rule ended April 17. Comments will be considered in the FDA's development of a final rule.    Warning for Women on Blood-Thinner Therapy    If you take the prescription blood thinner warfarin, you should consult a doctor or pharmacist before using over-the-counter vaginal miconazole products. Miconazole is an antifungal drug found in some creams and suppositories to treat vaginal yeast infections, including Monistat.    The Food and Drug Administration recently issued a warning that bleeding or bruising may occur when warfarin and vaginal miconazole are used together. The agency has received two reports of abnormal blood clotting tests in women who used both drugs. One woman also developed bruises, bleeding gums, and a nosebleed.    The FDA has advised manufacturers of products containing miconazole to add a new warning to product labels and brochures telling consumers about the problem.    Femara Approved as First-Line Breast Cancer Therapy    The Food and Drug Administration has approved a new use for the breast cancer drug Femara (letrozole). Femara had been approved to treat women with advanced breast cancer who had not responded to anti-estrogen drugs. The FDA's latest action approves the drug for use as a first-line treatment for postmenopausal women with advanced, metastatic, or hormone receptor positive or hormone receptor unknown breast cancers. Hormone receptor positive tumors are those that may grow when exposed to estrogen.    Femara was shown to be more effective than tamoxifen in a multinational study of more than 900 postmenopausal women whose locally advanced or metastatic breast cancers were not treatable by surgery or radiation.    Among those in the study, Femara significantly slowed the the time to progression of disease when compared to tamoxifen. With Femara, the median time to disease progression was 9.4 months, compared to 6 months with tamoxifen.    The incidence of side effects for Femara and tamoxifen was similar in the study. Side effects reported most frequently included bone pain, hot flushes, back pain, nausea, joint pain, and labored breathing.    Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corp., East Hanover, N.J., manufactures Femara.    New Drug Fights Invasive Fungal Infection    The Food and Drug Administration has approved Cancidas Intravenous Infusion    (caspofungin acetate), a new antifungal medication for people who cannot tolerate    or who don't respond to standard treatments for infections caused by Aspergillus,    a common type of fungus.    Most healthy people are unaffected by Aspergillus. But those with weakened or abnormal immune systems may develop invasive aspergillosis, a group of potentially serious fungal infections associated with the fungus Aspergillus.    Cancidas is the first approved drug in a new class of anti-fungal agents called echinocandins, which are believed to disrupt the creation of fungal cell walls. A study of 63 patients determined that 41 percent of patients overall had a favorable response to the drug. Forty-seven percent of people who were treated with Cancidas for more than seven days improved. Those who were unresponsive to previous therapies had a favorable response rate of 36 percent, and people who were intolerant of previous therapies had a favorable response rate of 70 percent.    Adverse events reported in people treated with Cancidas include fever, inflammation of a vein (phlebitis/thrombophlebitis), infused vein complications, headache, nausea, vomiting, rash, skin flushing, mild liver function test elevations, and one case of a hypersensitive reaction (anaphylaxis). Cancidas has not been studied as an initial therapy for invasive aspergillosis and it is not recommended for such use. Cancidas also should not be used with the immunosuppressant drug cyclosporine until more information is available on the interaction between the two drugs.    Merck & Co. Inc., Whitehouse Station, NJ, manufactures Cancidas.    Warning for Pregnant Women On HIV Therapy     The Food and Drug Administration and Bristol-Myers Squibb have warned that pregnant women taking the combination of the drugs Zerit (stavudine) and Videx or Videx EC (didanosine) with other antiretroviral agents to treat the virus that causes AIDS (HIV) may be at increased risk for organ damage and fatal lactic acidosis.     Lactic acidosis occurs when the body's cells are unable to convert food into usable energy. Excess acid accumulates, and vital organs such as the liver or pancreas may be damaged. Severe lactic acidosis is an infrequent complication of the class of HIV drugs known as nucleoside analogues.     This new warning follows three reported cases of fatal lactic acidosis, with or without pancreatitis, which occurred in pregnant women taking Videx and Zerit in combination with other HIV drugs. In addition, there have been several nonfatal cases of pancreatitis, with and without lactic acidosis or liver failure, occurring in pregnant women receiving this combination of drugs.     Bristol-Myers Squibb recommends that the combination of Videx and Zerit be prescribed for pregnant women only when the potential benefit clearly outweighs the potential risk. The FDA will strengthen the existing product warnings, indicating that women taking this combination drug therapy should be closely monitored for signs of liver damage and lactic acidosis. This syndrome may develop abruptly.    Health-care providers are encouraged to report any adverse events related    to stavudine and didanosine to Bristol-Meyers Squibb at 1-800-426-7644. Reports    may also be submitted to the FDA by phone (1-800-FDA-1088), by fax (1-800-FDA-0178),    online at  www.fda.gov/medwatch , or by mail to: MedWatch    (HF-2), FDA, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, MD 20857.     FDA Publishes Human Cell and Tissue Products Regulation     Burn victims, children with congenital defects, and people who are sight-impaired    are just some of those who can benefit from donated human cells or tissues.    Surgeons use an array of cell- or tissue-based products to repair or replace    damaged or diseased areas, such as skin, tendons, bone, heart valves, and corneas.   A final regulation published on Jan. 19 will help the Food and Drug Administration    better communicate with and regulate the human cell and tissue industry. The    regulation requires all human cell, tissue, and cellular- and tissue-based product    manufacturers to register and list their products with the FDA within the next    two years. When fully implemented, the regulation will provide, for the first    time, a complete database of tissue banks and other establishments that recover,    process, store, and distribute human cells and tissues.   The new rule covers tissues not previously regulated, including reproductive    tissues and certain hematopoietic (blood-forming) stem cells derived from umbilical    cord blood and other blood sources. Hematopoietic stem cell transplants have    been used to treat a variety of malignant diseases, such as leukemia and solid    organ tumors. The regulation also applies to innovative human tissue uses, such    as the use of manipulated human cells to treat viral infections, Parkinson's    disease and diabetes.   This final rule is part of the FDA's comprehensive regulatory framework to    help ensure the safety and quality of tissue products, including those employing    new technologies. The FDA also has proposed two other rules on the use of human    tissue. One, issued Sept. 30, 1999, focuses on ""donor suitability""--the screening    of donors to prevent transmission of infectious diseases. The second proposed    rule, issued Jan. 8, focuses on ""good tissue practice"" and will help ensure    that tissue-based products are free of communicable diseases and contamination    during manufacturing. Written comments are being accepted on the latter proposed    rule until May 8, 2001. For more information, visit  www.fda.gov/cber/rules.htm.       Weekly Prozac Dosage: Treatment Alternative for Depression      People who require longer-term treatment of depression now have another treatment option. In February, the Food and Drug Administration approved Prozac Weekly (fluoxetine hydrochloride), the first prescription medication given weekly for the longer-term treatment of depression. It is intended for use by people whose symptoms have stabilized and who require continuing treatment.     Fluoxetine is cleared slowly from the body, which allows the drug to work when taken only once a week. In addition, the Prozac Weekly tablets are coated with a substance to help delay release of the drug into the bloodstream.    In a U.S. clinical trial involving 501 depressed people, the rates of relapse for those treated with either Prozac Weekly or a 20 milligram daily dose of Prozac were significantly lower than for those treated with an inactive pill (placebo). Prozac Weekly's most common side effects are similar to those of the daily dose and include nausea, headaches and insomnia. People interested in switching from the daily dose to Prozac Weekly should consult their physician.    According to the National Institute of Mental Health, depressive disorders affect more than 18 million Americans each year. Major depression is the leading cause of disability in the United States and worldwide. Almost twice as many women (12 percent) as men (7 percent) suffer from a depressive disorder each year.     Eli Lilly and Co. in Indianapolis manufactures Prozac Weekly.     New Schizophrenia Drug     People with schizophrenia now have available another drug treatment, although approval of the medication comes with a strong warning about a serious health risk and requires that the manufacturer change the drug's brand name.    The Food and Drug Administration approved Geodon (ziprasidone) to treat schizophrenia, a lifelong mental illness that affects a person's behavior, thinking, and emotions. The product will carry a warning on its labeling about possible heart problems associated with its use. The antipsychotic medication may cause a heart rhythm irregularity, and even death. People with significant heart disease should not use the drug.    Schizophrenia affects about 1 percent of the world's population. Typically, the illness strikes men and women in adolescence or young adulthood. Schizophrenia is chronic, often with multiple relapses and impaired daily functioning. People with schizophrenia may experience hallucinations and delusions.    The drug's manufacturer, Pfizer Inc., of New York, planned to market the medication under the name Zeldox, but the FDA believed it sounded too similar to other medications and had the potential to cause confusion. Pfizer settled on the alternative name Geodon.    The most common side effects reported with the drug, which was approved in February, included sleepiness and abnormal movements. Pfizer has agreed to continue studying the drug's effects on the heart.

GX006-48-10266947	"Evidence On The Safety And Effectiveness Of Ephedra:     Implications For Regulation    Background    More than half of the population of the United States uses ""dietary supplements,""    as the term is defined in the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act (DSHEA)    of 1994.  [Refs. 1, 2 ] Dietary supplements include vitamins,    minerals, amino acids, enzymes, and herbs and other botanicals. Use of most    dietary supplements does not appear to be associated with any serious adverse    health effects, and there is evidence that supplements confer health benefits    in certain cases. For example, it is well recognized that calcium helps to build    strong bones and prevent osteoporosis and that folic acid helps to reduce the    risk of neural tube defects. [ Ref. 3 ]     Certain dietary supplements also include ephedra, a plant that contains six    ephedrine alkaloids among which ephedrine is predominant. The dietary supplement    industry estimates that approximately 12 million individuals were using ephedra    in 1999. [ Ref. 4 ] As the tragic death of Orioles' pitching    prospect Steve Bechler has reminded Americans, ephedra has long posed difficult    issues for clinical investigators, for regulators, and most importantly, for    the health of the public, all of whom are concerned about the safety of ephedra    relative to its potential benefits, if any. These concerns stem from both the    sympathomimetic mechanism of action of ephedrine alkaloids, and accumulating    evidence of potentially serious adverse events after use of ephedra-containing    products.     FDA regulates ephedra under DSHEA, which places the burden of proof on the government if it wishes to take regulatory action against a supplement.  The government must show that the supplement presents a ""significant or unreasonable risk of illness or injury"" under the conditions recommended or suggested in labeling (or under ordinary conditions of use if the labeling is silent).  DSHEA's regulatory framework is primarily a ""postmarket"" program like the bulk of food regulation.   Thus, there is no requirement for manufacturers to provide evidence of product safety prior to marketing ephedra-containing products.  In contrast, drug regulation involves an extensive ""premarket"" evaluation of safety and effectiveness with explicit standards of evidence, providing opportunities for developing evidence to guide not only approval decisions but also conditions of use to manage benefits and risks.  In addition, there are postmarket reporting requirements for drugs, to support product safety monitoring.      Ephedra is a complex substance that has unusual features with respect to these alternative regulatory approaches.  Because it is a botanical, it meets the condition of a dietary supplement regulated under DSHEA.  On the other hand, the principal active alkaloid in ephedra is ephedrine, and synthetic ephedrine and other ephedrine alkaloids are regulated as drugs, which are only marketed for indications where safety and effectiveness have been demonstrated.  Synthetic ephedrine is available as a component of various over-the-counter and some prescription drug products for treating allergies, asthma, nasal congestion, and related upper respiratory symptoms, none of which include caffeine or other stimulants that may interact with its effects.  All synthetic ephedrine drug products are subject to significant regulations in dosing and in manufacturing practices.  There are no synthetic ephedrine products approved for long-term use.    When FDA moved to significantly restrict access to ephedra through a proposed    regulation in 1997, an independent report by the General Accounting Office concluded    that the available evidence did not support the FDA's proposed restrictions    on dosage limits. [ Ref. 5 ] The difficulties that FDA encountered    five years ago in imposing restrictions on the availability of ephedrine alkaloid    containing dietary supplements raise two critical health policy questions. Has    the evidence raising concerns about ephedra's safety become significantly stronger    since that time? Given the latest evidence on benefits and safety, can reasonable    restrictions on ephedra labeling and availability be imposed under DSHEA?    Additional Evidence on Ephedra's Safety and Effectiveness    Shekelle et al.'s review provides the best compilation of evidence yet on the    safety profile of ephedra. [ Ref. 6 ] This thorough review,    including formal meta-analyses to the extent possible, covers the vast majority    of the recent clinical evidence available on the safety and efficacy of ephedra    and ephedrine for its two most popular uses: weight loss and athletic performance    enhancement. With respect to effectiveness, the authors found a modest but relatively    consistent effect of short-term weight loss from ephedrine or ephedra-caffeine    combination products. However, none of these studies included treatment for    more than 4 to 6 months or any follow-up after the product was stopped; there    is therefore no evidence on the critical question whether there is a long-term    weight loss effect that would translate into significant health outcome improvements.    There is also no evidence on whether the known effects of ephedra (increase    in blood pressure and long-term inotropic stimulus) have adverse long-term health    consequences. In addition, it is unclear what dose is needed and whether caffeine    is also required for long-term weight loss. Further, despite the widespread    marketing of ephedra products as performance-enhancers, Shekelle et al. found    no evidence to support the claim for ephedra and very limited evidence for ephedrine.      Shekelle et al.'s analysis also adds significantly to the literature on the safety profiles of ephedra and ephedrine.  The meta-analysis concludes that ephedra and ephedrine, especially in combination with other stimulants, are associated with a higher risk of certain mild to moderate side effects that are plausible given its mechanism of action: palpitations and gastrointestinal, psychiatric, and autonomic symptoms.  However, the meta-analysis only has enough statistical power to conclude that the rate of serious adverse events, including acute myocardial infarction, stroke, and death is very likely to be less than 1 in 1000.  Thus, as has marked the history of inquiries into ephedra's safety, further analysis of safety risks involves case reports - the weakest form of epidemiological evidence since there are no direct ""controls"" for any confounding factors or even for the natural occurrence rate of these serious events.  Shekelle et al.'s thorough review of the available information on adverse effects associated with ephedra or ephedrine, which included in aggregate more than 16,000 case reports, identified ""two deaths, four myocardial infarctions, nine cerebrovascular accidents, one seizure, and five psychiatric cases"" involving ephedra that were ""sentinel events,"" where the available records appeared thorough and no other precipitating factors were evident.  They also identified 10 such ""sentinel events"" involving ephedrine, and an additional 51 [43 for ephedra] where the compound might have been involved but other contributors were also present.    There has been much discussion of whether such events constitute the ""smoking    gun"" for a causal relationship between ephedra and serious adverse events. An    FDA advisory panel argued three years ago that such sentinel events, by themselves,    cannot prove causality. [ Ref. 7 ] Even if the records were    completely accurate and there were no other competing explanations, heart attacks,    hemorrhagic strokes, and sudden deaths occur in young, otherwise healthy persons,    albeit at a very low rate. Given industry estimates of over 3 billion ""servings""    of ephedra sold each year, there is reason to expect some of these serious events    in ephedra users, even if ephedra use did not cause them. However, adverse events    related to dietary supplements are likely to be significantly underreported    [ Ref. 8 ], which would argue for taking reported events    more seriously.     Subsequent to the end date of studies included in the review by Shekelle et    al., additional studies on ephedra safety have been reported.  [Refs.    9, 10, 11, 12 ] For example, Bent, et al. compared the share of reported    serious adverse events for ephedra to the share of ephedra products among all    dietary supplement sales - in effect using other dietary supplements to ""control""    for baseline rates of adverse events in the population. [Ref. 9] Ephedra accounted    for 64% of all serious dietary supplement adverse events, but less than 1% of    all sales. While it is possible that ephedra events are more likely to be reported    because of the public attention devoted to the compound, and that ephedra users    (because of their demographics and behavior, including consumption of other    stimulants) are intrinsically more likely to have serious adverse events than    other dietary supplement users, this is a very disproportionate representation.      The known pharmacologic properties of ephedrine alkaloids, together with these studies, suggest that concerns about serious complications from ephedra use are not unreasonable - especially in cases involving strenuous exercise, concomitant use of other stimulants, and underlying medical conditions that limit cardiovascular capacity or ability to discharge body heat.  However, they do not establish definitive causal evidence of a statistically significant elevated risk of death or serious injury from ephedra.  Nor do the studies firmly establish that ephedra has meaningful health benefits.  The most evidence is available for weight loss, but even there, the demonstrated effect is only short term and is not more substantial than approved drugs for weight loss, whose risk profiles are better understood and which are used with physician guidance.      While additional studies of ephedra's safety and efficacy would clearly be    useful, it is unlikely that any studies that could be conducted or completed,    at least in the near term, would be powerful enough to resolve these safety    questions. Even if a very costly, definitive large randomized clinical trial    could be funded, it might be unethical to carry it out, given the risks suspected    from ephedra and the likelihood that its health benefits are modest at best.    Alternatively, additional valuable evidence might be obtained from a nonrandomized,    prospective case-control study. For example, the Hemorrhagic Stroke Project    was a critical element in the FDA's announcement of its intention to withdraw    PPA from the market. It found a significantly increased stroke risk on the order    of 1 in 100,000 in women (but not men) who took PPA as an appetite suppressant    within a 3-day window. [ Ref. 13 ] An equivalent study    of ephedra would probably have to be done prospectively as well, because there    is no existing population database that has reliably recorded both ephedra use    and patient outcomes; consequently, drug histories would have to be obtained    for patients (or their proxies) after the event occurs. It would take some years    for such a study to accumulate enough cases to have the statistical power to    detect a significant difference in serious adverse events.     However, some additional evidence related to ephedra safety comes from another source:  the more restricted availability of synthetic ephedrine in products regulated as drugs, available in low doses and with specific labeling for short-term indications and mandatory warnings, has not been associated with the same magnitude of reported adverse events as ephedra.  It seems plausible that a regulatory approach akin to that used for synthetic ephedrine would have a reasonable likelihood of avoiding some of the serious adverse effects that have been reported with ephedra use.  Similar restrictions on marketing and access - which could be tightened or loosened depending on further scientific evidence - could provide an effective deterrent to some current practices that appear to exacerbate ephedra's potential risks.    Further Regulatory Actions on Ephedra    On February 28, 2003, the Department of Health and Human Services announced a number of actions to address concerns about ephedra's safety.  First, warning letters were sent to dozens of ephedra manufacturers challenging them to remove unproven claims or substantiate those claims, with a particular focus on athletic performance enhancement claims.  Given the limited evidence on ephedra's benefits, FDA and the Federal Trade Commission are assessing whether further enforcement actions are warranted against other manufacturers.  Second, a new, mandatory warning label for all marketed ephedra products was proposed.  It would make it clear to users, via a black-box warning on the front of the product, as well as additional information in the product labeling, that serious adverse events and death have been reported after using ephedra, and that risks of adverse events are particularly high with strenuous exercise and/or use of stimulants including caffeine.  Third, FDA announced that it was seeking comments from health professionals, the supplement industry, and the general public on any additional data on ephedra's safety, so that we can acquire the most complete picture possible of the product's potential risks.    Our Federal Register announcement was also intended to support comments on whether evidence of significant safety concerns, short of a definitive demonstration of a risk profile, is sufficient for new restrictions on products regulated under DSHEA.  DSHEA established that a dietary supplement may not be sold if it ""presents a significant or unreasonable risk of injury.""  We do not have definitive evidence that ephedra has caused serious injuries and deaths.  Instead, ""sentinel"" events have been identified along with various types of additional suggestive evidence, including ephedra's known blood pressure and inotropic effects as well as an increasing number of cleverly designed observational studies.  As noted above, such suggestive rather than definitive evidence seems to be all that is likely to emerge for dietary supplements with potential safety problems regulated under DSHEA.  Although some may believe that the unreasonable risk standard requires FDA to prove definitively that a product presents a defined hazard if used as indicated by the manufacturer, there is another way to understand that requirement.  ""Unreasonable risk"" clearly implies a risk-benefit calculus.  Such a calculus should be able to examine the available scientific evidence and take it into account in assessing whether the product's known or suspected risks outweigh its known or suspected benefits, in light of the claims the product makes or under ordinary conditions of use.    Such a reading helps give DSHEA the meaning in practice that many of its supporters say it should have, by clarifying that public health authorities can take actions to protect the public from unreasonable but uncertain safety risks associated with ephedra.   We intend to establish an up-to-date public record for further, legally sustainable regulatory actions based on the latest scientific evidence and statutory analysis, by analyzing public comments on this approach quickly.  Alternatively, if DSHEA alone is not adequate, we have also asked for comments on possible legislative modifications to DSHEA to achieve this public health goal.    Finally, expanded research on the safety and effectiveness of dietary supplements is needed, particularly for certain botanicals.  In recent years, the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine and the Office of Dietary Supplements (components of NIH) have substantially expanded funding for studies of commonly used supplements.  Such efforts would be significantly enhanced by clear standards for the labeling and production of all dietary supplements, which the FDA is committed to implementing soon.  The resulting research could provide a foundation for science-based health claims by certain supplements, or, in cases where effects can be disproved, help eliminate public misunderstandings about the purported benefits of a supplement.

Example: Efficacy and Safety of Ephedra for Weight Management and Athletic Performance Enhancement. Since the stated overall objective is ""to assess he efficacy of We think this is more appropriate for the herbal ephedra and synthetic ephedrine on weight loss and text, and the title reflects the uses for athletic performance ......"" and since there is stated too few which we attempted to find evidence. studies and data available to conduct an analysis of herbal ephedra on athletic performance, should not the title of the study be altered or the reported at least noted to reflect this limitation? I think you did an excellent job. Having reviewed this subject No Response in more superficial fashion in the past, I can appreciate, more than most, what fine job you have done. The overall purpose of the evaluation, including the questions, methods, findings and conclusions are clearly and succinctly written and easy to understand. No Response  The search for relevant data appears to have been thorough No Response and encompassed a broad range of literature resources. The study selection appears to be appropriate for an evidence-based review of this type. No Response  Data collection and data synthesis appear to be reasonable. No Response This is an excellent comprehensive review, and it will make an important contribution to the literature. Strong points are a clear description of review criteria, rigorous assessment methods, and straightforward data presentation. The questions formulated are relevant and appropriate, search strategies seem reasonable, and study selection is well justified. The meta-analyses are useful. The Evidence Report utilizes modern methods of metaanalysis of clinical trials. However, it ignores a great deal of scientific evidence that can augment the interpretation of data from the clinical trials and has a major structural flaw and several weaknesses that are discussed below. In my area of expertise (clinical studies of obesity), the findings were consistent with my understanding of the literature. No Response  No Response. A specific response to the ""great deal of scientific evidence ignored"" is presented where such evidence is specifically referred to. No Response  The overall evaluation is clear, and the purpose of the report No Response is well stated. Overall I found the report well-researched and written. The questions were adequately formulated and easily understood. No Response No Response  A3-1   Appendix 3. Reviewer Comments (continued) Reviewer Comment Reasons for inclusion or exclusion of studies were clear. In evaluating the obesity weight loss clinical studies, the report acknowledges some of the problems [small numbers of subjects, short durations of treatment, etc.] and states that long-term assessments of effectiveness are lacking. It would be useful to put these statements in the context of current knowledge in this area: that weight loss generally ceases after about 6 months irrespective of the treatment and any weight lost is generally regained. Current recommendations for appropriate clinical trials in this area include a much longer duration of treatment [1  2 years] and an evaluation of what happens after the agent is withdrawn . Both of these are very important in evaluating the efficacy and the risk to benefit ratio of a particular substance. Although ephedrine plus caffeine combinations [pharmaceutical and dietary supplement sources] are being compared to certain prescription drugs, to date no ephedrine plus caffeine product has undergone the equivalent types of efficacy and safety studies that are required prior to marketing of a prescription drug in the US. The purpose of the study and the means for arriving at its conclusions were clear and relatively easy to follow. The Meta analysis approach was appropriate and the criteria well defined. I believe some discussion should be given to the purported mechanisms of action (i.e. anoretic versus thermogenic) behind the "" statistically significant ""weight loss attributed to synthetic ephedrine/caffeine/ or ephedracontaining dietary supplements. The impression given by the meta analysis results is that, while statistically significant, these types of products also provide clinically relevant weight reductions. Given the results of the case report analyses, I don't believe the benefit of minimal weight loss (e.g. 1 to 3 pounds per month) outweighs the potential risk of serious adverse health effects exemplified by the case report analysis. Despite the study's inability to assign causality to most, if not all, of the serious adverse events, the authors, in their conclusion, seem to downplay the ""potential"" risks associated with these products. The appraisal of ephedra studies for weight loss could include a stronger statement about the unusually high attrition rates as compared to many drug studies. Although this is mentioned in the Limitations section, it also might be included in the results section where the data is interpreted. Can you expand on whether attrition rates differed between treatments a placebo groups? In my view, this is a major weakness of the recent efficacy studies involving ephedra. Rand Response No Response This information was added to the limitations.  This communicates a value judgment about the balance of evidence that is beyond the scope of the EPC. The concern about the report ""downplaying"" the potential risks is, as later peer review comments will indicate, shared by some other reviewers, but directly contradicted by others.  Attrition rates did not differ between treatment and placebo groups. This has now been added to the results.  It is stated under Findings [p4] and elsewhere ""that in Change Made aggregate the clinical trials only enrolled a sufficient number of patients to detect a serious adverse event rate of one per one thousand"" or ""three per thousand "" in the case of  A3-2   Appendix 3. Reviewer Comments (continued) Reviewer Comment botanical sources of ephedrine It would be useful to put these numbers in the context of the frequencies of adverse events [common, infrequent, rare, etc.] Using commonly accepted definitions , all of the current clinical trials in aggregate, irrespective of source, lack the power to detect any rare adverse event [defined as greater than 1 per 1000 rate or frequency]. Throughout the report, reference is made to ""synthetic ephedrine"". I suggest deleting ""synthetic"", since ephedrine is ephedrine. Some is extracted from plants and some is synthesized. The term ""synthetic ephedrine"" is ambiguous due to the meaning of the terms ""natural"" and ""synthetic"" with respect to natural products chemistry. What could be meant are synthetically derived ephedrine alkaloids because these are natural products by virtue of their existence as naturally occurring compounds regardless of how they are produced. Ephedrine is by definition always a natural product unless one is referring to the racemate that is produced during some synthetic production processes because the specific optical isomer that is identical to naturally occurring ephedrine is itself is itself often synthesized through chiral specific processes. The fact of the matter is that what the draft means when referring to ""synthetic ephedrine"" could be either naturally or synthetically derived. It may be preferable then, in the interest of clarity throughout the document, to use some consistent terminology, such as: ""ephedra"" as the name of the crude raw material (with parenthetical identification of the pinyin name: ma huang one time, but not as a substitute common name) which consist of the dried stem of the plant; ""ephedra extract"" when referring to raw materials or ingredients that are processed extracts of ephedra; ""ephedrine "" when referring specifically to those one alkaloids as found in the plant or wherever the term ""synthetic ephedrine"" now occurs in the draft. I would place ""synthetic"" in front of all mention of ephedrine, or ephedrine alkaloids; for policy experts and others it is important to make the distinction between herbal and synthetic. I would use ""herbal"" ephedra when possible. I would also state more directly and more often why the synthetic ephedrine use is not reviewed as part of the AERs. Also, contrary to the phytochemical section of the report, ephedra is know to contain (-)-norephedrine but not (+)norephedrine. Phenylpropanolamine consists of (-/+)norephedrine, while ephedra does not contain (+)norephedrine. The parenthetical identification of norephedrine as phenylpropanolamine should therefore be removed. Change made As these contradictory comments indicate, there is no agreement among experts about standardized terminology. In this report, for simplicity's sake, we use the term ""ephedra"" to mean the herb or herb abstract, and ""ephedrine"" to mean the chemical, regardless of source. Rand Response  A3-3   Appendix 3. Reviewer Comments (continued) Reviewer Comment A minor point in phytochemistry (page 13) is that only (-)norephedrine occurs naturally in ephedra, whereas the synthetic drug, phelypropanolamine is the racemic mixture of (+/-) -norephedrine. So, it is more precise to state that ephedra contains norephedrine, as opposed to containing PPA. After reading the RAND report, my first impression is the following: What are we evaluating  ephedrine or herb ephedra? The latter is not a single-chemical entity and cannot be assumed to be ephedrine. Even assuming the herb ephedra in the literature is defined to contain specific dosage levels of `ephedrine,' what efforts were made to ascertain that this `ephedrine' is indeed ephedrine and not a mixture of ephedrine-type alkaloids, or, worse, different types of alkaloids that are also present in ephedra? Any study or report on a natural product (not just a singlechemical compound) must clearly define what the material under study or being reported is. I don't see such a definition in this report. Despite the limited availability of useful data, this report's conclusions regarding the efficacy of ephedrine (the single-chemical drug), in the presence and the absence of caffeine, in short-term weight loss and athletic performance, appears to be sound. However, this cannot be said of the herb ephedra that contains ephedrine but is not equivalent to ephedrine. Hence, the conclusion regarding ephedra's efficacy ""Ephedrine, ephedrine + caffeine, and ephedra-containing dietary supplements + herbs containing caffeine all promote modest amounts of weight loss over the short term..."" lacks supporting data, unless all the limited number of clinical studies employing ""ephedra-containing dietary supplements"" had clearly defined ephedra, including amounts of ephedrine and related alkaloids (not just ephedrine and inert herb carrier). The ODS and AHRQ contracted with RAND (Dr. Paul Shekelle as Task Director) to conduct a thorough synthesis of the clinical efficacy and adverse effects of ephedra. It was clear to me that the objective of this contract was met. The review was complete and the researchers used the systematic review/meta-analysis tool to review the published controlled clinical studies on ephedra-containing dietary supplements. There was a mention of 157 articles that were case reports of adverse events published in medical journal, however, they are not included in the case report and there are no mention of the finding in the Limitation section on page 110. Would those case reports provide more information than what are available from FDA? Should a statement be made on why those published case reports not included in the analysis (e g potential duplication with FDA time and We agree that the lack of specificity is a problem. We have modified the conclusions to be more specific to only these herbal combinations studied. In the RCTs of herbal ephedra included in the efficacy analysis, the dose of ephedrine alkaloid was stated. Rand Response  No Response  These case reports are now included in this revision.  A3-4   Appendix 3. Reviewer Comments (continued) Reviewer Comment resources...etc.)? The report has been carried out and is free from bias. It is objective. I cannot comment on some areas of the report that are not my expertise. The draft report is incomplete since it does not include a review of studies of two types: Toxicology in laboratory animals, and published case reports. No response Rand Response  Published case reports are now included. Toxicology and animal studies were not included, as this (and most all EPC reports) focus on clinical studies in humans. We disagree that the report is slanted against the safety of ephedra products, and note the peer review comments we received with exactly the opposite opinion (i.e. that we were too conservative in our conclusions regarding possible adverse events from ephedra). We have endeavored to keep the language of the report as factual as possible. We note that other reviewers criticized the report for exactly the opposite reason  being ""too soft"" and ""down playing"" the risks of ephedra use. We do not think we can revise the report to reconcile these two divergent opinions. With regard to format, this report adheres to EPC format requirements. With regards to phenylpropanolamine, we note other reviewers critiqued us for not making more of possible similarities. In this case, we deleted the phenylpropanolamine sentence.  This draft emphasizes the subjective judgments of the authors over the objective findings of the clinical studies and therefore appears from the outset to have a slant against the safety of ephedra products.  Given the observations and comments above, one is left with the impression that this draft report has a tone or tenor that leans toward an apparently preconceived conclusion that ephedra supplements are not safe. The tone is established in the abstract by reference to the FDA's AERs ""related to herbal ephedra"" and ""available reports of herbal ephedra-related death, myocardial infarction (heart attack) and cerebral vascular accident (stroke)."" the abstract goes on to describe ""our causality algorithm"" and later to use terms ""probably causally related"" and ""possibly casually related"". Nowhere in the abstract is it suggested that these purported AERs were looked at objectively and found (to quote page 112) that ""definite causality cannot be determined from case reports"". The statements in the abstract strike the reader as definite scientific conclusions rather than subjective observations that is not consistent with other objective data. Nowhere in the abstract are the major limitations described, nor is there any mention that ""scientific studies (not additional case reports) are necessary"" (from page 113). On page 5 it is stated that ""Continued analysis of case studies cannot substitute for a properly designed study to assess causality"", yet this is precisely what this draft report has done. Additional statements and references point to a lack of objectivity and a bent toward sensationalism. For example, page 5 a comparison is drawn with phenylpropanolamine and it's ""reported association and cerebral hemorrhage"" without nothing that the report at issues is highly controversial, or that the report found no association between ephedrine as an over-the-counter drug. The mention of cerebral hemorrhage at the conclusion of the abstract is presumably also a result of some unfounded  A3-5   Appendix 3. Reviewer Comments (continued) Reviewer Comment conclusion that phenylpropanolamine have been conclusively tied to cerebral hemorrhage when this is not the case. In counterpoint to a description of the extent of present use and to the long history of use in China, references are made to media attention, lawsuits, a citizens' petition, and a ban by the National Football League, and a Canadian Warning. These references are not helpful in a scientific review that should be evidence based, but instead give an impression of the slant toward a view that ephedra products are not safe. Although the draft report contains much factual information about both the benefits and risks of ephedra, ephedrine, and combinations of one or the other with caffeine sources, certain critical components of a full analysis are missing. Specifically, there is much proper emphasis on examining the data for evidence of causality, but little or no attention to the dose-response relationship within any possible causal case. This is a critical limitation that prevents the safety component of the report from being fully useful. The strength of this report is that it is not only comprehensive, but also objectively performed. Another strength of this report is defining the areas that need further research. The limitations are those imposed by the data. It is clear what was done. The major strength of study was the statistical approach utilized for assessment of efficacy and the incidence of minor adverse effects. The major limitation was the coupling of conservative causality assessment criteria with limited medical records and toxicology data while interpreting the case reports. While the case reports do not offer mechanism for assessing the incidence of serious adverse events, they shouldn't be dismissed completely owing to an overly conservative set of exclusion criteria. Case control studies are definitely warranted, but it would be especially tragic if their outcome, when determined three of four years from now, confirm what is strongly suspected at the moment. A dose response analysis has been added to the RCT analysis. We indicate that we do not feel such an analysis is justified on the case report data. Rand Response  No response  No response No response  We acknowledge our criteria are conservative. We note the great deal of discussion among peer reviewers regarding whether a case report analysis was biased toward or against the safety of these products.  There are some nomenclature issues in the draft that should We have endeavored to keep the be corrected or clarified. The term ""herbal ephedra"" nomenclature clear. contains a redundancy, as by definition, all ephedra is herbal or herbally derived. Also, and this goes beyond nomenclature to ingredient definition, the term ephedra is often used in the draft when in fact what is being discussed is an extract of ephedra with a specified percentage of ephedrine alkaloids. This sort of misrepresentation of material identity leads to confusion between ephedra as a crude botanical, an extract of ephedra (the form most often used in dietary supplements) with a specified percentage of constituent ephedrine alkaloids (usually 8%) and the  A3-6   Appendix 3. Reviewer Comments (continued) Reviewer Comment ephedrine alkaloids themselves. Perhaps it could be made clearer that, overall, a very small number of people have been studied in controlled trials of any duration. This is an issue as regards to safety, rather than efficacy where the studies, though small, are quite consistent. This review reflects my perspective as a neurologist and stroke researcher. It is a very valuable collection of data assembled to address clear, relevant clinical questions. It was clear how the report was developed. The major strength of this report is its collection of data systematically on one report for review and assessment. The major limitation is the way in which the conclusion are stated and failure to distinguish for the lay reader the difference in strength of evidence of adverse reports vs. intervention studies. We emphasize the limited power of the RCTs to assess safety. Rand Response  No response  No response No response We have tried to make this distinction clearer in this revision.  This well-done report takes a conservative approach without No response, other than causality has extrapolating the interpretation beyond the available data .

The text under Future Research describing identification of gaps in knowledge is particularly useful. The presentation of the analysis of adverse events reports (AERs) might be made clearer by using different terminology or a narrative explanation of the causality designations. We agree this outcome is important. Quality of Life. As I view the field of obesity, there are two However, we did not find it reported in the reasons people want to lose weight. One is for the healthclinical trials we identified. related benefits. For most physicians, of whom I am one, this is often the major focus of our support for efforts to lose weight. However, over the years, I have come to realize that the major reason people want to lose weight is because obesity is a ""stigmatized"" condition. The fact that 75% or so of the people volunteering for treatment are women, and that obesity carries such a negative social view stimulates people, particularly women, to use over-the-counter medications. Yet there is no mention that I can find of quality of life in this report. Body Composition. One of the interesting responses to treatment with ephedrine and caffeine in the reports of Astrup and his colleagues is the increase in lean body mass, or loss of less lean body mass. The implications of this for use of these medications and in the future research is not even mentioned that I can find. This distinction is not one that was included as an outcome of interest by our TEP. We agree it is a potential area for future study.  Performance. There is quite a literature on caffeine and We were not requested to assess the performance that certainly plays into the ephedra/caffeine literature on caffeine and performance. use by athletes. Yet none of this literature is dealt with here.  A3-7   Appendix 3. Reviewer Comments (continued) Reviewer Comment Drop Outs. The issue of drop-outs is considered with the <20% vs. >20%. From a therapeutic effect, the ""completers"" in a trial are much more informative to me than using the data on those who drop-out in a last observation carried forward analysis. We are certain that drop-outs are likely to regain weight - We aren't curing obesity and weight gain during the adult life is the ""expected"". Moreover, if we do not use the LOCF approach, the impact depends strongly on when people drop out. If they drop-out at month 5 of a 6 month trial it has essentially no effect. If they drop out in the first month it has a major effect. On page 3 there is mention that the studies have ""particularly high attrition rates."" What is considered a high attrition rate? How do these studies compare to other studies on obesity? There is no explanation as to whether there is a particular challenge in all obesity studies or research in general, or whether this attrition rate appears to be unique to the ephedra studies. Long-Term Trials. In the Future Research area you call for ""longer"" term trials. For all reported drugs the maximal weight loss is achieved by 6 months. Continuing treatment usually maintains an effect, but because weight losses of 10% (20 lbs for someone weighing 200 lbs) does not often get them to a satisfactory weight, people drop-out because of perceived ""failure"" of the medication. I thus have limited enthusiasm for long term studies with agents that don't produce weight losses of more than 10%. On p. 4 you indicate that there are ""no long term"" studies. As noted above, I think the 6 month studies that reach a plateau tell us about all we can expect from these trials. Do you disagree? The report should be reorganized to focus on the conclusions about the need for further research. The section on safety should address expected effects at intended doses and comment on adverse effects of higher doses. The transient nature of the events observed in the clinical studies should be discussed. The FDA AER database unfortunately is not of sufficient quality to comment on either of these issues related to safety. Rand Response We agree that knowing when dropouts occurred might make it possible to better understand the results of weight loss trials. However, when dropouts leave a study is not routinely reported and hence we did not have access to these data.  The attrition rate issue is explained in more detail on page 27, where 20% is identified as a threshold. A high attrition rate is not unique to studies of ephedra, but regardless of study question a high attrition rate increases the concern regarding bias. We clarified this to indicate both longer duration of treatment and maintenance of weight loss.  We do not know if the events observed in the clinical studies were all transient and would not characterize them as so. A dose analysis is now included in this revision.  There should be another draft report issued to the TEP to This is not EPC practice, and there is no ensure that these issues are addressed to the satisfaction of requirement that the TEP be ""satisfied"" the TEP before a report is finalized. before the report is finalized. We intentionally recruit TEP members holding differing views in order to be made aware of all viewpoints. Trying to get all such people to be ""satisfied"" with the final report is an impossibility as demonstrated by the wildly diverging comments we received from TEP members regarding the causality analysis.  A3-8   Appendix 3. Reviewer Comments (continued) Reviewer Comment Rand Response Para 1 I would use the word treatment duration, intervention Change Made length, or other terms designating the duration for which the participants were on ephedra/ephedrine instead of using ""follow up"". I would not use follow-up as it denotes a passive time post-intervention for which participants were followed to measure outcomes. e.g. 19 were excluded from pooled analysis because their intervention periods were less than 8 weeks. The term ""follow-up"" can have a number of meanings in the context of obesity/weight loss trials. In addition to referring to the duration of treatment with a test agent during which a research subject is evaluated, it can also refer to patient evaluation after treatment has been discontinued. From my reading of this report, you are using ""follow-up"" to only refer to the time during which treatment is administered. It might be useful to clarify this in the text as 8 weeks of treatment, etc so as to avoid any confusion in meaning. I was slightly troubled by the exclusion of studies with less than eight weeks' follow-up. While I agree that studies with less than eight weeks' follow-up are undesirable, if a large number of such studies exist, it does seem unfortunate to exclude them. I would rather have seen them included and have separate analyses for a very short-term weight loss and slightly longer term weight loss. I think that the exclusion of such studies, if there are many, opens up the report to allegations from companies who have done such short term studies that their important data were not included and that the report is biased. I am not stating that I believe the report is biased, but only by any exclusion of such studies if there are many, opens up the report to this allegation. Moreover, while as I said previously, I do not favor studies less than eight weeks' duration, I still think that while such studies exist there is something we can learn from them. Page 2, para 4: It would be useful to give the reason that the Technical Expert Panel (TEP) gave for suggesting that follow-up of less than 8 weeks is insufficient to assess weight loss. It is because the original charge was to assess long-term weight loss and the TEP thought 8 weeks could not be considered long-term? Follow-up of 8 weeks. This term used on p. 2 and then many other places is confusing. As a clinical investigator, follow-up usually means the time after treatment is complete. You appear to be using it only for the treatment period. It would confuse me less if you said ""duration of treatment"". This review excluded 19-controlled trials that assessed ephedra or ephedrine for weight loss because there was follow up of less than 8 weeks in each of these This Change Made  The exclusion of studies less than 8 weeks duration was made by the TEP and not something we can change at this stage. The key question specified ""a sustained period of time"" for efficacy and this was judged by the TEP to be at least 8 weeks.  Yes, and furthermore even short term weight loss would not be useful below 8 weeks. Explanation made in the Methods.  Change Made  These studies were included in the safety assessment.  A3-9   Appendix 3. Reviewer Comments (continued) Reviewer Comment exclusion is rational from the perspective of evaluating the evidence for efficacy. Information obtained from these trials about short term adverse effects, or the lack thereof, would be valuable however in the overall evaluation of safety. We strongly encourage the inclusion of all such data from these trials. The statement, ""In order to improve health outcomes, long term weight loss is necessary"" is not accurate. Usually in pharmacotheraphy for weight loss, long-term means one year or more. I am not aware of studies that have used time in place of percent body weight loss as the important measure. Because your point is that the studies were short (<=4 months) I would change loss to maintenance because Yanovski et al. (2002) states that most nonsurgical obesity treatments lead to weight loss for the first four to six months followed by regain. It is not only that the ephedra interventions did not extend beyond 4 months but also that there was not sufficient follow-up to determine if individuals were able to maintain their loss.

Reviewer Comments (continued) Reviewer Comment algorithm unique to this study, or is there already significant scientific agreement to its accuracy and validity? If it is a new algorithm, who suggested its use? How was ""reasonable certainty"" determined? The Draft identifies question that guided this Report, both in relation to weight loss and energy enhancement, as ""Does ephedra have additive effects with other agents?"" Specific emphasis was placed on caffeine and caffeine-containing botanicals, but in Table 1 herbal ""agents"" were listed as ""Herbs commonly combined with ephedra,"" presumably (though not stated) in products marketed for weight loss. It is stated that ""the majority of ephedrine (up to 97%) is excreted unchanged by the urine."" The 97% seems too high. The recent paper by Christine Haller et al (Clin Pharmacol Therap 2002;71:421-32) indicates that about 60% of ephedrine is excreted unchanged in the urine. This is important because the other 40% can be metabolized to other pharmacologically active alkaloids. Change Made Rand Response  Change made  In places, particularly the introduction , the report focuses We present the results stratified by agent. more on ephedrine than ephedra. Since there were only 5 The efficacy results for ephedrine & trials assessing ephedra for weight loss (actually 4, since ephedra were similar. one is reported twice) and many more synthetic ephedrine, the ephedrine trials would seem to have greater weight than the ephedra trials. Not clear how this influences the results. There are several problems with Table 1. No references We greatly shortened this Table to include were given to inform as to how the herbs included in this just the caffeine-containing herbs, as Table were identified as ""commonly combined with ephedra"" suggested by this reviewer. and in fact it is our belief that several of the listed herbs are either uncommonly found in products containing ephedra and marketed for weight loss or are not found in the market. For example, although the aloe resin is known to be a cathartic laxative, we are not aware that it exists as an ingredient in any ephedra product (or in any dietary supplement product), and if it does it is certainly not common. Without attempting to be exhaustive, the same is true for at least the following: cocoas, coffee, scotch broom, jalap bark, and mayapple root. In addition, several of the ingredients are at best questionable for the described categories, and follow-up should be undertaken to find references to support that yellow dock root is a cathartic laxatives. These examples are again not exhaustive; references should be given to support each herb in its classification. An additional oversight is that some listings do provide the part of the plant that is purportedly a commonly combined with ephedra, though very nearly 50% do not. The federal law requires that botanical ingredients in dietary supplements identify the plant part and this Table should do the same.  A3-11   Appendix 3. Reviewer Comments (continued) Reviewer Comment Finally, the Table does not appear to provide any information that is useful toward answering any of the questions proposed by the funding agencies or those that guided the Report. While the question of the additive effect of other agents was proposed and reportedly guided the report, there is no attempt in the Report to actually do this, except in the case of caffeine containing herbs. In summary, it might be best to eliminate the Table to reduce it to consist of just the caffeine containing herbs. If the table is maintained, some effort should be made to actually find each of the listed ingredients in one or more products in the market. This is especially true for hers with significant toxicity potential, such as Scotch broom to mayapple as the final report should not communicate that these ingredients are ""commonly"" sold. Preferably, such market information would be provided in the form of references. The part of the plant that is used should be including for any plant listed in this Table. References should be provided as to how classifications are made if the categories in the Table are maintained. Notwithstanding the above comments the question whether all of these herbs should be included in the Table, there are several spelling errors in the botanical names: Coffea is correct, as in the 1st such listing but Caffea is not; Camellia is correct as in the 2nd such listing, but Camilla is not; the correct spelling of the species name for Mate is paraguariensis; the references species of mayapple is P. peltatum while Rheum palatum us correctly recorded as rhubarb, R tanguticum (misspelled in the Table) is considered to be a variety of R. palmatum (so R. palmatum var.tanguticum) and R. officinale is misspelled in the Table; the correct spelling of the botanical name for flax ends in ""m"" rather than ""n"" (so Linum usitatissium);Irish moss is in the genus Chondrus, not Chrondrus; contemporary authorities accept the name of the slippery elm to be Ulmus rubra rather than Ulmus fulva, these corrections may not be exhaustive.

It should either be removed -It has nothing to do with the assignment-or expanded, to include other elements of the law. For example:"" The DSHEA was passed unanimously in 1994 based in part of Congressional displeasure with the federal governments 'adhoc, patchwork regulatory policy on dietary supplements.' Under these regulations, herbal dietary supplements are not necessarily required to be tested for safety prior to marketing, although marketers are required to assure all of their products are free of significant or unreasonable risks. Also, as with overthe-counter drugs, there is not a requirement to report health problems that resulted from their use. The federal regulations that govern this class of goods are different from this that control either foods or drugs, but as with both of these classes, FDA and FTC maintain significant authority to regulate the manufacture, labeling and claims for dietary supplements and to remove unsafe products.""  A3-13   Appendix 3. Reviewer Comments (continued) Reviewer Comment The Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994 (DSHEA) The brief mention of Public Law 103-417 is inadequate. In 1994, Congress passed the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act (DSHEA) amending the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. In DSHEA, the term ""dietary supplement"" is defined as: 1. A product other than tobacco intended to supplement the diet that bears or contains one or more of the following dietary ingredients: * a vitamin; * a mineral; * an herb or other botanical; * an amino acid; * a dietary substance for use by man to supplement the diet by increasing the total dietary intake; or * a concentrate, metabolite, constituent, extract, or combination of the above listed dietary ingredients. 2. A product that is intended for ingestion is not represented as food or as a sole item of a meal or diet, and is labeled as a dietary supplement. 3. It includes an article that is approved as a new drug, or licensed as a biologic, and was, prior to such approval, certification, or license, marketed as a dietary supplement or as a food unless the Secretary has issued a regulation, after notice and comment, finding that the article, when used as or in a dietary supplement under the conditions of use and dosages set forth in the labeling for such dietary supplement, is unlawful. 4. It excludes articles that are approved as a new drug, certified as an antibiotic, or licensed as a biologic, or an article authorized for investigation as a new drug, antibiotic, or biological for which substantial clinical investigations have been instituted and for which the existence of such investigations has been made public, which was not before such approval, certification, licensing, or authorization marketed as a dietary supplement or as a food, unless the Secretary, in the Secretary's discretion, has issued a regulation, after notice and comment, finding that the article would be lawfully marketed as a dietary supplement. 5. It deems a dietary supplement to be a food. 6. It excludes a dietary supplement from the definition of the term ""food additive."" Important safety measures were included in DSHEA. A food could be deemed to be adulterated if it was a dietary supplement or contained a dietary ingredient that: 1. presents a significant or unreasonable risk of injury; 2. is a new dietary ingredient for which there is inadequate information to provide assurance that such ingredient does not present such risk; 3. poses an imminent hazard to public health or safety; or 4. contains an ingredient that renders it adulterated. Important clarifications were included in the law regarding labels and labeling. Section 5 of DSHEA provides that a publication shall not be defined as labeling when used in connection with the sale of dietary supplements when it: 1. is not false or misleading; 2. does not promote a particular manufacturer or brand of supplement; 3. is displayed so as to present a balanced view of the available scientific information; 4. is displayed physically separate from such supplements; and 5. does not have appended to it any information by sticker or other method. 6. places the A3-14 burden of proof on the United States in establishing that such matter is false or misleading. Additionally DSHEA: 1. Set forth conditions under which nutritional claims may be made with respect to such supplements. 2. Deemed a dietary supplement misbranded unless its labeling meets specified guidelines. 3. Deemed a dietary supplement which Rand Response   Appendix 3. Reviewer Comments (continued) Reviewer Comment The draft sites in it's Chapter 1 the findings of a 1996 meeting of the FDA's Food Advisory Committee (FAC), stating that ""over half of the members recommended removal of dietary supplements containing ephedra on the market"" and gives as it's reference Dr. Lori Love's testimony in August 2000 at another meeting. To assure that the findings of this meeting are most accurately reported it would be best to add a statement such as ""a finding that was in direct contravention to the recommendation of the Special Working Group of experts that had been empanelled to offer guidance to the FAC. ""The transcript of the 1995 meeting of this Special Working Group can be seen at http://www.cfsan.fda.gov/~dms/dsephe1.html . The more important factor with regard to this statement, however, is that it is false. The transcript of this meeting is available on the FDA's website in two PDF files (see http://www.fda.gov/ohrms/dockets/ac/cfsan96.htm). Regardless of how Dr. Love characterized the recommendations of the FAC members, the record shows that only 4 of the eleven voting members of the FAC stated that ephedra products should be removed; even when calculating the opinions of all the meeting's participants, well under half made statements to that effect. The statement in the Draft could be corrected either by changing ""over half of"" to ""a minority of"" or by reversing the two sentences (At this time over half of the members recommended that the FDA develop rules on use that would help reduce risk over adverse events, a recommendation that trade groups had made two years earlier"". Finally, the use of the word ""Thus"", at the beginning of the next sentence in this section implies a direct relationship between the reported advice of the FAC and FDA's imposed rule. This is a reinvention of the historical facts. FDA stated in its proposal was based on information that included, but was not limited to the opinions of the FAC. More detail should be added to this section if the report is to be an accurate record of facts. If the only limitation accessible about the history of the controversy regarding the use of ephedra in dietary supplements was from the Background in the Draft's Chapter 1, one would conclude that federal health officials, consumer groups and National Football league had been actively attentive to this issue while industry stood by. This is not the case. The Background information should be expanded to include some or all of the facts: that AHPA adopted labeling guidelines in 1994 that were substantially familiar to those later proposed by FDA; AHPA adopted dosage limits (25mg/servind; 100mg/day of ephedra alkaloids) in 1995; AHPA and others specifically requested in public hearings in 1995 and 1996, and in a meeting with FDA in 1999 that the industry policies be adopted by rulemaking; AHPA and others submitted a Citizen petition in October 2000 (prior to the Public Citizen petition identified in A3-15 the background) to make the same request in a more formal manner. Rand Response   Appendix 3. Reviewer Comments (continued) Reviewer Comment Many scientists would disagree with the statement [page 4, and elsewhere] that ""definite causality cannot be determined for case reports when the adverse event is very serious"" [or various iterations of this statement] p.9 Background states ""Three billion servings of ephedra containing products were consumed during 1999"" This is a misstatement , as in the transcript Mr. McGuffin indicates ""servings sold"" rather than servings consumed. As a separate comment, it is unclear as to whether the data on the number of servings actually represents servings manufactured by a particular company or some other measure. D. Finally, the report should not repeat the industry assertion that three billion servings of ephedra were consumed in 1999, unless this is based on hard facts. It's a self-serving statement that has the effect of diminishing the safety concerns over ephedra by perhaps inflating the frequency of exposure. Is the three billion estimate based on quantities sold? Surely not all dosages were consumed. p.10 FDA concerns about the safety of ephedrine alkaloid containing products sold as supplements preceded the passage of DSHEA, which changed how FDA could deal with safety in the context of supplements. Rand Response We note this comment, and also note that many scientists would agree with it. At any rate, we have deleted from this revision the causality assessment. We have revised this statement to make clear this is the industry's contention.  Change made to reflect this is an industry assumption.  We revised the text to reflect this.  Change made Two references in the background section should, in my opinion, be changed. On page 11, you state that ""weight loss has been associated with decreased morbidity and mortality"" and cite ref. 26, the Williamson et al study. Actually, the literature on this point is quite controversial, and despite the Williamson study, much of the literature shows an increase in mortality with weight loss. All of these studies are observational, and subject to serious limitation. This is why NIDDK is undertaking a very large study (Look AHEAD) to answer questions about morbidity/mortality with voluntary weight loss. The DPP does suggest that intentional weight loss in persons at risk can delay or prevent the onset of type 2 diabetes in persons at high risk. I suggest that you state instead that ""intentional weight loss in obese persons leads to reductions in risk factors for disease"" and cite the NIH guidelines: Clinical Guidelines on the Identification, Evaluation, and Treatment of Overweight and Obesity in Adults--The Evidence Report. National Institutes of Health. Obes Res 1998; 6 Suppl 2:51S-209S. Also, on page 14, ref. 69--when discussing the role of ephedrine in humans, its role in stimulation of beta three adrenergic receptors in brown fat is noted. There is very little brown fat in adult humans, and I'm unsure that this would play any role in ephedrine's thermogenic effect. The reference cited is an old one (1982). Someone should be sure that this citation represents current thinking on the role We deleted this comment.  A3-16   Appendix 3. Reviewer Comments (continued) Reviewer Comment (if any) of brown fat in the thermogenic effects of ephedra compounds. The definition of overweight is >=25-29.9 (not in excess of 25 but also inclusion of 25) and the definition of obesity is >=30 (not greater than 30 but inclusion of 30) See NHLBI, Clinical guidelines for obesity, 1998 Change made Rand Response  The attempted intentional weight loss data is only for 1996. Change made The 1998 data you reference is a paper that only includes a subset, only 5 states. The latest national data on attempts for weight control is the 2000 data that is in Reference 10. Therefore, you may want to delete reference to the 1996 data and instead use the 2000 or just edit the sentences to say ""The same survey when administered in 2000 showed that one third (38.5%) of subjects were actively trying to lose weight and another third (35.9%) were trying to maintain their weight.ref 10 Furthermore, among those who were overweight 45.0% of subjects were actively trying to lose weight and 34.9% were trying to maintain their weight. Among those who were obese, 65.7% of subjects were actively trying to lose weight and 20.8% were trying to maintain their weight"" ref 10. I then go on to reference 29 data. The would suggest using the estimates from Reference 29 to determine a denominator for use. I would suggest also using the Michigan data from this paper to support claims that consumers are not aware of the ingredients in their herbal supplements. Ref 29 ""In a population-based study of 14,679 U.S. adults in 5-states using the 1998 BRFSS data, 7% reported using nonprescription weight loss products; 2% reported using PPA and 1% reported using ephedra products from 1996 to 1998. More women used ephedra products than men; 1.6% of women and 0.4% of men reported using weight loss products containing ephedra. Extrapolated nationally, this study estimated that during 1996-1998, 2.5 million Americans used weight loss products containing ephedra. ""This study also has data to suggest that many individuals are not aware they are taking weight loss products that contain ephedra. Of the 183 respondents in Michigan who responded no to the questions about using ephedra and reported to have taken ""other"" nonprescription weight loss products, 33% reported using name-brand products that claim to contain both ephedra products and chromium picolinate. "" I would rewrite the sentence regarding Harnack et al. (2001) This change was made consistent with to be the following (inclusion of small n and previous of previous reviewers comments. ephedra specific for weight loss). It is hard to follow what the 12% of the total is when you don't give the original total usage (61.2%); and, it is really 5.3% that used ephedra for weight loss This is larger than Ref 29 but Ref 29 has  A3-17   Appendix 3. Reviewer Comments (continued) Reviewer Comment 14679 individuals whereas the Harnack study has only 376. Among 230 (61.2%) of 376 adults in the St. Paul/MSP area who reported using an herbal products during the past 12 months, 44 (19.1%) used ephedra. Of these 44, 20 (45%) used ephedra for weight loss. Therefore, 5.3% of adults (20 of 376) reported using ephedra for weight loss. --Taking these estimates, you find that 20 (5.3%) of 376 individuals used ephedra for weight loss during the past 12 months (1998/1999). Some of the herbs mentioned in the last sentence are not listed in Table 1. Many of the latest formulations also contain bitter orange. I would add these to the Table. On page 9, the following key information is provided: Ephedra has been used for over 5,000 years. Three billion doses have been sold. Even after the FDA's campaign to advertise the AERs and to have more AERs reported, there has been a 65% increase in volume of sales over the previous five years. Even after the FDA's campaign, there are only 1,500 AERs out of 3 billion servings. That calculates to about 1 adverse event in every 2 million servings. By anyone's standards that is very safe. On page 10, the statement, ""Still, the controversy over ephedra continues,"" and a reference to litigation have no place in a scientific analysis. It is doubtful that such information was garnered from a review of the published scientific literature. Inclusion of this type of information takes away from the science. Information from the scientific literature on ephedrine (the purified alkaloid) regarding it mechanism of action. There is a fair amount of literature (1910 to 1930) about ephedrine. For example, Chen KK, Schmidt CF. Ephedrine and Related Substances, Medicine volume 9, number 1, 1930. Page 10 paragraph 1: Obesity, The definition of obesity had changed since 1991. A result of this change was that in the mid-1990's many more people were considered obese than previously. So, although the incidence of obesity had been increasing since 1991, the change in definition makes it seem more dramatic than it actually was. As a result, this statement may need to be qualified. Page 12, paragraph 2: It is appropriate to extrapolate figures from 511 subjects attending a gymnasium to the general public? Suggest qualifying this statement. The RAND Corporation has drafted a document entitled ""Ephedra: Clinical Efficacy and Side Effects"" in order to assess the efficacy of herbal and synthetic ephedrine on weight loss and athletic performance and to assess the safety of herbal ephedrine products through review of adverse events reported in clinical trials and in reports on This Table has been greatly shortened and this part has been deleted. This is a judgment and not a statement of evidence, which is what the Evidence Report presents. Rand Response  We disagree that these sentences take away from the science, we think they are necessary to put the science in context.  This section of the report was not intended to be exhaustive, but to provide context for the reader. Many relevant references may not be included. This is probably true, but by most standards the incidence is increasing. At any rate we did qualify the statement.  We indicated this is the authors' extrapolation. No specific response to these general comments. Specific responses to specific comments below.  A3-18   Appendix 3. Reviewer Comments (continued) Reviewer Comment file with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). This report will focus on the safety assessment in the RAND report. Prior to commenting on this assessment, however, it is important to note that the RAND report includes a formal meta-analysis that concludes that products containing herbal ephedra and caffeine produce significant weight loss over a 4 to 6 month period. This weight loss is similar to that documented from synthetic ephedrine plus caffeine. Given the epidemic of obesity in the United States and the associated morbidity and mortality from obesity, it must be emphasized that weight loss may play a large role in reducing morbidity and mortality. In fact, several studies have shown that weight loss associated with herbal ephedra and synthetic ephedrine are associated with significant reductions in parameters associated with cardiovascular disease among the obese (e.g., reductions in triglycerides, 1, ApoB, 1 and LDLcholesterol;2 and increases in HDL-cholesterol2).The evidence for weight loss is quite robust because it is derived from controlled randomized trials. The best data for safety would also be derived from randomized trials. RAND reports on adverse events within randomized trials, noting that there were ""no serious adverse events (e.g., death, myocardial infarction, stroke) reported in these clinical trials."" Because of the limited numbers of subjects studied in these trials, these studies could only detect a serious adverse event rate of one in a thousand. That is the studies can exclude a rate of serious adverse events of greater than one in a thousand. This should not be inferred to mean that the rate is one in a thousand nor that ephedra even causes adverse events. In the absence of additional controlled studies, RAND then turned to adverse event reports (AERs) filed with the FDA up to September 30, 2001. The limitations of AERs in proving causality, especially when viewed in isolation of the totality of evidence, are well known and have been discussed extensively in the literature and basic textbooks of pharmacoepidemiology. Causality cannot be proven by AERs because there is no comparison control group. Authors of other reviews of AERs in the ephedra database have noted that a collection of AERs ""does not prove causation, nor does it provide quantitative information with regard to risk.""3 There are several reasons for this which will be discussed briefly. To what end was this inquiry directed? Most exogenously ingested chemicals that are thought to enhance athletic performance are banned from competitive sports. To what end will the results of such an inquiry be applied? This report was commissioned by AHRQ & ODS to assess the state of the science regarding ephedra. Rand Response  Given the most contradictory recommendations of the We believe that every person on the TEP CANTOX report regarding the safety of the ephedra has a bias.

Of note, no neurologists (and particularly no stroke experts) were included on the Technical Expert Panel. Rand Response biases. We judged it important to include in the TEP a member with close ties to the industry who was also scientifically credible. While true, a neurologist was included in the group assessing the case reports and a neurologist was included in the peer reviewers. Our TEP defined this for us as indicated in Table 3.  The group was charged with assembling and evaluating the evidence that ephedra and its congeners favorably affected ""energy enhancement"", affected weight loss and improved athletic performance. ""Energy enhancement"" is a vague term and it is not clear how it can be measured or tested. A basic problem in the method adopted for the pooling of studies rests with the false assumption that these herbal preparations have been standardized and are similar enough in constituents, potency and purity that they can be assumed to have sufficient homogeneity to justify pooling of results. In fact, there is much evidence that this is not the case. Yet much of the report rests on the results of the pooling of many under-powered studies of herbs or ephedra where potency and constituents are vaguely described or even unknown. The herbs are mixtures of many chemicals with various actions so it is doubtful merging or pooling such studies represents a scientifically legitimate exercise. In sum, this report addresses two questions that are not relevant to the public health: ""energy enhancement"" and ""improved athletic performance"". The public health question it does address, obesity or weight loss, is not answered due to the heterogeneity of the products examined and pooled and the lack of long-term follow-up studies. The case reports of adverse events possibly due to ephedra or ephedrine are not well described and the algorithm adopted is too rigid and is being applied to a data collection system that is unable to obtain the data required for causality in the algorithm. There is no ephedra or and risks to research is the product  We disagree with this opinion, and point out the chi-square test of heterogeneity did not reject the null hypothesis of no difference in the effects reported in the four ephedra studies.

No response as there is no specific critique of methods or analysis.  That ephedra has efficacy for weight loss seems to be true, though people can quibble over how much. The key question, as I see it, is: Is there credible evidence that ephedra poses a significant or unreasonable risk of harm, even when taken at recommended dosages? This report so far is inadequate for addressing this question. Page 23, paragraph 3: This paragraph is not clearly written.  Change Made  A3-20   Appendix 3.

According to page 53 of the Evidence Report, there are 48 controlled trials identified. It is unclear if the two Danish trials are included or not. Even if it is, there are still discrepancies with the number. In reading the objectives, one assume that synthetic ephedrine was also part of the study objectives. However, this is not the original intent (see page 19 on Original Potential Key Questions). Should the changed in objectives be explained in the evidence report (rather than just a statement of agreement by TEP on page 20)?

Readers may think it unusual (as did several of our reviewers) that RAND would place an announcement seeking unpublished studies in Phytomedicine and Herbalgram. They would wonder why such announcements were not put into more mainstream medical journals such as JAMA and Lancet. It might be useful to mention that the intent in choosing Phytomedicine and Herbalgram was to reach individuals who might know of small studies being done on ephedra or ephedrine the TEP may not have been familiar with. It is quite evident that a concerted effort was put forth by the authors to search all relevant databases and literature sources for clinical studies assessing the efficacy of the ephedrine/caffeine and ephedra containing dietary supplements. I was somewhat surprised that advertisements were placed only in Phytomedicine and HerbalGram. Phytomedicine is a relatively obscure journal while HerbalGram is targeted more toward the layperson. Were other journals considered? On page 26, the authors state that when a standard deviation was missing they imputed an average standard deviation from all other available data. They further state that they weighted all other standard deviations equally (IF I understood them correctly). It was unclear to me why they would weight all the standard deviations equally rather than weighting them by same size. We weighted each study equally in the imputation procedure, i.e. we did not weight each study by its sample size (we assume the reviewer meant ""sample size"" not ""same size""). Neither approach (weighting equally or weighting by sample size) is entirely consistent with our assumed random effects model. The approach we did take is simply applied, and we have found in practice that the results are fairly insensitive to weight choice.  On page 42, the authors indicate that in their reporting form, The form has been correct to read BMI greater than 27 was defined as obesity. This seems an ""overweight/obese"". odd choice given that both the NIH and the World Health Organization have now reached a consensus that a BMI greater than or equal to 30 should represent obesity and this information was available prior to the initiation of the current project.

In the weight loss category, of the 24 trials listed in Evidence Table 2, 4 were excluded, 2 because of study design, the other 2 because of ""insufficient statistics"" and lack of ""weight loss outcome"" (addressed weight gain). However, 4, available only as abstracts, were rated using the Jadad system, scoring 0,1,2, and 2. Of the 20 trials included in this weight loss panel, only 5 used herbal ephedra, the other 15 employing the pure alkaloid ephedrine. Interestingly the highest scores (5) on the Jadad scale were to the two Boozer studies, which combined herbal caffeine ( kola and guarana, respectively).

We did include all available trials in the The literature search seems to be appropriate, with the safety analysis and have clarified the text relevant publications being identified. The study selection to reflect this. for efficacy analysis seems justified, whereas the selection of studies for safety is not appropriate. This reviewer finds it justified including only the controlled trials with a placebo arm for efficacy analysis. But for safety evaluation is obvious that all trials should be included. The safety information collected during a clinical trial has much better value and validity than the cases received through the FDA. I suggest therefore that the analysis of safety in terms of adverse effect dropouts and side effects should be reexamined with inclusion of all the available trials. Could you estimate the average amount of weight loss per month in each of the ephedrine groups and in the placebo weight loss groups. For the lay press and political readers this may mean more to them than the difference in weight loss between the active intervention and the placebo. This revision now contains the percent weight loss in the treated group.  It is clear there are data gaps with respect to ephedra use No Response and effects which are apparent in this study. However, I did not identify any evidence of bias in the data collection process. It appears that the researchers made every effort to reduce No Response bias in the data collection process. The data collection process was systematic and thorough. Problems were identified and explained in the Limitations section of the report. The researchers did acknowledge that missing information did exist and also described this in the Limitations section. It seems as if the researchers did the best they could have done with the literature captured in the meta-analysis. Is there a minimal amount of missing information regarding We conducted sensitivity analysis on  A3-23   Appendix 3. Reviewer Comments (continued) Reviewer Comment outcomes and other variables considered key to the interpretation of results? The fact that the studies that were found has 6 month or less treatment duration. That is too short a period of time to fully analyze safety or efficacy. I believe you did a fine job in synthesizing the data. There was one inconsistency that I think might have been a typographical error. In table 15 you state that the pooled monthly weight loss in pounds is 2.7. In the text on page 55 and 56, you state that the same monthly weight loss is 2.1 pounds. You my want to check this apparent conflict. Reasonable decisions were made concerning whether and how to combine data. Precisions of results were indicated. Limitations and inconsistencies were also stated. All study designs were considered in the synthesis and reasonable decisions were made as to combining the data. Precision was reported and limitations described. Limitations and inconsistencies were stated along with limitations of the review process. The meta-regression was used in an attempt to compare treatment across trials. At one or more points the authors used the term ""cathartic"". I am not certain I know what they mean by that . Do you mean laxative? Rand Response attrition rate greater or less than 20%, and the results are reported in the text. We acknowledge in the limitations that the short duration of the identified studies limits the conclusions that can be drawn. This discrepancy has been corrected.  No Response  No Response  Yes.  I believe that there are at least three major reviews related In this revision we do not review previous to this topic to varying degrees that merit mention. I believe reviews, therefore we did not act on this the authors have mentioned at least two of these three. The comment. three of these are: the CANTOX Report; Frank Greenway's recent review, and a review by Allison and colleagues which appeared in critical reviews in Food Science and Nutrition in 2001. Each of these reports addressed the use of ephedrine products for weight loss in part or in whole. I do not think any of them need to be discussed at great length, but it should be mentioned an the authors of the current report should briefly mention whether their conclusions largely agree or do not agree with those prior reports. The authors are probably also aware that, subsequent to their producing this draft document, there was a Senate hearings on the use of dietary supplements for weight loss, at which a number of experts provided testimony. The written testimony from several of these experts are available on the Senate's website. The authors may wish to briefly mention this in their report and cite any key relevant information that appeared in that testimony that was not available to them this report was written. I think that as it intimated above, any studies excluded must be carefully accounted for. The exclusion of studies opens up the reports to potential allegations of bias. Therefore, I would advocate that the authors include a very detailed table of all excluded studies giving the reason for their We considered doing so, but felt the report had so many tables already that this table was of marginal extra benefit.  A3-24   Appendix 3. Reviewer Comments (continued) Reviewer Comment exclusion and a full reference to the study. If the authors have already done that and I missed it (the tables were quite extensive and I confess that I did not go through them with a fine toothed comb), I apologize. I was confused on one point. I thought that the authors only included studies that were randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials. If I understand the scoring of the Jadad system correctly, a study that is randomized would get at least one point, and a study that was placebocontrolled ( and therefore presumably double-blind) would get a second point. Therefore, all studies should receive a score of at least 2 on the Jadad scale. However, I thought that I saw some point that some of the studies received scores less than 2. Can this be clarified? I was somewhat disappointed by the authors discussion and use of effect sizes. First, the discussion is slightly simplistic at points. For example, it seems to imply that the particular effect size metric they use is ""the"" effect size rather than ""a"" specific metric of effect size. Moreover, it is generally wellrecognized that when the outcome measure in a field of study is something that had intrinsic or accepted meaning it is perfectly reasonable to use this outcome measure rather than the particular effect size metric the authors used, which scales things relative to within group standard deviations. This is the case with body weight, where most investigators and people in general understand pounds and kilograms. There is no reason to standardize by the standard deviation, which makes the data less interpretable. In fact, several meta analyses have appeared in the literature on obesity and simply use pounds or kilograms. I agree that several meta analyses have as appeared in the obesity field that have used the standardized effect size that the authors use, but I personally see it as unnecessary. It is not only unnecessary but it can create situations in which there is less clarity. For example, two studies can achieve the same absolute weight loss and yet one study because it is much more tightly controlled may have a smaller standard deviation. This latter study would achieve a larger effect size and yet I do not think that most people would see it as more efficacious if the same number of pound or kilograms were lost. The authors themselves seem not to accept this metric of effect size because they later back transform if two pounds as a way to help the reader interpret the results. Finally, although a minor point, the authors should use metric units of weight (kilograms) rather than pounds. The metric system is the accepted system in current scientific practice and the authors report will be perceived as less professional otherwise. Being not a statistician I do not understand certain parts in Studies were included if they were controlled clinical trials. Such studies can score zero on the Jadad scale. Rand Response  The effect sizes were transformed back to changes in weight loss in pounds. We also assessed whether conducting the analysis entirely in pounds changed the results. It did not. We also continue to report the results in pounds because US audiences are more familiar with this unit of measurement.  The methods text has been revised to  A3-25   Appendix 3. Reviewer Comments (continued) Reviewer Comment the Methodology. For example, effect size is not defined in the section ""Weight Loss Effect Size"" (page 25), the paragraph in the Safety Assessment, Controlled Trial Adverse Events, Meta-Analysis section on exact conditional inference methods versus asymptotic methods (page 29) was not very clear. On p. 2 you describe the ""effect size"" determination. Although it becomes clear later that you are comparing them with placebo, this one sounds like it is only for single treatments. I am confused. Rand Response improve clarity.  An effect size is calculated for any comparison of two groups.  In general I think that this a reasonable objective, and have A dose analysis is included with this little doubt that this will make a useful contribution to the revision. We also tried to make sure our field. That being said, I think there are a number of points statements were accurate. that, if carefully addressed, could improve the document. I detailed specific comments below. In the main summary (I.e. pages V and VI) the authors made no mention of dose. I think that this is a marked oversight. It could inappropriately be taken as an indication that they statements they make apply to all doses. Clearly this is not the case as the statements they make can only apply at best to the doses for which they observed the data. I believe the authors should consider substantially softening several of their statements. The first one to catch my eye was the statement on page VI that ""the effects on weight loss of synthetic ephedrine plus caffeine and Ephedracontaining dietary supplements with herbs containing caffeine are equivalent..."" As I am sure the authors are well aware, lack of evidence for an effect is not the same as evidence for lack of an effect. We can never marshal sufficient evidence to unequivocally prove the null hypothesis. We can only fail to reject a null hypothesis. If the authors had access to multiple, very well controlled studies comparing herbal and non-herbal ephedrine, this conclusion might be warranted. However, based on the data they have observed, a far softer statement such as ""We observed no statistically significant difference between the effects of herbal and nonherbal sources of ephedrine and caffeine"" would be much more appropriate. The authors may perceive me to be a stickler on this point. I am suggesting that the authors try to particularly cautious throughout this report in framing their conclusions because of the highly contentious nature of the topic they are studying. Even if these authors never enter a courtroom, it is highly probable that they will ""speak"" in one or more courtrooms through this document. That is, lawyers and expert witnesses representing multiple diverse interests are likely to cite this document in court cases. For this reason, it is crucial that the authors say exactly what they mean and state exactly what can be supported by data and be vary catious about making statements that could be  A3-26   Appendix 3. Reviewer Comments (continued) Reviewer Comment misinterpreted or overextended On page 11of the report, the authors state some numbers regarding how many billions of dollars obesity costs. Although I do not think these numbers are especially relevant to the report and could easily be eliminated without any loss, if the authors are going to cite them they should cite the most accurate information available. My colleagues and I published a report in the American Journal of Public Health in 1999 in which we showed that prior estimates of the costs of obesity were almost certainly inflated by a fact of approximately 25%. If the authors are going to cite cost figures they should probably cite our paper and lower costs showed therein. We stated that the reported value is only one estimate. The point, we think, is that obesity has an enormous cost in terms of health. We also included this reference stating that another estimate was 25% less. Rand Response  On Page 14 under Pharmacokinetics, I thought the authors We made this modification. may wish to consider softening their statements about the lack of difference between herbal and non-herbal sources of ephedrine in terms of Pharmacokinetics. It seemed to me that the studies they reviewed did not fully support what appeared to be their conclusions, namely that there were no important differences in pharmacokinetics between herbal and non-herbal ephedrine. The authors state that two physicians working independently extracted data in duplicate and resolved disagreements by consensus. It would be interesting to know how often such disagreements occurred. That is, can the authors present any indication of the reliability of their coding scheme. With respect to the search strategy, the authors seem to have been quite thorough. However, there are two sources they did not mention using that, in my experience can be extremely useful for this type of work. The first is the United States Patent and Trade Office which now has all patents on line. The online data base is searchable. One can often obtain quite a bit of additional information on this topic by finding companies' patents. Second, although, in my experience a less important source, Dissertation Abstracts International, Which also had on line searchable databases can occasionally help uncover additional studies. I can certainly understand the last thing the authors probably wish to hear at this point is a suggestion they go back and search for more literature. Whether they ultimately choose to do so is obviously up to them. However, at minimum they might want to do a type of ""sensitivity search"" to see if it seems likely that they would have missed a great deal of information by not searching these databases. Regarding herbal ephedra for weight loss: There are apparently no studies addressing whether weight loss is maintained after ephedra use is discontinued. This is a very important gap in our knowledge and should be explicitly We did not assess in this project (or any similar project) a measure of disagreements, such as Kappa, and therefore cannot report this.  We did not go back and search these databases. No reviewers identified any missed trials, so while we can never be sure, we judge it unlikely that there are significantly large and well done RCTs that were not included in our analyses.  An addition was made to the limitation section.  A3-27   Appendix 3. Reviewer Comments (continued) Reviewer Comment pointed out. With all other weight loss medications, weight is regained after their use is discontinued, suggesting that lifelong use (whether continuous or intermittent) is likely needed to maintain weight loss. If this is also true for ephedra, adverse events must be considered from the perspective of chronic ephedra use rather than episodic use. This has important implications for clinical use, public health, and study design to detect adverse effects. The HHS requested this analysis to evaluate the safety and The issue of studying select populations efficacy of ephedra/caffeine products when used for weight was added to the limitations. loss or exercise enhancement used in the absence of medical supervision. However, the reports that have been analyzed have all been performed on subjects that were screened for pre-existing medical conditions and were followed during the trials with medical supervision. For example, in the most recent study by Boozer et al., the investigators excluded one of every ten subjects they screened for medical history or for conditions that made ephedra/caffeine, in their estimation, to be unsafe. The only trials that could have adequately addressed the question posed by HHS would be any that enrolled an unscreened population and followed them with little, if any, medical supervision. Such studies are not feasible or ethical because of the general knowledge that ephedrinecontaining products are dangerous. An Institutional Review Board would not accept this study design. The report should note that the clinical trials reviewed (at least the ones with which I am familiar) had strict criteria for medical exclusion and require careful monitoring for safety during the study. This is the result of the general understanding of the medical community that these products are dangerous and therefore requires medical supervision during their use These are topic areas that may be worthy The other major flaw in the analysis is that it failed to of review but were outside our scope of adequately consider the pharmacology and clinical work. pharmacology of sympathomimetic amines. The consistency of the evidence across a range of chemically related substances must be considered. The relative safety and efficacy of other drugs that have similar pharmacologic actions is absolutely relevant. Every drug with sympathomimetic actions that have been studied adequately has been associated with serious cardiovascular and neurological adverse events. Likewise, the actions of drugs that antagonize the effects of ephedrine should be considered. For example, adrenergic antagonists reduce the incidence of strokes and heart attacks. The questions are clearly formulated, but some of the answers are difficult to find. For example, the answer to question 7 on page 19 was buried in paragraphs on page 14. I might suggest adding to the summary chapter, brief answers to the questions you posed that are based on your We reported the questions as we received them. We tried to reword our conclusions to better match the questions. Rand Response  A3-28   Appendix 3. Reviewer Comments (continued) Reviewer Comment analysis. Although the summary does address many of the questions, it would be nice to see the answers lined up with the questions. For example, the answer to questions 7 may be something short like this: "" Ephedrine releases norephedrine from nerve terminals stimulating alpha and beta adrenergic receptors. Caffeine magnifies this effect by slowing the breakdown of cyclic-AMP inside the cell through the inhibition of phosphodiesterase."" This is not an attempt to suggest text, but just to give an idea of how it might be possible to address the questions you posed in a two or three sentence answer. The questions are understandable but not well formulated. The questions should be specific for the way the ephedrine/caffeine products are being used. To ask whether they are safe without specifying how they are used ignores the potential selective bias. The selection of 24 hours as a window for exposure to ephedra is conservative. It is quite possible that ephedra could cause coronary or cerebral vasospasm that could persist much longer. This certainly has been described for other sympathomimetic drugs such as cocaine. The 24 hour criterion was set by the TEP and not something we can change. Rand Response  In evaluating the adverse events, why was documented use This criterion was set by the TEP of ephedra with 24 hours made a criterion? This timing interval is far shorter than that used in the PPA epidemiology study [use ~72 hours]. Furthermore, this criterion tends to exclude those adverse events that are not necessarily time or dose dependent or whose effects are not ascertained until some critical threshold is exceeded [e.g., immunological reactions; hemorrhagic stroke with symptoms of an antecedent headache not considered ""typical""]. Requiring documentation of ephedra exposure within 24 hours of the acute event may be biased against the most serious cases when a patient cannot provide a history of recent use because of death, coma, aphasia, or other sever impairment. In the absence of toxological results a reliance proxy history by a household or family member should be adequate. Most likely the only detail analysis of all the trials of ephedrine in the literature. The detail explanation of the method with tables and graphs are helpful to the reader. We did count as satisfying this criterion a report of the subject consuming ephedra or ephedrine within 24 hours.  No response  Is the FDA data on the products that contain ephedra based It could be based on the label or on direct on label claims that it is ephedra or there are lab analysis analysis. confirmation? This should be stated as many of the products tested claim to contain ""ephedra only"" contain ephedrine and pseudoephedrine and no other ephedra alkaloids. This is likely due to a non-naturally occurring source.  A3-29   Appendix 3. Reviewer Comments (continued) Reviewer Comment ""In September 2001, the FDA's Office of Nutritional Products, Labeling, and Dietary Supplements produced an excel spreadsheet...for the dates specified"" What is the inclusive date of the requested report? The literature on herbal supplements/medicines is replete with reports based on undefined or poorly defined research materials. This occurs at least one of three levels: (1) research, (2) reporting research findings in journals, and (3) abstracting/indexing journal articles for database entry. Unless serious efforts are made immediately to set criteria for researchers at all three levels to follow, further research in the herbal supplements/medicines field will only continue to generate data that will continue to lead to ambiguous conclusions and hence, controversy. Ephedra and ephedrine are no exception. Ephedra herb (defined as the green herbaceous stem) sometimes contains up to 30% root material, which has different types of chemical constituents than those of ephedra herb. The root has completely different traditional uses than the stem as well (e.g., antiperspirant vs. diaphoretic). And the root contains macrocyclic spermine alkaloids (ephedradines) that are hypotensive, as opposed to the hypertensive effect of ephedrine in ephedra herb. Also, ephedra herb from different sources (Ephedra sinica, E. intermedia, E. equisetina, etc.) contains widely different levels of ephedrine among the ephedrine alkaloids (30%90%) present in the herb.4 We can't assume the results from ephedra herb containing `ephedrine' are equivalent to those based on the single-chemical drug ephedrine unless both the following two conditions are met: (1) the efficacy and safety evaluation is only based on ephedrine and (2) the concentration of ephedrine in ephedra has been specifically defined by definitive chemical analyses. Otherwise this `ephedrine' could only be 30% ephedrine, with the rest (70%) being made up of other phenethylamines (e.g., pseudoephedrine, norephedrine, etc.) as well as ephedradines (from root material present as adulterant in the raw material used for extraction); the latter have different pharmacological activities and toxicities than ephedrine.

Reviewer Comments (continued) Reviewer Comment In contrast to the Rand draft report, the relation of the potential of consumption of ephedra to the dosage involved was the central point of the ephedra risk assessment contracted by the Council for Responsible Nutrition and performed by Cantox Health Sciences International, Mississauga, Ontario (http://www.crnusa.org/CRNCantoxreportindex.html). The Cantox report reflects a true risk assessment that includes (1) evaluation of the evidence for a hazardous effect, (2) dose response relationship evaluation, (3) uncertainty assessment, and (4) identification of a dose that does not carry significant risk under specified conditions of use. The Rand report includes one important topic not addressed by Cantox--the benefits of ephedra. Rand Response No response  Given the animal toxicology data that includes wellA dose analysis is now included in this documented toxicity at high doses, as well as many revision and this revision no longer assigns anecdotal cases from the drug and dietary supplement causality. literature that point toward ephedrine or ephedrine alkaloid toxicity, examination of the ephedra adverse event report (AER) dataset for possibly, likely, or even ""definite"" causality seems to be a moot point unless the dosage that produced that causal case is identified and put into context with the recommended dosages. There are abundant examples among the essential nutrients of the absolute necessity of applying this principle. For a comparative example, a conclusion that vitamin A can cause liver damage may be true but is misleading, and actually harmful, as a generality. Clearly, scientists should recognize the critical importance of dose in any evaluation of causality, but not all policymakers or legislators, much less the general public, can be expected to do so. Thus, it is critically important to recognize and evaluate the dosage involved in any possibly or likely causal cases of adverse effects by ephedra. The Rand evaluation of risk stops a major and critical step short of the Cantox risk assessment in that little attention was paid to the dosage involved in adverse effects that might be casually related to ephedra ingestion. The absence of any significant dose-response consideration in the evaluation and conclusions is very clear in the Structured Abstract sections Main Results and Conclusions (page vi). This omission inexplicably occurs even though in the Methodology section (page 19), the Safety Assessment list of considerations asks the appropriate dosage question. This virtual absence of dose-response assessment in the entire report is reflected in the section on Attribution of Adverse Events (pages 20-21). In that section, the ""dose question"" is asked mainly in relation to the temporal relationship, not a dose-response quantitative relationship. Likewise, in the section on Causality Analysis of Case Reports, the three key points of the causality algorithm do not include any evaluation of the dose that produced the  A3-31   Appendix 3. Reviewer Comments (continued) Reviewer Comment adverse effect. A complete evaluation requires an answer to the following question: If the answer is affirmative on all three key points, what dose was involved? Paracelsus got it right some 500 years ago--""the dose makes the poison."" Without consideration of dose, we can justifiably conclude that anything, indeed everything, is a poison. The necessity of adequate information to answer the doseresponse question is exemplified by AER 13408, released by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). In contrast to the labeled dosage of up to six capsules per day, the wife of the 26 year-old male in this case acknowledged to the FDA investigator that he ""took a handful at a time, several times a day."" This case is mentioned only to illustrate actual dosage may bear no resemblance whatever to labeled or expected dosage. Regardless of oral reports of specific dosage, the actual dosage should be assumed to be completely unknown, without confirming pharmacokinetic information or other objective information. Pharmacokinetics. There are two published studies of the pharmacokinetics of ephedra, both from the same laboratory (Gurley, references 74, 75). Unfortunately, the results are not consistent, but rather conflicting. It is strongly recommended that future research include a carefully designed comparison of the pharmacokinetics of ephedrine and two ephedra formulations, one comprised of powdered whole herb and the other powdered extract of the whole herb, in human volunteers. This should resolve the issue of a potential difference between purified ephedrine and the herbal products. The report notes the similarity between ephedrine and phenylpropanolamine (PPA) but fails to consider the relevance of the data with PPA to ephedrine. The suggestion that a trial similar to the one with PPA should be performed ignores the fact that most would consider the study to be unethical. The only ethical way to do the study would be to exclude patients at risk for cardiovascular events but that would make it impossible to accurately define the safety in an unscreened population of patients. Again, it would not be ethical to conduct a case control trial to quantify the magnitude of harm from a drug known to have the ability to cause strokes and heart attacks. The only reasonable recommendation from this analysis is that the drug (ephedrine/caffeine) has modest short-term efficacy and probable safety when used under medical supervision. If it is to remain available to the public it should only be used under medical supervision, i.e. dispensed only by prescription. The review of the safety of a drug with potentially rare adverse events must include a complete consideration of the polymorphisms of adrenergic receptors that have been We agree this is an important line of research, but think this falls somewhat lower in priority than our first three listed recommendations. Rand Response  The case control study suggested is an observational study design that does not compel subjects to take anything, and in most situations starts after exposure has already occurred. We do not think it any more unethical to conduct this study than the PPA study.  We judged this beyond the scope of our report.  A3-32   Appendix 3.

The polymorphisms that result in failure to develop tolerance are especially important to be considered. The section on metabolism should include some mention of the metabolic polymorphisms that result in deficient metabolism and accumulation of excessive drug levels. The evidence report questions were easily understandable.

However they presented a particular method as a way of analyzing MedWatch Report data from the FDA. In brief, the method entailed creating a contingency table between types of events on the one hand, and drugs or substances ingested on the other hand. By looking for cells with larger than expected frequencies, one can potentially identify drugs with particular hazards. The authors might consider adapting this method to their data, or at least mentioning it. On page 54, the authors state that ""a sensitivity analysis on We do note this prominently in the text but also note this effect was only observed for only those studies scoring 3 or greater on the Jadad scale studies of ephedrine without caffeine. yielded a pooled estimate of effect size substantially lower than the main analysis...this difference...did not quite reach the conventional levels of statistical significance (p=.053)."" In my opinion this is an extremely important finding. The literature on supplements for weight loss is riddled with a large number of trials of a very dubious quality. It is often difficult to know how to interpret such trials. It is easy to point out the flaws in these trials, but the obvious question is do these flaws matter? No study is perfect, and defenders of the claims companies make based upon these flawed trials are quick to point this out. The finding from the current authors suggest that such flared trials may be giving misleading answers. I believe that the authors should much more carefully describe this result and its implications and portray it much more prominently in the report. On page 58 the authors state that there are data from the pharmaceutical literature that support the contention that patients taking pharmaceuticals outside of clinical trials may have a greater risk of certain adverse events than do patients selected to participate in clinical trials. The authors should supply one or more references supporting this statement. On page 59 the authors state ""Thus bias may exist, as the events we included were different in terms of type vs. those we had to exclude."" It is unclear to me exactly what they meant by this. I suggest that they describe exactly what bias they are referring to. Reference added.  We revised the text to try and clarify this point.  A3-33   Appendix 3. Reviewer Comments (continued) Reviewer Comment Health Canada discourages its citizens from using ephedra for weight loss. They say they have at least 60 reports of adverse events. It's not enough to say that you haven't received them. You must get them and include them in your analysis. The US military discourages its people from using ephedra. A Col Mike Health, identified as an Army pharmacy consultant, states on the armymedicine.army.mil website: ""There were 25 documented active-duty deaths of soldiers, sailors, airmen or Marines who had died and were coincidentally taking ephedra-containing products."" You must get these and include them in your analysis. The American Association of Poison Control Centers collects information on human poison exposure cases, including cases attributed to dietary supplements. In 2000, 2.2 million cases of poisoning were reported to 63 centers. The Los Angeles Times reported on September 2, 2002, that the nation's Poison Control Centers collected 9,000 cases of ephedra poisoning since 1993. Where are these? You must include them in your analysis. E'Ola, a manufacturer of ephedra products, admitted in a lawsuit deposition in 1999 that it had received 3,500 complaints about ephedra from its customers that it had not forwarded to FDA. Where are these? They should be included in your analysis. There are at least 25,585 reports of adverse events associated with ephedra that you have not included This report must deal better with the issue of dosages. Some people dismiss reports of ephedra-induced reactions as the consequences of over-dosing. Which events among the likely or possibly associated with ephedra use involved subjects taking only the recommended dosages? Why were the criteria for high blood pressure set at systolic BP > 180 or diastolic > 105 mm Hg? More reasonable measures for serious or clinically significant hypertension would be to capture all cases of hypertension where pharmacologically management is indicated [class 2 and 3 hypertension] . This would be consistent with the definitions of serious adverse event as defined by MedWatch and in CIOMS [ required intervention to prevent serious outcome....] Ascertainment of the rate and risk of clinically significant hypertension would be particularly critical in any safety assessment of ephedrine alkaloid containing products for use the general population where a ""learned intermediary"" is not required. p. 50 Figure 4 brief data collection form for case report: what criteria were used to establish the categories under psychiatric [e.g., severe depression, psychosis] Rand Response The EPC did request adverse event reports from most of these sources. We did not receive any. The EPC does not have the power to compel organizations to provide any data. Furthermore, the adverse events that were assessed leave us unable to conclude anything about causation. Therefore, our expectation is that the inclusion of additional case reports is unlikely to increase our certainty about a causal relationship between ephedra use & serious cardiovascular or neurologic events.  It is not possible to tell which patients were taking the recommended doses.  The criteria were set at a level sufficiently high that treatment would be warranted that day.

Reviewer Comments (continued) Reviewer Comment On page 59 it is stated that ""we did not examine the remaining 251 adverse events because the descriptors in the master excel spreadsheet were of conditions less severe....."" The descriptors mentioned in the listing were of the `adverse event as reported' [usually by a consumer] rather a diagnosis or precise description of signs and symptoms. Consequently, this description may be an unreliable or inadequate characterization of the adverse event, its severity or seriousness. It may be better to state that the remaining 251 AERs appeared to fall outside the focus of serious adverse events [deaths, cardiovascular, CNS, etc.]. Were other measures of variation included, e.g. confidence intervals or limits? Could these be used instead of having to impute standard deviations? The questions were clearly formed. The search methods were appropriate and resources were clearly documented. Rand Response We changed the text to reflect this.  If possible we back calculated the standard deviation from other information include din the report. Otherwise, we reported the standard deviation. No response No response  Inclusion of Non-Scientific Adverse Event Reports Invalidate Animal and laboratory data were outside the Integrity of the Study our scope. There is a potentially fatal weakness in the report in that there is no inclusion of a discussion on the peer-reviewed animal and laboratory research but extensive discussion of the non-peer-reviewed, non-scientific FDA Adverse Event Reports (AERs). The inclusion and heavy dependence on data that the General Accounting Office has already concluded was flawed is likely to nullify the scientific integrity of the report. The GAO report stated: We do not see how this critique of FDA is While FDA's conclusions regarding the desirability of the proposed action may be valid, we believe these conclusions applicable to our report. are open to question because of limitations and uncertainties associated with the agency's scientific and economic analyses. The GAO found that the AERs were poorly documented; that the FDA did not perform a causal analysis to determine if, in fact, the adverse events reported in the 13 AERs it used to set dosing levels were caused by supplements containing ephedrine alkaloids; and that the FDA indicated in its proposed rule that 10 to 73 percent of reported adverse events might not be related to consumption of dietary supplements containing ephedrine alkaloids. Have AERs ever been included in an AHRQ or RAND Evidence-based Center review before? An important hallmark of the evidence-based review or meta-analysis is the establishment of strict criteria prior to the review and an adherence to the established criteria once the review begins. Any deviation from criteria once the study begins may result in a flawed analysis and a loss of credibility Case reports have certainly been included as a course of evidence in other AHRQ evidence reports, for example our own report on a ""Best Case Series for CAM Treatments of Cancer"".  A3-35   Appendix 3. Reviewer Comments (continued) Reviewer Comment The inclusion of AERs as part of this review appears to be a serious deviation both from what AHRQ requested and from the standard criteria used in conducting a meta-analysis. On page 4 of the draft, the authors conclude, ""the majority of FDA case reports are insufficiently documented to make an informed judgment about the relationship between the use of ephedra-containing supplements and the adverse event in question."" Devoting approximately 50 pages to AER reports in the report seems incongruent with the space devoted to descriptions of the peer-reviewed scientific data. There is also no explanation in the AER evaluation of products that were found to be illegally marketed as dietary supplements, which in fact were misbranded. Some of the early and most serious adverse events were from products that were adulterated with high doses of synthetic ephedra. In fact, as our analysis shows, there were more deaths as a percentage of total AERs reported in the more recent data compared to the older data. Rand Response  Several of the preliminary questions provided to RAND have A dosage analysis is included in this not been addressed in the report. We expected a review of revision. the literature to be included in the report: Questions about Dosage: What dosage of ephedra produce risk of CVD or other life threatening events? This may be because there is little or no data available. If so, it should be made clear in the report. The CANTOX report drew conclusions about a safe upper limit. While these were based on the results of a single study, they were somewhat corroborated by others. This is not to say that the CANTOX report is definitive. Also not addressed: Do ephedra-containing dietary supplement products alter physiologic markers of cardiovascular function? This was addressed to the extent that RCT data in humans was identified. Blood pressure and ventricular tachycardia were two physiologic measures of cardiac function included in the analysis. These have been included in this revision.  Adding AER analyses of ephedra AERs in the published literature, ephedrine AERs from the FDA's Adverse Event Database, and those for seizure and would make the report more complete and well balanced. While it's useful to analyze the controlled trials for evidence of adverse effects, we're not likely to find significant effects in them because if adverse events were that common the studies wouldn't have been permitted in the first place. We must rely instead on case reports and adverse event reports for evidence. Therefore, every effort should be made to assemble all the credible case reports and adverse event reports associated with ephedra use. That was not done.  We disagree strongly with the contention that we did not expend every effort to obtain case reports. We have extensive documentation of our efforts to identify and obtain case reports for this analysis. Within the resources available to this project every possible effort was made.  The report should also make a better attempt at comparing This has been done in this revision. the commonly reported adverse symptoms with those symptoms observed upon exposure to ephedra/ephedrine in controlled experiments. If the symptoms are consistent, or inconsistent, that's important to know. The case reports cited are difficult to evaluate as they We were limited by what was available in  A3-36   Appendix 3. Reviewer Comments (continued) Reviewer Comment contain clinical terms incorrectly used, incomplete descriptions and use an algorithm for causality that is impractical and unrealistic when using FDA reports. A vigorous documentation and search for better records at the time the case-reports were received would have improved the utility of the case reports. We regard the handling of adverse consequences as incomplete and unrealistic. The review by the Clinical Research and Review staff of the Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition of the Food and Drug Administration represents a more comprehensive and scientifically valid approach to reviewing adverse events associated with ephedra and ephedrine. Overall Evaluation. (i)The means used to evaluate the AERs is not clear. It is difficult to determine what role, if any, the TEP actually played in the review process. From the description given in the text, it would appear that most members of the TEP never even saw the AERs. (ii) It is not clear why an eight-week exclusion criteria was chosen the review of earlier safety studies. The exclusion of doubleblind placebo control studies of less than 8 weeks duration resulted in the loss of valuable information about acute toxicity (and excluded most of the existing data not demonstrating toxicity). (iii) Important epidemiologic and scientific data has been omitted. This omission severely limits the value of this study. Question Formulation. Questions are well formulated and easily understood. All of the defects in the study, and there are many, stem from the methods used to answer the questions. Study Identification. Appropriate search criteria were not used. Not all episodes of ephedra/ephedrine toxicity are a consequence of chronic exposure. The exclusion of all studies of less than eight weeks duration may strengthen conclusions about effectiveness, but it weakens conclusions about safety. There are, for example, dozens of double blind placebo control studies where clinically relevant doses of ephedrine were found to have no effect on blood pressure or cause arrhythmias, even in asthmatics with heart disease. There is no reason to exclude such highly relevant data. Studies where ephedrine was compared to placebo should not be excluded just because they were not about weight loss or athletic performance. The scientific credibility of the report was weakened by the search strategy that was chosen. Clearly, the authors of the report assume that (1) all episodes of ephedra/ephedrine toxicity are a consequence of chronic exposure, and that (2) clinical trials of ephedrine have been limited to studies assessing the effect of ephedrine on weight loss. All these assumptions are easily shown to be incorrect. Rand Response the files sent to us. It is not within the EPC scope to ""search for better records at the time the case reports were received."" We disagree that clinical terms are incorrectly used; in most circumstances we are reporting the clinical terms used in the source documents. Finally, if there was agreement about the best ""scientifically valid approach to reviewing adverse events"" then there would exist standardized methods for so doing and we would not have received the same level of peer review comments that we did. The trials of less than 8 weeks duration were not excluded from the safety analysis and epidemiologic studies were outside our scope of work.  No response  There is no assumption that chronic exposure is necessary and we did not assume that trials of ephedrine have been limited to studies of weight loss. We do not agree that studies of safety in healthy adults are necessarily relevant to studies in obese individuals who are at greater risk for comorbid conditions.  A3-37   Appendix 3. Reviewer Comments (continued) Reviewer Comment Rand Response Data Synthesis. The analysis of the weight loss achieved by We disagree. We tested whether weight loss was linear over this time period and ephedrine versus placebo, and ephedrine plus caffeine we could not prove that it was not. versus placebo etc., is very problematic because one has assumed that the weight loss rate is high initially and subsequently lowers, so that the weight loss from months 3 to 6 is typically very small. It is therefore invalid to simply calculate the mean rate of weight loss as pounds weight loss per month when trials of very different duration are included. Those who are familiar with placebo controlled weight loss and weight maintenance trials know that most of the difference between the active and placebo arms is achieved during the first 3 to 4 months, and that the difference is subsequently maintained even up to 2 years. The way the data are handled in this report has therefore produced projections that severely underestimate the real efficacy of ephedrine and ephedrine plus caffeine. This has been carried over into the conclusions, where it is stated that ephedrine/caffeine is not as effective as other antiobesity medications currently on the market. Data Synthesis. This must refer to Orlistat (the pancreatic lipase inhibitor from Roche) and Sibutramine (the centrally acting compound from Abbott). If one looks at the long-term of Orlistat ones sees that the mean weight loss difference between Orlistat and placebo after 6 months to 2 years are of the order of between 2-5 kg in all the large trials. Ephedrine plus caffeine produces at least an equivalent effect. For example: If the weight loss on an active compound after 3 months is 10 pounds more than on placebo, and this result is maintained also after 6 months, it is clear that rate of weight loss would be calculated as 10 pounds divided by 3 (=3.33) if the trial is stopped at 3 months. Whereas the result from a 6 month trial would give 10 pounds divided by 6 months (=1.67), which is exactly half of the weight loss. This issue should be addressed and the efficacy section should be revised accordingly. The way the panel has calculated the weight loss rate actually assumes that the weight loss rate is linear and that it continues at the same rate with prolonged use. Obviously, this is not the case. Data Synthesis. I note that Astrup et al. International Journal of Obesity 1992;16:269-77, listed in the bibliography (accepted articles) as number 1, is not included in the analysis! The Danish double publication of this is the Quaade et al., listed as number 48 in the same bibliography. It is hard to see why the panel quotes the Quaade et al. publication in Danish, which a condensed version of the Astrup et al. paper, which I assume must be the paper the panel had taken the study information from in English. The panel has used pounds in the analysis of weight loss, but it would be more appropriate to use weight loss in percent of initial body weight because the weight loss in pounds in not We were careful to state in the text that our results could not be extrapolated beyond 4-6 months. We added data on other weight loss products for comparison.  We identified these two trials as reporting identical data, and the inclusion of either (but not both) should make no difference in the results. Our practice is to include the most informative article. For these reasons we note, a percent weight loss analysis has several limitations.  A3-38   Appendix 3.

Emotional/ mood adverse effects might be more appropriate. On page 55, the authors state ""the effects of ephedrine and caffeine appear to be additive. I do not understand the basis for the authors statement. Unless there is a 2 x2 design in which to have the opportunity to observe an interaction between ephedrine and caffeine and observe that no such interaction occurs, how can the make a statement of additivity? I believe what they mean to state is that there is an effect of the combination of ephedrine and caffeine combined that is greater of the effect of either alone. This is not that same thing as stating that the effect is additive. On page VI, the authors state that there are no data from studies of herbal ephedra-containing dietary supplement products without caffeine. This is not correct. There is at least one study. My colleagues and presented an abstract at the 2002 Experimental Biology meeting from suck a trial. Unfortunately, we did not present efficacy data. Moreover, I had thought the community sponsoring the study had provided the safety data to the NIH for this review. Although, it is not within my authority to release the data themselves, I can certainly provide the authors a copy of the poster presented if they do not have access to it. There is no published study of the efficacy of ephedra without caffeine, but a large, industry-sponsored study was done by Coffey et al. at the 2002 Experimental Biology Meeting the authors reported that there had been no adverse events, but did not report on efficacy.

Reviewer Comments (continued) Reviewer Comment As far as athletic performance goes, no studies were available on herbal ephedra and only a modest affect on ""very short-term immediate performance"" was observed with ephedrine, only when caffeine was co-administered. The report states that there was one study that assessed the effect of ""sustained use of ephedrine on performance over time"", an "" reported that the addition of caffeine to ephedrine necessary to produce an effect on athletic performance."" But in the structured abstract it is not made clear what the extent of the effect was. The report text states on pg. 57, however, that ""a study116 published in Denmark concluded that aerobic training enhanced the effect of ephedrine on energy expenditure. After, 8 weeks of aerobic conditioning, ephedrine increased post-exercise energy expenditure by 100%. N. B. The reference numbers in the section are incorrect e.g. ref 116 cited above should be 43, 115:52 Regarding the 1986 Denmark study  do you mean that ephedra increased energy expenditure during exercise, or that it increased energy expenditure after the completion of exercise? Please clarify. Were there a disproportionate number of case reports of adverse events that occurred during or after the performance of exercise training or physical activity? The conclusions regarding herbal ephedra for weight loss are reasonable and defensible as far as they go, but are too conservative. Saying that there is no evidence for sustained weight loss with use of these preparations for more than 3-4 months is true, but does not translate into conclusions that are useful for the clinician or regulatory agencies. The data presented and summarized support the use of herbal ephedra or ephedra + caffeine for weight loss. Important parameters were properly identified and addressed, such as study population and design. In general, the appropriate study parameters were examined. However, I would have liked more data on doseresponse, especially with the efficacy trials Most of the important parameters were systematically addressed. Should a descriptive statement be made on possible nonstatistical publication bias. For example, funding source for the published clinical trials may also bias the quality of the results (see BMJ 2002;325 (August 3):249). On re-examination we determined this study should have been excluded, as it did not measure the effect of ephedrine on physical activity but rather on basal metabolic rate. Not assessed, and probably not possible to assess. Our charge was to present the evidence.

Was the attrition rate higher in the active vs. placebo treatment group? This should be clarified. If the rates were higher in the active group, which I suspect, then a specific analysis should be done as to the cause of attrition. Athletic Performance, second paragraph. Please clarify the duration of the exercise test. This is important because some drugs (like creatine) may produce benefit with short duration exercise (a few seconds) but not longer duration exercise. The originally proposed key questions included inquiries regarding dosage levels if ephedra with respect to weight loss, athletic performance, and safety. The Report does not address dosage levels with respect to weight loss, athletic performance, and safety assessment (except for the mention of possible future research study). Clearly this is an extremely important concept, and issue, regarding to these materials, especially with respect to the review of case reported obtained from the passive AE reporting system. It is our view that the general omission of dosage considerations should be mentioned with regard to the AER case report reviews and that it receive some attention in weight loss and athletic performance assessments. Are all of these studies single dose studies? What was the interval between taking the dietary supplement and the performance of the exercise test? The exercise tests varied in duration from short (weight lifting) to an hour or more (endurance).  A dose analysis was added to the RCT portion of the report. We did not judge analysis to be possible in the case report portion of the report.  This has been clarified in the results.  The meaning of this sentence is obscure. What is meant by This sentence has been reworded. ""enhanced mechanisms of heat loss?"" See page 26: none of the weight loss studies were beyond 4 months. Therefore, I would rewrite the first paragraph of the Main Results to say the ""longest published weight loss intervention was 4 months"". If there was a study with a post-intervention follow-up then this should be stated as well. (See comments for page 5) Three studies had 6 months of treatment, which was too few to perform metaanalysis on this time period specifically.

There should be some description of the findings of these studies in this report. It may not be standard format for the EPC's to cite patient numbers at this early point in a report, but to make sure readers understand what a small number of people have actually been studied in controlled trials, it would be helpful to include this near the beginning of the report. Figure 2, question 18: Chemical analysis of ephedrine alkaloids was part of the quality review form, but data for individual studies are not provided.

Please Clarify ""(no more than a few months)"". We assume you are not saying that the data show loss of effect after a few months, just that the studies don't extend beyond a few months. It would be helpful to define what is meant by ""sufficient evidence."" Considering that we pooled data, we do not think the addition of our assessment of power of individual studies is very useful. We did include this in specific circumstances where it seemed warranted. The data cannot be extrapolated beyond a few months. We have clarified this. We earlier explained the reason for the ""4  6"" month designation.  This is defined as statistically significant.  Several of the preliminary questions provided to RAND have We now include a dose analysis in this not been addressed in the report. We expected a review of revision. the literature to be included in the report: Questions about Dosage: I. What dosage levels of ephedra are necessary to achieve weight loss? When describing the efficacy studies, it might be helpful to include a table delineating the key elements of the weight loss studies: Dietary prescriptions, Description of subject characteristics, Mean weight or BMI at initiation of study, and inclusion and exclusion criteria for studies. Although ephedrine is the chemical drug that has been We considered this change or addition but decided there were already a great deal of tables and therefore we did not add this table. We are sympathetic to this comment but  A3-43   Appendix 3. Reviewer Comments (continued) Reviewer Comment found to be effective in short-term weight loss and athletic performance, this result cannot be extrapolated to the herb ephedra that contains multi chemical components. In order to study the efficacy of herb ephedra, the amount of ephedrine present in the herb ephedra being tested must be precisely defined. This `ephedrine' must be pure ephedrine and not, say, 50% ephedrine with 25% pseudoephedrine and 25% norephedrine or other related or unrelated alkaloids, as are normally present in herb ephedra. Ephedra is not ephedrine and vice versa, even though ephedrine is one of ephedra's active components. I personally don't see how one can generate meaningful results from a study using a material, such as ephedra, which is not clearly defined. There are just too many variables. Good science requires a well-defined test material. For example, we would never accept a singlechemical drug like cortisone with even 25% impurities when performing a clinical trial on cortisone. Why should we accept the chemical drug, ephedrine, present in herb ephedra, whose concentration can vary by 300% (from 30% to 90%, with the balance composed of other alkaloids)!? Until this problem (which is not insurmountable, as product definition criteria have been and can be set)5 is resolved, any studies on herb ephedra for weight loss or athletic performance (both based on ephedrine) will not yield meaningful results. It is possible that some of the papers the RAND report selected do clearly define the ephedrine content in the herb ephedra (though I seriously doubt it), the fact still remains that there are related and unrelated alkaloids also present in addition to ephedrine. For example, if a product containing an ephedra extract has been analyzed to contain specifically 20mg ephedrine per tablet/capsule to conform to the required amount of ephedrine for efficacy, what happens to the other alkaloids also present, which could easily be twice the ephedrine amount, or 40mg, making the total alkaloids content 60mg? This is a natural scenario unless made `unnatural' by manufacturers or suppliers who take spent ephedra herb (from which all alkaloids have been extracted) or a token amount of ephedra herb and add the prescribed amount of ephedrine, thus rendering the product basically a singlecomponent drug (ephedrine), formulated with inert spent ephedra or token ephedra herb as carrier/excipient. In this `unnatural' case, the `ephedra' product is basically an ephedrine drug dosage form and has nothing to do with the herb ephedra. I doubt there is any published scientific information on herb ephedra based on sound scientific definition of the test products containing ephedra. Furthermore, whatever reports available most likely have not clearly identified and characterized their test materials Rand Response believe that the consistency of our findings supports the decision to pool studies of weight loss and compare ephedra to ephedrine.  A3-44   Appendix 3. Reviewer Comments (continued) Reviewer Comment hence rendering their findings of little value to us. Based on the current state of published information in this field, I don't believe we will be able to obtain meaningful conclusions relating to herb ephedra's toxicity through adverse events analysis alone or based on modern published experimental data. In case of the former, since no precise standards are required for commercial ephedra products, few if any of the reported adverse events can be reasonably traced to ephedra herb. In case of the latter, there are simply too few useful published reports whose findings are based on work that used well characterized and well-define ephedra. Modern medicine and traditional Chinese medicine are two parallel and distinctly different healthcare systems, each has its own merits and defects. While modern medicine is based on scientific experimentation, TCM is based on empirical practice and trial and error in humans over time. The latter has accumulated a vast amount of recorded information, including cautions and contraindications. This has been an ongoing process and it continues to accumulate data as TCM practice continues to generate them. It would be our loss if this valuable resource was not somehow utilized. Since herb ephedra has a long use history in traditional Chinese medicine with an extensively documented record (safety, cautions, contraindications, etc.) over a 2000-year period, this should be taken into consideration. Also, common TCM traditional practice should be heeded. For example, some of the adverse events reportedly due to herb ephedra alone may not be so at all, but rather due to the concurrent and inappropriate use of other common herbs such as Asian ginseng which is traditionally cautioned against use in healthy persons with a vigorous (yang) constitution and which has been known to cause serious toxicity, including death when used improperly. 6 If one combines the indiscriminate use of even such common herbal tonics as Asian ginseng with a relatively potent herbal drug like ephedra as dietary supplements, to be used daily with no prominent warnings or precautions, serious adverse effects are bound to occur. In order to meaningfully study or evaluate the safety and efficacy of traditional medicines such as ephedra (not ephedrine, the chemical), apart from ensuring that the ephedra has been well characterized and defined, we should also consider taking its historical record and its traditional use context into consideration as well as keeping an eye open to the simultaneous but inappropriate (outside of tradition) use of tonics such as Asian ginseng. Furthermore, we should keep an open mind to the possibility that the efficacy and safety of herbal medicines simply cannot be determined by Western `hard' science alone. Common sense and welldocumented historical use and safety data should constitute Rand Response  A3-45   Appendix 3. Reviewer Comments (continued) Reviewer Comment part of the evaluation protocol. Regarding safety or adverse effects of ephedrine and herb ephedra, the two drugs need to be evaluated separately. With ephedrine, there should not be much of a problem because there must be copious amounts of data on the drug ephedrine, which can be accessed in various databases. However, with ephedra herb, it is quite different. Since ephedra has not entered the market through the usual drugdevelopment-and-approval route, which would have generated toxicity data during that process, evaluating its safety as if it were a standard pharmaceutical (the singlechemical drug ephedrine) is not appropriate. There are few modern scientific or clinical reports published in the field. You are to be commended for the comprehensive search you conducted. Your methods seemed well-defined and unbiased. I think you did an excellent job of selecting articles using specific criteria and limiting bias. I know that one of the major issues prompting this review was concern regarding the safety profile of caffeine and ephedrine. In the United States this combination is sold in an unregulated fashion, so the only estimate of the denominator for adverse events is the number of doses manufactured. In Denmark, caffeine and ephedrine is a prescription preparation for the treatment of obesity. Orlistat and, before 1997, dexfenfluramine were approved prescription drugs in Denmark competing with caffeine and ephedrine. I assume that sibutramine is also approved in that country, but I do not know that for sure. It may be too late to at this point to include in this report, but information must exist for the incidence of reported adverse events to obesity drugs in Denmark. Although this is not a perfect way to assess safety, it might be useful to determine the relative incidence of serious adverse events reported with various prescription obesity drugs in Denmark. Based on conversations with individuals familiar with the Danish experience, I suspect that the safety of caffeine and ephedrine would compare favorably with sibutramine. One advantage of such an analysis is that one would be comparing alternative drugs for treatment of obesity in the same population. The second advantage would be a better estimate of the denominator based on prescriptions written rater than manufactured pills. For the RCT data, the numbers of patients studied with ephedra have been too small to assess adverse events without a high probability of a type II error. For the case report analysis, we did separate ephedrine from ephedra. Rand Response  No response  It was beyond our resources to obtain safety data (other than published data) from Denmark. We added to the future research that this would be a good study to undertake.  A3-46   Appendix 3. Reviewer Comments (continued) Reviewer Comment Denmark Experience. Ephedrine/caffeine combinations are used extensively in Denmark for weight control purposes. There is a long history and experience that should be considered by RAND. Dr. Astrup has indicated that there are very few adverse event reports associated with such products in Denmark. RAND should contact the Denmark health authority, and/or Dr. Astrup, in order to obtain more information regarding these reports - and should include this information and Denmark experience in the final report. With regard to the adverse event reports, significant amounts of information were often missing; however that was not the fault of the authors, but rather a shortcoming of the MEDWATCH program. If anything the study highlights the inadequacy of voluntary reporting systems for adverse health effects and the confusion that results when a ""systematic"" analysis is attempted on such data. It is well known among the legal community and the FDA that thousands of adverse events have been reported to ephedra supplement manufacturers. Access to these reports might have affected the outcome of the present study. If anything these additional reports would have magnified the gravity of the public health threat attributable to ephedra-containing supplements. Moreover, Poison Control Centers throughout the country also log calls on ephedra supplements. Were attempts were made to access these additional resources? There was a thorough search of relevant articles using 9 electronic databases. Both national and international journals were included and the searches appeared to capture most of the relevant studies. The majority of the accepted articles for the meta-analysis were from the U.S. It seemed that 3 were from Germany. There were no studies from Asian journals. Table 19, I do not understand the point of this table or the conclusions being drawn. Please clarify for the simple minded. We did not contact Poison Control Centers. We did include in this revision an assessment of the reports made to one manufacturer. Rand Response  No response  We have added text to explain this table. The point is the later cases, that we did not have access to, contained proportionately more deaths.  Timing of last ephedrine (ephedra) dose? If it was > 24 Such cases were not reviewed, so a hours, because of the relatively short half life, one would not negative toxicology screen would not even expect to detect much or any in the blood at autopsy. Is have been assessed. timing of last dose with a tox screen negative test taken into consideration when determining causality? Insert percentage next to the # of adverse events for easier direct comparison of the placebo and intervention groups Instead of the 5x4 (nxn) test, it may be better to perform the chi-square test on event type vs. data type, ie. death (vs. other) x data type (2x3), stroke x type, etc. We do not feel this comparison is justified due to small sample sizes, that is why we did not perform meta-analysis. We are not sure what this comment applies to.  A3-47   Appendix 3. Reviewer Comments (continued) Reviewer Comment There were clear criteria used to select studies for inclusion in the report. The appropriate criteria were used to assess the studies on efficacy of weight loss with ephedra or ephedra/caffeine. Rand Response No response No response  The initial draft failed to include a review of the published These published case reports are now case reports of adverse events. Given that these case included in this revision. reports were published in peer-reviewed medical journals and are prepared by medical professionals, they are likely to contain data that is more complete, accurate, and of scientific merit. It would seem more appropriate for these reports to have been evaluated and included in this report, especially since no other entity has conducted a review of them, than to once again include an evaluation of the FDA's evaluation. Currently one must read to page 54 to get an answer to the This information is in the appropriate place key question, ""We interpret this data as indicating the use of for an EPC evidence report. ephedra is associated with a statistically significant 1.3 pounds of weight loss per month more than is associated with placebo for up to four months of use"" and ""We interpret these data as indicating that the use of ephedrine and caffeine is associated with a statistically significant 2.2 pound weight loss per month more than is associated with placebo up to four months duration."" This should be in the very beginning of the report. The 19 efficacy studies not pooled in the analysis because they had a duration of less than 8 weeks, and the 9 studies eliminated for a variety of reasons should be accounted for in the document, and any serious adverse event reports described should be included in the report. These studies were included in the safety analysis.  We added that these events would be ""Even in aggregate the clinical trials only enrolled sufficient number (how many?) of patients to detect a serious adverse classified as ""rare."" event rate of one per one thousand."" And again on page 58: ""For studies of ephedra, there was only sufficient statistical power in aggregate to detect a rate of serious adverse events if three in one thousand."" For the reader, it would be helpful to know how these event rates, 1/1000 and 3/1000 compare with those reported in the literature for drugs in the same usage category as ephedra (three billion servings in 1999), i.e. to HRT (approx, 3.8/1000 women has an MI or developed breast cancer), or to event rates for aspirin and GI bleed. References 104 and 108: The Nasser study (ref.108) is the same as the first Boozer study (ref.104). This duplicate study has now been removed from the pooled analysis.  Under Bibliography Accepted Articles, pp 135 137, This duplicate study has now been references 12 and 41 are the same study [12=published removed from the pooled analysis. study, 41 = published abstract], leaving 4 studies that assessed the effect of ephedra + herbal caffeine. Data reported in Chapter 3 Results including Table 14 will need  A3-48   Appendix 3. Reviewer Comments (continued) Reviewer Comment to be corrected and re-analyzed. Monthly Weight Loss. In your results section you report the data as ""Monthly"" weight loss. The rationale for this escapes me. Weight loss with all medications slows with time and a plateau is reached between 4 and 6 months. Thus, the most rapid weight loss occurs in the first month. In trials that last 6 months, the only weight loss will be slower than one that lasts 2 months. How do we compare them with this criterion? Miscellaneous Comments. On page 11, the draft report acknowledge that the ""estimate of use of ephedra containing products may be low."" Despite this, the report fails to emphasize denominator-related concerns associated with adverse event report reviews. This major scientific weakness needs to be acknowledged as part of the adverse event report analysis in a manner similar to that used in prior AHRQ studies (such as the Garlic Report). On page 29, the draft report indicates that although certain studies did not record any data for certain even category or indeed any adverse events at all, such studies were not included in the adverse event meta-analysis as RAND did not assume zero observed events if a study did not mention a particular type of event. Is this approach consistent with most scientific reviews? The Garlic Report. The draft report, as noted above, is in many ways inconsistent with prior AHRQ reports that address adverse event case reports. The AHRQ Garlic Report (Garlic: Effects on Cardiovascular Risks and Disease, Protective Effects Against Cancer, and Clinical Adverse Effects), and statements contained in the Garlic Report, should be reviewed by RAND as a potential model for the ephedra report - particularly in the manner case reports are assessed and described. For example, the Garlic Report provides the following with regard to adverse event reports and confounding factors: Adverse effects of oral ingestion of garlic are ""smelly"" breath and body odor. Other possible, but not proven, adverse effects include flatulence, esophageal and abdominal pain, small intestinal obstruction, contact dermatitis, rhinitis, asthmas, bleeding, and myocardial infarction...The frequency of adverse effects with oral ingestion of garlic and whether they vary by particular preparations are not established...Furthermore, the causality of the adverse effects was not clear, except for the breath and body odor, and the expected frequency of adverse effects was not determined... In addition to the RCTs, 73 studies were found that addressed diverse effects. Most (97 percent) were case reports or small case series (Evidence Table 9). The literature reviewed gives a limited picture of adverse effects We tested, given the data available in these trials, whether weight loss differed across the different months. We could find no evidence that it did. Therefore, within the limited time frames of these trials (4 months), we included all relevant data points, as it increased our statistical power. We did assume zero events for serious events like death or stroke even if they were not recorded in the RCT. We did not do so for other events because we could ever know whether those events were sought by the investigators if they were not recorded. In other words, we did not assume zero for the entire universe of adverse events, only for those specifically mentioned and sought and recorded as zero. This is consistent with most high quality scientific reviews. Rand Response  The inclusion criteria and reporting of studies in the Garlic Report were shaped by their TEP and their Partners. The inclusion criteria and reporting of studies in our ephedra report were shaped by our TEP and our Partners. There is no requirement that these reports be the same in inclusion and reporting.  A3-49   Appendix 3. Reviewer Comments (continued) Reviewer Comment attributable to garlic for many reasons. First, searching for studies that report adverse effects is difficult. Many studies may mention adverse effects in passing, but do not use adverse effects as a key index word or in their abstracts. If these studies do not otherwise meet selection criteria in a review, they will be missed. Second, in most case reports and case series, adverse effects cannot be directly attributed to garlic because chance, coincidence, or confounding factors could have been responsible for the adverse effect. For example, alternative causes of reported adverse effects were possible in 22 percent of the reviewed studies and could not be excluded definitively in 69 percent. Third, case reports and case series may miss delayed adverse reactions because such associations are more difficult to make than those that occur immediately after garlic is administered. Fourth, although case reports and case series can provide qualitative information about the nature of an adverse effect, incidence cannot be estimated from such evidence... The frequency and severity of adverse effects that are related to garlic should be quantified. Whether adverse effects are specific to particular preparations, constituents, and doses of garlic should be elucidated. Whether certain adverse effects are unique to particular types of garlic exposure (e.g. inhaled, oral, or topical) should be clarified. The most serious potential adverse effects of garlic that have been cited are complications related to bleeding. Whether particular preparations and constituents of garlic affect physiological parameters related to bleeding such as platelet adhesiveness, prothrombin time, and partial thromboplastin time, as well as whether particular preparations lead to clinically significant bleeding, warrants more study. (emphasis added). The limitations of the review process are not stated. You have adverse reactions and inconclusive studies on the effectiveness of ephedra/caffeine. That leaves us with insufficient information to make an assessment of either safety or efficacy. In the data synthesis, the impression is given that there is more precision than can be justified based on the nature of the data. Possible bias of the report due to members of the TEP and literature captured. Limitations and quality of the studies and short-term studies used in the systematic review. Combining the systematic review by meta-analysis with the analysis of AERs. No conclusions for herbal ephedra and weight loss. The AERs evaluated were limited to those provided by FDA. AERs from the studies were not reviewed. Report did not emphasize any potential benefits of ephedra/ephedrine and weight loss. We disagree with regard to the reviewers comments on precision. Precision is determined mostly by sample size and number of studies. We believe our pooled results adequately reflect the degree of precision the data allow. The AERs from other sources are now included in this revision. We disagree that the report did not emphasize the potential benefits of ephedra/ ephedrine use and weight loss. The other limitations are noted. Rand Response  A3-50   Appendix 3. Reviewer Comments (continued) Reviewer Comment Reference 29 can provide a national estimate of 2.5 million individuals using ephedra wt loss products (during 19961998), which is probably an underestimate since 33% of one-states respondents did not know that their nonprescription weight loss product contained ephedra. Some of the questions guiding the evidence report were not answered but are available in the literature search and data collection. For example, the question regarding the dosage level of ephedra necessary to achieve weight loss was not answer. There is no summary statement on the dose of ephedra or ephedrine other than Evidence Table 1 and 2. Rand Response The imprecision noted by the reviewer even in this one estimate is, we believe, good reason to avoid its use in trying to calculate a rate using case reports. A dose analysis is included in this revision.  Conclusions regarding the efficacy of ephedra-containing No Response supplements in promoting weight loss and the enhancement of exercise performance were supported by the available data. The conclusions are clearly and concisely laid out and are consistent with the evidence presented. The conclusions of the efficacy of ephedrine and related compounds are valid for the short term studies evaluated and conclude that longer term studies need to be conducted. The remaining conclusions are valid and appropriate. For the efficacy and minor adverse effect evaluations, the evidence does support the conclusions. Finally, there was no demonstrable effect of sustained ephedrine supplementation on strength training. According to the report, caffeine appears to enhance the effect of ephedrine yet there is no mention of assessing caffeine in the diet. This would have to be done in a casecontrol study. It may be appropriate to add this separate bullet under conclusions. No Response No Response  No Response No Response The need to control for caffeine intake was added to a bullet in the conclusion.  Bullet 1: Conclusion of ""sufficient evidence"" should be Changes made to bullets. tempered with reference doses used and duration of treatment in the studies.-Bullet 2: This is just a statement not a conclusion. It would become a conclusion by adding that out of 1848 cases known, 1344 were selected for review and of these, 158 showed serious adverse events. Within this subset of 158 reports, 11 were identified in which ephedra was possibly causal. Conclusions section should be able to stand alone. This would require adding more detail including doses and duration. It is generally acknowledged in the field of obesity research that any study with less than a 2-year follow-up is misleading and not relevant to the evaluation of the antiobesity modality under investigation. The reason for this is that most individuals regain lost weight on any diet, drug or weight loss program after 24 months There were no longWe believe the text is clear that these results cannot be extrapolated beyond four months. The data support a linear relationship for weight loss over 4 months in these studies.  A3-51   Appendix 3. Reviewer Comments (continued) Reviewer Comment term weight loss studies of ephedra or ephedrine reviewed in this report, yet a mathematical formula for weight loss associated with ephedra was presented. This seems highly speculative and hard to defend. The conclusion that shortterm weight loss can be achieved with herbal ephedra and caffeine rest on studies of herbal concoctions that are not adequately characterized, chemically and pharmacologically, to permit pooling of studies; The attempt to quantitate the weight loss per month attributed to the use of ephedra-containing herbs is invalid. Further, the model assumes constant weight loss over time, an unlikely outcome. The need to add caffeine to ephedrine to produce any measurable degree of enhanced athletic performance suggests caffeine alone may suffice to achieve this effect, which, in any event, is evident for only short time periods. The reviewer is incorrect, since one study reported in the athletic performance section compared ephedrine, caffeine, and their combination, and reported only the ephedrine/caffeine combination produced an effect. This result refutes the reviewer's hypothesis that caffeine alone may suffice. The literature cases are now included in this revision. Rand Response  It seemed that the decision to review FDA adverse event reports produced very little useful information and was almost a duplicate effort given Haller and Benowitz study. It may be more useful to use the same strategy on the case studies reported in the literature. The bullet point ""Scientific studies (not additional case reports) are necessary..."" should be deleted as this is not the conclusion of the Adverse Consequences but rather Future Research, which has been stated already. Dr. Leung made the point that there were thousands of Chinese literature on the Ma Huang, and if it wasn't safe the literature would say so. The literature comments that some people should not take it, but there is a lot of information to show that it is safe. Dr. Leung also made a point on the credibility of this information by stating that for other herbs the literature shows they are not safe.  We think it important to also include this as a conclusion.  We do not disagree that there may be extensive Chinese literature on MaHuang but we did not find controlled trials in our literature search, nor was this literature offered to us by any of the many reviewers of this report. Furthermore, we believe that there is ample evidence to support that the most valid conclusions come from properly designed hypothesis testing studies, not a collection of anecdotal literature, either supporting or refuting safety.  I disagree with the safety conclusion of this report for two We added to the limitations the issue of reasons: select patient populations. It was outside 1. The clinical trials excluded patients at risk, thereby our scope to assess other chemicals. reducing the study's ability to detect harmful effects of the drugs. 2. The totality of prior pharmacologic information was ignored in the analyses of the FDA cases. The consistency between the type of events reported and the known actions of ephedrine to increase heart rate and blood pressure must contribute to the assessment of causality The similarity of  A3-52   Appendix 3. Reviewer Comments (continued) Reviewer Comment the reports seen with similar chemicals, e.g. phenylpropanolamine, must be given consideration. The cases that the authors classify as ""possibly caused"" by ephedrine/caffeine I would classify as ""probably caused by"" ephedrine/caffeine. I believe the second bullet under ""Adverse Consequences"" (page 112) is unclear and unqualified. This statement reads, ""There have been a great number of adverse event reports filed with FDA regarding herbal ephedra-containing dietary supplements."" I find this statement unqualified and unhelpful. A great number of reports compared to what?  Total dietary supplements sales? The number of AER's reported for other dietary supplements? The statement should be better qualified, in my judgment. The first bullet on page 113 is a very key issue and I believe deserves further comments. I agree with the conclusion that, given the rarity of serious adverse events associated with ephedra, properly designed case controlled studies would be appropriate. However, I believe it will be difficult to develop such a properly designed case controlled study, as the underlying factors (that appear to be idiosyncratic) are not well understood. How, then, would a case controlled study be designed to take such unquantifiable factors into account? This is precisely the continuing problem in deciding how best to approach both the regulation of and further scientific research into ephedra The conclusions seemed fair and stated appropriately. I would suggest adding a section answering the questions you posed at the start of the report in a summary fashion. Most of the studies reviewed were on synthetic ephedrine and weight loss, therefore, a relationship between herbal ephedra and weight loss cannot be made and this appears problematic. The clinical data that were examined only included ephedra in combination with another herbal stimulant. While it is true that many weight loss products contain a combination of ingredients, not all do (NNFA's database of ma hang or ephedra reveals that almost half of the products do not contain another stimulant). A concern is that the conclusions drawn in the report may be applied to all ephedra products, regardless of use and regardless of whether other ingredients are present. It seems important to mention that apparently healthy individuals have died from the use of these products, possibly related to exacerbation of previously undetected disease. And, because these products are available without prescription, and not even regulated as OTC drugs, the risk associated with unsupervised use are potentially greater than with drug formulations of ephedrine. The conclusions of adverse consequences are internally We believe 2000 is ""a great number"" by most people's definition and have not made any changes. Rand Response  It is beyond the scope of an EPC evidence report to go into such details of study design. We note, however, that others have made detailed proposals to governmental agencies for just such a study.  We organized our bullets to follow the order of the questions. We now include one RCT of ephedra without caffeine. We have limited the conclusions to only those concoctions studied.  We have added to the conclusions and limitations both of these points.  We disagree since the finding of serious  A3-53   Appendix 3. Reviewer Comments (continued) Reviewer Comment inconsistent. Once the limitations are listed, then the number of serious adverse events (death, stroke, and myocardial infarction) should not be enumerated. This is the same thing as saying that results of a scientific study are not statistically significant and then still enumerating them in the conclusion. The most important conclusion is listed second to last on Page 113 and should be moved up to the front of the conclusion section of the report. That is, scientific studies (not additional case reports) are necessary. I disagree that a case-control study would be the next step. Rather I would recommend strongly a prospectively randomized controlled study design with appropriate data safety and monitoring in place. A population-based study will have the same drawbacks as the phenylpropanolamine study and will have the same risk of spurious associations rather than cause and effect relationships. An intervention study and not an epidemiologic study is needed to clarify the situation. As already stated, it is clear that the evidence does not support the conclusions. The adverse event reports are that they are. The attempts to connect them to the use Ephedra/Caffeine remain unconvincing both in this report and in the New England Journal of Medicine article. Rand Response adverse events in otherwise healthy young people is a cause for concern. We also disagree that the phenylpropanolamine study found a ""spurious"" association. We note that a case control study is the accepted study design to quickly assess a possible relationship between an exposure and rare adverse events.  Specific issues related to ephedra are not addressed We clarified that the use of ephedrine to adequately, and notions for which there is no proof are raise blood pressure intraoperatively is presented as if they were accepted scientific fact. For with parenteral use. example, in the Pharmacology section, the report states ""ephedrine increases peripheral resistance and can lead to a sustained raise in blood pressure...Elevations in blood pressure appear to be dose dependent in humans. However, does under 50 mg do not always result in increased blood pressure."" The report fails to state that the sustained raises seen in hypotensive patients occur after the intravenous, not oral administration of ephedrine. The only citation for the dose dependency of an ephedrinerelated rise in pressure is a review article, and that article does NOT say that ephedrine causes hypertension! It says, ephedrine and caffeine cause a greater increase in systolic pressure than ephedrine alone, that there is no effect on diastolic pressure, and that hemodynamic effects are transient. The statement is quoted out of context and is therefore misleading. The way the sentence is written, readers would be likely to assume that, even though ""doses under 50 mg do not always result in increased blood pressure, a series of double-blind, placebo control trials have shown that at most the effects of oral ephedrine on blood pressure are negligible (as opposed to intravenous dosing used b anesthesiologists). A partial listing of some of these studies is cited here [10-23]. The lack of effect on blood pressure is even supported by the list of TEP ""accepted articles"" cited in  A3-54   Appendix 3. Reviewer Comments (continued) Reviewer Comment the bibliography. All of the cited articles were from controlled clinical trials, and none reported clinically significant blood pressure elevations. These studies should be included as part of the RAND review, and the statements regarding increases in blood pressure should be substantially revised. Indeed, if the authors of the report cannot cite published, double-blind placebo control studies showing that taking oral ephedra/ephedrine significantly increase blood pressure, that that claim should not be included in the report. Suggested directions for research were provided, but they are narrow in scope and may suggest ""gaps"" that do not really exist. To date, more than 2000 ephedra/ephedrine users have been enrolled in clinical trials. Given the consistently benign results of all the previous trials, are still more trials needed before the issue is put to rest? On the other hand, cutting edge issues in obesity-related research are completely ignored. Does ephedrine interact with uncoupling protein? Does use of ephedra supplements have any effect on the production of inflammatory cytokines by adipose tissue? Or upon lepton homeostasis? On Lipotoxicity? If supplement manufacturers are to be believed, they have thousands of testimonials from satisfied users reporting weight losses of 50 pounds or more. Why not study these individuals and compare them with other product users who were unable to achieve weight loss? Having identified a population of proven ephedra responders, and non-responders, comparing the two groups medically, chemically, or genetically, may provide some truly useful insights. The report draws conclusions about efficacy and safety that are not sufficiently supported by the data. As I have pointed out below the efficacy of ephedrine/caffeine is underestimated due to the incorrect method of analysis. In addition, in my view a number of shortcomings in the safety assessment tend to exaggerate the adverse events. My overall conclusion is that in several aspects the report needs some important revision. This includes the identification of studies, selection of studies for efficacy and safety. The data handling is also inadequate in some aspects. Consequently the report's overall conclusions are not supported in the current version and I believe that the revision suggested below will produce a substantially changed conclusion. Weight Loss. In the first bullet it is stated that compounds produce weight loss over relatively short periods of time (no more than a few months). This is misleading as there are trials for a duration of 6 months. The same applies for the 3rd bullet where the expression ""short-term weight loss"" is used Bullet 6 is outrageous here it is concluded that We would ask the reviewer whether 2000 successful airplane flights mean that airplanes never crash. The point is that 2000 studied patients is insufficient to detect a rate of 1/1000 events, and even rare events, when multiplied by the millions of people who may be consuming ephedra, add up to numerous serious adverse events, if such an association exists. Rand Response  No response to this general comment. Specific response made to specific comments. We disagree that the identification of studies, selection of studies, data handling, etc. are inadequate. We also disagree that our results underestimate the efficacy of ephedrine/ caffeine, or that our analysis is incorrect.  Six months is still ""a few months"" when one year data are considered necessary by FDA to assess pharmaceuticals. The data about phentermine are taken directly from the graph in the cited reference. We have added data about weight loss using  A3-55   Appendix 3. Reviewer Comments (continued) Reviewer Comment Rand Response other pharmaceuticals. ephedrine and ephedrine plus caffeine produce a weight loss somewhat less than the effect reported for FDA approved pharmaceuticals for weight loss. The panel has used phentermine as an example and state that the effect is ""reported at about 20 pounds of weight loss at 6 months"". This is certainly not the weight loss produced by phentermine above placebo, the weight loss produced by phentermine from baseline including a diet. For comparison one can take the Astrup et al. study from 1992 where the weight loss in the ephedrine plus caffeine arm was about 16 kg. But of course, the weight loss in the placebo arm must be subtracted, giving an additional weight loss produced by the compound of 3.6 kg. Adverse consequences. Again, this reviewer suggests that Our statement refers to the data included the open trials should also be included. In the first bullet it is in our review, which was restricted to stated that it is not possible to separate out how caffeine RCTs and CCTs. contributes to the side-effects. This is actually possible. In the Astrup et al. in International Journal of Obesity in 1992 there was a separate caffeine arm in the 6 months trial. Side-effects are shown in one of the tables in this paper, and here it is clear which side-effects can be attributed to caffeine. A long-term study of comparing ephedra + caffeine with ephedrine + caffeine at promoting weight loss and adverse reactions. Expand the pharmacokinetic study of ephedrine (pharmaceutical preparation) and ephedra (botanical preparation) absorption (as part of the dose response studies). The most basic and important aspect of any research in natural products and in the reporting of findings is the characterization and clear definition of the products or materials being studied. Without this, research findings cannot be reproduced and thus are meaningless. In our case with ephedra evaluation, we not only need to set criteria for selecting articles for study, but also be sure to clearly understand what it is that we want to study  ephedra herb or ephedrine. The whole field of `ephedra' in weight loss and athletic performance is twisted backwards. The herb ephedra has never been traditionally used for either function, nor has it been first clinically reported (before ephedrine) to have these effects. Only the drug ephedrine has. Yet ephedra is being used for these effects and is touted as natural ephedrine and thus safer. So far, there has been no credible clinical evidence that ephedra itself (and not synthetic ephedrine in an inert `ephedra' carrier) has these actions, despite the conclusion reached in this report. It is worthwhile to reevaluate references 104-108 to determine whether the `ephedra' used in those studies was actually natural ephedra containing the total complements of We think this is already subsumed under the first bullet point.  The included ephedra studies said they assessed herbal ephedra. We agree with the reviewer that a future study of ephedra should adhere to these recommendations.  A3-56   Appendix 3. Reviewer Comments (continued) Reviewer Comment ephedrine alkaloids in their natural proportions. If not, was it composed mainly of synthetic ephedrine formulated with carriers (e.g., token ephedra or exhausted ephedra marc) into an `ephedra' dietary supplement that contains little or none of the usual complements of other ephedrine alkaloids? If it is the latter, then this `ephedra' herb has no place as a dietary supplement in weight loss or athletic performance. Such `ephedra'-containing products should then be more appropriately placed under the OTC-drug category which would eliminate much of the problems currently associated with its abuse and also would save us taxpayers much money trying to resolve these problems. In order to show ephedra herb (not synthetic ephedrine) to also have efficacy in weight loss and/or athletic performance, it is necessary to first characterize and standardize ephedra products to specific amounts of ephedra's alkaloids in their natural proportions, before subjecting them to clinical trials. This would eliminate the drug ephedrine being formulated into a dietary supplement to bypass the OTC-drug regulations. Unless ephedrine-containing products (whether natural or synthetic) for weight loss and athletic performance are all considered OTC drugs, adulterated, poorly characterized, and undefined dietary supplements containing ephedra herb will continue to be sold and abused. We need to set standards for manufacturers to meet and follow in order to be able to label and market their ephedra-containing products as dietary supplements. As I have repeatedly stressed, the most important aspect of any research in herbal medicines/supplements is characterization and precise definition of the test materials, without which no meaningful and reproducible results can be achieved, no matter how well designed and how well executed the rest of the research. In order to reduce the continued accumulation and dissemination of ambiguous, meaningless, and useless research data in the natural products field, we urgently need to set criteria for the characterization and precise definition of test materials at three levels: (1) research; (2) publication; and (3) abstracting, indexing, and data input into databases. Such criteria have been published and are available. The conclusion that ""a properly designed case control study would be the appropriate next step"" would require a study so large, lengthy and expensive it is unlikely to ever be funded or completed. (If one assumes a prevalence of use of ephedra of 1%, an alpha of 0.05, a power of 80% and if one seeks to detect a doubling of risk, then 2,400 stroke cases and 2,400 unaffected controls would be required. See Schlesselman, Case-Control Studies, Oxford University Press, 1982). The presumed benefits of ephedrine, should they exist (improved athletic performance enhanced We agree that a properly designed case control study would need to be large (perhaps not as large as this reviewer conjectures). However, the PPA case control study was also large and was successfully completed, and we do not favor substituting opinion for science when the scientific study is feasible. Rand Response  A3-57   Appendix 3. Reviewer Comments (continued) Reviewer Comment energy, short-term weight loss) are likely due to the sympathomimetic effects of the drug and the adverse consequences are predictable as they were with isoproterenol, amphetamines and fenfluramine. Since sympathomimetic drugs have never been shown to result in safe and sustained weight loss, it is highly unlikely that this will be the result of long-term controlled trials of ephedrine and weight loss. But the known adverse effects of the drug and its congeners are now well characterized. First, you need to organize your listing of sources of adverse event information better so that readers can see which sources you have included and which you have not. Right now, it's difficult to follow what you have gathered. A table would be ideal, with each row specifying the source, the number of complaints, the number of deaths, serious injuries, non-serious injuries, and the numbers of each of these you concluded are likely or possibly related to ephedra use. You do not provide clear evidence of the pharmacological and pharmacokinetic equivalences in the use of the herb or of ephedrine alone. The complexity of the Phytochemistry of Ephedra (p 13) reinforces the point that the whole herb contains other alkaloids that are likely to be active or to qualify the effect of ephedrine. More should be made of this deficit at various points in the text. All of the serious adverse events came from FDA data, so in the draft report such a table would have no meaning. In the revised report, such a table is included. Rand Response  We agree that there is likely heterogeneity in the herbal concoctions, but note the striking consistency of our findings relative to amount of ephedrine alkaloid and weight loss.  There is insufficient evidence that dietary supplements We disagree and believe the data speak made up of the herb Ephedra spp. have any of the effects or for themselves. risks identified for the alkaloid ephedrine. The future research directions proposed are reasonable. This was added to the future research. One addition may be to recommend examining the interaction of ephedrine and exercise training on weight loss and adverse events. Is there some interaction between physical activity and ephedrine? If the majority of ephedra users are seeking long-term weight loss, it would be very helpful to better understand the age, gender, race, temporal use patterns, concomitant drug use and other risk factors associated with ephedra usage. These points are underdeveloped and are, I believe, central to understanding safe and appropriate use of ephedra in the general population. I agree with the suggestion to analyze and compare the adverse events reported for ephedrine to ephedra. I would also add PPA. We agree in principle with this comment, but think it might wait until there is better evidence of sustained weight loss in any population.  This report now includes an assessment of ephedrine so this bullet has been eliminated.  The suggestion to consider a dose response study to While it may be difficult, it is certainly determine a minimum effective dose of ephedra would be feasible and consistent with the way FDA difficult, at best. Effectiveness criteria should be identified in evaluates pharmaceuticals for weight loss. these comments.  A3-58   Appendix 3. Reviewer Comments (continued) Reviewer Comment Rand Response There remain open questions whether there is a difference Agreed. between synthetic ephedrine and naturally extracted ephedrine alkaloids. It would be a very useful research activity to analyze the branded products which are identified in AER's using both AOAC and USP methods to try and determine whether synthetic or naturally occurring ephedrine alkaloids are present. Future Research. The ""numerous gaps"" in the literature regarding the efficacy and safety of ephedra is a central point. No response  FDA has recently taken action against six companies selling No response synthetic ephedrine as dietary supplements. This is not permitted under current law but, unfortunately, synthetic ephedrine dietary supplements are being sold to the general public. As a final thought, the inadequacy of FDA's adverse event This is not a proper role for an EPC reporting system is clear as it relates to ephedrine. I believe evidence report and we decline to make it is appropriate for RAND to recommend that, with respect such recommendations. to ephedra products, FDA/CFSAN's process and systems to evaluate and capture ephedra-related AER's be thoroughly reviewed, as it is likely that continued reliance will be placed on this system, despite its weaknesses. A chapter was devoted to future research. The researchers No response addressed the gaps in a variety of areas and suggested meaningful recommendations for further research. Most significant is the need for long-term studies of ephedra/ephedrine and weight loss and athletic performance including both anaerobic and aerobic exercise. This was emphasized in this chapter. It might be beneficial to explain the pathophysiology of how ephedra/ ephedrine can contribute to an acute cardiovascular event in the setting of mild-moderate underlying disease. For instance, in individuals with noncritical coronary artery disease, ephedrine alkaloids can produce platelet aggregation with resultant thrombus, increased myocardial oxygen demand, and cause vasospasm, all of which can result in decreased perfusion and ischemia. The same contributory actions could be expected in individuals with congenital cerebral aneurysms, and other underlying abnormalities in the cardiovascular system. While we agree that biologic rationale is an important criterion when assessing causality, we think that direct evidence of an association is most important, and therefore recommend a hypothesis-testing study.  The implications for future research are fairly stated. I would This was added to the Future Research suggest adding the analysis of safety or adverse events Section. reports in Denmark comparing available prescription obesity drugs, since Denmark uses caffeine and ephedrine as one of it's approved prescription drugs for obesity. Are implications for research discussed? Not adequately. The major implication of the research is whether the The role of the EPC is to report the evidence which we believe we have done  A3-59   Appendix 3. Reviewer Comments (continued) Reviewer Comment analysis will be adequate to advise the FDA and HHS on whether they should take action to protect the public. This aspect of the analysis is ignored. What directions for future research would you recommend based on this report that we have not covered? As I discuss in the following general statement, the missing ingredient in this (in addition to the issue of how the products are being used by the public) is the need for an analysis of the complete pharmacology of ephedrine/caffeine products. This must include consideration of the modern science of pharacogenomics and genetic polymorphisms of receptors for these products. This type of analysis adds relevance and credibility to adverse events that occur in low frequencies. It explains how some patients can have little or no change in blood pressure or heart rate and how some can be placed at risk of stroke, seizures or heart attacks. Implications for future research were discussed. Physicians and most pharmacologists seem to want to lay the blame for problems associated with ephedra supplements at the feet of ephedrine/ caffeine. This narrow view excludes the pharmacological activity or potential interactions with other phytochemicals present in these products. In the opinion of this reviewer, the problem is more complex than simply ephedrine and caffeine. Regarding future research aimed at stroke aspects, it would seem valuable to pursue case-control studies along the lines of that by Kernan and colleagues cited above but considering both hemorrhagic and idiopathic ischemic stroke in relatively young adults. Rand Response The judgment about the adequacy of the evidence to make a judgment is not a role for the EPC. A good suggestion, but one that we feel is probably some years off, as opposed to the three studies listed first. A genetic analysis could conceivably be added to a case control study and used as an effect modifier in the analysis.  This is a good point. An assessment of ephedra use may be able to take advantage of the heterogeneity in concoctions to perform subgroup analyses looking for ingredients other than ephedrine and caffeine.  Agreed. The proposed case control study should assess all of the serious outcomes we assessed.  Page 5, paragraphs 3 and 4 would it be appropriate to We do not think so. The exposure has mention ethical considerations for case-controlled studies in already occurred. the summary? Page 5, paragraph 4: ""Pre-clinical studies should also be considered to determine the use of ephedrine or ephedrine containing the alkaloids increases the risk of development of heat related conditions such as heat exhaustion, heat stroke, and rhabdmyolysis, if an appropriate animal model can be found."" What specifically would be learned from this? Could it be extrapolated to humans? Rewrite to redirect emphasis of sentence by placing, ""If an appropriate animal model can be found, pre-clinical studies should be....and rhabdomyolysis."" I would suggest come additions to the section of future research including an interaction study to investigate the effects of ephedra with not just caffeine-containing herbs, but also combined with botanicals such as citrus aurantium, garcinia cambogia and the herbal diuretics and cathartics It might help establish a biologic rationale, but in this discussion we have deleted the ""animal model"" and ""pre-clinical aspect"" to this and suggest it be included in a study of adverse outcomes in humans.  We actually eliminated the ""preclinical studies"" part of this and suggest a study assessing this as a potential adverse event. These suggestions have been added.  A3-60   Appendix 3. Reviewer Comments (continued) Reviewer Comment as listed in Table 1. Also, I would specifically suggest that studies on athletic performance be conducted in women and adolescents, since these populations are known users of these products. Finally, I would recommend that the association between ephedra and seizures be formally explored. Future Research Section. You favor a case-control study. The case-control trial with phenylpropanolamine was sufficient to remove the drug from the market, but it was a pretty poor study. The controls and cases had very different lifestyle habits. There was a no-dose-response to PPA. The effect was only detected in women. Because of the large number of things used in the many products on the market, and the relatively high rate of deaths and disability from heart disease and stroke, it is not clear that a useful answer would emerge. Another point that available data it is populations are at and that this could research. might be useful to make is that from the not possible to determine which greatest risk for serious adverse events, only be determined by additional We disagree. We think such a study would tell us something useful about ephedra products. We do not think the heterogeneity in the components of the products will be any greater impediment to the analysis of safety than it was to efficacy. Our data are consistent with the hypothesis that the only active components with respect to efficacy and safety are ephedrine and caffeine. This point has been made in our suggestion for a hypothesis testing study. Rand Response  A3-61   Appendix 3. Reviewer Comments (continued) CAUSALITY COMMENTS The remaining reviewer comments from the first review concern an attempt in our draft document to assess causality for some adverse events. We did so using our own modification of published methods. These comments varied widely, ranging from critiques of our method for being too conservative (meaning, in the opinion of some reviewers, we had excluded or assigned too low a level of causality to certain cases) to critiques for being too liberal (meaning, in the opinion of some reviewers, we assigned too high a level of causality to certain cases). Often, these conflicting comments concerned the same cases. We believe these peer review comments demonstrate that case report reviews involve considerably more subjective interpretation than do reviews of randomized trials. Because our goal in this evidence report is to report the evidence as objectively as possible, we ceased to assign assessments of causality to the case reports. Rather, we tried to identify those cases that would be classified medically as ""idiopathic"" in etiology, meaning the cause is not known. For such cases, given the known pharmacology of ephedrine, if use of ephedra or ephedrine was documented, a potential role for ephedra or ephedrine in causing the event must be considered. We classified such cases as ""sentinel events."" Other than correct typographical errors and respond to questions of fact, we do not provide a response to the numerous criticisms of the causality algorithm or suggestions to change our interpretation of these case reports based on the reviewer's opinion or ""additional information"" they posses that we did not have in the documents available to us to review. Reviewer Comment Although the present study was compared to that report by Haller and Benowitz (New England J Med), why was a comparison not made to the Samenuk et al. study (Mayo Clin. Proc.)? Were individual case numbers not available from Dr. Samenuk? On page 51, in Level 2 of the Causal Flow Model, what is meant by ""in more than minimal dose""? What constitutes a minimal dose? Are you talking about ephedrine, ephedrine/caffeine, or ephedra supplements? It must be emphasized that ephedrine and caffeine in conjunction potentially hundreds of other pharmalogically active phytochemicals constitute an ephedra supplement? Accordingly, the pharmacodynamic effects for ephedra supplements are not directly comparable to synthetic ephedrine or ephedrine/caffeine combinations. Furthermore, given the heterogeneity of ephedra supplement formulations, the pharmacodynamic effects of individual ephedra supplements are expected to vary. It should also be acknowledged in the final report that there is very little consistency in the results of any expert attempts at assessing causality with this same set of AERs. The draft touched on this issue in discussing comparison with other reports and in presenting information in Table 22. The language of the draft is not, however, consistent with the data in the table. The draft states that the current judgments ""are more conservative than those of Drs. Haller and Benowitz"" but that there was agreement that some cases cannot otherwise be explained. It is difficult to understand how such statements, with their implication that any differences are either minimal it immaterial, can possibly be associated with the actual information in the table. The table identifies 24 cases 20 of which were evaluated by both this Rand Response  A3-62   Appendix 3. Reviewer Comments (continued) Reviewer Comment group and by Haller and Benowitz. In only 5 of these is there full agreement. Twelve of the 20 cases are cases where Haller and Benowitz report possible or probable causality while the current reviewers reported insufficient information! It is curious that the Table does not note that, of the 11 cases reported by the draft as probably and the 26 cases identified as possibly related to the use of ephedra, Haller and Benowitz only classified 2 of the first and 7 of the second as either probably or possibly related. Information is not provided to assist in understanding whether Haller and Benowitz had classed these as not associated with ephedra of whether they had not evaluated these cases. If the first case, it should be disclosed if the second, there should be some mention that the current causality assessment is preliminary and subject to review by other qualified experts. It is also curious why reviews with different conclusions by other parties were not acknowledged. For example, in at least one case where both this group and Haller and Benowitz agreed that there was a possible causal relation between use of ephedra and death, the local coroner ascribed the unfortunate incident to congenital problem. In addition testimony was given by Theodore Farber, Ph.D. on August 8, 2000 at the HHS Office of Women's Health to discuss the issue of inconsistency at length and in detail. As Dr, Farber noted "" There was a sufficient lack of concordance between the FDA's causality analysis and the causality analysis performed by it outside experts."" Other presenters at this meeting provided analyses of these AERs that found quite different conclusion that have been drawn in the Draft. It must be assumed that the record of this meeting and possibly more specific information, was accessible as the draft was being prepared but it does not appear that any attention was paid to any other commentary on causality reviews to date. This must be corrected. In discussing the case reports the Draft states that ""events related to synthetic ephedrine"" were removed. Notwithstanding out earlier attempt to clarify that synthetic ephedrine probably means ephedrine in isolation (or its salts, e.g. ephedrine hydrochloride), at least 8 of the cases reported on were associated with a product that was labeled to contain ephedrine hydrochloride (the E'OLA product) or was subsequently found, or at least has come out to be assumed to have been manufactured with undisclosed ephedrine salts (Formula One). At lease two cases do not identify the brand so it is not known how this determination was made from these cases. Almost every `Probable"" case and ""Possible"" case had either a preexisting condition that could have contributed to the adverse event or exhibited unhealthy behaviors Rand Response  A3-63   Appendix 3. Reviewer Comments (continued) Reviewer Comment (excessive drinking, smoking, ""intense effort to lose weight"") which should be noted. On p 69 and Table 22 there is a comparison of the results of Rand evaluation of FDA AER with those of Dr. Benowitz  the specific criteria to meet definite, probably or possible causality are explicitly stated for the Benowitz evaluation [as was the case with other expert evaluations of these data in the FDA docket]. It would be useful to specifically list the criteria used for the Rand Evaluation for their classification. It is stated that the Rand evaluation is more conservative than the analysis by Benowitz, but what about comparisons with other expert reviews of these data [2 FDA reviews, Woosley, Benowitz, Ricaurte and Stoll]? Table 22 Summary of comparision with other reports of ephedra adverse events there is an error in the table for FDA case number 12720 and 12722. According to information elsewhere in the report, the following appear to be the correct data entries: Case# Adverse event Benowitz EPC 12720 Death Possible Insufficient information 12722 Death Possible Possible What was the classification of the CanTox study commissioned by CRN? Do you have information as to how soon an autopsy was performed? Could this have any impact on the toxicological screen results? I would assume that the prevalence of pre-existing coronary artery disease is very high. Therefore, when interpretations are made as to causality and risk for most Americans, it may be important to have some reference numbers as to how many Americans have pre-existing CAD.According to the Am Heart Association (using NHANES III data), 1 in 5 males and females has come form of cardiovascular disease, see this website for details about CAD.See American Heart Association. 2002 Heart and Stroke Statistical Update. Dallas, Texas: American Heart Association, 2001.http://www.americanheart.org/downloadable/heart/101 48328094661013190990123HS_State_02.pdf My prior bias about ephedra and stroke was based on influential case-control study of the relationship between the use of phenylpropanolamine, a compound with related physiological effects, and hemorrhagic stroke (Kernan WN et al. NEJM 2000;343:1826-32). I believe that it is likely, reenforced by the data in this draft report, that ephedra use occasionally leads to stroke. However, for the purpose of this review, I have elected to play the devils advocate in considering the specific question: ""how strong is the existing A neurologist was included in the review process in this revision. ""Grand mal"" seizure was the description of the event in the original source material. Rand Response  A3-64   Appendix 3. Reviewer Comments (continued) Reviewer Comment evidence that use of ephedra can cause a stroke?"" Because determining the cause of strokes among young people is not that often straightforward, it would have been optimal to have the stroke cases reviewed and classified by a stroke expert with experience in evaluation of young stroke. The case reports (p.63) suggest a lack of neurological sophistication (i.e. grand mal seizure in case 11062 is not technically correct; generalized convulsive seizure is probably what was intended). OK,so this is an irrelevant elitist comment, but in the absence of hard evidence, credibility is a subjective issue. Case 10874 is categorized as ""probably causal"" : along time intravenous drug abuser with phenylpropanolamine on toxicology screen. Case 9335 is classified as ""possibly causal"": 56 year old woman with hypertension, tabacco use, elevated cholesterol and triglicerides, an MRI with microvascular changes and whose event was lacunar infarct. Case 12713 was ""possibly causal"": a 63 year-old woman with artificial fibrillation with acute loss of conscious and embolic stroke. It would be easy to take issue with classification of likelihood of causality in each case. In short, I agree with the appropriately cautious conclusion that ""there is sufficient evidence to suggst a possible causal role of ephedra-containing dietary supplements in rare, but serious adverse events, particularily cerebral hemorrhage."" (p.vi) Support for this statement would be better served by have a stroke expert review the case reports and perhaps tossing our the marginal cases (such as noted above). Further, since this authoratative report may eventually be used for medical-legal purposes, it would seem responsible to include a caveat that it is not sensible to consider all strokes of idiopathic cause in people taking ephedra as caused by the agent. These comments are not meant to disparage the overall quality of this impressive report. As noted at the outset, I have elected to play the devil's advocate concerning this specific aspect. The criteria for determining causality were arbitrary and did not address the true causality. In fact, the term ""causality"" is misleading in this connection. Rather, the term ""association"" should be used as in ""guilt by association"". Lay people will read this report and ""probable causality"" will be interpreted as a cause-effect relationship which is not warranted by the data available from medical record reviews. The limitations of the data collection are not emphasized enough in this report. Adverse reactions reports by definition have no denominator and are subject to reporting bias. In the famous Phen-Fen debate, initial reports on which the FDA took action suggested at 35% incidence of valvular abnormalities. Subsequently, this was found to be less than 8% and reversible following discontinuation of the Rand Response  A3-65   Appendix 3. Reviewer Comments (continued) Reviewer Comment medications. It is very important to the integrity of this report that the basic questions asked in the contract are answered, that the report is well ordered, and that only scientifically valid information is included. If the AER information, which is not scientifically valid is included, it should be included as an appendix, not in the body of the report, as this takes away from the science. Use of the terms probably and possibly causally related may make the causality assessment sound more objective than it is. Would be the subjective natures of the assessment be more effectively conveyed by changing those AERs currently designated as probably causal to possibly causal, such as events if uncertain relationship? Instead of specific designations it might be adequate to describe the results in narrative form. The narrative could explain that although in some cases cofounders make it difficult to attribute causality, there is a subset of cases in which cofounders make it difficult to attribute causality, there is a subset of cases on which cofounding factors are minimal or absent as far as can be determined, and it is these cases that raise concern over safety. Whatever terms or phrases are used, defining them early in the document will help even those unfamiliar with adverse event causality analyses understand their meaning. Should make it clear that it is not possible to determine the actual level of risk for people taking ephedra or ephedrine because the number of people who actually take it is not known. It would be helpful to provide possible reasons for the differences between the RAND causality assessment and the one done by Haller and Benowitz, this could be done by adding text to point out that: I. Each group used different criteria. II. The same group of experts would come to different conclusions of they were using different sets of criteria for evaluating the same set of AERs, and III. The RAND report use more stringent/restrictive criteria for assigning causality than were used in the Haller and Benowitz review, resulting in more conservative assessment. Requirement of angiography for assigning causality for M.I.s to Ephedra (similar comments from two reviewers): Page V Paragraph 5:"" for cases of myocardial infarction, we required coronary angiography to have been performed and the results available."" This seems like a very restrictive set of myocardial infarction cases. What would be the effect on the results if angiography had not yet been done? Why was this restriction used?

Pages 3 and 32: While we understand the importance if documenting the occurrence of myocardial infarction by restricting the documentation of the event so that the cardiac characterization is required to assign causality to ephedra, are the number of MI events being underestimated? Why not also use enzyme changes in laboratory specimens and Q-wave changes on the EKG to assign causality? ""`Probably not causal' was used for events that had clear other causes discovered on detailed investigation."" This assumes all events had a single cause. But can't someone with known atherosclerosis die suddenly because of superimposed effects of a substance. This sentence is confusing "" In the 935 reports, there were data in 968 subjects of which 925 reported taking ephedra."" Not clear how there can be more subjects than reports. A case presented (#12843, 15-year-old female) without any reference to ephedra exposure. Absent that information, it would be hard to make this even a possibly causal classification. A couple of reviewers were confused by the mention of We added text to try and help explain this. AERs that took place after September 30, 2001. Perhaps a footnote on the table would be informative to remind readers if the timeframe for the AERs analyzed. Table 20 provides a lot of useful information, but it might be easier for readers to interpret the data if another table were added. This table would have 5 columns across the top, labeled Product, #Probably Causal, #Possible Causal, # Insufficient Information, and Total (terminology may change based on other comments). Data from the case report of the death of a 28-year-old female indicates that the MiniThin was one of the products that she was taking. MiniThins were shown to contain synthetic ephedrine, not ephedra, and the FDA required the company stop marketing it for weight loss and change the name and marketing focus (product name was subsequently changed to MiniTwoWays and was marketed for use on people with bronchial asthma). Should this AER be included there? Specific cases. Page 60, Deaths, Probably Causal: A 21year-old male collapsed..."": This patient has been taking hydroxycut, which I assume is hydroxy citrate. Hydroxy citrate is probably quite toxic, though it has not been systematically assessed in clinical trials. Biochemically it may be assumed to have a substantially liver toxic effect. I think it is therefore very difficult to attribute the case to ephedrine. I think that there are too many examples of patients with many other risk factors such as those included We considered but did not make any changes to this table. A different kind of Summary Table is included with this revision. A single FDA MedWatch report can contain information on more than one person. Rand Response  This case was included in the ephedra FDA MedWatch file. The patient was also taking Yellow Jacket.  A3-67   Appendix 3.

Page 62, Deaths, Probably Causal (cont'd): Page 62: Another example is the ""Stroke, Probably Causal"": ""She was a long-time intravenous drug abuser and alcohol abuser. She also smoked cigarettes for 10 years."" She tested positive for benzodiazapines and phenylpropanolamine, whereas there was no positive test for ephedrine. I strongly disagree with the conclusion that this case can be classified as probably causal with respect to ephedra use. It is more likely, with the given history and the positive test of the patient, that the stroke was caused by other vaso-active drugs taken by the patient. These weaknesses apply to several of the other stroke cases, and I think this is particularly interesting in light of the metaanalysis of adverse events reported from control trials (Table 17, page 80) where it is found that there is no statistically significant increased risk of hypertension. This also quite clear from the control study by Ingerslev et al. on hypertensive patients treated with ephedrine/caffeine. One should therefore be cautious about drawing conclusions on the causality with respect to stroke. HHS and GAO Statements Regarding the Same AERs that RAND Reviewed. The draft report attempts to ascribe degrees of causality to the ephedra AERs, thereby ignoring recent statements by the Department of Health and Human Services and the General Accounting Office (""GAO""). HHS and FDA recently reviewed the same AERs that RAND reviewed, and issued a response to Public Citizen on June 14 that provides the following: The primary purpose of a voluntary adverse event reporting system is to generate 'signals' of potentially related events, rather than assessing product safety. While a 'signal' has been generated by these reports, FDA has determined that questions remain on the likelihood and strength of association between ephedrine alkaloids and the adverse events reported to the FDA... There are situations when background rates of the observed event are so rare or unusual that, in combination with physiologic responses and biologic plausibility, a significant relationship between the events is self-evident from the reports in a voluntary reporting system. However, the FDA has advised me that the types of observed outcomes reported in relationship to the ingestion of ephedrine alkaloids are not uncommon in the general population and therefore the reports alone do not provide a scientific basis for assessing the safety of ephedrine alkaloids or establish a link between the reported adverse events and the ingestion of ephedrine alkaloids. (emphasis added). The draft report should mention and cite the aboveRand Response  A3-68   Appendix 3. Reviewer Comments (continued) Reviewer Comment mentioned letter and FDA's and HAS' position with regard to the AERs and attempts to ascribe causality. The draft report also does not acknowledge the GAO report on ephedra AERs, which reviewed the same AERs and determined that they were ""poorly documented,"" further weakening RAND's reliance upon reports for causation analysis. GAO also noted that the AERs have ""inherent weaknesses"" and lacked or had inconsistent information...such as the amount of the product used, how often it was used, or for how long it was used. These limitations were not prominently identified in the RAND report - nor were the general limitations associated with attempts to ascribe causality based upon review of information obtained from a passive surveillance system. GAO also noted that, based upon its review of specific AERs, it was not possible to draw conclusions regarding the ""causal relationship between ingestion of the implicated product and the adverse event observed."" Potential Product Variation. As noted above, the draft report does not even acknowledge the possibility that certain ephedra supplements may not be standardized and/or manufactured according to GMPs. Accordingly, even assuming causation (which is a major assumption), it is conceivable that certain adverse events may have been caused by problems with a specific product (such as having more ephedrine alkaloids or caffeine than stated on the label). Although it is my understanding that most manufacturers of ephedra employ stringent quality controls, this is still nevertheless a significant possibility that should be reflected in the report. Attachment B contains an article prepared by Dr. Gurley entitled ""Content versus label claims in ephedra-containing dietary supplements."" Although this article reviewed only a small subset of ephedra products, and only reviewed a small sample-size of bottles, it nevertheless supports the conclusion that it may be inappropriate to assume that all ephedra products are identical with regard to product quality. Accordingly, even assuming causation, it should be noted that there is no assurance that any potential adverse health events were not caused as a result of consumers ingesting non-standardized products that contain too much ephedrine or caffeine. It would be inappropriate for RAND to assume that consumption of ephedrine and caffeine within labeled amounts is a potential problem if the possibility exists that certain incidents may have been caused by consuming nonstandardized products. Accordingly, my strong opinion is that as part of its review, RAND should call for FDA to finalize dietary supplement GMPs and impose stringent quality control requirements on ephedra manufacturers to ensure that such products contain what they are claimed to contain. Haller/Benowitz Review of AERs The draft report places Rand Response  A3-69   Appendix 3. Reviewer Comments (continued) Reviewer Comment great importance of the review of ephedra adverse events reports conducted by Dr. Haller and Benowitz. In fact, the draft report compares RAND's assessment of AERs with the Haller/Benowitz assessment. The draft report, however, fails to mention that Drs. Haller and Benowitz subsequently wrote a letter to the editor of the New England Journal of Medicine (Attachment C) indicating that their review did NOT prove causation or provide quantitative information with regard to risk. Specifically, their letter provides the following: Finally, our report describes a series of cases in which the use of ephedrine-containing dietary supplements was associated with a diverse cardiovascular events. Our report does not prove causation, nor does it provide quantitative information with regard to risk. A large-scale case-control study similar to the Hemorrhagic Stroke Project for phenylpropanolamine is needed to determine the risks associated with these dietary supplements. Based upon this letter and clarification, it is unclear why the Haller/Benowitz review of the AERs is used as a baseline for purposes of comparison. Moreover, it is unclear why their statement regarding causation and the recommendation of a case-control study is not highlighted as this would appear to be information that RAND should consider as a recommendation for further research. Importance of Background Risk - Kimmel Study. This draft report fails to cite favorable analyses of FDA AERs including a detailed study conducted by Dr. Steven Kimmel that was presented before the Office of Women's Health (Attachment D). Dr. Kimmel reviewed the AERs and determined that the number of events was consistent with background rates in the general population. His report highlights the importance of background risk - an issue that should be highlighted in the RAND report. He concludes that the AERs - even assuming significant under-reporting are not suggestive of causation. In this regard, he quoted FDA"" ""it is possible that the reported serious adverse events are reflective of coincidental background spontaneous occurrences in the population and are not necessarily causally related..."" OTC Drugs Containing Ephedrine and Caffeine. The draft report does not prominently refer to the wide usage in the United States of ephedrine in OTC drug products. The report should include use-data for OTC drugs, and should explain that FDA has already determined - under the OTC Drug Review - that ephedrine is safe and effective (as a bronchodilator) in does well over 100 mg per day (the maximum dose level for the vast majority of ephedra supplements on the market). In addition, the FDA does not require such products to contraindicate caffeine ingestion (i.e. consumers routinely ingest such products along with coffee tea and other beverages that contain caffeine) This Rand Response  A3-70   Appendix 3. Reviewer Comments (continued) Reviewer Comment information must be factored into the final report, as they have a direct bearing on any safety assessment of ephedrine and caffeine. OTC drug use-data indicates that the combination of ephedrine and caffeine is safe. Scientific Data and the Landmark Six-Month HarvardColumbia Trial. The draft report acknowledges that ""there were no serious adverse events reported in these clinical trials."" Despite this, the report barely addresses this issue. Rather, the vast majority of the report reviews and subjectively interprets AERs that GAO, HHS, and FDA have already reviewed. Even though the number of subjects in the clinical studies is limited, and therefore it is conceivable that small subsets of the population may have some susceptibility, the clinical data is far more reliable than the anecdotal adverse event reports and should receive greater prominence than the AERs. In addition, the report does not place enough significance upon scientific data such as the Cantox Report and the landmark six-month HarvardColumbia trial (published in the International Journal of Obesity). The Harvard-Columbia trial addresses the review of adverse event reports, and makes suggestions regarding future research. The RAND report should contain a more detailed discussion of this landmark trial - including the researchers assessments regarding product safety and efficacy. For ease of review, sections of the report addressing adverse event reports, product safety and efficacy, and future research are included below: In a FDA-sponsored analysis, Haller and Benowitz categorized 140 adverse-event reports based on how likely they believed the reported events to have resulted from the use of ephedra supplements. The difficulty in making such judgments is illustrated by the controversy regarding their conclusions. With millions of American consuming ephedra-containing products it is obvious that some number of adverse events is expected each year regardless of consumption of these products. The real question is not whether adverse events occur in a population undergoing treatment, but whether these occur at a rate that is higher than that of a matched, untreated group. This is impossible to determine from adverse event reports alone. The randomized, placebocontrolled trial allows evaluation of cause and effect relationships vs. coincidental events. Most clinical trials purposely exclude individuals with pre-existing medical conditions to avoid confounding of results. It is therefore not justified to extrapolate results from such trials to individuals with such exclusionary medical conditions or to extrapolate results beyond amounts or time periods that have been studied. The possibility of unfavorable interactions between herbal combinations and other medications either prescription or Rand Response  A3-71   Appendix 3. Reviewer Comments (continued) Reviewer Comment illicit, should be recognized and warning labels present on herbal products should be adhered to. Some have expressed the theory that adverse event reports may reflect an unusually high degree of sensitivity in a small fraction of individuals. Because of the low suspected incidence, this type of sensitivity might not be revealed in a clinical trial, but requires a case-control study of a very large number of individuals. Such a study would be difficult to conduct, but may be the only way to address the question of rare hypersensitivity. In total, these [ephedra studies] suggest that herbal ephedra/caffeine herbal supplements, when used as directed by healthy overweight men and women in combination with healthy diet and exercise habits, may be beneficial for weight reduction without significantly increased risk of adverse events. In total, these [ephedra studies] suggest that herbal ephedra/caffeine herbal supplements, when used as directed by healthy overweight men and women in combination with healthy diet and exercise habits, may be beneficial for weight reduction without significantly increased risk of adverse events. The current widespread usage of herbal products and the increasing incidence of obesity warrant additional clinical trials to confirm and extend these results. (emphasis added). Finally, it should be noted that the Harvard-Columbia Trial researchers, and Drs. Haller and Benowitz appear to agree that in order to evaluate the safety of ephedra, a long-term control study would be beneficial. The draft report in the end recognizes the futility of trying to reach scientific conclusions from the AER's, recommending that a case control study be done to assess risk and recommending against further AER analysis. Nevertheless, a detailed causality assessment was performed and included in the draft report, and conclusions of this assessment are presented without context. Further, the draft report describes the involvement of the TEP in a way makes it appear this assessment was done on the recommendation of the TEP., when I and others thought that there was a general agreement within the TEP and RAND further assessing causality based on the AER's was not recommended and would not be part of the ephedra review. The draft report on page 21 states that the ""Highest level if causality that could be ascribed. Was ""probably"" causal"". This is not a position taken by the TEP at the November meeting; in fact it is contradictory to the TEP's position as quoted above. There was a discussion of the characteristics of the case reports, but not in the context as stated on Page 21...""that would be necessary in order to assign a classification of ""probably causal."" The criteria quoted were of causality The report not only implies (also The causality analysis was dropped from this revision. Regarding the involvement of the TEP, there was a lengthy discussion of the criteria by which we would assess case reports, so we are surprised this TEP member concluded ""the TEP"" agreed that such a review was not warranted. We did not receive any such comment from any other TEP member, all of whom reviewed this report. Rand Response  A3-72   Appendix 3. Reviewer Comments (continued) Reviewer Comment on page 31) but also states that the TEP agreed with this causality classification categorization, which was not the case. The classification scheme was developed after the November meeting, and any category such as ""possible causal"" or ""probably causal"" that suggests a causal relationship is in contrast to the position of the TEP at the November meeting. Terminology of ""possibly"" or ""probably"" causal is too strong and more than suggestive of causality, and to suggest that these terms are less than ""definitely"" causal is too fine a point for readers of this report and also an incorrect representation of the TEP's position. If the causality assessment remains in the final report, I suggest that all reference to this classification scheme be changed accordingly, to omit the word ""causal"". The conclusions could be characterized as weak evidence or possibly suggestive evidence, but the words causality and causal are too strong. The draft report notes correctly about the AERs that ""The most important limitation is that the study design, that is an assessment of case reports, is insufficient to warrant definite conclusions regarding causality."" Yet when it came to assessment of individual case reports, there were definite conclusions that the AERs prove ephedra to be unsafe. The result is a misleading presentation of the available information. For the reasons explained above, I feel the report requires major revision and subsequent further review by the TEP. Because I have been focused on the fundamentals of the reports as described above, I haven't even considered the comments on details that are included in the draft report. The weakness of the FDA AER database must be better addressed, and the causality analysis should either be removed from the report or substantial revised to, among other things, provide the necessary context and to change the classification of the AERs to avoid using the terms ""causal"" and ""causality"". The fact that the safety section is dominated buy the AER analysis reduces the credibility of the section and indeed the whole part of the report. However, in the opinion of the reviewer, those conclusions regarding the case reports are limited by a combination of the conservative causality assessment criteria and the limited medical records and toxicology data available for most case reports. For example, hypertension was defined as a systolic pressure in excess of 180 and a diastolic pressure in excess of 105. Also, no consideration appeared to have been given to the contribution multi-component ephedra-containing dietary supplements might have had in those individuals with underlying cardiovascular or cerebrovascular disease. I think it is generally accepted among the medical and scientific community the presence Rand Response  A3-73   Appendix 3. Reviewer Comments (continued) Reviewer Comment of sympathomimetic likelihood of adverse think most clinicians differential diagnosis agents could potentially exacerbate the events in such populations? I would would factor such information into their rather than dismiss them altogether. Rand Response  Adverse Events Reports: One limitation with your approach taken in evaluation of the adverse events reports made to the FDA is that your causality algorithm does not include an assessment of whether ephedra played a contributory role on the adverse event. Because ephedra is available as a dietary supplement, it is likely that many persons taking these products are not using them under doctor's supervision, and may have medical contraindications to their use. Therefore, the role of underlying disease becomes a crucial factor in causation assessment, particularly when a potential risk factor often goes undetected (i.e. essential hypertension, structural heart defect), or when a condition is omitted from the ephedra product label warning (i.e. family history of premature CAD, sickle cell trait). Two AERs that you assess as no higher than possibly causal illustrate this point. AER 12485 did indeed have a moderate degree of coronary artery disease detected at autopsy. However, he was reportedly in good health without history of angina, and had been jogging regularly without adverse effects. Because he collapsed suddenly after returning from jogging, we felt this was a primary arrhythmic event due to ephedra. Similarly AER 12843 was a healthy, adolescent who had participated in competitive sports for many years. She had appeared to have been wellcompensated for a serious underlying coronary artery abnormality that was clinically undetected since birth. Only with use of Ripped Fuel, did she suffer a catastrophic cardiac event resulting in death. We felt that the cardiac stimulant effects of ephedra resulted in myocardial ischemia in this case. It would be helpful to specify what degree of pre-existing This case was reviewed by a cardiologist coronary artery disease would constitute a significant risk who made this judgment. factor to result in myocardial infarction or sudden death in the absence of stimulant use, thereby ruling out ephedra in the causation assessment. (page 32 of chapter 2 methodology). In the case of AER 14530 (page 63), I would disagree that 20-30% stenosis would be significant enough to result in acute M.I. in a 43-year-old female smoker without a significant contributory effect from the ephedra alkaloids in Metabolife. On page 59 I suggest the authors be slightly cautious with We have revised this language. their use of language such as ""probably causal"" and ""no other possible explanation."" The latter phrase is particularly troubling. What they mean is no other explanation that they could identify. Similarly, on page 69 they state that there are a certain number of cases of serious adverse events that  A3-74   Appendix 3. Reviewer Comments (continued) Reviewer Comment ""cannot be explained by causes other than ephedra use."" While I do not deny that it is extremely likely that many cases of adverse events happen due to ephedra use, simply because we do not have in our hand an explanation of why an event occurred other than a particular explanation under consideration, does not mean that the particular explanation under consideration is the correct one. Because of the paucity of large randomized trials, evidence concerning stroke and ephedra by necessity consists of analysis of case reports. ""...An assessment of case reports is insufficient to warrant definite conclusions regarding causality."" (p.110) Nevertheless, arbitrary criteria are used to define ""probably cause"": documentation that a stroke occurred, that ephedra was used, and that there was exclusion of other potential causes. The definition may be too liberal. Of ischemic strokes in relatively young adults (i.e. those <50 years old), perhaps 20-35% are ""idiopathic"" despite thorough evaluation. The definition implies that all idiopathic strokes would be classified as ""probably causal"" if ephedra was used in any dose in proximity to the event. Given the frequency of idiopathic stroke, many (perhaps most) neurologists would consider ""possibly causal"" to be a better designation in this situation. Are there specific clinical circumstances in which the relationship of ephedra use and idiopathic stroke could be certain? Perhaps if acute, striking elevation of blood pressure were known to precede the stroke onset of of angiographic features characteristic of vasospasm were present in the abscence of migrane? Arbitrary to be sure, and not very helpful. The evidence for effectiveness supports the conclusion. Except for AERs, however, little evidence of toxicity is actually provided, and evidence of safety has been largely ignored. No evidence is provided to even suggest ""a possible causal role of ephedrine-containing dietary supplement in rare, but serious events,"" let alone extremely common events such as heart attack and stroke. Even critics of ephedra have concluded that the clinical effects of pharmaceutical ephedrine, and the ephedrine contained in herbal preparations, are indistinguishable. Gurley states that the increased incidence of ma huang toxicity does not stem from differences in the absorption of botanical ephedrine compared with synthetic ephedrine."" Haller and Benowitz, in their most recent publication, conclude, ""Botanical stimulants have disposition characteristics similar to their pharmaceutical counterparts..."" The Cantox Report, and the Report of the Expert Panel of the EEC reached similar conclusions. Since there are no real differences, studies demonstrating the safety of pharmaceutical ephedrine and pharmaceutical ephedrine in combination with pharmaceutical caffeine should not be Rand Response  A3-75   Appendix 3. Reviewer Comments (continued) Reviewer Comment excluded when considering the safety of herbal equivalents. The explanation most frequently offered for alleged cases of ephedrine-related stroke is drug-induced blood pressure elevation, this in spite of the fact that no clinical trial, of any duration, has ever demonstrated that a clinically significant effect on blood pressure exists. Indeed, the studies that have addressed this question. including the most recent paper by Drs Haller and Benowitz, have shown diminishing cardiovascular effects over time. In other words, if dangerous blood pressure elevations do not occur with the first dose ephedrine, they are even less likely to occur with prolonged dosing. These studies should be included in the RAND review of ephedra and should be used to address the question of potential increases in blood pressure and other safety issues. Ephedrine has been studied in more than 50 double blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials, some of long duration. A far from exhaustive literature search produced the attached list of peer-reviewed, published, clinical trials. Most have compared ephedrine to placebo, and to other sympathomimetic drugs used to treat asthma. However, others have involved smoking cessation, sexual function and athletic performance. Nearly a dozen of these trials involved caffeine/ephedrine combinations using does exceeding those found in herbal supplements. In total, more than 2000 individuals have been enrolled in these trials. In several studies there was even continuous cardiac monitoring in middle-aged patients with known heart disease; no effect was observed. No clinically significant episodes of toxicity were reported. Including these and other studies on ephedrine that have been excluded from the RAND review will increase the power of the safety calculations that can be derived from clinical data. One of the major limitations of the report was the composition of the TEP and the reviewers who made subjective assessments of the AERs. Given the importance placed on assessment of AERs, it is unfortunate that no pathologist was included in the view or on the panel. The lack of expertise is obvious from the comments made about the individual AERs. The failure to provide information about any potential conflicts of reviewers also detracts from the study. Why were the findings of Expert Panel of the Ephedra Education Counsel not considered? The analysis of this panel was in some ways unique, as it is the only consensus opinion on ephedra safety. In addition, this panel conducted the most comprehensive review of the ephedra AERs to date, and yet the causality assessment, which conflicted the findings of the draft report, are not even mentioned. If RAND believes that the EEC review and analysis was, in some way scientifically flawed, then the reasons for that belief should be stated. Rand Response  A3-76   Appendix 3. Reviewer Comments (continued) Reviewer Comment The danger of drawing conclusions from AERs without a control group can be illustrated by examining data from randomized trials in which participants are blinded to whether they are receiving the study treatment or inactive placebo. In the placebo group of a recent randomized trial,2 there was an increase in ventricular couplets (extra heart beats) at the 4th week of the study 9from 3% at baseline to around 14% at week 4). This is, of course, not due to the placebo, which is inactive, but rather just spontaneous ventricular couplets that occurred by chance. However, if these participants had been given ephedrine alkaloids in an uncontrolled study (without placebo), this change could have been attributed, incorrectly, to the ephedra. That is, these could be AERs that were attributed to ephedra. In fact, in the controlled trial, a similar increase in ventricular couplets was not seen in the ephedra/caffeine arm. Another example is the 15-year-old female (case 12843) with Bland-White-Garland syndrome who died while playing soccer. This disorder has been associated with sudden death after physical exertion. In the absence of a unique pathologic process, it is almost never possible to establish a causal association on the basis of adverse event reports. There is nothing pathologically or diagnostically unique about the adverse events noted in the ephedra database (e.g., myocardial infarction, stroke) that allow one to distinguish a spontaneous event from one caused by use of Ephedra products. In fact, a review of all autopsy data from ephedra AERs by Dr. Grover Hutchins, a Professor of Pathology at the John Hopkins University School of Medicine and member of the Expert Panel of the EEC, concluded that ""The pathology data available do not show any pattern consistent with ephedrine alkaloid-containing dietary supplements as a cause of death.""5 Similarly, 10 participants in the ephedra/caffeine group (12% of these participants) withdrew because of cardiovascular symptoms (palpitations, elevated blood pressure, arrhythmias). If there were no control group, these also might have been attributed to the ephedra/caffeine combination. However, the same proportion of participants in the placebo group (13%) withdrew for the same reasons. The withdrawal rate in the ephedra/caffeine group thus was consistent with the background rate of these events in a placebo group unrelated to ephedra use. A second limitation of adverse event reports is that other potential causes of the event are often present, making it extremely difficult to determine if an event truly is related to the exposure. As an example, it is well established that physical exertion can trigger myocardial infarctions and cardiac arrest (up to a 74-fold increase in the risk of sudden death, according to a recent report in the New England Journal of Medicine6) Rand Response  A3-77   Appendix 3. Reviewer Comments (continued) Reviewer Comment Therefore, a case such as the 38-year-old man with three vessel coronary disease and a dilated heart who died after jogging could very well have been related only to the physical exertion and not the ephedra. According to his wife, his heart problems had been known for at least five years. In addition, this man had been taking an ephedra product for one year without apparent ill effect. The third limitation of AERs is that their interpretation remains subjective. Even experts in the field will disagree about the possibility that an event may or may not be due to an exposure. The RAND report (Table 22) displays a comparison of the causality assessment between their review panel and a published report by reviewers for the FDA.3 In only two out of 20 cases that both groups reviewed was their agreement about the highest level of possible causality. For example, with respect to the 38year-old discussed above, the Haller and Benowitz review recorded this event as ""Definitely or probably related"" to ephedra while the RAND report classified it as only ""Possibly causal."" Another review of AERs performed by Dr. Theodore Farber and Dr. Norbert Page, members of the Expert Panel of the EEC, reveals similar disagreements. The two ""probable"" cases reviewed by EPC were rated as ""Low Possible"" (case 12980) and ""Improbable"" (case 13418) by Drs. Farber and Page. The fact that the etiology of events can be debated simply illustrates the substantial limitation of case reports that lack a comparison control group. This echoes reviews done by FDA and its consultants in which agreement about causality was poor. For example, two consultants from FDA, Drs. Ricaurte and Stoll, reviewed 28 AERs related to neurological events. Dr. Ricaurte classified eleven cases as ""attributable"" while Dr. Stoll classified only five as ""attributable.""5 Only two of the consultant's findings overlapped - that is, there were only two cases that both Dr. Ricaurte and Dr. Stoll agreed should be categorized as ""attributable.""5 This disagreement is not a flaw of the reviewers, but rather a flaw of AERs. A fourth limitation of AERs is that ingestion of the substance in question cannot always be substantiated. For example, case 10276 is a 32-year-old with an enlarged heart who was found dead in his truck. Although a product that contains herbal ephedra was found in his truck, so were several bottles of cold medications, including Nyquil. Toxicology revealed no ephedrine, but did identify pseudoephedrine and doxylamine, both components on Nyquil. Thus, there is no evidence that this person even ingested the herbal ephedra. A similar case (13096) revealed no ephedrine in a toxicology screen again suggesting that the man had not ingested ephedrine around the time of death. Equally importantly this man died of a disease that appeared to run Rand Response  A3-78   Appendix 3. Reviewer Comments (continued) Reviewer Comment in his family (aortic dissection), including an 18-year-old niece. In summary, AERs cannot be used to assess causality. As stated by several authors with experience in interpreting adverse event reports for the FDA: ""It is probably impossible to do comparative analyses employing ADE [adverse drug event] reports for drugs that have received extensive publicity in the mass media for an adverse event...""7 In fact, the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research pointed out, in a February 10, 2000 memorandum concerning ephedra products, that ""it is possible that the reported serious adverse events are reflective of coincidental background spontaneous occurrences in the population and are not necessarily causally related to [the use of dietary supplements containing ephedrine-type alkaloids]."" The RAND review notes this as well, stating that ""The most important limitation [of their assessment of adverse events] is that the study design, that is an assessment of case reports, is insufficient to warrant definite conclusions regarding causality."" They list this limitation as one of the ""most important...gaps"" in the current knowledge-base. The RAND review also states that ""Disentangling the relative importance of the pre-existing condition and the ephedra use is not possible."" They state further that ""Continued analysis of case reports cannot substitute for a properly designed study to assess causality. A case control study would probably be the study design of choice."" Their Technical Expert Panel also ""judged that case reports alone would be insufficient to establish definite causality between ephedra use and serious adverse events."" Because of these limitations, terms such as ""probably causal"" and ""possibly causal"" in AER reviews are potentially misleading (see, in particular, the ""Conclusions"" section of the ""Structured Abstract,"" page vi, and the ""Conclusions"" section, page 112). They represent only reviewers' assessment of causality based on uncontrolled data and subjective assessments. Although these terms are often used in scientific publications, their use in the RAND report may suggest a level of evidence that does not exist from the current data. These statements, therefore, should not be taken out of context. RAND's stated limitation that ""Definite causality cannot be determined from case reports"" must be kept in mind when interpreting this report. It is also critically important to remember that case reports can produce false signals of cause and effect.8,9 Most importantly, because of the limitation of AERs, it is unclear why the RAND report states, in the Structured Abstract, that ""These [sic] is sufficient evidence to suggest a possible causal role of ephedracontaining dietary supplements in rare but serious adverse Rand Response  A3-79   Appendix 3. Reviewer Comments (continued) Reviewer Comment events, particularly cerebral hemorrhage."" With respect to a possible causal role of ephedra in adverse events, RAND acknowledges that AERs are not sufficient to draw conclusions about causality, consistent with the known limitations of AERs discussed above. In addition, this comment is puzzling given that their ""Conclusions"" section (ages 112-113) does not state this at all. With respect to cerebral hemorrhage, the only comment in the body of the report on cerebral hemorrhage refers to a case-control study of phenylpropanolamine (PPA) and cerebral hemorrhage.10 However, the RAND report refers to this study only as an example of case-control methodology that could be applied in the future to ephedra. The report does not discuss the PPA study further. In fact, this study has been heavily criticized. Despite this, there was not a formal review of this study by RAND (and there were no members of the technical expert panel listed with expertise in epidemiology to perform such a review). In addition, PPA and ephedra have different chemical structures and different pharmacological activities. Finally, the RAND report does not mention that the PPA report also presented data on non-PPA, ephedrine-alkaloid containing products. These agents included medications that contained pseudoephedrine hydrochloride, phenylephrine, ephedrine, and epinephrine. In the report, there was similar prevalence of use of these products among those with and without hemorrhagic strokes. Although this is not a definitive analysis, it suggests that there was no association between these ephedra-containing products and hemorrhagic stroke. Therefore, the statement in the Conclusions section of the Structured Abstract of the RAND report is inconsistent with currently available scientific data. In summary, the RAND review supports the use of herbal ephedra and caffeine for weight loss, an effect that may have beneficial health consequences. The report also suggest, from controlled studies, that adverse events following ephedra use are, at most, rare. (The should not imply that the events are even causally related to ephedra us.) Most importantly, because of the reliance on AERs, the report cannot establish a causal effect of ephedra on serious adverse events. Review of Anecdotal Adverse Event Reports - Limitation of Review. On pages 109-110, the report identifies potential limitations associated with the review of anecdotal adverse event reports. These limitations are buried at the end of the report, rather than being incorporated into the appropriate sections of the report (as per prior AHRQ reports, such as the Garlic Report - see Section IX, herein). Moreover, a number of limitations are not prominently identified, including but not limited to: a) The poor quality of the data and information contained in the anecdotal adverse event Rand Response  A3-80   Appendix 3. Reviewer Comments (continued) Reviewer Comment reports; b) Inherent problems associated with voluntary reporting systems; c) The number of individuals in the general population who experience the adverse events identified (i.e. background risk); d) The possibility that certain products may not have been standardized and/or manufactured according to Good Manufacturing Practices (""GMPs"") - resulting in potential adverse events that have nothing to do with ephedra or caffeine when consumed in recommended amounts. Specifically, in the absence of standardization and quality control, it is conceivable that certain products may contain far more ephedra or caffeine (or other constituents) than indicated on the product label. This possibility must be considered when evaluating anecdotal adverse event reports. In the absence of identical product identity, any general conclusions regarding ephedra and caffeine are inappropriate and highly suspect based upon adverse event reports (see the AHRQ Garlic Report for an appropriate way to address this issue). In my opinion, RAND should strongly support immediate issuance by the FDA of dietary supplement GMPs and should endorse stringent quality control measures to ensure that all ephedra supplements contain what they are claimed to contain; e) The possibility that the consumer abused or misused a product by ingesting more than the recommended amount - or that the consumer ignored detailed product warnings and contraindications. RAND should emphasize the detailed warning label contained on the vast majority of ephedra supplements - and should acknowledge that there is little way to know from anecdotal data whether a consumer abused a product (either intentionally or more likely inadvertently); f) The possibility that the anecdotal adverse event reflects chance, coincidence , or confounding factors - including but not limited to the possibility that ingestion of a different product or substance led to the stated event. I I. Review of Anecdotal Adverse Event Reports - B. Ascribing Causality to Adverse Event Reports - 1. Reliance on Unpublished Article. In order to establish a framework for analyzing the adverse event reports, the draft report relies upon an unpublished article written by Cynthia Mulrow, M.D. Reliance upon an unpublished, non peerreviewed article to establish the framework for a critical portion of the report is entirely unacceptable. AHRQ studies have not, to our knowledge, ever relied upon an unpulished article to establish the framework for this type of analysis. In addition, reviewers such as myself have no way of analyzing the article - thereby defeating one of the primary reasons for review of the draft report. II.

Reviewer Comments (continued) Reviewer Comment summarizes the various methods researchers use to assess causality from adverse event reports. The following nine factors are identified: a.

For example, dehydration or consumption of other toxic substances. e) Prior reaction to same substance. f) Dose response. g) Objective evidence of adverse event. h) Previous conclusive reports. i) Definition of substance. Despite the report's reference to these nine factors, it is my understanding that the report concludes that events are ""probably causal"" based upon a review of only two factors - a and g. The draft report does not explain why RAND believes only two factors out of nine can be used to ascribe degrees of causation to anecdotal adverse event reports. II. Review of Anecdotal Adverse Event Reports - B. Ascribing Causality to Adverse Event Reports - 2. Failure to Review Factors Critical to the Interpretation of Anecdotal Adverse Event Reports (cont'd). The draft report also indicates that three factors are used to determine if an event is ""probably causal"": a) Reasonable certainty that the adverse event occurred. b) Reasonable certainty that the patient took ephedra in a dose and timing compatible with the known pharmacology of ephedrine. c) An adequate evaluation must have been done to rule out other potential causes for the adverse event. The third factor (factor c, above) is exceptionally problematic from a scientific perspective. The report acknowledges that the third factor is subjective. Specifically, in an effort to rule out other potential causes, the report indicates that such a determination was made by determining if the subject had a pre-existing condition that was identified in the adverse event report. Adverse Event Reports. While CRN acknowledges that the judgments made about the AERs were, overall, much more conservative than those made by other reviewers, there is concern that, in some cases, a much more likely explanation was evident, but still possible causality was assigned. Some examples follow, although they are not allinclusive: 1. Case 10276. A deceased truck driver was found with cold tablets, Nyquil and Vick's Formula 44, in addition to ephedra-containing supplements. The toxicology screen was negative for ephedrine, but positive for pseudoephedrine. The much more obvious and likely culprit here would be one of the pseudoephedrine-containing cold formulas, since ephedrine is the dominant alkaloid by far in ephedra products, and the clearance rates for the alkaloids are roughly the same. 2. Case 12843. A 15 year old died of a congenital abnormality of the left coronary artery No ephedrine was Rand Response  A3-82   Appendix 3. Reviewer Comments (continued) Reviewer Comment reported in her system. How could this possibly be causal? 3. Case 10874. A woman with considerable substance abuse problems and some use of ephedra supplements for weight loss tested positive for phenylpropanolamine (PPA), but not for ephedrine or pseudoephedrine. The former is but a minor constituent of ephedra and products derived there from, but were a common primary component of a number of OTC weight loss products until recently. Such products are a much more likely source of the PPA than the ""possibly causal"" ephedra supplements. We have several concerns about the way the information is presented in the sections related to safety. It is AHPA's position that the report's safety assessment section reviews case reports from a passive event reporting system without fully and redundantly disclosing what has already been determined about the nature of the FDA's current AER system. Appropriate disclosures include, at a minimum, a reference to the GAO report on the subject and recognition that the Special Working Group of the office of Special Nutritional (FDA: Food Products Containing Ephedrine Alkaloids, Washington D.C., October 11th-12th, 1995) explicitly stated that such a system cannot, by it's nature, show causality. AHPA recognizes that limitations in the clinical trial data lead one necessarily to consider case reports for an assessment of serious adverse events. The fact that there are no serious adverse events reported in any of the clinical study should however be stressed, even as it is identified as of insufficient statistical power to detect a rate of serious adverse events. This fact should be repeated at the Structured Abstract and in the Conclusions, for example, and the total number of patients in these studies (is that 2319 in the intervention groups?) should be identified. In addition, Table 17 should be expanded to include each of the serious adverse events that are subject to safety review in the draft (e.g. death, myocardial infarction, and stroke) and the number ""zero"" should be entered in both the placebo and intervention columns, if that was in fact the published observation. The Draft contains an extensive review of the specific AER case reports. This inherent emphasis presents an unbalanced appearance with respect to the intent of the original key questions. In comparison, assessment of efficacy is presented in a much more summarized fashion. In arriving at criteria for judging the causal relationship in case reports of adverse effects from ephedra, the concept of biological plausibility is conspicuously absent. All else bring equal, adverse events that are biologically plausible (consistent with the mechanism of action of the drug in question) are more likely to be causally related to drug use We acknowledge that the case reports cannot show causality. We do not need to discuss the findings of other with respect to the adequacy of the FDA AER system. We assessed the information we did receive using explicit criteria, and our findings are reported. Rand Response  We do not favor, as a general rule, adding rows or columns to a Table when all the entries in each cell will be the same. Such information can more expeditiously be conveyed in the text.  We cannot change the amount of space needed to describe what we did.  A3-83   Appendix 3. Reviewer Comments (continued) Reviewer Comment than those, which are not. Sudden death, myocardial infarction, and stroke are biologically plausible toxic effects of ephedra. This should be taken into account when interpreting the data. Clearly there is no right or wrong answer with regard to how much data is needed to judge the causality of an adverse event case report as ""probable"" or ""possible"" but I believe that the criteria used in this review have resulted in conclusions that that are understated. There is nothing wrong with the criteria per se, but using the term ""probable"" for a death that has fulfilled every review criteria (except rechallenge which is by definition impossible) understates the quality of the data and implications of the case. Similarly, the term ""possible"" for cases that have satisfied several but not all criteria makes it sound like these importance of these cases should be minimized, which I do not think is the intent of the report. For example, requiring negative angiographies to support causality for myocardial infarction has a rationale, but will necessarily exclude many or most cases because not all patients have this procedure. The importance of this wording is illustrated by the comparison of the Benowitz ephedrine data and your group's reanalysis of it, which would have downgraded so many case reports as to make the report unpublishable. Instead, It was published and shows a remarkable similarity in adverse event profile with the current report. This congruence of findings is in fact some of the strongest literature support for the conclusions of the current report regarding toxicities from ephedrine and ephedra, and these two reports suggest just that. The alternative to changing the terminology of the report is to provide additional commentary on the interpretation of the findings; that, in a view of 1) biological plausibility, 2) the considerable number of case reports emanating form a spontaneous reporting system, 3) similar toxic effects of pharmaceutical ephedrine, and 4) similar toxic effects of phenylpropanolamine, the findings of the current review are highly suggestive of a relationship between herbal ephedra and serious adverse events such as sudden death, myocardial infarction, and stroke. Discussion at the NIH requested that the title ""possibly causal"" was misleading and should be retitled to indicate more accurately the Rand staff interpretation that there is no proof of causality and while causality is possible, it is not probable. Study Selection. Study selection was not appropriate. Partly for the reasons stated above, but also because of the reliance placed upon passively collected anecdotal data. The mere fact that existing clinical trials contained ""too few Rand Response  A3-84   Appendix 3. Reviewer Comments (continued) Reviewer Comment (subjects) to allow adequate statistical power to access the rate of serious adverse events,"" does not make AER analysis any more reliable or probative. In fact, case reports cannot be ""relied upon to assess serious adverse events,"" except, perhaps for the occurrence of rare disorders such as coronary artery dissection. The decision to include an analysis of AERs is particularly puzzling, given that the TEP chose to reject the Haller and Benowitz analyzing the same AERs (see ""rejected articles"" #195, record #116)! Heart attack and stroke are common disorders in our society, and thousands of ephedra product users would be expected to experience vascular events, even if ephedra did not exist. Analysis of AERs for common disorders, which are even more frequent among the overweight, is virtually guaranteed to show a connection with ephedra use, even if no such connection exists (for example, see the August 1 article, ""Obesity and the Risk of Heart Failure"" in the New England Journal of Medicine). Appraisal of Studies. Important parameters that could alter study results have not been systematically addressed. The brief discussion of obesity is confined to generalities. Obesity is a prothrombotic disease. [1]. Overweight people, presumably the majority of ephedra supplements users, are at greater risk for sudden cardiac death (SCD), and heart disease [2]. The report fails to provide any sort of epidemiologic prospective, leaving the false impression that the occurrence of these disorders among ephedra product users is somehow surprising or unanticipated. In fact, when the GAO wrote its highly critical analysis of the FDA's proposed rule on ephedra products, one of the issues raised was FDA failure to account for the reality that ""there is almost always an underlying background rate for any clinical event in a population, regardless of whether there was exposure to a particular product..."" The RAND report states that 3 billion servings of ephedra were sold in 1999. Assuming that 3 servings are used per day for 12 weeks (as Haller and Benowitz do in the NEJM paper), then there were 12 million users. The accepted rate for sudden death, heart attack, and stroke in the U.S. is 0.1, .5, and .2 percent per year respectively [3]; which means that even if ephedra/ephedrine has absolutely no relationship to any of these disorders, 12,000 cases of SCD, 60,000 cases of myocardial infarction, and 24,000 cases of stroke would still be expected among ephedra users each year. Not providing this information to general readers paints a completely misleading picture and leads to a misinformed, if not false, impression of relative risk. It also repeats the same FDA error already criticized by the Government Accounting Office. Data Collection No effort is made to reduce bias in the The reviewer is incorrect The"

Background In the Federal Register of October 10, 1978 (43 FR 46694), FDA published an advance notice of proposed rulemaking to establish a monograph for OTC antiperspirant drug products, together with the recommendations of the Advisory Review Panel on OTC Antiperspirant Drug Products (the Panel), which evaluated the data on these products. The agency's proposed regulation (TFM) for OTC antiperspirant drug products was published in the Federal Register of August 20, 1982 (47 FR 36492). In the Federal Register of November 7, 1990 (55 FR 46914), the agency issued a final rule establishing that certain active ingredients in OTC drug products are not generally recognized as safe and effective and are misbranded. These ingredients included seven antiperspirant ingredients, which are included in  310.545(a)(4) (21 CFR 310.545(a)(4)). In this rulemaking, the agency is adding one additional ingredient to this section. (See section III.1 of this document.) In the Federal Register of March 23, 1993 (58 FR 15452), the agency requested public comment on two citizen petitions, and a response to one of the petitions, related to the safety of aluminum compounds in OTC antiperspirant drug products. This final monograph completes the TFM and  DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES Food and Drug Administration 21 CFR Parts 310, 350, and 369 [Docket No. 78N0064] RIN 0910AA01  Antiperspirant Drug Products For Over-the-Counter Human Use; Final Monograph AGENCY:  Food and Drug Administration,  HHS. ACTION:  Final rule.  SUMMARY: The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is issuing a final rule in the form of a final monograph establishing conditions under which over-the-counter (OTC) antiperspirant drug products are generally recognized as safe and effective and not misbranded as part of FDA's ongoing review of OTC drug products. FDA is issuing this final rule after considering public comments on its proposed regulation, issued as a tentative final monograph (TFM), and all new data and information on antiperspirant drug products that have come to the agency's attention. DATES: Effective Date: This rule is effective December 9, 2004. Compliance Dates: The compliance date for products with annual sales less than $25,000 is June 9, 2005. The compliance date for all other products is December 9, 2004. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Gerald M. Rachanow, Center for Drug  provides the substantive response to the citizen petitions. Twenty-four months after the date of publication in the Federal Register, for products with annual sales less than $25,000, and 18 months after the date of publication in the Federal Register, for all other products, no OTC drug product that is subject to this final rule and that contains a nonmonograph condition may be initially introduced or initially delivered for introduction into interstate commerce unless it is the subject of an approved new drug application (NDA) or abbreviated new drug application. Further, any OTC drug product subject to this final monograph that is repackaged or relabeled after the compliance dates of the final rule must be in compliance with the monograph regardless of the date the product was initially introduced or initially delivered for introduction into interstate commerce. Manufacturers are encouraged to comply voluntarily as soon as possible. In response to the TFM on OTC antiperspirant drug products and the request for comment on the citizen petitions, the agency received 20 comments. One manufacturer requested an oral hearing before the Commissioner of Food and Drugs on six different issues. Copies of the information considered by the Panel, the comments, and the hearing request are on public display in the Dockets Management Branch (HFA305), Food and Drug Administration, 5630 Fishers Lane, rm. 1061, Rockville, MD 20852. ``OTC Volumes'' cited in this document refer to information on public display. The agency received some ``feedback'' communications under the OTC drug review procedures (see the Federal Registers of September 29, 1981 (46 FR 47740) and April 1, 1983 (48 FR 14050)). The agency has included these communications in the administrative record and addressed them in this document. The safety issues raised by the citizen petitions are discussed in section II.F of this document. The agency believes it has adequately responded to the six issues related to the hearing request; therefore, a hearing is not necessary. II. The Agency's Conclusions on the Comments A. General Comments on OTC Antiperspirant Drug Products (Comment 1) One comment requested that FDA reconsider its position that OTC drug monographs are substantive, as opposed to interpretive, regulations. The agency addressed this issue and reaffirms its conclusions as stated in  VerDate Jan<31>2003  15:48 Jun 06, 2003  Jkt 200001  PO 00000  Frm 00013  Fmt 4700  Sfmt 4700  E:\FR\FM\09JNR1.SGM  09JNR1   34274  Federal Register / Vol. 68, No. 110 / Monday, June 9, 2003 / Rules and Regulations new or amended TFM to address these issues. The agency has determined that there is no need to withdraw, amend, or initiate a new TFM. Since the Panel's report was published in 1978, the procedural regulations for the OTC drug review were revised to comply with the Court ruling in Cutler v. Kennedy, 475 F. Supp. 838 (D.D.C. 1979). The revised regulations (46 FR 47730, September 29, 1981) provide that TFMs and final monographs will no longer contain recommended testing guidelines. The agency is not required by statute or regulation to include testing guidelines as part of OTC panel reports or TFMs. The agency stated in proposed  350.60 of the TFM (47 FR 36492 at 36504) and states in  350.60 of this final monograph (21 CFR 350.60) that ``To assure the effectiveness of an antiperspirant, the Food and Drug Administration is providing guidelines that manufacturers may (emphasis added) use in testing for effectiveness.'' The ``enhanced duration of effect'' and the ``problem perspiration'' issues are discussed in section II.C, comments 10 and 12 of this document. Extended duration of effect claims have been placed in Category I based on data submitted by other comments (see also comment 12). The agency has determined that claims for problem perspiration are outside the scope of this monograph because no data were submitted to support such claims (see also comment 10). (Comment 4) One comment contended that the proposed monograph would have a disastrous economic effect on its company, which markets an antiperspirant product first formulated in 1902 and labeled for excessive perspiration, including keeping the hands free of perspiration (labeled for use on the hands for tennis, racquetball, bowling, football, and other sporting uses), and marketed for prosthesis and orthotic use (for amputees to keep their appliance contact areas dry). To qualify for exemption from the ``new drug'' definition under the 1938 grandfather clause of the act, the drug product must have been subject to the Food and Drug Act of 1906, prior to June 25, 1938, and at such time its labeling must have contained the same representations concerning the conditions of its use (21 U.S.C. 321(p)(1)). Under the 1962 grandfather clause of the act, a drug product which on October 9, 1962 was: (1) Commercially used or sold in the United States; (2) not a ``new drug'' as defined in the 1938 act; and (3) not covered by an effective NDA under the 1938 act, would not be subject to the added requirement of effectiveness ``when intended solely for use under conditions prescribed, recommended, or suggested in labeling with respect to such drug on that day.'' (Public Law 87 781, section 107(c)(4), 76 Stat. 788, note following 21 U.S.C. 321). The person seeking to show that a drug comes within a grandfather exemption must prove every essential fact necessary for invocation of the exemption. See United States v. An Article of Drug * * * ``Bentex Ulcerine,'' 469 F.2d 875, 878 (5th Cir. 1972), cert. denied, 412 U.S. 938 (1973). Furthermore, the grandfather clause will be strictly construed against one who invokes it. See id.; United States v. Allan Drug Corp., 357 F.2d 713, 718 (10th Cir.), cert. denied, 385 U.S. 899 (1966). A change in composition or labeling precludes the applicability of the grandfather exemption. See USV Pharmaceutical Corp. v. Weinberger, 412 U.S. 655, 663 (1973). Although the comment stated that its drug products have been marketed since 1902 with hand perspiration labeling claims, no evidence was submitted to show that the labeling and composition of the products have remained unchanged since either 1938 or 1962, so that they qualify as grandfathered products. The agency requested product labeling from these years on several occasions (Refs. 1, 2, and 3), but none was ever provided. Without such evidence, the products do not qualify for either grandfather exemption. The burden of proof with respect to the grandfather exemption is not on FDA, but on the person seeking the exemption. See An Article of Drug * * * ``Bentex Ulcerine,'' supra. The 1938 and 1962 grandfather clauses apply only to the new drug provisions of the act (see 21 CFR 314.200(e)) and not to the adulteration and misbranding provisions. The OTC drug review was designed to implement both the misbranding and the new drug provisions of the act. (See  330.10 (21 CFR 330.10), 37 FR 9464 at 9466.) The grandfather clauses do not preclude the agency from reviewing any currently marketed OTC drug product, regardless of whether it has grandfather protection from the new drug provisions, in order to ensure that it is not misbranded. Although the comment claimed this final rule would have a disastrous economic effect on its company if antiperspirants can be labeled only for underarm use, it provided no documentation about this impact. The agency notes that while the company's products would need to be relabeled to bear different indications, as long as the monograph conditions are met, the  paragraphs 85 through 91 of the preamble to the procedures for classification of OTC drug products (May 11, 1972, 37 FR 9464 at 9471 to 9472) and in paragraph 1 of the preamble to the TFM in the present proceeding (47 FR 36492 at 36493). (Comment 2) Three comments disagreed with the agency's proposed definition of an antiperspirant: ``A drug product that, when applied topically to the underarm, will reduce the production of perspiration (sweat) at that site,'' (47 FR 36492 at 36503). One comment contended it was unduly restrictive and unnecessary to limit use only in the underarm area because it is not the only area of the body upon which these products could potentially be applied. The comment asked the agency to modify the definition to parallel the pharmacologic activity of the active ingredients and suggested: ``A drug product that, when applied topically, will reduce the production of perspiration (sweat) at that site.'' A second comment stated that the definition limiting use to the underarm only would adversely affect its products labeled for use on the hands and for use with orthotic and prosthetic appliances (to keep appliance-skin contact areas dry). Noting that the agency and the Panel recognized the similarities and differences between axillary and foot perspiration, a third comment stated that ingredients effective in the underarm area are probably effective to control foot perspiration. The agency agrees with the first comment that it is not necessary to specify the area of use on the body in the definition of an antiperspirant because that information is included in the product's labeling. Accordingly, the agency is deleting the phrase ``to the underarm'' from the definition of an antiperspirant in  350.3 (21 CFR 350.3) of this final monograph to read: ``Antiperspirant. A drug product applied topically that reduces the production of perspiration (sweat) at that site.'' The use of an antiperspirant on other areas of the body, as mentioned by the second and third comments, is discussed in section II.A, comment no. 4 and section II.C, comment 14 of this document. (Comment 3) One comment stated that the TFM for OTC antiperspirant drug products was substantively and procedurally defective because it failed to address adequately the Panel's Category III recommendations concerning ``enhanced duration of effect'' and ``problem perspiration'' and failed to state what testing was required to substantiate these claims. The comment requested that FDA issue a  VerDate Jan<31>2003  15:48 Jun 06, 2003  Jkt 200001  PO 00000  Frm 00014  Fmt 4700  Sfmt 4700  E:\FR\FM\09JNR1.SGM  09JNR1   Federal Register / Vol. 68, No. 110 / Monday, June 9, 2003 / Rules and Regulations products could remain in the marketplace after relabeling occurred. The economic impact of this final rule is discussed in section VI of this document. B. General Comments on Labeling of OTC Antiperspirant Drug Products (Comment 5) Several comments contended that FDA should not incorporate the ``exclusivity policy'' in the final monograph by prescribing specific labeling terminology to the exclusion of other truthful nonmisleading language. After these comments were submitted, in the Federal Registers of May 1, 1986 (51 FR 16258) and March 17, 1999 (64 FR 13254), the agency published final rules changing its labeling policy for stating the indications for use of OTC drug products. Under  330.1(c)(2) (21 CFR 330.1(c)(2)), the agency provides options for labeling OTC drug products. The final monograph in this document is subject to the labeling provisions in  330.1(c)(2). In addition, the monograph labeling follows the format and content requirements of  201.66 (21 CFR 201.66). (Comment 6) One comment objected to limiting the terms proposed in  350.50(b)(1), (b)(2), and (b)(3) to ``reduces,'' ``decreases,'' ``diminishes,'' and ``lessens.'' The comment stated that ``lower'' and ``mitigate'' are synonyms for ``reduce'' and other words and phrases state, truthfully and accurately, the effect of antiperspirants. Several comments disagreed with the agency that words such as ``stop,'' ``check,'' ``halt,'' ``end,'' ``eliminate,'' and ``protect'' should not be used in the labeling of antiperspirant drug products, even if preceded by the word ``helps,'' because these words imply the ability to stop underarm perspiration totally and would therefore mislead the consumer about the effectiveness of antiperspirant drug products. The comments mentioned the minority Panel position that ``The Panel did not see scientific data to indicate that a consumer can differentiate between such words as `halts,' `checks,' `stops,' and `ends,' as disallowable words versus `diminishes' and `reduces' as allowable words,'' (43 FR 46694 at 46725). One comment agreed with the minority because a review of the entire record of this proceeding found no studies or data to support a decision to disallow ``protects,'' ``halts,'' ``checks,'' and ``stops.'' Another comment requested a hearing on this issue. One comment disagreed with the Panel's Category II status for the following labeling claims (43 FR 46694 at 46724): ``Dry,'' ``dry formula,'' ``super dry,'' ``helps stop wetness,'' ``completely guards your family,'' ``helps stop embarrassing perspiration wetness,'' ``complete protection,'' ``really helps keep you dry,'' and ``gentle enough for sensitive areas of the body.'' The comment asked the agency to allow these claims in the final monograph. The agency has re-evaluated these claims in light of the comments' arguments and its current policy to provide consumer friendly OTC drug product labeling. The agency is deleting one previously proposed word (``diminishes'') and adding some more consumer-friendly words (``sweat'' and ``sweating'') to antiperspirant product labeling. The agency proposed the word ``diminishes'' in  350.50(b) as one of the optional terms that could be used as the first word of the indications statement. While the word ``diminish'' means to ``reduce,'' the agency does not consider it as consumer-friendly as the other optional words ``reduces,'' ``decreases,'' or ``lessens.'' Therefore, the agency is not including ``diminishes'' in  350.50(b) of this final monograph as an FDA-approved term. The agency rejected the words ``mitigate'' and ``lower'' in the TFM (comment 14, 47 FR 36492 at 36496 to 36497). The agency's position has not changed. While the terms ``mitigate,'' ``lower,'' and ``diminishes'' are not in the monograph and the agency does not favor their use, manufacturers may use these terms, or other words or phrases that truthfully and accurately express a similar meaning, under the flexible labeling policy in  330.1(c)(2). The agency is not changing its position on the use of the word ``helps'' in conjunction with the words ``stop,'' ``halt,'' ``check,'' ``end,'' and ``eliminate.'' In the TFM (comment 14), the agency stated that these words imply the ability to stop underarm perspiration totally and would therefore mislead consumers about antiperspirant effectiveness. Although neither the Panel nor the agency had any consumer comprehension studies to support a decision to disallow this information, the comments also did not provide any data to support these terms. The agency would consider these terms if data are provided to show that consumers would not be misled about the effect of antiperspirant drug products. The agency is not including ``helps protect'' before ``underarm dampness,'' ``underarm perspiration,'' or ``underarm wetness,'' because the language is not clear and could confuse consumers. The agency is not including any ``dry'' or similar claims (``dry,'' ``dry formula,'' ``super dry,'' ``really helps keep you  34275  dry'') in this final monograph because no criteria have been established to define ``dry.'' Thus, what may be ``dry'' for one manufacturer's product may not be ``dry'' for another manufacturer's product. The agency would consider including ``dry'' claims in the monograph if appropriate criteria for such claims are developed. The agency is not including claims such as ``complete protection'' or ``completely guards your family'' in the monograph because there is no evidence that antiperspirant drug products provide ``complete'' protection. The agency is not including the claim ``gentle enough for sensitive areas of the body'' because the words ``sensitive areas'' may imply that the product can be used on other body areas in addition to the underarm. The agency is not including the claim ``helps stop embarrassing perspiration wetness'' because what is ``embarrassing'' or ``problem'' perspiration for one individual may not be ``embarrassing'' or a ``problem'' for others. (See section II.C, comment 10 of this document.) The agency is not including both ``perspiration'' and ``wetness'' in the same claim because it considers the duplicative wording unnecessary. The currently allowed claims are ``* * * underarm wetness'' or ``* * * underarm perspiration.'' The agency would have no objection to ``* * * underarm perspiration wetness,'' but such would have to be done under the flexible labeling provisions of  330.1(c)(2). The agency is adding the words ``sweat'' and ``sweating'' in  350.50(b) as other ways to describe ``wetness'' and ``perspiration,'' because consumers regularly use these terms to describe perspiration. Based on the previous discussion, the agency concludes that a hearing is not warranted on these issues. (Comment 7) Three comments requested that OTC antiperspirant drug products be exempted from the keep out of reach of children and accidental ingestion warnings in  330.1(g) because these products are not toxic by oral ingestion. One comment noted only one reported ingestion in 30 years of marketing antiperspirant products. Another comment stated that aerosols, in particular, should be exempt from the ingestion warning due to the characteristics of the delivery system and the warnings already required for aerosols pressurized by gaseous propellants under  369.21 (21 CFR 369.21). Although the comments did not submit any data to show that antiperspirant drug products are safe if ingested, the agency believes these products should not be toxic by oral  VerDate Jan<31>2003  15:48 Jun 06, 2003  Jkt 200001  PO 00000  Frm 00015  Fmt 4700  Sfmt 4700  E:\FR\FM\09JNR1.SGM  09JNR1   34276  Federal Register / Vol. 68, No. 110 / Monday, June 9, 2003 / Rules and Regulations avoid excessive inhalation. There are many people who would not deliberately misuse the product who should be alerted to keep away from their face and mouth and to avoid excessive inhalation. The warning appears in the final monograph in more consumer friendly language and in the new labeling format as follows: ``When using this product [bullet] keep away from face and mouth to avoid breathing it.'' (See  201.66(b)(4) for description of a ``bullet.'') C. Comments on Category III Effectiveness Testing (Comment 9) Several comments objected to user perception testing to substantiate Category III effectiveness claims. (See comment 24, 47 FR 36492 at 36499.) The comments contended that the user perception test is not reliably indicative of product effectiveness and offers at best a crude index of activity that is difficult to employ for precise qualitative and quantitative evaluations. The comments considered objective gravimetric sweat collection procedures more reliable than user perception testing to assess antiperspirant activity levels and requested that user perception testing be deleted. Three comments submitted data on user perception testing of Category III claims, including extra effective, 24-hour duration, emotional sweating, and foot perspiration (see section II.C, comments 11 through 14 of this document). The agency has determined that userperception test data support emotional sweating, 24-hour protection, and extra effective claims. Accordingly, the agency concludes that there are sufficient data on user perception tests (including both user and independent observer perception tests) for use of antiperspirants for the underarm. No further user perception tests are necessary if an underarm antiperspirant shows at least 20 percent sweat reduction by gravimetric tests for emotional sweating and 24-hour protection claims or 30 percent sweat reduction for extra effective claims. Adequate user perception tests have not been conducted for parts of the body other than the underarms, such as the hands or feet. The agency will still require user perception and other effectiveness data to support use of antiperspirants on the hands and feet (see section II.A, comment 4 and section II.C, comment 14 of this document). (Comment 10) Several comments objected to the Category III status of the claims ``problem perspiration'' and ``especially troublesome perspiration.'' One comment contended these claims are not inherently misleading or untruthful and many people who do not perspire heavily may, at times, consider themselves to have ``problem'' or ``troublesome'' perspiration. Other comments objected to the agency's definition of problem perspiration as affecting the upper 5 percent of perspirerers, contending that a more realistic approach would be to let consumers define the meaning of these words by running efficacy studies on people who identify themselves as having problem or especially troublesome perspiration. One comment objected to the economic consequences of testing the top 5 percent of the population to establish a ``problem perspiration'' claim, because this could raise the price for one efficacy evaluation from the current $5,000 to $10,000 up to $200,000. The comment requested a hearing on this issue if FDA did not revise its approach. No data were submitted to the agency to show that any OTC antiperspirant drug product is effective in reducing ``problem'' or ``especially troublesome'' perspiration. The agency is not aware of any products that currently qualify as effective for those conditions. If products are found to be effective in the future, the agency will include a definition and labeling for ``problem'' or ``especially troublesome'' perspiration in the monograph. The agency proposed in the tentative final monograph that a 30 percent reduction in sweat production in the upper 5 percent of perspirerers is necessary for a ``problem perspiration claim'' (47 FR 36492 at 36500). As discussed in section II.C, comment 9 of this document, gravimetric testing is sufficient to prove these claims. The agency would find acceptable an antiperspirant effectiveness study on a population of individuals who perceive themselves to have ``problem perspiration,'' as one comment suggested. Based on changes in the testing to support these claims, the agency concludes that a hearing is not needed. (Comment 11) Several comments objected to the agency's proposed Category II classification of the claims ``extra strength,'' ``extra effective,'' or any other comparative effectiveness claims (see comment 19, 47 FR 36492 at 36498). The comments argued that if manufacturers can demonstrate by appropriate testing and methods of statistical analysis that one product is more effective than another, they should be permitted to so inform consumers. The comments noted that the agency had approved an NDA for an acetaminophen ``extra strength'' product and allowed sunscreen products to label  ingestion for most individuals. However, individuals with renal dysfunction or immature renal function (i.e., infants) are at a higher risk from any exposure to aluminum. Further, ingestion of the various inactive ingredients present in these products may make young children ill or cause other undesirable consequences. Without adequate proof of safety if accidental ingestion were to occur, the agency has no basis to exempt OTC antiperspirant drug products from the accidental ingestion warning. Although aerosol antiperspirant drug products are unlikely to be accidentally ingested by most consumers, the agency notes that the product containers are similar to those used for some food products. Spraying an aerosol into the mouth and ingesting it could be more hazardous than ingesting other dosage forms of the product because of the aerosol propellants. The warnings required under  369.21, for those drugs in dispensers pressurized by gaseous propellants, are not related to ingestion, but state the following: ``Avoid spraying in the eyes. Do not puncture or incinerate. Do not store at temperatures above 120 F. Keep out of reach of children.'' The agency does not consider these warnings a basis to exempt aerosol antiperspirants from the accidental ingestion warning required by  330.1(g) for topical drug products. The last statement of the warning required by  369.21 and the first warning required by  330.1(g) (i.e., ``Keep out of reach of children.'') are identical as of March 17, 1999 (64 FR 13254 at 13294). Section 350.50(c)(4)(ii)) of the final monograph requires aerosol antiperspirant drug products to bear the language in  369.21. These products do not have to repeat the first general warning required by  330.1(g) but need to have the accidental ingestion warning required by  330.1(g). (Comment 8) Two comments objected to the proposed warning in  350.50(c) for aerosol antiperspirants, which states: ``Avoid excessive inhalation.'' The comments argued that the warning duplicates and gives less information than the current warning required for aerosol drug products under  369.21. Section 369.21 requires the following warning statement for a drug packaged in a self-pressurized container in which the propellant consists in whole or in part of a halocarbon or hydrocarbon: ``Use only as directed. Intentional misuse by deliberately concentrating and inhaling the contents can be harmful or fatal.'' The agency does not consider this warning (which addresses deliberate misuse) as being the same as a general statement warning people to  VerDate Jan<31>2003  15:48 Jun 06, 2003  Jkt 200001  PO 00000  Frm 00016  Fmt 4700  Sfmt 4700  E:\FR\FM\09JNR1.SGM  09JNR1   Federal Register / Vol. 68, No. 110 / Monday, June 9, 2003 / Rules and Regulations their degree of effectiveness. One comment requested a hearing on this subject. To prove the validity of comparative claims, two comments submitted both gravimetric and perceptual data (Refs. 4 and 5). Another comment submitted gravimetric data only (Refs. 6 and 7) and stated that one study showed that a 10 percent difference in antiperspirant effectiveness can be measured with currently marketed antiperspirant products. This comment stated that adequate data (Ref. 8) had been submitted to the Panel (43 FR 46694 at 46715) to show that as differences in antiperspirant performance levels increase, larger numbers of consumers perceive the difference. These data included a chart plotting differences in sweat reduction against the percentage of subjects who noted variations in axillary wetness. The chart shows that at 20 percent sweat reduction, approximately 45 to 50 percent of the subjects noticed a difference; at 35 percent sweat reduction, approximately 60 percent noticed a difference; and at 50 percent sweat reduction, approximately 75 percent noticed a difference. The comment contended that this study confirmed the Panel's determination that the user can perceive a shift of at least 10 percent in antiperspirant effectiveness and that a product providing a 30 percent or greater sweat reduction is perceived as more effective than a standard antiperspirant. The comments requested monograph status for ``extra strength'' and ``extra effective'' claims, as qualified by gravimetric studies. The agency has determined that some of the studies (Ref. 4) meet the Panel's ``guidelines for user perception test to be done for claims of `extra-effective' to be classified as Category I'' (43 FR 46694 at 46730). In these studies, two solid stick antiperspirant products (containing either 10 percent or 25 percent aluminum chlorohydrate) were compared by both a gravimetric and a user perception test. In the gravimetric test, 91 female subjects used the 10percent product, and 88 used the 25percent product. A 17-day conditioning period with no antiperspirant use was followed by four daily applications of one of the products to a randomly selected axilla (armpit or underarm). The opposite axilla received no treatment and served as the control. Baseline sweat production was determined the first day of the test. On days two and three, the antiperspirant was applied and 1 hour later a sweat production sample was collected. On day five, 24 hours after the fourth application, a sweat production sample was collected. Both the 10- and 25percent products were more effective than the no treatment control for all time periods according to the statistical methods (Wilcoxon signed rank test) in the agency's guidelines for effectiveness testing of OTC antiperspirant drug products (Ref. 9). Evaluation of the Z values for the two 1-hour test days and the 24-hour test day showed that both products were statistically (Wilcoxon test) at least 20 percent better than the control axilla for all time periods (p < 0.001 for all three cases). Thus, both products met the requirements for standard effectiveness, i.e., a minimum of 20-percent reduction in underarm perspiration. Applying the same statistical methods to a 30-percent reduction in underarm perspiration on the last 24-hour data showed that the 25-percent product was more effective than no treatment (p < 0.001) and, thus, met one of the extra effective criteria. The same study design was used in the user perception test except that the subjects applied the 10-percent product under one axilla and the 25-percent product under the other axilla. On day five, 24 hours after the fourth application, the 100 female subjects were asked ``Under which arm do you feel drier?'' All subjects had a preference: 33 favored the 10-percent product and 67 favored the 25-percent product. A statistically significant number of the subjects were able to perceive that the 25-percent product was more effective than the 10-percent product (p = 0.0005 one-sided). This result exceeded the Panel's requirement that 58 out of 100 subjects have a preference for the test antiperspirant (43 FR 46694 at 46731). Thus, these studies showed that the 25-percent aluminum chlorohydrate met the Panel's criteria (gravimetric measurements and user perception) for an extra effective claim. The agency has determined that the studies indicate that gravimetric testing shows an adequate difference between a standard antiperspirant (with a 20percent reduction in sweat) and an antiperspirant with at least a 30-percent reduction in sweat, as required by the Panel, to support an ``extra effective'' claim. The agency stated in the tentative final monograph (47 FR 36492 at 36499) that once the level of activity that is perceivable by users has been established using the Panel's recommended guidelines, it will not be necessary to perform user perception testing on individual products. Accordingly, the agency concludes that no further user perception testing is necessary for an ``extra effective'' claim, which is being included in the monograph for those antiperspirant  34277  products that reduce underarm perspiration by 30 percent or more using the guidelines for effectiveness testing of antiperspirant drug products referred to in  350.60. The Panel placed ``extra-strength'' claims in Category II because it concluded that ``the presence of more active ingredient in an antiperspirant product cannot be used as a basis for a claim of added effectiveness because additional amounts of antiperspirant active ingredient do not necessarily result in improved product effectiveness'' (43 FR 46694 at 46724). The Panel also stated that ``the term `extra-strength' normally refers to increased concentration of the active ingredient which would normally mean added effectiveness.'' Several comments agreed that more active ingredient may not yield more effectiveness. Thus, a product containing 20 percent of an active ingredient (compared to 15 percent) that did not provide 30 percent or more sweat reduction could not claim ``extra strength'' or ``extra effective.'' The agency does not believe that for antiperspirants the claim ``extra strength'' is as informative to consumers as the claim ``extra effective.'' The agency considers ``extra effective'' to be the key information that consumers want to know to select an appropriate antiperspirant product. The agency is including this new labeling claim in  350.50(b)(4) of this final monograph. Based on this discussion, the agency concludes that a hearing is not needed on this subject. (Comment 12) Several comments objected to the Panel's Category III classification of claims for enhanced duration of effect, such as ``24-hour protection,'' ``one spray keeps you comfortably dry all day,'' ``prolonged protection,'' etc. (43 FR 46694 at 46728). One comment stated that if an antiperspirant product can be shown to provide the required 20-percent reduction in perspiration under hotroom conditions for 24, 48, etc. hours after application, then duration claims have been substantiated. Three manufacturers submitted gravimetric studies (Refs. 4, 7, 10, and 11) that used a hotroom to induce sweating and measured sweat collected in cotton pads twice over a 24-hour period. The tested ingredients showed a 20-percent or more reduction in sweat production for both collection times, which the comments contended satisfied enhanced duration claims such as ``24 hour protection'' and ``all day protection.'' One comment added that its data (Ref. 11) support a variety of product forms (cream, roll-on, solid  VerDate Jan<31>2003  15:48 Jun 06, 2003  Jkt 200001  PO 00000  Frm 00017  Fmt 4700  Sfmt 4700  E:\FR\FM\09JNR1.SGM  09JNR1   34278  Federal Register / Vol. 68, No. 110 / Monday, June 9, 2003 / Rules and Regulations claim, an antiperspirant product must reduce sweat production by at least 20 percent over a 24-hour period after application using the guidelines for effectiveness testing referred to in  350.60. Antiperspirant products that meet the extra effective criteria (see section II.C, comment 11 of this document) over a 24-hour period can be labeled with both extra effective and enhanced duration claims (e.g., ``24 hour extra effective protection,'' ``all day extra effective protection,'' ``extra effective protection lasts all day,'' etc.). Claims of enhanced duration for more than 24 hours are nonmonograph because the agency has not received any data to demonstrate antiperspirant effectiveness for more than 24 hours according to the Panel's criteria. (Comment 13) Several comments objected to the Panel's Category III classification of claims for control of emotional sweating, e.g., induced by tension or stress (43 FR 46694 at 46728). The comments contended that a product's antiperspirant activity is the same whether the sweat is due to thermal conditions or emotional factors. Some comments disagreed with the need for additional testing, especially consumer perception testing, to establish these claims. One comment requested a hearing. One comment submitted clinical data (Refs. 7 and 12) which it contended showed: (1) There is a valid scientific protocol that combines a gravimetric sweat test with a word-quiz stress test to measure reduction in emotionallyinduced sweat; (2) an antiperspirant is not washed from the axillae during controlled emotional stressing, and excessive sweat does not diminish antiperspirant effectiveness; (3) an antiperspirant effective in reducing thermally-induced sweat is effective in reducing emotionally-induced sweat also; and (4) an antiperspirant that reduces emotionally-induced sweat by 20 percent or more meets the standard for antiperspirant effectiveness for which user perception and benefit has already been accepted and, thus, there is no need for additional user perception testing. The studies included aerosol, roll-on, and stick products containing aluminum chlorohydrate or aluminum zirconium tetrachlorohydrate, the major antiperspirant active ingredients. The agency has determined that gravimetric sweat tests combined with mental stress tests support an emotionally-induced sweating claim. The data included 12 studies with the same design of 5 days each on panels of approximately 25 female subjects: Pretest-abstention from all antiperspirants for at least 4 weeks prior to the study; day one--pretreatment control sweat collection under no stress; day two--pretreatment control sweat collection under emotional stressing; days two through five--apply test product; and days four and five-- posttreatment sweat collection under emotional stressing. Subjects applied the antiperspirant test formulation to one axilla and used either a comparative formulation, a control placebo formulation, or no treatment on the opposite axilla. A control emotional challenge test, which lasted for about 60 minutes, was done on day two and an emotional challenge test was done on days four and five of the study. Emotional sweating was induced by having subjects do a word definition test conducted by a moderator experienced at insuring optimum stress. The subjects received monetary rewards for a correct definition, but forfeited some of their rewards for incorrect or untimely definitions. Subjects had a 5-second time limit to begin a response and a 15second maximum time to give the actual word definition. After 60 minutes, sweat was measured gravimetrically from the preweighed absorbent pads. Standard sweat collection and statistical evaluation procedures were used. The median sweat output for the 12 studies was 1,257 milligrams (mg) for the pretreatment control under emotional stressing compared to 415 mg for the pretreatment control under no stress. This word definition test effectively elicited a sweat response. In the 12 studies using the word definition test, there was at least a 20percent reduction of sweat production. The top 10 percent of heavy sweaters from each study (25 subjects) having the highest sweating rates on the untreated axilla had a 36.8 percent average sweat reduction compared to 38.2 percent reduction in the remaining 90 percent of each population (196 subjects), showing no significant difference in effectiveness in the two groups. Majors and Wild (Ref. 13) obtained similar results when comparing individual percent reduction in thermal sweating in the antiperspirant-treated axilla to rate of sweating from the untreated axilla in 89 subjects. They found that heavy sweating did not affect the rate of reduction. The products tested under the emotional sweat protocol were also evaluated under a standard thermal sweat protocol at 100 F with 30 percent relative humidity. The average percent sweat reduction for aerosols was 37.0 percent for emotional sweating and 34.0 percent for thermal sweating, for sticks it was 46.0 percent for emotional  stick) and, thus, the enhanced duration effect is not limited to product form. The agency has determined that the data support a claim of enhanced duration for 24 hours according to the Panel's criteria. The protocols in seven of the studies (Refs. 7 and 10) varied only slightly from the Panel's recommended protocol. Subjects in one study abstained from antiperspirant use for 2 weeks prior to the study. Subjects in the other six studies stopped using antiperspirants 4 weeks prior to the studies. The subjects were pretreated with an antiperspirant for the 5 days prior to beginning sweat collection procedures. Sweat was collected 4 and 24 hours following the last antiperspirant application. Five studies included untreated axilla controls, and two studies included placebo controls. One product was tested in two different studies (one with a placebo and one without), and the results were virtually identical. The tests supported enhanced duration efficacy of 20 percent sweat reduction over the 24-hour period for aluminum zirconium tetrachloride (15.5 percent roll-on and 18.2 percent stick), zirconium tetrachloride (20 percent rollon), aluminum chlorohydrate (6.8 percent aerosol), and aluminum chloride (20 percent solution). Other data (Ref. 4) also supported enhanced duration of effectiveness for antiperspirant solid sticks containing 10 and 25 percent aluminum chlorohydrate. Subjects, who abstained from antiperspirant use for 17 days prior to the study, were pretreated with an antiperspirant for the 3 days prior to sweat collection, 1 and 24 hours after the last antiperspirant application. Standard hotroom and sweat collection procedures were used. Over the 24-hour period, both 10 percent and 25 percent aluminum chlorohydrate sticks reduced sweat production in the treated axilla by 20 percent compared to the untreated axilla. The 25-percent aluminum chlorohydrate product also showed a 30-percent reduction in sweat production. Six other studies (Ref. 11) support enhanced duration claims. Most products showed a 20-percent reduction in sweat production compared to an untreated axilla for both the 4- and 24hour evaluation periods, with several products showing a 30-percent sweat reduction. However, the studies did not identify the antiperspirant active ingredients. The agency is including the following enhanced duration claims in  350.50(b)(3) of this final monograph: ``all day protection,'' ``lasts all day,'' ``lasts 24 hours,'' or ``24 hour protection.'' In order to make such a  VerDate Jan<31>2003  15:48 Jun 06, 2003  Jkt 200001  PO 00000  Frm 00018  Fmt 4700  Sfmt 4700  E:\FR\FM\09JNR1.SGM  09JNR1   Federal Register / Vol. 68, No. 110 / Monday, June 9, 2003 / Rules and Regulations sweating and 41.4 percent for thermal sweating, and for roll-ons it was 51.3 percent for emotional sweating and 53.3 percent for thermal sweating. These data show that the same products have similar average percent sweat reduction for both emotional and thermal sweating. The agency concludes that gravimetric sweat tests combined with mental stress tests are sufficient to show effectiveness for control of emotionallyinduced sweating; the data show antiperspirant drug products that are effective for thermal sweating are also effective for emotional sweating. The agency has determined that no additional testing (e.g., user perception tests) is required for an emotionallyinduced sweating claim for products containing monograph ingredients that meet the guidelines for effectiveness testing of antiperspirant drug products referred to in  350.60. The agency is including the following emotionally-induced sweating claim in  350.50(b)(2) of this final monograph: ``also [select one of the following: `decreases,' `lessens,' or `reduces'] underarm [select one of the following: `dampness,' `perspiration,` `sweat,' `sweating,' or `wetness'] due to stress''. Based on the previous discussion, the agency concludes that a hearing is not needed on this subject. (Comment 14) One comment requested monograph status for 25 percent aluminum chlorohydrate to control foot perspiration based on gravimetric and perceptual data from four randomized, double-blind, bilateral, paired-comparison trials, each having 12 female subjects (Ref. 14). Treatment was randomly assigned; aluminum chlorohydrate was used on one foot and placebo on the other foot. A 25 percent aluminum chlorohydrate solution in 50 percent ethanol:50 percent water and a placebo control consisting of 50 percent ethanol:50 percent water were used in the first study. The same solutions in aerosol form were used in the other three studies. The procedure in the agency's ``Guidelines for Effectiveness Testing of OTC Antiperspirant Drug Products'' (Ref. 9) was modified for foot testing: (1) A 3-day pre-treatment period during which subjects were not to use any foot care products, with each subject receiving four daily product applications prior to final hotroom posttreatment testing collection; (2) sweat collection media were cotton socks rather than absorbent pads; (3) a required 5-minute period of mild exercise (walking around the hotroom at the beginning of each collection period); and (4) a modified method to calculate effectiveness due to the erratic rate of sweat collections for both treated and control feet. The comment stated that the calculation technique included in the agency's guidelines could not be used for the following several reasons: (1) The increased number and higher concentration of sweat glands in the foot area, (2) the occlusive nature of the foot area, and (3) the erratic rate of sweat collections for both treated and control feet. The comment contended that by considering the baseline, the posttreatment sweat collections, and the preferential subject perception data, statistically significant differences could be shown between sweat collection values for the treated foot compared to baseline values. The comment stated that based on at least a 5-percent difference between the measured sweat output of each foot, sweat reduction was achieved for the treated foot in 25 of 48 subjects (52 percent) compared to only 10 of 48 subjects (21 percent) for the control foot. The comment added that, based on the user perception questionnaire, 75 percent of the subjects (29 out of 39 subjects who were able to discriminate) were able to perceive after the hotroom exposure that the treated foot was drier compared to only 21 percent of the subjects (10 out of 48) who perceived the control foot to be drier. A second comment submitted a proposed clinical protocol (Ref. 15), but never submitted any clinical data. The agency has found the data are insufficient to support a foot antiperspirant claim. In axillary sweating tests submitted to the Panel, the range of effectiveness (average percent sweat reduction) of antiperspirants was 20 to 40 percent in most tests, with aerosols having a reduction range of 20 to 33 percent (43 FR 46694 at 46713). In the comment's studies on aluminum chlorohydrate for foot antiperspirancy (Ref. 14), the average percent sweat reduction was below 10 percent, which is considerably below the 20 percent minimum level of sweat reduction recommended by the Panel for efficacy testing of OTC antiperspirant drug products on the foot (43 FR 46728). In addition, the agency has a number of concerns about the comment's data treatment methods: (1) The particular sweat collections selected for analysis were not chosen consistently across studies but were based on arbitrarily chosen final sweat measurements that varied with the different studies, (2) the choice of a 5percent difference between the measured sweat output of each foot as ``clinically significant'' seems arbitrary  34279  and was not prespecified in the protocol, (3) the efficacy criterion used (greater than 15 percent reduction from baseline) was apparently defined after the data were collected and the results are therefore potentially biased, and (4) comparison with baseline is not an adequate basis upon which to conclude product efficacy because it ignores placebo and time effects that are accounted for in between product comparisons. The agency's analysis of ``across study'' data (using the average of the two sweat collections on day four, or average of the four collections on day four and five as the baseline, and the average of the two final collections as a measure of the final sweat product) did not show a statistically significant mean (or mean percent) sweat reduction from baseline in treated or control feet. The agency does not agree with the comment's evaluation of its user perception data, but considers the product as ineffective both in subjects who preferred placebo and in subjects with no preference. It appears that the comment chose to ignore tied preferences. However, when subjects with no preference were included in the analysis, 22 out of 48 subjects (45.8 percent) and 29 out of 48 subjects (60.4 percent) preferred the treated foot, before entering and after leaving the hotroom, respectively. Both proportions are not significantly different from 1/2 (two-tailed, p = 0.28 and 0.15, respectively). Furthermore, the subjects apparently could not perceive which foot, treated or untreated, was drier. More subjects failed to choose the drier foot, than chose it correctly, both at baseline and posttreatment. Thus, the wetness perception study failed to show that subjects are able to tell marginal differences in sweating of the feet. The agency has concluded that no statistically significant treatment effect was found in sweat reduction or in subject's perception of sweat (Ref. 16). Thus, 25 percent aluminum chlorohydrate has not been shown to be an effective foot antiperspirant. The agency provided the second comment suggestions on its protocol; a revised protocol was acceptable (Ref. 17), but no test data were ever submitted. The agency is not including foot antiperspirancy claims in the final monograph. D. Comments on Testing Guidelines (Comment 15) Several comments requested that the background section of the effectiveness testing guidelines include the following: ``FDA recognizes that alternative methodologies may be appropriate to qualify an antiperspirant drug product as effective.

Noting that the guidelines state that the control formulation is to be ``devoid of any antiperspirant activity * * * determined in a test compared to no treatment,'' a comment contended that it should be appropriate to compare antiperspirant activity directly against an untreated axilla and, thereby, reduce the time, complexity, and cost of the testing, especially the cost of developing a control formulation ``devoid'' of antiperspirant activity. The comment requested that the testing guidelines be revised to provide for the application of a control formulation or no treatment to the other axilla of each test subject. The other comment submitted data from two studies (Refs. 22 and 23) where one antiperspirant formulation was tested against both a placebo control and an untreated axilla control with virtually identical results; therefore, a placebo control was unnecessary to evaluate product effectiveness. The data (Refs. 22 and 23) involved an aerosol spray containing 6.8 percent aluminum chlorohydrate tested by two gravimetric sweat tests under hotroom conditions to substantiate the claim that the product provides ``all day wetness protection.'' Both studies had the same design: Day one--pretreatment control collection; days two, three, and four-- application of antiperspirant; and days four and five--posttreatment sweat collection 4 and 24 hours after application. The data were evaluated using one of the statistical methods recommended in the antiperspirant testing guidelines. In one study (Ref. 22), the product was tested against a placebo aerosol in 44 subjects. The placebo was identical to the test formulation and supposedly devoid of antiperspirant activity; the formula difference was adjusted with aerosol propellant. The results were statistically significant and showed that the aluminum chlorohydrate aerosol effectively reduced sweat production by at least 20 percent more than the placebo aerosol at 4 and 24 hours after application. However, the placebo showed some antiperspirant activity. In the second study (Ref. 23), the same product was tested against an untreated axilla control in 49 subjects with statistically significant results. The aluminum chlorohydrate aerosol effectively reduced sweat production by at least 20 percent more on the treated axilla than the untreated control axilla at 4 and 24 hours after application. The agency is unable to conclude from these data that an untreated comparator is equivalent to use of a placebo. The observed effect of a treatment (e.g., antiperspirant) may represent the sum of the pharmacological effects of the test drug and other effects associated with the intervention effort, which may include psychological effects and the effects of the excipients used in a product formulation. Although studies have been conducted in the past using no treatment for one axilla, the use of a placebo control for that axilla allows for assessment of the net treatment effects of the test article. Therefore, the agency is retaining the requirement for a placebo/vehicle control in the antiperspirant effectiveness testing guidelines. The proposed guidelines stated that the control formulation is as similar as possible to the test formulation and devoid of any antiperspirant activity. As the placebo used in one study (Ref. 22) was not completely devoid of antiperspirant activity, the agency is revising the guidelines to state: Hotroom procedure. (1) For gravimetric and user perception testing, treatments consist of the application of the test formulation to one axilla and the application of a placebo control formulation to the other axilla of each test subject. Except for the active ingredient, the placebo control formulation should be as similar as possible to the test formulation.  guidelines do not preclude the use of alternative methodologies that provide scientifically valid results.'' The agency is adding this statement (but changing the words ``alternative methodologies'' to ``alternate methods'') and adding ``subject to FDA approval'' to provide for alternate methods and statistical evaluations of effectiveness test data. (Comment 16) Several comments requested that the relative humidity of 35 to 40 percent in the effectiveness testing guidelines be lowered to 30 percent, the hotroom condition widely used by industry. One comment submitted the results of effectiveness studies (Refs. 7, 10, and 18) that used a hotroom operated at 30 + 3 percent relative humidity. The comment stated that 30 percent relative humidity accurately measures antiperspirant effectiveness without causing excessive discomfort to test subjects. Two other comments submitted effectiveness test data where the relative humidity in the hotroom was ``about 35 percent'' (Refs. 19 and 20) or ``35 percent  5 percent'' (Ref. 21). Based on these data, the agency is revising the relative humidity range for hotroom conditions in the antiperspirant effectiveness testing guidelines from 35 to 40 percent to a range of 30 to 40 percent. Seven studies (Ref. 10) that showed an enhanced duration of effectiveness of 20 percent sweat reduction over a 24-hour period for several antiperspirant products (see also section II.C, comment 12 of this document) used a protocol (Ref. 18) in which the subjects were placed in a controlled environment with the temperature held at 100  2 F and the relative humidity held at 30  3 percent. Because the subjects were able to generate at least 150 mg of sweat per axilla per 20 minute period, the agency considers the results of the gravimetric tests valid. In other studies (Refs. 20 and 21), sweating was induced by having the subjects sit in a hotroom maintained at a temperature of 100  2 F and at a relative humidity of about 35 percent or 35  5 percent. These studies support claims of extra effectiveness and enhanced duration (24hour claims). See section II.C, comments 11 and 12 of this document. To assure that test subjects sweat adequately during the hotroom test, the agency is adding the following baseline perspiration rate condition: ``Baseline perspiration rate. Test subjects must produce at least 100 milligrams of sweat from the untreated or placebo control axilla in a 20-minute collection in the controlled environment.''  The agency concludes that this revised testing procedure will reduce the time, complexity, and cost of testing because it eliminates the cost of developing a control formulation ``devoid'' of antiperspirant activity. E. Comments on Antiperspirant Active Ingredients (Comment 18) Several comments noted a discrepancy in a heading in an active ingredient table in the Panel's report (43 FR 46694 at 46697), where ``Metal:Halide'' is used, and in proposed  350.10 (47 FR 36492 at 36504), where ``Al:Cl'' is used. Two comments suggested that ``Al:Cl'' in the table heading and in  350.10 should be changed to ``Metal:Cl,'' because the ratio range in the table is for the ratio of the ``Cl'' to either aluminum (``Al'') or aluminum plus zirconium (``Al+Zr''). The agency notes that the ratio range designated as ``A1:Cl'' in the TFM should have been ``Metal:Halide,'' as it was in the Panel's report. The agency is not including the ratio range table in  350.10 of this final monograph because this information is now included in the U.S. Pharmacopeia-  VerDate Jan<31>2003  15:48 Jun 06, 2003  Jkt 200001  PO 00000  Frm 00020  Fmt 4700  Sfmt 4700  E:\FR\FM\09JNR1.SGM  09JNR1   Federal Register / Vol. 68, No. 110 / Monday, June 9, 2003 / Rules and Regulations National Formulary (USPNF) monographs for each active ingredient included in  350.10, where applicable. The agency is changing the introductory text of  350.10 to state: ``Where applicable, the ingredient must meet the aluminum to chloride, aluminum to zirconium, and aluminum plus zirconium to chloride atomic ratios described in the United States Pharmacopeia-National Formulary.'' (Comment 19) Two comments agreed with the agency that buffer components present in the compound, such as glycine or glycol, should be omitted when calculating the maximum allowable concentration of active ingredients in an antiperspirant product (47 FR 36492 at 36495). One comment noted a potential source of confusion because the active ingredients table in proposed  350.10 included the buffer names along with the active ingredient names. To minimize confusion and to be consistent with the agency's policy regarding buffers, the comment requested the agency to remove the buffer names from the ``active ingredient'' column in  350.10. The comment proposed a number of changes in the active ingredient section. When the Panel first discussed terminology for aluminum chloride and aluminum chlorohydrate antiperspirant active ingredients, the buffer additives were not included (Ref. 24). Subsequently, the Cosmetic, Toiletry, and Fragrance Association (CTFA) Antiperspirant Task Force developed definitions for aluminum chlorohydrex complexes with propylene glycol or polyethylene glycol, and for aluminum zirconium chlorohydrex complexes with glycine (Ref. 25). The Panel adopted these definitions, including those for ingredients with buffered additives, in its report (43 FR 46694 at 46696 and 46697), and the agency proposed this nomenclature in the TFM (47 FR 36492). Since the comment was submitted, the USPNF developed names for these antiperspirant active ingredients that include the names of the buffers, where applicable, and active ingredient names in this final monograph include the buffer, where applicable. The agency considers calculation of the concentration of an antiperspirant ingredient present in a product based on the amount of anhydrous ingredient to be appropriate. Buffered antiperspirant ingredients contain the same active chemical moiety as the corresponding nonbuffered ingredients, and the antiperspirant activity of both ingredients is similar. (Comment 20) One comment requested the agency allow concentrations of antiperspirant active ingredients above those proposed in the monograph as long as the amount of ingredient applied to the skin is not greater than the amount judged safe by the Panel. The comment noted that, in the TFM (comment no. 12, 47 FR 36492 at 36495 to 36496), the agency had disagreed with earlier comments on this issue and stated that ``the comments included no new data to show that a higher concentration of antiperspirant active ingredient marketed in a particular container would deliver no more than the amount of active ingredient judged safe by the Panel.'' The comment submitted new data from eight usage studies (Ref. 26) to support a higher (up to 35 percent) active ingredient concentration for powder roll-on antiperspirant drug products. Fifty male and female subjects, between the ages of 18 and 55, participated in each study. Subjects were given a preweighed product and instructed to use only that product, to keep a record of how many times they used it, and not to allow anyone else in the household to use the product. An average of 43 subjects completed the 1week studies and returned their product to the laboratory where it was reweighed. The amount of product applied with each use was calculated. The four powder roll-ons, which contained 33 percent aluminum zirconium tetrachlorohydrate, were found to deliver between 23 and 44 mg of antiperspirant ingredient per axilla per use. The other product forms (solid stick, cream, or liquid roll-on), containing 18 to 19 percent of either aluminum chlorohydrate or aluminum zirconium tetrachlorohydrate, were found to deliver between 54 and 98 mg of antiperspirant ingredient per axilla per use. The comment contended these data show that higher concentrations of active antiperspirant ingredients, as used in powder roll-on systems, deposit no more and, in fact, deposit less active ingredient than is deposited in a liquid roll-on, solid stick, or cream product containing proposed monograph concentrations of active ingredients. Thus, the comment argued that concentrations up to 35 percent of Category I active ingredients should be allowed in powder roll-on antiperspirants. This issue was specifically brought before the Panel, which did not agree to change the maximum concentration (Ref. 27). The Panel noted that aluminum antiperspirants can be irritating, expressed concern that a small amount of a concentrated formulation may be more irritating than  34281  a large amount of a more dilute formulation, and concluded that antiperspirant products with a higher concentration would need an NDA with additional safety studies. The agency notes that increasing the concentration of aluminum antiperspirant ingredients increases the acidity of the material and irritation of the skin (Refs. 28, 29, and 30). The agency concludes that safety data are needed to show that powder roll-on dosage forms containing up to 35 percent aluminum chlorhydrates or aluminum zirconium chlorhydrates are not irritating. Since the TFM was published, several citizen petitions have raised concerns about the amount of aluminum absorbed from topical antiperspirant drug products. (See section II.F, comment 23 of this document.) The agency has no data showing that products containing up to 35 percent aluminum chlorhydrates or aluminum zirconium chlorhydrates increase aluminum absorption and is not revising the monograph to provide for powder rollon dosage forms containing up to 35 percent antiperspirant active ingredient, without additional safety data being provided. (Comment 21) One comment requested monograph status for aluminum sesquichlorohydrate prepared by neutralizing aluminum chloride with magnesium hydroxide even though the aluminum to chloride (Al:Cl) ratio of the ingredient prepared in this manner does not fall within the range specified for aluminum sesquichlorohydrate in the TFM. The comment stated that during the course of the rulemaking all aluminum chlorhydrates placed in Category I were prepared by conventional techniques: Either by neutralization of aluminum chloride with aluminum monochlorohydrate or by a controlled reaction of aluminum metal with hydrochloric acid. Thus, the comment argued that it was both appropriate and convenient to characterize the various aluminum chlorhydrates in terms of their Al:Cl ratios. The comment stated that its data showed that the reaction of aluminum chloride with magnesium hydroxide yields aluminum sesquichlorohydrate equivalent to that listed in the TFM and the neutralizer magnesium hydroxide does not contribute either aluminum or chloride ions to the neutralization process; thus, the Al:Cl ratio of aluminum sesquichlorohydrate prepared this way will always remain 0.33, the same as aluminum chloride alone. The comment was concerned because this Al:Cl ratio of 0.33 does not fall within the ratio range of 1.9 down  VerDate Jan<31>2003  15:48 Jun 06, 2003  Jkt 200001  PO 00000  Frm 00021  Fmt 4700  Sfmt 4700  E:\FR\FM\09JNR1.SGM  09JNR1   34282  Federal Register / Vol. 68, No. 110 / Monday, June 9, 2003 / Rules and Regulations composition'' because the aluminum to chloride ratio of 0.33 is outside the specified range for aluminum sesquichlorohydrate and because the material contains measurable amounts of magnesium. Also, as discussed in section II.E, comment 18 of this document, because the atomic ratio range should be metal to halide, magnesium should be counted as a metal in the atomic ratio range of the comment's material. Using the name aluminum sesquichlorohydrate for an ingredient prepared by neutralization of aluminum chloride with magnesium hydroxide would be misleading because this would imply that the drug is the same identifiable ingredient as aluminum sesquichlorohydrate prepared by neutralization of aluminum chloride with aluminum chlorohydrate. The agency believes the material described in the comment should be classified as a new ingredient, perhaps an aluminum magnesium chlorohydrate, rather than aluminum sesquichlorohydrate. The agency concludes that additional information on the chemical characterization of the proposed material, particularly its ionic structure, is needed to permit a more scientific review. The submitted information does not provide a technical basis for allowing the substitution of aluminum sesquichlorohydrate manufactured by neutralization with magnesium chloride for that neutralized with aluminum monochlorohydrate. The USPNF monograph (Ref. 32) does not contain information to characterize or identify an aluminum sesquichlorohydrate containing magnesium (e.g., no identification or content test, and no assay involving magnesium calculations). Further, the agency notes that no clinical efficacy data were provided to show that the material proposed in the comment would be equally effective as aluminum sesquichlorohydrate prepared in the conventional manner. Even minor variations in formulation, such as the addition of emollients or buffers, can alter the effectiveness of an antiperspirant ingredient. (See comment no. 8 in the TFM (47 FR 36492 at 36494).) The new mixture may be just as effective. However, whether such a finding would apply to equal amounts, or whether an equivalent effect could be achieved with a greater or lesser amount of aluminum sesquichlorohydrate prepared with magnesium hydroxide, should be determined by effectiveness testing that follows the guidelines referred to in  350.60 of the final monograph. The agency needs appropriate effectiveness data and an appropriate USPNF monograph amendment (see 21 CFR 330.14(i)) before the ingredient prepared by the new method can be generally recognized as safe and effective and included in the final monograph. (Comment 22) One comment objected to the agency's rejection of its earlier request (discussed in comment no. 9 of the TFM, 47 FR 36492 at 36495) that combinations of two or more Category I antiperspirant ingredients should be Category I. The comment stated that the combination policy in  330.10(a)(4)(iv) allows combinations of two or more safe and effective active ingredients; thus, the Panel should be reversed. In the TFM (47 FR 36495), the agency concurred with the Panel (43 FR 46694 at 46718) that both combinations of antiperspirant active ingredients and combinations of antiperspirant active ingredients with other types of active ingredients (except for a deferred antiperspirant/antifungal combination) are Category II because of no information on the existence of any such combinations or any data to support their safe and effective use. The agency classified antiperspirant/ antifungal combination drug products in Category III in the TFM for OTC antifungal drug products (December 12, 1989, 54 FR 51136 at 51148 and 51149). No additional data were submitted to support this combination, and in the final monograph for OTC antifungal drug products (September 23, 1993, 58 FR 49890 at 49891), the agency classified all antifungal combination drug products as nonmonograph. The comment did not provide any supporting data or specific examples of Category I antiperspirant ingredients that would be suitable for use in combination with other antiperspirant or nonantiperspirant Category I ingredients. Thus, the combination policy does not apply. These combinations remain nonmonograph. However, new clinical data may be submitted to support safety and effectiveness. F. Comments on the Safety of Aluminum Ingredients (Comment 23) The information and arguments presented by the citizen petitions that questioned the safety of aluminum-containing ingredients in OTC antiperspirant drug products and the comment that disagreed with one of the citizen petitions were discussed in detail in the Federal Register of March 23, 1993 (58 FR 15452 at 15453 and 15454). One petition was concerned that aluminum can be absorbed and get into the blood and that some of the aluminum in the blood enters the brain,  to but not including 1.25:1 proposed for aluminum sesquichlorohydrate in the tentative final monograph (47 FR 36492 at 36504). The comment contended that if the final product is regarded as a mixture of aluminum sesquichlorohydrate and magnesium chloride, and if the amount of chloride that serves as counter ions for the magnesium ions were subtracted from the total chloride, then the Al:Cl ratio of the aluminum sesquichlorohydrate component of the mixture would have the Al:Cl ratio specified in the TFM. The comment submitted data (Ref. 31) using gel permeation chromatography and elemental analysis of the eluates (the substance separated out by washing) to show that aluminum sesquichlorohydrate prepared by this neutralization method is chromatographically indistinguishable from that prepared by conventional methods. The comment suggested designating the ingredient prepared by the neutralization method as ``aluminum sesquichlorohydrate MAG.'' The agency does not find these analytical data sufficient to support the comment's claim that the ingredient prepared by this neutralization method is chemically equivalent in composition to aluminum sesquichlorohydrate. The chromatographic indistinguishability from aluminum sesquichlorohydrate prepared by conventional methods only demonstrates that the chromatographic method in this study is insufficient to support the claim. This result perhaps is to be expected because the gel permeation chromatographic method used in this study is based primarily on a size exclusion principle; however, the agency doubts that any chromatographic method will provide such support. USP 23NF 18 Fifth Supplement (Ref. 32) added a monograph for aluminum sesquichlorohydrate and described it as consisting of complex basic aluminum chloride that is polymeric and loosely hydrated and encompasses a range of aluminum-to-chloride atomic ratios between 1.26:1 and 1.90:1. Its chemical formula is stated as: Aly(OH)3y-zClz.nH2O. According to the method described in the comment, when aluminum sesquichlorohydrate is prepared by the reaction of aluminum chloride with magnesium hydroxide, the product must be a mixture of aluminum sesquichlorohydrate and magnesium chloride. The agency does not consider it suitable from a technical point of view to simply designate this material as aluminum sesquichlorohydrate. Information provided by the comment shows that the alternate process material is not ``equivalent in  VerDate Jan<31>2003  15:48 Jun 06, 2003  Jkt 200001  PO 00000  Frm 00022  Fmt 4700  Sfmt 4700  E:\FR\FM\09JNR1.SGM  09JNR1   Federal Register / Vol. 68, No. 110 / Monday, June 9, 2003 / Rules and Regulations where it remains and accumulates. The petition cited a study by Perl and Good (Ref. 33) that suggested that inhaled aluminum compounds could have a direct nasal-olfactory pathway to the brain. The other petition contended that two inhalation studies (Refs. 34 and 35) provided by industry showed aluminum absorption in the peribronchial lymph nodes, brain, and adrenal glands of the animals after 12 and 24 months. Both petitions expressed concern about the potential neurotoxicity of aluminum upon chronic use, especially a possible link to Alzheimer's disease. The comment that disagreed with one petition contended that the majority of the petitioner's references described findings from in vitro studies that did not consider the blood-brain barrier, which is the brain's main defense against potentially toxic substances such as aluminum. The comment contended that extraordinarily high concentrations of aluminum were used in these studies, and that aluminum from antiperspirants would never reach a biologically significant level to be of concern. The comment stated that the majority of researchers investigating the etiology of Alzheimer's disease would consider current evidence insufficient to link aluminum to Alzheimer's disease. The comment concluded that current scientific information does not support the need to reclassify the safety of aluminum-containing antiperspirants. The agency does not find the current evidence sufficient to conclude that aluminum from antiperspirant use results in Alzheimer's disease. Both petitions mention the widely quoted study by Perl and Good (Ref. 33) as showing that inhaled aluminum compounds may get directly into the brain by a nasal-olfactory pathway. The agency does not consider this animal study (published as a one-page Letter to the Editor in Lancet) as adequate to establish a direct nasal-olfactory pathway for aluminum. This study was only a small pilot animal study, about which the agency has a number of concerns. First, the method of introducing the aluminum to these animals was not physiologically relevant. Two strips of Gelfoam (absorbable gelatin sponge, USP) saturated with high concentrations of aluminum salts (15 percent aluminum lactate or 5 percent aluminum chloride) were inserted into rabbits' left nasal recess through a hole drilled into the frontal bone. While the authors attempted to demonstrate the accessibility of aluminum from the nasal recess to the brain, the agency questions whether the normal use of antiperspirant aerosols would ever produce a high aluminum concentration in this relatively distant anatomic site. Second, the size of this study was very small (only three rabbits in each group). The agency is concerned that any error in this complicated surgical procedure to introduce the aluminum salts or in preparing the specimens for analysis could have caused a major difference in the final results. Third, the results were not consistent. Of the three animals exposed to aluminum lactate, besides the involvement of the left olfactory bulb and the cerebral cortex, only one rabbit had a lesion in the hippocampus while the other two rabbits had granulomas found in the pyriform cortex. In the group exposed to aluminum chloride, only one rabbit had a granuloma in the olfactory bulb while the other two rabbits were free of lesions. The distribution of lesions in this study was fairly random. If a nasalolfactory pathway exists for neuronal aluminum transport, the agency believes that the distribution of these lesions should follow a more persistent anatomical pattern. In addition, the authors were unable to explain why two of the six rabbits were free of lesions. Finally, although some of the rabbits had granulomas, these lesions did not resemble the plaques or neurofibrillary tangles found in Alzheimer's disease, and none of the rabbits had any symptomatic neurologic deficit. While this study implied that access to the brain via the nasal recess may be possible under nonphysiological conditions, a direct nasal-olfactory pathway and any relationship to Alzheimer's disease cannot be established. Several other studies, which were not done with aluminum, are of no value in establishing a direct nasal-central nervous system pathway for aluminum antiperspirants. Aluminum lactate, one aluminum salt used in this study (Ref. 33), is not included in this final monograph. Sodium aluminum lactate has been used as a buffer for aluminum sulfate in a nonaerosol dosage form, but that product is nonmonograph. In one of the inhalation studies (Ref. 34), the life-span of the male hamsters exposed to the aluminum chlorhydrate aerosol was shorter (583 days) than that of the controls (661 days). The female hamsters exposed to aluminum chlorhydrate had a slightly longer lifespan (489 days) than the controls (481 days). Male hamsters exposed to aluminum chlorhydrate coated with a high concentration of isopropyl myristate, an emollient frequently used to increase the retention on the skin of the aluminum salts used in antiperspirant products, had a life-span  34283  (646 days) comparable to the controls (661 days). Overall, these numbers do not follow a consistent pattern and could be affected by other experimental conditions. The same petition criticized the other inhalation study (Ref. 35), contending that the results showed that the animals had suffered significant weight loss and increased terminal brain-to-body weight ratios, results it considered consistent with clinical aluminum toxicity, and that the increase in brain weight was possibly due to cerebral edema. The petition claimed that because aluminum was found to be deposited in the animals' brains, peribronchial lymph nodes, and adrenal glands, this proved that systemic absorption of aluminum had occurred and that aluminum had been transported to the brain. Other comments disagreed with the petition's argument that the rats in this study were found to have detectable aluminum levels in their brains after 12 months, contending that this finding may only be artificial considering the analytical methods used. The comments added that if aluminum did accumulate in the rats' brains, those rats should have had symptoms of neurotoxicity, which they did not have. The comments concluded that the artificial finding should be ignored. The agency does not concur with the petition's extrapolations. The weight loss occurred only in rats and not in guinea pigs that were similarly treated. The increase in terminal brain-to-body weight ratio occurred only in the female rats at 12 months in the low- and highdose groups. The female rats in the middle-dose group and all the males were not affected. At 24 months, this same ratio was found to increase only in the high-dose groups of both sexes; however, the increase in the female high-dose group was not statistically significant. The agency notes that all of these findings did not follow any predictable pattern or a pattern that would be expected from a dose-related or cumulative toxin exposure. The pattern of deposition was not consistent. In the guinea pigs, aluminum was found in the peribronchial lymph nodes, but not in the adrenal glands and brains (as occurred in the rats). The agency finds it possible that aluminum absorption and deposition may be animal dependent. If this were the case, then even if the rat data were evidence of a problem, the same situation may not apply to humans. The agency is not aware of other investigators having similar results. The petitions and the comment had different views on a study by Rollin,  VerDate Jan<31>2003  15:48 Jun 06, 2003  Jkt 200001  PO 00000  Frm 00023  Fmt 4700  Sfmt 4700  E:\FR\FM\09JNR1.SGM  09JNR1   34284  Federal Register / Vol. 68, No. 110 / Monday, June 9, 2003 / Rules and Regulations (cases and controls) were matched by age, sex, and the relationship between the case/control and his or her surrogate (spouse or child). The authors mentioned that, in general, antiperspirants contain aluminum and deodorants do not, except for some deodorants marketed for women. The authors reported that there was no association between the use of ``any'' antiperspirant/deodorant and Alzheimer's disease. However, when the data were stratified by aluminum-containing antiperspirants the overall odds ratio showed a modest increase in risk and a statistically significant trend emerged between increasing lifetime use of aluminumcontaining antiperspirants and the estimated relative risk of Alzheimer's disease. The authors commented that, to their knowledge, this was the first epidemiological study of this association between antiperspirants and Alzheimer's disease, and there were several methodologic limitations that made interpretation of their results difficult. First, there were missing data because the case surrogate and the control surrogate could only recall all variables (frequency and duration of use, and product brand name) in about one-half of the matched pairs. Second, there might have been some misclassification because the analyses were based on the most common brand provided, while some subjects may have used multiple brands. Third, the authors considered the validity of the data, resulting from difficulty in learning the subjects' exposure using telephone interview methods, to be a critical limitation. Despite these limitations, the authors considered an association between aluminum-containing antiperspirants and Alzheimer's disease as biologically plausible, but concluded that their findings are provocative and, due to methodologic problems, should be considered preliminary. Garruto (Ref. 38) described efforts to establish models of chronic motor neuron degeneration in a long-term effort to understand the cellular and molecular mechanisms of aluminum neurotoxicity. He studied foci of dementia (ALS and Parkinson's disease) in western Pacific populations. He mentioned experimental models in rabbits and cell culture as demonstrating that chronic, rather than acute, toxicity is the cause of human neurodegenerative disorders with a long latency and slow progression. However, Garruto stated that he and his colleagues had been most deficient in the design and implementation of good epidemiological studies, particularly of Alzheimer's disease and the epidemiology of aluminum intoxication per se, and described what he felt was needed for future well-designed studies. The petitions/comment also discussed environmental exposure to aluminum, percutaneous absorption after topical use, inhaled absorption after aerosol use, aluminum neurotoxicity (and a possible relationship to Alzheimer's disease), and possible mechanisms of action. Numerous references were provided. The agency has reviewed these references and other literature published on aluminum since the petitions were submitted. Many early references were simply hypotheses and different theories that have not been adequately substantiated in humans or any animal models. A number of studies were pilot projects in a few animals, and the agency is unable to draw any definite conclusions based on the small sample sizes. The agency notes Priest's (Ref. 39) statement that most investigators now agree that aluminum is unlikely to be implicated in causing Alzheimer's disease, whereas Rowan (Ref. 40) contended it would be considerably more correct to state that the issue is controversial. More recently, Savory et al. (Ref. 41) stated that the question whether aluminum presents a health hazard to humans as a contributing factor to Alzheimer's disease is still subject to debate. The agency finds the literature shows the issue of aluminum toxicity and Alzheimer's disease remains controversial and is not resolved. Scott et al. (Ref. 42) reported that aluminum has been detected in Alzheimer neurofibrillary tangles, but the significance of its presence is unknown. Kasa, Szerdahelyi, and Wisniewski (Ref. 43) reported that histochemical staining showed that aluminum was present in brain samples from Alzheimer's disease victims, but the structural localization indicated that it is not primarily involved in the etiology of the disease. Candy et al. (Ref. 44) reported that data from post mortem brain examinations of patients with chronic renal failure who did not have dialysis encephalopathy suggest that it is unlikely that aluminum plays any major role in neurofibrillary tangle formation and that its role in senile plaque formation is likely to be only part of a complex cascade of changes. Savory et al. (Ref. 41) stated that the lack of agreement on the question whether the brain content of aluminum is increased in Alzheimer's disease attests to the complexity of the issue. Savory et al. (Ref. 41) indicated that most of the data linking aluminum  Theodorou, and Kilroe-Smith (Ref. 36) in which rabbits were exposed to aluminum oxide dust for 8 hours a day, 5 days a week, for 5 months. The authors of the study found that the brains of these rabbits had a significant increase in aluminum at the end of the study. The first petition contended that this study showed that the inhalation of aluminum antiperspirants poses a special risk because this route of delivery bypasses the blood-brain barrier. The comment calculated that this study would be equivalent to a person using spray antiperspirants for approximately 10 seconds daily for 789 years to experience the same toxicity. The second petition contended that this 10-seconds-exposure assumption was incorrect because the aluminum particles in an antiperspirant aerosol remain suspended in the air for a long period of time, and the exposure will be more than the comment calculated. The agency finds this study has a number of limitations: (1) The extraordinary high concentrations of aluminum oxide exposure in the animals, (2) the small sample size (eight animals in each group), and (3) an overlap in the standard deviations of the results obtained decreases the power and generalizability of the study. While the study shows an accumulation of aluminum in the rabbits' body tissues under certain exposure conditions, the agency does not consider the study as providing evidence of a direct nasalolfactory pathway or that normal use of aluminum-containing antiperspirants would provide comparable results. Further, the second petition's position includes a number of assumptions, which might not occur: (1) That the place where the product is used is a confined, poor-ventilated airspace, and (2) that the user remains in the vicinity of the dispersed aerosol for a period of time during which significant inhalation would occur. One petition claimed that an epidemiology study by Graves et al. (Ref. 37) has shown that Alzheimer's disease was associated with the use of aluminum antiperspirants and that a high incidence of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and Parkinson's disease in Chamorro natives of Guam, as reported by Garruto (Ref. 38), may be related to high environmental aluminum. The agency has looked closely at the Graves et al. study (Ref. 37) because it explored the association between exposure to aluminum through the lifetime use of antiperspirants and antacids and Alzheimer's disease.

They concluded that quantification of the risk of Alzheimer's disease from other sources of aluminum (such as food additives, cosmetics, deodorants, antiperspirants, pharmaceuticals, and respiratory dusts) is needed before the total risk from all environmental sources of aluminum can be fully evaluated. Despite Graves et al.'s acknowledgment of the limitations of their study (Ref. 37), other authors, e.g., Anane et al. (Ref. 45), report that Graves et al. found an increased risk of Alzheimer's disease with lifetime use of aluminum-containing antiperspirants after an epidemiological study. Anane et al. applied low aqueous concentrations (0.025 to 0.1 micrograms (g)/square centimeter) of aluminum chloride (AlCl3.6H2O) to healthy shaved Swiss mouse skin for 130 days. They reported that this led to a significant increase in urine, serum, and whole brain aluminum, especially in the hippocampus area, compared to control animals. They mentioned that this percutaneous uptake and accumulation of aluminum in the brain was greater than that caused by dietary exposure to 2.3 g per day in feed and water. Anane et al. conducted in vitro and in vivo mouse skin studies and showed for the first time that aluminum is absorbed through mouse skin and this contributes to a greater body burden than does oral uptake. They also mentioned that several antiperspirant preparations containing AlCl3.6H2O are applied to sensitive regions of the skin, which may increase penetration and could be an important source of body aluminum burden. Anane et al. recommended that an epidemiological study be conducted to ascertain whether use of AlCl3.6H2Ocontaining antiperspirants correlates with neurodegenerative disease, because such cannot be excluded based on the results of their study. Forbes and Agwani (Ref. 46) stated that there is uncertainty about how aluminum-containing substances enter the body, but current information suggests that the skin and/or the lung are important. They mentioned that Priest (Ref. 39) noted that at least some antiperspirant sprays contain aluminum compounds of a particle size of about 1 micrometer (micron) (), which is ideally sized for deposition in the deep lung, and that such deposition may also be relevant for skin. Salib and Hillier (Ref. 47) examined clinically diagnosed Alzheimer's disease patients and controls (other dementias and nondementias) and collected information to examine the association between Alzheimer's disease and aluminum occupation. They reported that manual work, such as welding, expected to be in direct contact with aluminum dust and fumes does not appear to be significantly associated with the risk of Alzheimer's disease. The authors concluded that no significant association was shown between developing Alzheimer's disease later in life and previous occupational history for all of the occupations in the study. This included both manual workers, who would be expected to have had a higher exposure opportunity to aluminum dust and fumes, and other workers at an aluminum factory. The authors concluded that neither Alzheimer's disease nor dementia in general were shown to be associated with previous aluminum occupation. Salib and Hillier (Ref. 47), in 1996, repeated Doll's (Ref. 48) conclusions from 1993 that it is generally accepted that the delayed effects of chronic aluminum exposure have not been adequately assessed in man. Factors that govern the bioavailability, neurotoxicity, and the effect of chronic low dose exposure to aluminum compounds remain unclear. Flaten et al. (Ref. 49) stated that the lack of a readily available radioactive isotope of aluminum has been a major obstacle toward elucidating the mechanisms of absorption, distribution, and excretion of the metal. Both Doll (Ref. 48) and Salib and Hillier (Ref. 47) stated that the possibility of a causal link between aluminum and Alzheimer's disease must be kept open until uncertainty about neuropathological evidence is resolved and the prognosis of humans exposed to aluminum by inhalation is known. Flaten et al. (Ref. 49) stated that multidisciplinary collaborative research efforts, involving scientists from many different specialities, are needed, with emphasis placed on: (1) Increasing knowledge of the chemistry of aluminum in biologic systems and determining the cellular and molecular mechanisms of aluminum toxicity, and (2) variations in neuropathology from long-term, low-level exposure to aluminum. In summary, the literature shows that at high doses and long-term industrial exposures, aluminum can be associated with recognizable, specific neurologic effects. However, to date, the agency considers the evidence insufficient to link aluminum to Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, or ALS. Although aluminum uptake and transport by a ``nasal-olfactory pathway'' has been  34285  suggested in a nonphysiologic study in an animal model (Ref. 36), the agency is not aware of any evidence in humans that supports an olfactory-neuronal transport of aluminum to the brain. One petition suggested that the agency require that 90 percent of the particles of an aerosol aluminum antiperspirant be greater than 50  (currently the requirement is between 10 and 50 ) to reduce exposure to the upper respiratory tract. The agency notes that both Priest (Ref. 39) and Forbes and Agwani (Ref. 46) discussed a particle size of 1  for deposition in the deep lung. Based on current knowledge (no proof in humans of an olfactory neuronal transport of aluminum to the brain) and the lack of information on a minimum particle size to affect the respiratory tract, the agency finds no basis to impose a greater than 50 requirement at this time. Flaten et al. (Ref. 49) stated that the possible human toxicity of aluminum has been a matter of controversy for well over 100 years. Despite many investigators looking at this issue, the agency does not find data from topical and inhalation chronic exposure animal and human studies submitted to date sufficient to change the monograph status of aluminum containing antiperspirants. The agency will continue to monitor the scientific literature on aluminum and, if new information appears, will reassess the status of aluminum-containing antiperspirants at such time. The agency acknowledges that small amounts of aluminum can be absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and through the skin. Assuming a person has normal renal function, accumulation of aluminum resulting from usual exposures to antiperspirant drug products (application to the underarms once or twice daily) and subsequent absorption is considered minimal. However, people with renal dysfunction have an impairment in normal renal excretion of aluminum. Flaten et al. (Ref. 49) noted that the first human conditions generally accepted to be causally related to aluminum exposure did not occur until the 1970's, shortly after the introduction of routine dialysis therapy in persons with chronic renal failure. Dialysis encephalopathy was perhaps the first disease recognized in this population (1972, 1976). Later, fracturing osteomalacia (1977, 1978) and a microcytic hypochromic anemia (1980) were related to aluminum exposure in dialysis patients. Flaten et al. indicated that aluminum can cause encephalopathy, bone disease, and anemia in dialysis patients resulting  VerDate Jan<31>2003  15:48 Jun 06, 2003  Jkt 200001  PO 00000  Frm 00025  Fmt 4700  Sfmt 4700  E:\FR\FM\09JNR1.SGM  09JNR1   34286  Federal Register / Vol. 68, No. 110 / Monday, June 9, 2003 / Rules and Regulations by the antiperspirant and thus caused to spread internally. These androgens may be converted in the surrounding adipose tissues to estrogens, and excess estrogens have been associated with an increase in breast cancer. Alternatively, these excess androgens may interfere with the normal functioning of the hypothalamic-pituitary axis, thereby causing an imbalance of estrogen in the body. About 50 percent of breast cancers occur in the upper outer quadrant of the breast, and axillary sweat glands are anatomically very close to this site. A protein marker called GCDFP15 (Gross Cystic Disease Fluid Protein), which is normally found only in the sweat glands, was found in the fluids of many breast cysts. The author postulated that the blocked axillary sweat glands would cause GCDFP15 and other markers to migrate to the breast due to its proximity and gravity, and because the fetal precursors for apocrine sweat glands and mammary glands are the same, these migrated protein markers may stimulate the breast and play a role in the carcinogenic process. The author also postulated that aluminum may play a role in the development of breast cancer because calcification of breast tissues (commonly seen in breast cancer) may be caused by a local electrolyte imbalance induced by the absorbed aluminum. The author noted that breast cancer in Japan was more than five times lower than in the United States and postulated this has occurred because Japanese women, especially the older population, do not use antiperspirants. The author noted that the breast cancer rate is currently on the rise in Japan, especially among young premenopausal women, and postulated that this is occurring because the young Japanese generation has adopted the western habit of using antiperspirants. The agency finds these theories lack sufficient evidence. The agency notes that the amount of androgens produced by the sweat glands is relatively insignificant compared to normal physiologic amounts produced by the adrenals and the gonads. The agency is not aware of any studies that have shown an ``internal spread'' of androgens or that establish that GCDFP 15 or other protein markers are carcinogenic in humans. The agency considers the author's views about a local electrolyte imbalance by absorbed aluminum causing breast tissue calcification inconsistent with knowledge about the calcification process. In addition, there are many benign calcifications. Finally, many proposals (e.g., diet, lifestyle changes) have been made as to why there is an increased incidence of breast cancer among Japanese women. However, there is no evidence to associate this increase with an increased use of antiperspirants. Thus, the agency concludes that there is insufficient evidence to support these theories. (Comment 25) The agency previously assessed the carcinogenic potential of aerosolized aluminum chlorhydrate antiperspirants in comment 22 of the TFM (47 FR 36492 at 36498 and 36499). Primary lung tumors, granulomatous lesions, and macrophagic activity were evaluated in animal studies. No increase in lung tumors was seen in the low- and mid-dose rats given doses at least 100 times greater than the expected human exposure via aerosolized antiperspirants. Normal macrophage response and pulmonary fibrosis were observed at higher doses with chronic exposure. No increase in tumors was noted in guinea pigs or hamsters at any dose levels in the studies. While the agency removed aerosol antiperspirant products containing zirconium from the market because of granuloma formation (August 16, 1977, 42 FR 41374), the agency is not aware of data that indicate aluminum antiperspirants cause foreign body granulomas or pulmonary tumors. III. Agency Changes 1. It has been agency policy since April 3, 1989 (54 FR 13480 at 13486), that before any ingredient is included in a final OTC drug monograph, it must have a compendial (USPNF) monograph. Compendial monographs include an ingredient's official name, chemical formula, and analytical chemical tests to confirm the quality and purity of the ingredient. These monographs establish public standards for the strength, quality, purity, and packaging of ingredients and drug products available in the United States. Eighteen of the 19 antiperspirant active ingredients that the agency proposed in  350.10 of the antiperspirant TFM (47 FR 36492 at 36504) currently have compendial monographs. Nine of the official compendial names are the same as those proposed in  350.10, while 10 of the names have changed slightly. (See Table 1 of this document for the previous and current ingredient names.)  from the introduction of aluminum directly into the blood stream via highaluminum dialysate or the consumption of large oral doses of aluminumcontaining phosphate binders. Reduced urine production (the major route for aluminum excretion) contributes to this problem. The authors noted that, in the early 1980's, reports began to appear describing aluminum neurotoxicity and osteotoxicity in children with renal failure who were not on dialysis treatment. The agency is concerned that people with renal dysfunction may not be aware that the daily use of antiperspirant drug products containing aluminum may put them at a higher risk because of exposure to aluminum in the product. The agency considers it prudent to alert these people to consult a doctor before using or continuing to use these products on a regular basis and is including a warning in the final monograph: ``Ask a doctor before use if you have kidney disease.`` Flaten et al. (Ref. 49) mentioned several reports of aluminum accumulation and toxicity in individuals without chronic renal failure, especially preterm infants (primarily fed intravenously), and stated that preterm infants are at risk for aluminum loading because of their immature kidney function. Term infants with normal renal function may also be at risk because of their rapidly growing and immature brain and skeleton, and an immature blood-brain barrier. Until they are 1 to 2 years old, infants have lower glomerular filtration rates than adults, which affects their kidney function. The agency is concerned that young children and children with immature renal function are at a higher risk resulting from any exposure to aluminum. Accordingly, the agency is requiring both general warnings in  330.1(g) on all aluminum-containing antiperspirant drug products to inform parents and others to keep these products away from children, and to seek professional assistance if accidental ingestion occurs. (See also section II.B, comment 7 of this document.)

The agency is including in  350.10 of this final monograph those antiperspirant active ingredients that currently have a compendial monograph. Only one active ingredient, aluminum sulfate buffered, does not have a current or proposed compendial monograph. While aluminum sulfate does have a compendial monograph, the buffer component, sodium aluminum lactate, does not. This buffer ingredient must also have a compendial monograph or there must be a compendial monograph for aluminum sulfate buffered in order for aluminum sulfate buffered to be included in the antiperspirant final monograph. At the present time, this ingredient is being included in  310.545(a)(4)(ii) as a nonmonograph ingredient because the agency is not aware of any pending compendial monograph being developed. Should a compendial monograph eventually be developed, the agency will move this ingredient from  310.545(a)(4)(ii) to  350.10. 2. The agency is revising the format for active ingredients in  350.10 for consistency with recent monographs:  The proposed chart format is now a paragraph format listing ingredients in alphabetical order. The amount of active ingredient is stated as ``up to _____ percent'' instead of as _____ percent or less concentration.'' The information about calculating the concentration on an anhydrous basis is moved to the preamble of  350.10. The preamble statement about aluminum to chloride and/or aluminum to zirconium ratios is revised to state: ``Where applicable, the ingredient must meet the aluminum to chloride, aluminum to zirconium, and aluminum plus zirconium to chloride atomic ratios described in the United States Pharmacopeia-National Formulary.'' The proposed ratio range table is not included in the final monograph because this information is now included in the USPNF monographs for each active ingredient in  350.10, where applicable. 3. The agency is expanding the indications proposed in  350.50(b) of the TFM to provide additional uses based on new effectiveness data. The  agency is also revising the uses format to make it more concise. Because the indications proposed in  350.50(b)(1), (b)(2), and (b)(3) of the TFM are very similar, the agency is combining them as a single indication with choices under  350.50(b)(1): [Select one of the following: ``decreases,'' ``lessens,'' or ``reduces''] ``underarm'' [select one of the following: ``dampness,'' ``perspiration,'' ``sweat,'' ``sweating,'' or ``wetness'']. (See section II.B, comment 6 of this document.) The agency is adding a new additional indication in  350.50(b)(2): ``also [select one of the following: `decreases,' `lessens,' or `reduces'] underarm [select one of the following: `dampness,' `perspiration,' `sweat,' `sweating,' or `wetness'] due to stress''. (See section II.B, comment 6 and section II.C, comment 13 of this document.) The agency is adding a new additional indication in  350.50(b)(3): Select one of the following: [``all day protection,'' ``lasts all day,'' ``lasts 24 hours,'' or ``24 hour protection'']. (See section II.C, comment 12 of this document.) The agency is adding a new additional  VerDate Jan<31>2003  15:48 Jun 06, 2003  Jkt 200001  PO 00000  Frm 00027  Fmt 4700  Sfmt 4700  E:\FR\FM\09JNR1.SGM  09JNR1   34288  Federal Register / Vol. 68, No. 110 / Monday, June 9, 2003 / Rules and Regulations in the controlled environment.'' (See comment 16 also.) Because the final monograph contains 24-hour duration effectiveness claims, the agency has revised section 4(a)(4) of the guidelines to state: ``For claims of enhanced duration of effect, the test should be conducted at least two times during the period of the claim, such as 1 hour and 24 hours after the last daily treatment for 24 hour claims.'' (See section II.C, comment 12 of this document.) Because the final monograph contains ``extra-effective'' claims shown by standard gravimetric testing to have a 30-percent or more reduction in sweat, the agency has revised the guidelines to include a section on data treatment to demonstrate, with high probability, at least 50 percent of the target population will obtain a sweat reduction of at least 30 percent. (See section II.C, comment 11 of this document.) The revised ``Guidelines for Effectiveness Testing of OTC Antiperspirant Drug Products'' are now dated as of the date of publication of this final rule and are on file in the Dockets Management Branch (address above) and on FDA's Web site at http:/ /www.fda.gov/cder/otc/index.htm. Persons wishing to obtain a copy of the guidelines should submit a Freedom of Information (FOI) request in writing to FDA's FOI Staff (HFI35), 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, MD 20857. The agency has revised  350.60 to include this information about the guidelines. IV. Summary of Changes from the Proposed Rule 1. The agency is modifying the definition of an antiperspirant that was proposed in  350.3 of the TFM to delete the phrase ``to the underarm.'' (See section II.B, comment 2 of this document.) 2. The agency is revising the format for listing active ingredients in  350.10. (See section III.2. of this document.) 3. The agency is expanding the indications for OTC antiperspirant drug products based on new data that support these additional uses (see section III.3. of this document) and is expanding the ``Guidelines for Effectiveness Testing of OTC Antiperspirant Drug Products'' to address some of these additional uses (see section III.6. of this document). V. The Agency's Final Conclusions The agency is issuing a final monograph establishing conditions under which OTC antiperspirant drug products are generally recognized as safe and effective and not misbranded; 18 ingredients listed in  350.10 are a monograph condition. In the Federal Register of November 7, 1990 (55 FR 46914), the agency published a final rule in part 310 establishing that certain active ingredients that had been under consideration in a number of OTC drug rulemaking proceedings were not generally recognized as safe and effective. That final rule included the antiperspirant ingredients aluminum bromohydrate, aluminum chloride (alcoholic solutions), aluminum chloride (aqueous solution) (aerosol only), aluminum sulfate, aluminum sulfate buffered (aerosol only), potassium alum, and sodium aluminum chlorohydroxy lactate in  310.545(a)(4), and was effective on May 7, 1991. In this final rule, the agency is redesignating the text of paragraph (a)(4) as paragraph (a)(4)(i), adding new paragraph (a)(4)(i) heading, and adding new paragraph (a)(4)(ii) to contain aluminum sulfate buffered with sodium aluminum lactate. Any drug product labeled, represented, or promoted for use as an OTC antiperspirant drug that contains any of the ingredients listed in  310.545(a)(4)(i) or (a)(4)(ii) or that is not in conformance with the monograph (21 CFR part 350) may be considered a new drug within the meaning of section 201(p) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act) (21 U.S.C. 321(p)) and misbranded under section 502 of the act (21 U.S.C. 352). Such a drug product can not be marketed for OTC antiperspirant use unless it is the subject of an approved application under section 505 of the act (21 U.S.C. 355) and 21 CFR part 314. An appropriate citizen petition to amend the monograph may also be submitted in accord with 21 CFR 10.30 and  330.10(a)(12)(i). Any OTC antiperspirant drug product initially introduced or initially delivered for introduction into interstate commerce after the effective date of the final rule for  310.545(a)(4)(i) or after the compliance dates of this final rule that is not in compliance with the regulations is subject to regulatory action. Mandating warnings in an OTC drug monograph does not require a finding that any or all of the OTC drug products covered by the monograph actually caused an adverse event, and FDA does not so find. Nor does FDA's requirement of warnings repudiate the prior OTC drug monographs and monograph rulemakings under which the affected drug products have been lawfully marketed. Rather, as a consumer protection agency, FDA has determined that warnings are necessary to ensure that these OTC drug products continue  indication in  350.50(b)(4) that states ``extra effective''. This claim applies to products that demonstrate 30 percent or more sweat reduction using the guidelines for effectiveness testing of antiperspirant drug products referred to in  350.60. (See section II.C, comment 11 of this document.) The agency is adding a new additional indication in  350.50(b)(5) for products that demonstrate extra effectiveness sustained over a 24-hour period: These products may state the claims in  350.50(b)(3) and (b)(4) either individually or combined, e.g., ``24 hour extra effective protection,'' ``all day extra effective protection,'' ``extra effective protection lasts 24 hours,'' or ``extra effective protection lasts all day''. (See section II.C, comment 12 of this document.) 4. The agency is revising the ``Do not apply * * *'' warning in proposed  350.50(c)(1) to the new labeling format. The warning now reads: ``Do not use on broken skin'' and ``Stop use if rash or irritation occurs''. 5. The agency is including a warning to alert people with renal dysfunction to consult a doctor before using antiperspirants containing aluminum. The warning appears in the new labeling format and states: ``Ask a doctor before use if you have kidney disease''. (See section II.F, comment 23 of this document.) 6. The agency has revised the August 1982 Guidelines for Effectiveness Testing. The revised guidelines (dated as of the date of publication of this document) state that ``FDA recognizes that alternate methods may be appropriate to qualify an antiperspirant drug product as effective. These guidelines do not preclude the use of alternate methods that provide scientifically valid results, subject to FDA approval.'' (See section II.D, comment 15 of this document.) The agency has revised parts of the test procedures section of the guidelines to delete the requirement that the control formulation be devoid of ``any'' antiperspirant activity. Therefore, the control formulation no longer needs to be compared to no treatment. (See section II.D, comment 17 of this document.) The agency has changed the permitted relative humidity of the hotroom conditions from 35 to 40 percent to a range of 30 to 40 percent. (See section II.D, comment 16 of this document.) The agency has added a requirement for ``baseline perspiration rate'' to assure that test subjects sweat adequately during a hotroom test: ``Test subjects must produce at least 100 milligrams of sweat from the placebo control axilla in a 20-minute collection  VerDate Jan<31>2003  15:48 Jun 06, 2003  Jkt 200001  PO 00000  Frm 00028  Fmt 4700  Sfmt 4700  E:\FR\FM\09JNR1.SGM  09JNR1   Federal Register / Vol. 68, No. 110 / Monday, June 9, 2003 / Rules and Regulations to be safe and effective for their labeled indications under ordinary conditions of use as those terms are defined in the act. This judgment balances the benefits of these drug products against their potential risks (see  330.10(a)). FDA's decision to act in this instance need not meet the standard of proof required to prevail in a private tort action (Glastetter v. Novartis Pharmaceuticals, Corp., 252 F.3d 986, 991 (8th Cir. 2001)). To mandate warnings, or take similar regulatory action, FDA need not show, nor do we allege, actual causation. For an expanded discussion of case law supporting FDA's authority to require such warnings, see ``Labeling of Diphenhydramine-Containing Drug Products for Over-the-Counter Human Use, Final Rule'' (67 FR 72555, December 6, 2002). VI. Analysis of Impacts An analysis of the costs and benefits of this regulation, conducted under Executive Order 12291, was discussed in the TFM for OTC antiperspirant drug products (47 FR 36492 at 36503). The one comment received is addressed in section II.A, comment 4 of this final rule and further addressed later in this section. FDA has examined the impacts of this final rule under Executive Order 12866, the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601612), and the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (2 U.S.C. 1501 et seq.). Executive Order 12866 directs agencies to assess all costs and benefits of available regulatory alternatives and, when regulation is necessary, to select regulatory approaches that maximize net benefits (including potential economic, environmental, public health and safety, and other advantages; distributive impacts; and equity). Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, if a rule has a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities, an agency must analyze regulatory options that would minimize any significant impact of the rule on small entities. Section 202(a) of the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 requires that agencies prepare a written statement of anticipated costs and benefits before proposing any rule that may result in an expenditure in any one year by State, local, and tribal governments, in the aggregate, or by the private sector, of $100 million (adjusted annually for inflation). The proposed rule that has led to the development of this final rule was published on August 20, 1982, before the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 was enacted. This final rule will not result in an expenditure in any one year by State, local, and tribal governments, in the aggregate, or by the private sector, of $100 million. The agency concludes that this final rule is consistent with the principles set out in Executive Order 12866 and in these two statutes. Additionally, the final rule is not a significant regulatory action as defined by the Executive order. The Unfunded Mandates Reform Act does not require FDA to prepare a statement of costs and benefits for this final rule, because the final rule will not result in any 1-year expenditure that would exceed $100 million adjusted for inflation. The current inflation adjusted statutory threshold is about $110 million. FDA has determined that this final rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. While the exact number of affected small entities is difficult to determine at any given time, the agency received only one comment from a small entity, which is discussed later in this section. This discussion explains the agency's determination that this final rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. The purpose of this final rule is to establish conditions under which OTC antiperspirant drug products are generally recognized as safe and effective and not misbranded. This includes establishing the allowable monograph ingredients and labeling. Eighteen of the 19 active ingredients under review are included in the final monograph. The remaining ingredient could have been included had a USP NF monograph been developed for this ingredient. If a USPNF monograph is developed before the effective date of this final monograph, products containing this ingredient could continue to be marketed without reformulation. Without a USPNF monograph for the ingredient, product reformulations to include a monograph antiperspirant active ingredient or discontinuation of the products will need to occur. The agency believes that this one antiperspirant active ingredient is currently in only a few products. Based on the large number of antiperspirant drug products in the OTC marketplace and the vast array of products that one known affected company currently markets, the agency considers the required reformulation or discontinuation of a few products not to be overly burdensome or substantial. The one known affected company markets at least 30 products not affected by this final rule. Only one of its products includes the active ingredient  34289  excluded under the final rule. Any company using this active ingredient has the option to: (1) Reformulate using any of the 18 active ingredients included in this final rule, (2) reformulate without this active ingredient and market the product as a deodorant, or (3) discontinue the product. This final rule establishes the monograph labeling for OTC antiperspirant drug products and will require relabeling of all products covered by the monograph. The agency's Drug Listing System identifies approximately 200 manufacturers and 700 marketers of 1,300 OTC antiperspirant drug products containing the 19 ingredients covered by this final rule. It is likely that there are additional products that are not currently included in the agency's system. While it is difficult to determine an exact number, the agency estimates that about 1,500 OTC antiperspirant drug products will need to be relabeled based on this final rule. The agency has been informed that relabeling costs of the type required by a final monograph generally average about $3,000 to $5,000 per stock keeping unit (SKU) (individual products, packages, and sizes). However, some of the relabeling that occurs as a result of this specific final monograph will be due to additional indications that the agency has included in the final monograph and that manufacturers will wish to add to their labeling. Assuming that there are about 1,300 to 1,500 affected OTC SKUs in the marketplace, total one-time costs of relabeling would be $3.9 million ($3,000 per SKU x 1,300 SKUs) to $7.5 million ($5,000 per SKU x 1,500 SKUs). The agency believes that actual costs will be lower for several reasons. First, many of the label changes will be made by private label manufacturers that tend to use relatively simple and less expensive labeling. Second, the agency has finalized a revised labeling format for OTC drug products in  201.66. The agency is allowing manufacturers to incorporate the labeling changes required by this final rule along with the new general OTC drug labeling format. Thus, the relabeling costs resulting from two different but related final rules will be individually reduced by implementing both required changes at the same time. Some relabeling costs will be further reduced because the agency is allowing up to 18 months (24 months for products with annual sales less than $25,000) for these revisions so they may be done in the normal course of business. Thus, manufacturers who  VerDate Jan<31>2003  15:48 Jun 06, 2003  Jkt 200001  PO 00000  Frm 00029  Fmt 4700  Sfmt 4700  E:\FR\FM\09JNR1.SGM  09JNR1   34290  Federal Register / Vol. 68, No. 110 / Monday, June 9, 2003 / Rules and Regulations For the reasons in this section and under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 605(b)), the agency certifies that this final rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Therefore, under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, no further analysis is required. VII. Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 FDA concludes that the labeling requirements in this document are not subject to review by the Office of Management and Budget because they do not constitute a ``collection of information'' under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.). Rather, the labeling statements are a ``public disclosure of information originally supplied by the Federal government to the recipient for the purpose of disclosure to the public'' (5 CFR 1320.3(c)(2)). VIII. Environmental Impact The agency has determined under 21 CFR 25.31(a) that this action is of a type that does not individually or cumulatively have a significant effect on the human environment. Therefore, neither an environmental assessment nor an environmental impact statement is required. IX. Federalism FDA has analyzed this final rule in accordance with the principles set forth in Executive Order 13132. FDA has determined that the rule does not contain policies that have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the National Government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Accordingly, the agency has concluded that the rule does not contain policies that have federalism implications as defined in the Executive order and, consequently, a federalism summary impact statement is not required. X. Section 369.20 Revision Section 369.20 (21 CFR 369.20) contains a recommended warning and caution statement for OTC antiperspirant drug products under the heading ``ANTIPERSPIRANTS:'' ``Do not apply to broken skin. If a rash develops, discontinue use.'' This statement is very similar to, but not quite as extensive as, the warnings required by the final monograph: ``Do not use on broken skin'' and ``Stop use if rash or irritation occurs''. The agency is removing the entry for ``ANTIPERSPIRANTS'' under  369.20 because it is superseded by  350.50(c)(1) and (c)(2). XI.

Among the steps the agency is taking to minimize the impact on small entities are: (1) To provide enough time to enable entities to use up existing labeling stock, and (2) to allow the labeling changes required by this final monograph to be done concurrently with the changes required by the new OTC drug labeling format. The agency believes that these actions provide small entities substantial flexibility and reductions in cost. The agency considered but rejected several labeling alternatives: (1) A shorter or longer implementation period, and (2) an exemption from coverage for small entities. While the agency believes that consumers would benefit from having this new labeling in place as soon as possible, a longer time period would unnecessarily delay the benefit of new labeling and a few revised formulations. Conversely, a shorter time period was also considered but rejected because it would be inflexible and more costly for the affected companies. The agency rejected an exemption for small entities because the new labeling and revised formulations, where applicable, are also needed by consumers who purchase products marketed by those entities. However, a longer (24-month) compliance date is being provided for products with annual sales less than $25,000. One small manufacturer has indicated that it will suffer economic consequences because it will no longer be able to make claims for use of its antiperspirant products on the hands, and for prosthesis and orthotic use. However, the manufacturer did not provide sufficient data to show that its products were safe and effective for these uses and did not provide documentation to show the economic impact of this final rule on its sales. The agency notes that the company could: (1) Relabel its products to contain only the monograph indications and then remain in the marketplace, or (2) discontinue its products. While revising the product labeling may have an economic impact on a company, it will be able to continue to market its products and can use the expanded indications provided by the final monograph to try to enhance product sales. The final rule would not require any new reporting and recordkeeping activities, and no additional professional skills are needed. There are no other Federal rules that duplicate, overlap, or conflict with the final rule.

The labeling of the product states, under the heading ``Uses,'' the phrase listed in paragraph (b)(1) of this section and may contain any additional phrases listed in paragraphs (b)(2) through (b)(5) of this section, as appropriate. Other truthful and nonmisleading statements, describing only the uses that have been established and listed in paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(5) of this section, may also be used, as provided in  330.1(c)(2) of this chapter, subject to the provisions of section 502 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act) relating to misbranding and the prohibition in section 301(d) of the act against the introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of unapproved new drugs in violation of section 505(a) of the act. (1) For any product, the labeling states [select one of the following: ``decreases,'' ``lessens,'' or ``reduces''] ``underarm'' [select one of the following: ``dampness,'' ``perspiration,'' ``sweat,'' ``sweating,'' or ``wetness'']. (2) The labeling may state ``also [select one of the following: `decreases,' `lessens,' or `reduces'] underarm [select  one of the following: `dampness,' `perspiration,' `sweat,' `sweating,' or `wetness'] due to stress''. (3) For products that demonstrate standard effectiveness (20 percent sweat reduction) over a 24-hour period, the labeling may state [select one of the following: ``all day protection,'' ``lasts all day,'' ``lasts 24 hours,'' or ``24 hour protection'']. (4) For products that demonstrate extra effectiveness (30 percent sweat reduction), the labeling may state ``extra effective''. (5) Products that demonstrate extra effectiveness (30 percent sweat reduction) sustained over a 24-hour period may state the claims in paragraphs (b)(3) and (b)(4) of this section either individually or combined, e.g., ``24 hour extra effective protection'', ``all day extra effective protection,'' ``extra effective protection lasts 24 hours,'' or ``extra effective protection lasts all day''. (c) Warnings. The labeling of the product contains the following statements under the heading ``Warnings'': (1) ``Do not use on broken skin''. (2) ``Stop use if rash or irritation occurs''. (3) ``Ask a doctor before use if you have kidney disease''. (4) For products in an aerosolized dosage form. (i) ``When using this product [bullet]1 keep away from face and mouth to avoid breathing it''. (ii) The warning required by  369.21 of this chapter for drugs in dispensers pressurized by gaseous propellants. (d) Directions. The labeling of the product contains the following statement under the heading ``Directions'': ``apply to underarms only''. Subpart D--Guidelines for Effectiveness Testing  350.60 Guidelines for effectiveness testing of antiperspirant drug products.  An antiperspirant in finished dosage form may vary in degree of effectiveness because of minor variations in formulation. To assure the effectiveness of an antiperspirant, the Food and Drug Administration is providing guidelines that manufacturers may use in testing for effectiveness. These guidelines are on file in the Dockets Management Branch (HFA305), Food and Drug Administration, 5630 Fishers Lane, rm. 1061, Rockville, MD 20852.

On April 5, 2000, a notice of proposed rulemaking (REG10787299, 20001 C.B. 911) under section 755 was published in the Federal Register (65 FR 17829). Only one commentator submitted written comments in response to the notice of proposed rulemaking, and no public hearing was requested or held. After consideration of the comment, the proposed regulations are adopted as revised by this Treasury decision. Explanation of Revisions and Summary of Contents 1. Summary Section 743(b) provides for an optional adjustment to the basis of partnership property following certain transfers of partnership interests. The amount of the basis adjustment is the difference between the transferee's basis in the partnership interest and the transferee's share of the partnership's basis in the partnership's assets. Once the amount of the basis adjustment is determined, it is allocated among the partnership's individual assets pursuant to section 755.  s  1.

The results of a RAND Corporation study commissioned by the National         Institutes of Health, as well as other recent studies, provide additional         evidence that ephedra may be associated with important health risks.         The Rand report also finds only limited evidence of health benefits resulting         from ephedra use.         On the basis of new evidence in the medical literature and in adverse         event reports, there are reasons for heightened concern that dietary         supplements containing ephedra may present a significant and unreasonable         risk of illness and injury.         To protect Americans from the potentially serious risks of these dietary         supplements, HHS and FDA are going to:                   Seek rapid public comment on the new evidence on health risks associated           with ephedra to establish an up-to-date record as quickly as possible           to support new restrictions on ephedra-containing products.            Seek rapid public comment on whether the currently available evidence           and medical literature present a ""significant or unreasonable           risk of illness or injury"" from dietary supplements containing           ephedra.            Seek rapid comment on a strong new warning label on any ephedra products           that continue to be marketed.            Immediately execute a series of actions against ephedra products           making unsubstantiated claims about sports performance enhancement.                  In addition, the nation's top public health officials issued strong         statements cautioning about the use of ephedra-containing products, especially         under conditions of strenuous exercise and in combination with other         stimulants, including caffeine.          ""We want to caution all Americans - particularly athletes and those         who engage in strenuous activities - about using dietary supplements         that contain ephedra,"" said Secretary of Health and Human Services         Tommy G. Thompson. ""There continue to be serious questions about         the risks surrounding this particular dietary supplement.""          ""FDA will do all we can to protect Americans from potentially dangerous         dietary supplements,"" said Commissioner of Food and Drugs Mark B.         McClellan, M.D., Ph.D. ""We are particularly concerned about the         risks of using products containing ephedra during heavy workouts, with         caffeine and other stimulants, in a diet program that stresses the cardiovascular         system, or by people under the age of 18. We are also concerned about         potential stresses to the body caused by the long-term use of ephedra.         The standard for regulating the safety of dietary supplements is largely         untested, but we are committed to finding the right public health solution.""         Ephedra is a naturally occurring substance derived from the Chinese         herbal Ma Huang. Its principal active ingredient is ephedrine, which         when chemically synthesized is regulated as a drug. While products containing         natural ephedrine alkaloids have long been used to treat certain respiratory         symptoms in traditional Chinese medicine, in recent years they been extensively         promoted and used with the goals of aiding weight loss, enhancing sports         performance, and increasing energy.         Many of today's proposed actions involve a  Federal           Register  notice, which went on display today, reopening for 30           days the comment period on a draft regulation FDA first proposed in           1997 and modified in 2000.          FDA's concerns about dietary supplements containing ephedra arise in         part from ephedra's mechanism of action in the body. Ephedra is an adrenaline-like         stimulant that can have potentially dangerous effects on the nervous         system and heart.          In addition, evidence is accumulating about potentially serious safety         problems following the use of ephedra-containing products. The RAND study         has concluded that ephedra is associated with higher risks of mild to         moderate side effects such as heart palpitations, psychiatric and upper         gastrointestinal effects, and symptoms of autonomic hyperactivity such         as tremor and insomnia, especially when it is taken with other stimulants.          Moreover, its review of some 16,000 adverse event reports revealed two         deaths, four heart attacks, nine strokes, one seizure, and five psychiatric         cases involving ephedra in which the records appeared thorough and no         other contributing factors were identified. RAND called such cases ""sentinel         events,"" because they may indicate a safety problem but do not prove         that ephedra caused the adverse event. The study recognized that such         case studies are a weak form of scientific evidence. Other unmeasured         factors may have contributed, and such serious adverse events are likely         to happen (albeit at very low rates) among the millions of users of ephedra         anyway. The study also identified other such events potentially associated         with ephedra, in which other factors may have contributed to the adverse         events or in which records were inadequate.         Two recent studies of ephedra's safety were published too late to be         included in the RAND Corporation's review, and each raises further concerns         about ephedra. One, published this month in the  Annals of Internal         Medicine , found that although ephedra-products make up less than         one percent of all dietary supplement sales, these products account for         64 percent of adverse events associated with dietary supplements.         Another ""case-control"" study, published in the journal  Neurology ,         concluded that the rate of hemorrhagic (bleeding) strokes among ephedra         users was statistically significantly higher than among non-users, for         people who take doses above 32 milligrams a day. Many ephedra dietary         supplement labels recommend that users take up to approximately 100 mg         of ephedra daily.         Additional relevant evidence on whether the current system of regulating         ephedra's safety is adequate comes from results under FDA's more extensive         regulation of synthetic ephedrine, which is identical to the main           active ingredient in ephedra. Ephedrine has long been available in some         FDA-approved over-the-counter and prescription drugs. It appears that         the more controlled availability of synthetic ephedrine products, which         are available primarily for approved uses for respiratory symptoms and         carry mandatory warning labels, has not been associated with the same         kind of severe adverse events as have occurred with dietary supplements         containing ephedra. This long experience with synthetic ephedrine (in         over-the-counter drug products, not in dietary supplements) suggests         that significant restrictions on labeling, marketing, and/or access to         ephedrine might effectively address unreasonable risks associated with         certain forms of ephedra today.         ""Although the overall evidence suggests that serious adverse events         from ephedra appear to be infrequent,"" said Dr. McClellan, ""we         know that such events can be very serious and possibly fatal. We believe         that the current scientific evidence strongly suggests that at least         some ephedra products present an unreasonable risk. We also believe that         FDA's system for regulating synthetic versions of the chemicals in ephedra         appears to have a much better track record of safety. To give us the         strongest possible basis for further regulatory action, we are asking         for quick comments on whether these dietary supplements present an unreasonable         risk of harm, and whether it makes sense for FDA to seek new authority         in this area.""         Under the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994, FDA does         not review dietary supplements for safety and effectiveness before they         are marketed. Rather, the law allows FDA to prohibit sale of a           dietary supplement if it ""presents a significant or unreasonable         risk of injury."" This legal standard of ""significant or unreasonable         risk"" implies a risk-benefit calculation based on the best available         scientific evidence. It strongly suggests that the agency must determine         if a product's known or supposed risks outweigh any known or suspected         benefits, based on the available scientific evidence, in light of the         claims the product makes and in light of the product's being sold directly         to consumers without medical supervision.          In seeking comment on these issues, FDA is reopening a proposed rule         entitled ""Dietary Supplements Containing Ephedrine Alkaloids."" That         proposal would have required a warning statement for these products,         as well as restrictions on their potency and composition. FDA later withdrew         parts of this proposed rule because of concerns about the specific scientific         evidence in the proposal, expressed by the General Accounting Office.          In a broad action against potentially dangerous products, FDA today         sent more than two dozen warning letters to firms marketing dietary supplements         that contain ephedrine alkaloids. The letters, targeted particularly         at products making claims for athletic performance, explain that any         claims their products make about effects on the structure and function         of the human body must be truthful and not misleading. They outline FDA's         view in light of the RAND report that the claims being made are not adequately         substantiated by scientific data, and they direct the companies to submit         any data supporting the claims within 15 days.          The letters also warn firms that they must not make claims about their         products' ability to treat or cure a disease or condition such as obesity.         Under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, unapproved products making         these ""disease claims"" are unapproved new drugs and therefore         subject to other prompt regulatory actions, including injunctions against         firms and seizures of their products.          FDA will also continue to work closely with the Federal Trade Commission         to ensure that dietary supplement products containing ephedra do not         make false and misleading claims. ""If an ad says a product is 'safe,'         the advertiser's must have competent and reliable evidence to prove the         claim,"" said Timothy J. Muris, Chairman of the Federal Trade Commission. ""Consumers         depend on advertising for factual information and deceptive ad claims         can put a consumer's health at risk. That's why the FTC is currently         investigating a number of weight loss products containing ephedra and         we will continue to pursue aggressively marketers making unsubstantiated         claims about product safety or effectiveness.""         In addition, FDA today proposed a warning label for all ephedra-containing         dietary supplements. The proposed label warns about the risks of serious         adverse events, including heart attack, seizure, stroke, and death; cautions         that the risk can increase with the dose, with strenuous exercise, and         with other stimulants such as caffeine; specifies certain groups (such         as women who are pregnant or breast feeding) who should never use these         products; and lists other conditions, such as diseases and the use of         certain medications, that rule out the use of ephedrine alkaloids.         ""The steps being announced today demonstrate FDA's commitment to         taking the most effective actions possible under current law, given the         state of the scientific evidence,"" said Dr. McClellan. ""It         may be possible to use ephedra safely, in small doses, for some purposes.         But in the face of continued serious adverse events following the use         of ephedra, there is a problem. It is a problem we are determined to         fix.""         Once the 30-day comment period has ended, FDA will analyze the comments         and publish its conclusions about the most appropriate approach to reducing         the risk of using dietary supplement products containing ephedrine alkaloids.         The National Advisory Council for the National Center for Complementary         and Alternative Medicine, part of NIH, is meeting March 17th to assess         the evidence on ephedra's safety and effectiveness in order to develop         a research agenda on ephedra. FDA will give that committee an opportunity         to comment on today's notice, should the committee find it appropriate         to do so. All interested parties may send written comments on these issues         involving ephedra until April 7, 2003,   electronically  or         by regular mail to Dockets Management Branch (HFA-305), Food and Drug         Administration, 5630 Fishers Lane, Room 1061, Rockville, MD 20852.

Overview  /  Reporting the Evidence  /  Methodology  /  Findings  /  Future Research  /  Availability of Full Report       Overview    At the direction of the funding agencies (the National Institutes of Health Office of Dietary Supplements (ODS), the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM), and the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ)), and in consultation with our Technical Expert Panel, we addressed research questions regarding the efficacy of herbal ephedra and ephedrine for weight loss and athletic performance through a comprehensive literature review and synthesis of evidence. We assessed the safety of these products through review of clinical trials. Meta-analysis was performed where appropriate. In addition, we reviewed herbal ephedra- and ephedrine-related adverse events reports on file with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), published case reports, and reports to a manufacturer of ephedra-containing products. It is expected that the results of this review will be used to direct further research.    Return to Contents     Reporting the Evidence    The following questions were provided to us by the funding agencies and guided this evidence report.   Weight Loss       What is the evidence for efficacy of ephedra-containing dietary supplement products in weight loss, over a sustained period of time?     Can efficacy for weight loss be attributed to ephedra alone, or ephedra in combination with other ingredients (e.g., caffeine)?      Does ephedra have additive effects with other agents?     What dosage levels of ephedra are necessary to achieve weight loss?     Athletic Performance       What is the evidence for efficacy of ephedra-containing dietary supplement products in terms of energy enhancement and enhancement of athletic performance, over a sustained period of time?     Can efficacy for energy enhancement and enhancement of athletic performance be attributed to ephedra alone, or ephedra in combination with other ingredients (e.g., caffeine) that produce energy enhancement and/or enhancement of athletic performance?      Does ephedra have additive effects with other agents?     What dosage levels of ephedra are necessary to achieve energy enhancement and enhancement of athletic performance?     Safety Assessment       Does use of ephedra-containing dietary supplement products over a sustained period of time increase the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) or other serious and life-threatening events in specific populations?     What populations are at risk of CVD and other life-threatening events through use of ephedra over a sustained period of time?     Can the risk for adverse events in these populations be attributed to ephedra alone, or in combination with other ingredients (e.g., caffeine)?      Does ephedra have additive effects with other agents?     What dosage levels of ephedra produce risk of CVD or other life-threatening events?      Do ephedra-containing dietary supplement products alter physiologic markers of cardiovascular function?      What are the metabolic actions of ephedra, so as to explain its beneficial and adverse effects?     In addition to answering these 15 questions about ephedra-containing dietary supplement products, we were also asked to synthesize the available information on the same questions for the purified alkaloid, ephedrine.   After searching published reports, journal articles, conference presentations, and various sources of unpublished studies, we identified 52 controlled clinical trials of ephedrine or herbal ephedra for weight loss or athletic performance in humans. The FDA provided us with copies of over 1,000 adverse event reports (AERs) related to herbal ephedra and 125 AERs related to ephedrine. These reports often included interviews with patients and/or family members, extensive medical records, and copies of product labels. We identified 65 case reports in the literature and received a disk of 15,951 reports containing 18,502 cases from Metabolife, a manufacturer of ephedra products.    Return to Contents     Methodology    Efficacy    Data for the efficacy analysis were abstracted from reports of controlled trials onto a specially designed form containing questions about the study design, the number of patients and comorbidities, dosage, adverse events, the types of outcome measures, and the time from intervention until outcome measurement. We selected the variables for abstraction with input from the project's technical experts. Two physicians, working independently, each extracted data from the same reports and resolved disagreements by consensus.    In selecting studies for the meta-analysis of weight loss efficacy, we considered only those trials of at least 8 weeks treatment duration. Our technical expert panel judged that shorter treatment durations were insufficient to assess weight loss. In selecting studies on athletic performance, we found that these studies varied widely with respect to intervention. Because of this heterogeneity, we compared and contrasted these studies in a narrative review, rather than performing a statistical synthesis.   The effects of ephedra/ephedrine on weight loss were examined in six different types of comparisons:       Ephedrine versus placebo.    Ephedrine plus caffeine versus placebo.    Ephedrine plus caffeine versus ephedrine.    Ephedrine versus other active treatment.    Ephedra versus placebo.    Ephedra plus herbs containing caffeine versus placebo.       The last comparison subgroup contained only a single trial; thus, effect sizes were estimated only for the first five. The effect size was calculated by dividing the outcome of a study (e.g., difference in weight loss per month between the two groups) by its standard deviation, which produces a unitless measure that is useful when comparing studies that assess outcomes (such as weight) that are similar but are measured differently (e.g., weight loss in pounds versus change in body mass index). Effect sizes were pooled separately for each of the five comparison subgroups.   In addition, we used meta-regression to conduct a cross-subgroup synthesis on the effect sizes of the subgroups with a placebo comparison:       Ephedrine versus placebo.    Ephedrine plus caffeine versus placebo.    Ephedra plus herbs containing caffeine versus placebo.     Safety   We reviewed each report of a controlled trial (regardless of treatment duration) for data on adverse events. Adverse events were recorded onto a spreadsheet that identified each study arm, the description of the adverse event as listed in the original article, and the numbers of subjects and adverse events in each arm. We then compared event rates in the ephedra or ephedrine groups to those in the placebo groups. We conducted a meta-analysis on those adverse event symptoms for which appreciable numbers of events were noted in the controlled trials.    Adverse event reports compiled by the FDA concerning ephedra or ephedrine were also reviewed by our physician reviewers. Within the time and resource constraints of this report, we reviewed all available reports of death, myocardial infarction (heart attack), cerebral vascular accident (stroke), seizure, and serious psychiatric illness filed prior to September 30, 2001. We also reviewed published case reports as well as event reports filed with Metabolife, a manufacturer of ephedra-containing products. After screening, all case reports were subjected to a review.   Based on input from our technical expert panel and the literature on methods to assess adverse event reports, we identified three important criteria for inclusion of such reports:        Documentation of an adverse event that met our selection criteria.     Documentation that the person having the adverse event took an ephedra-containing supplement or ephedrine within 24 hours prior to the event (for cases of death, myocardial infarction, stroke, or seizure).      Documentation that alternative explanations for the adverse event were investigated and were excluded with reasonable certainty.      We classified cases that met all three of these criteria as ""sentinel events."" Cases in which the event might have had other possible causes but the pharmacology of ephedrine could have contributed were classified as ""possible sentinel events."" Cases of death, myocardial infarction, cerebral vascular accident, and seizure were reviewed by internists, with additional review (as indicated) by a cardiologist, neurologist, or rheumatologist. Psychiatric cases were reviewed by a psychiatrist specializing in addictions and a psychologist with expertise in substance abuse. The criterion for use within 24 hours was not required for psychiatric cases.    Return to Contents     Findings    Efficacy for Weight Loss    We identified 44 controlled trials that assessed use of ephedra or ephedrine used for weight loss. Of these, 18 were excluded from pooled analysis because they had a treatment duration of less than 8 weeks. Six additional trials were excluded for a variety of other reasons. Of the remaining 20 trials included in the meta-analysis, only five tested herbal ephedra-containing products.   Together, these 20 trials assessed 678 persons who consumed either ephedra or ephedrine. The majority of studies of both ephedra and ephedrine are plagued by methodological problems (particularly, high attrition rates) that might contribute to bias. These methodological limitations must be considered when interpreting any conclusions regarding the efficacy of these products. Nevertheless, the evidence we identified and assessed supports an association between short-term use of ephedrine, ephedrine plus caffeine, or dietary supplements that contain ephedra with or without herbs containing caffeine and a statistically significant increase in short-term weight loss (compared to placebo).   Adding caffeine to ephedrine modestly increases the amount of weight loss. There is no evidence that the effect of ephedra-containing dietary supplements with herbs containing caffeine differs from that of ephedrine plus caffeine: Both result in weight loss that is approximately 2 pounds per month greater than that with placebo, for up to 4 to 6 months. No studies have assessed the long-term effects of ephedra-containing dietary supplements or ephedrine on weight loss; the longest duration of treatment in a published study was 6 months.   Efficacy for Physical Performance Enhancement    The effect of ephedrine on athletic performance was assessed in seven studies. No studies have assessed the effect of herbal ephedra-containing dietary supplements on athletic performance. The few studies that assessed the effect of ephedrine on athletic performance have, in general, included only small samples of fit individuals (young male military recruits) and have assessed the effects only on very short-term immediate performance. Thus, these studies did not assess ephedrine as it is used in the general population. The data support a modest effect of ephedrine plus caffeine on very short-term athletic performance. No studies have assessed the sustained use of ephedrine on performance over time. The only study that assessed the additive effects of these agents reported that ephedrine must be supplemented with caffeine to affect athletic performance.   Safety Issues    The data on adverse events were drawn from clinical trials and case reports published in the literature, submitted to the FDA, and reported to Metabolife, a manufacturer of ephedra-containing supplement products. The strongest evidence for causality should come from clinical trials; however, in most circumstances, such trials do not enroll sufficient numbers of patients to adequately assess the possibility of rare outcomes. Such was the case with our review of ephedrine and ephedra-containing dietary supplements. Even in aggregate, the clinical trials enrolled only enough patients to detect a serious adverse event rate of at least 1.0 per 1,000.   For rare outcomes, we reviewed case reports, but a causal relationship between ephedra or ephedrine use and these events cannot be assumed or proven.  Evidence from controlled trials was sufficient to conclude that the use of ephedrine and/or the use of ephedra-containing dietary supplements or ephedrine plus caffeine is associated with two to three times the risk of nausea, vomiting, psychiatric symptoms such as anxiety and change in mood, autonomic hyperactivity, and palpitations.   The majority of case reports are insufficiently documented to make an informed judgment about a relationship between the use of ephedrine or ephedra-containing dietary supplements and the adverse event in question. For prior consumption of ephedra-containing products, we identified two deaths, three myocardial infarctions, nine cerebrovascular accidents, three seizures, and five psychiatric cases as sentinel events; for prior consumption of ephedrine, we identified three deaths, two myocardial infarctions, two cerebrovascular accidents, one seizure, and three psychiatric cases as sentinel events. We identified 43 additional cases as possible sentinel events with prior ephedra consumption and seven additional cases as possible sentinel events for prior ephedrine consumption. About half the sentinel events occurred in persons aged 30 years or younger. Classification as a sentinel event does not imply a proven cause and effect relationship.   We did not assess the plethora of additional symptoms that have been reported in the published literature and the FDA Medwatch file for ephedra-containing dietary supplements and ephedrine products.    Return to Contents     Future Research    Our analysis of the evidence reveals numerous gaps in the literature regarding the efficacy and safety of ephedra-containing dietary supplements. First, long-term assessments of the effectiveness of herbal ephedra or ephedrine for promoting weight loss are lacking. We identified no study with a treatment duration longer than 6 months. To improve health outcomes and reduce the risk of morbidities associated with being overweight, sufficient weight loss (5 to 10 percent of body weight) and long-term weight maintenance are necessary. Therefore, the benefit of ephedrine or herbal ephedra-containing dietary supplements for health outcomes is unknown.   Evidence regarding the effect of herbal ephedra or ephedrine on physical performance that reflects its use in the general population (repeated or long-term use by a representative sample) is also needed.   In order to assess a causal relationship between ephedra or ephedrine consumption and serious adverse events, a hypothesis-testing study is needed. Continued analysis of case reports cannot substitute for a properly designed study to assess causality. A case-control study would probably be the study design of choice.

GX001-64-2990697	"FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE        PO3-13        February 28, 2003        Media Inquiries: 301-827-6250               Consumer Inquiries: 888-INFO-FDA                 HHS Acts to Reduce Potential Risks of Dietary Supplements Containing    Ephedra   The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) today announced a series    of actions designed to protect Americans from potentially serious risks of dietary    supplement products containing ephedra.    The results of a RAND Corporation study commissioned by the National Institutes    of Health, as well as other recent studies, provide additional evidence that    ephedra may be associated with important health risks. The Rand report also    finds only limited evidence of health benefits resulting from ephedra use.   On the basis of new evidence in the medical literature and in adverse event    reports, there are reasons for heightened concern that dietary supplements containing    ephedra may present a significant and unreasonable risk of illness and injury.   To protect Americans from the potentially serious risks of these dietary supplements,    HHS and FDA are going to:       Seek rapid public comment on the new evidence on health risks associated      with ephedra to establish an up-to-date record as quickly as possible to support      new restrictions on ephedra-containing products.     Seek rapid public comment on whether the currently available evidence and      medical literature present a ""significant or unreasonable risk of illness      or injury"" from dietary supplements containing ephedra.     Seek rapid comment on a strong new warning label on any ephedra products      that continue to be marketed.     Immediately execute a series of actions against ephedra products making      unsubstantiated claims about sports performance enhancement.     In addition, the nation's top public health officials issued strong statements    cautioning about the use of ephedra-containing products, especially under conditions    of strenuous exercise and in combination with other stimulants, including caffeine.     ""We want to caution all Americans - particularly athletes and those who    engage in strenuous activities - about using dietary supplements that contain    ephedra,"" said Secretary of Health and Human Services Tommy G. Thompson.    ""There continue to be serious questions about the risks surrounding this    particular dietary supplement.""    ""FDA will do all we can to protect Americans from potentially dangerous    dietary supplements,"" said Commissioner of Food and Drugs Mark B. McClellan,    M.D., Ph.D. ""We are particularly concerned about the risks of using products    containing ephedra during heavy workouts, with caffeine and other stimulants,    in a diet program that stresses the cardiovascular system, or by people under    the age of 18. We are also concerned about potential stresses to the body caused    by the long-term use of ephedra. The standard for regulating the safety of dietary    supplements is largely untested, but we are committed to finding the right public    health solution.""   Ephedra is a naturally occurring substance derived from the Chinese herbal    Ma Huang. Its principal active ingredient is ephedrine, which when chemically    synthesized is regulated as a drug. While products containing natural ephedrine    alkaloids have long been used to treat certain respiratory symptoms in traditional    Chinese medicine, in recent years they been extensively promoted and used with    the goals of aiding weight loss, enhancing sports performance, and increasing    energy.   Many of today's proposed actions involve a  Federal    Register  notice, which went on display today, reopening for 30 days the    comment period on a draft regulation FDA first proposed in 1997 and modified    in 2000.    FDA's concerns about dietary supplements containing ephedra arise in part from    ephedra's mechanism of action in the body. Ephedra is an adrenaline-like stimulant    that can have potentially dangerous effects on the nervous system and heart.     In addition, evidence is accumulating about potentially serious safety problems    following the use of ephedra-containing products. The RAND study has concluded    that ephedra is associated with higher risks of mild to moderate side effects    such as heart palpitations, psychiatric and upper gastrointestinal effects,    and symptoms of autonomic hyperactivity such as tremor and insomnia, especially    when it is taken with other stimulants.    Moreover, its review of some 16,000 adverse event reports revealed two deaths,    four heart attacks, nine strokes, one seizure, and five psychiatric cases involving    ephedra in which the records appeared thorough and no other contributing factors were identified. RAND called such cases ""sentinel    events,"" because they may indicate a safety problem but do not prove that    ephedra caused the adverse event. The study recognized that such case studies    are a weak form of scientific evidence. Other unmeasured factors may have contributed,    and such serious adverse events are likely to happen (albeit at very low rates)    among the millions of users of ephedra anyway. The study also identified other    such events potentially associated with ephedra, in which other factors may    have contributed to the adverse events or in which records were inadequate.   Two recent studies of ephedra's safety were published too late to be included    in the RAND Corporation's review, and each raises further concerns about ephedra.    One, published this month in the  Annals of Internal Medicine , found that    although ephedra-products make up less than one percent of all dietary supplement    sales, these products account for 64 percent of adverse events associated with    dietary supplements.   Another ""case-control"" study, published in the journal  Neurology ,    concluded that the rate of hemorrhagic (bleeding) strokes among ephedra users    was statistically significantly higher than among non-users, for people who    take doses above 32 milligrams a day. Many ephedra dietary supplement labels    recommend that users take up to approximately 100 mg of ephedra daily.   Additional relevant evidence on whether the current system of regulating ephedra's    safety is adequate comes from results under FDA's more extensive regulation    of synthetic ephedrine, which is identical to the main     active ingredient in ephedra. Ephedrine has long been available in some FDA-approved    over-the-counter and prescription drugs. It appears that the more controlled    availability of synthetic ephedrine products, which are available primarily    for approved uses for respiratory symptoms and carry mandatory warning labels,    has not been associated with the same kind of severe adverse events as have    occurred with dietary supplements containing ephedra. This long experience with    synthetic ephedrine (in over-the-counter drug products, not in dietary supplements)    suggests that significant restrictions on labeling, marketing, and/or access    to ephedrine might effectively address unreasonable risks associated with certain    forms of ephedra today.   ""Although the overall evidence suggests that serious adverse events from    ephedra appear to be infrequent,"" said Dr. McClellan, ""we know that such events can be very serious and possibly    fatal. We believe that the current scientific evidence strongly suggests that    at least some ephedra products present an unreasonable risk. We also believe    that FDA's system for regulating synthetic versions of the chemicals in ephedra    appears to have a much better track record of safety. To give us the strongest    possible basis for further regulatory action, we are asking for quick comments    on whether these dietary supplements present an unreasonable risk of harm, and    whether it makes sense for FDA to seek new authority in this area.""   Under the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994, FDA does not    review dietary supplements for safety and effectiveness before they are marketed.    Rather, the law allows FDA to prohibit sale of a     dietary supplement if it ""presents a significant or unreasonable risk of    injury."" This legal standard of ""significant or unreasonable risk""    implies a risk-benefit calculation based on the best available scientific evidence.    It strongly suggests that the agency must determine if a product's known or    supposed risks outweigh any known or suspected benefits, based on the available    scientific evidence, in light of the claims the product makes and in light of    the product's being sold directly to consumers without medical supervision.     In seeking comment on these issues, FDA is reopening a proposed rule entitled    ""Dietary Supplements Containing Ephedrine Alkaloids."" That proposal    would have required a warning statement for these products, as well as restrictions    on their potency and composition. FDA later withdrew parts of this proposed    rule because of concerns about the specific scientific evidence in the proposal,    expressed by the General Accounting Office.    In a broad action against potentially dangerous products, FDA today sent more    than two dozen warning letters to firms marketing dietary supplements that contain    ephedrine alkaloids. The letters, targeted particularly at products making claims    for athletic performance, explain that any claims their products make about    effects on the structure and function of the human body must be truthful and    not misleading. They outline FDA's view in light of the RAND report that the    claims being made are not adequately substantiated by scientific data, and they    direct the companies to submit any data supporting the claims within 15 days.     The letters also warn firms that they must not make claims about their products'    ability to treat or cure a disease or condition such as obesity. Under the Federal    Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, unapproved products making these ""disease    claims"" are unapproved new drugs and therefore subject to other prompt    regulatory actions, including injunctions against firms and seizures of their    products.    FDA will also continue to work closely with the Federal Trade Commission to    ensure that dietary supplement products containing ephedra do not make false    and misleading claims. ""If an ad says a product is 'safe,' the advertiser's    must have competent and reliable evidence to prove the claim,"" said Timothy    J. Muris, Chairman of the Federal Trade Commission. ""Consumers depend on    advertising for factual information and deceptive ad claims can put a consumer's    health at risk. That's why the FTC is currently investigating a number of weight    loss products containing ephedra and we will continue to pursue aggressively    marketers making unsubstantiated claims about product safety or effectiveness.""   In addition, FDA today proposed a warning label for all ephedra-containing    dietary supplements. The proposed label warns about the risks of serious adverse    events, including heart attack, seizure, stroke, and death; cautions that the    risk can increase with the dose, with strenuous exercise, and with other stimulants    such as caffeine; specifies certain groups (such as women who are pregnant or    breast feeding) who should never use these products; and lists other conditions,    such as diseases and the use of certain medications, that rule out the use of    ephedrine alkaloids.   ""The steps being announced today demonstrate FDA's commitment to taking    the most effective actions possible under current law, given the state of the    scientific evidence,"" said Dr. McClellan. ""It may be possible to use    ephedra safely, in small doses, for some purposes. But in the face of continued    serious adverse events following the use of ephedra, there is a problem. It    is a problem we are determined to fix.""   Once the 30-day comment period has ended, FDA will analyze the comments and    publish its conclusions about the most appropriate approach to reducing the    risk of using dietary supplement products containing ephedrine alkaloids.   The National Advisory Council for the National Center for Complementary and    Alternative Medicine, part of NIH, is meeting March 17th to assess the evidence    on ephedra's safety and effectiveness in order to develop a research agenda    on ephedra. FDA will give that committee an opportunity to comment on today's    notice, should the committee find it appropriate to do so. All interested parties    may send written comments on these issues involving ephedra until April 7, 2003,     electronically     or by regular mail to Dockets Management Branch (HFA-305), Food and Drug Administration,    5630 Fishers Lane, Room 1061, Rockville, MD 20852.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:  DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES Food and Drug Administration 21 CFR Part 111 [Docket No. 95N0304] RIN 0901AA59  Dietary Supplements Containing Ephedrine Alkaloids AGENCY  : Food and Drug Administration,  HHS. ACTION  : Proposed rule.  SUMMARY: The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is proposing to make a finding, which will have the force and effect of law, that a dietary supplement is adulterated if it contains 8 milligrams (mg) or more of ephedrine alkaloids per serving, or if its labeling suggests or recommends conditions of use that would result in intake of 8 mg or more in a 6-hour period or a total daily intake of 24 mg or more of ephedrine alkaloids; require that the label of dietary supplements that contain ephedrine alkaloids state ``Do not use this product for more than 7 days''; prohibit the use of ephedrine alkaloids with ingredients, or with ingredients that contain substances, that have a known stimulant effect (e.g., sources of caffeine or yohimbine), which may interact with ephedrine alkaloids; prohibit labeling claims that require long-term intake to achieve the purported effect (e.g., weight loss and body building); require a statement in conjunction with claims that encourage short-term excessive intake to enhance the purported effect (e.g., energy) that ``Taking more than the recommended serving may result in heart attack, stroke, seizure or death''; and require specific warning statements to appear on product labels. FDA is proposing these actions in response to serious illnesses and injuries, including multiple deaths, associated with the use of dietary supplement products that contain ephedrine alkaloids and the  I. Background A. Characteristics of Ephedrine Alkaloids Dietary supplements containing ephedrine alkaloids are widely sold in  the United States (Refs. 1 through 3). The ingredient sources of the ephedrine alkaloids include raw botanicals and extracts from botanical sources. Ma huang, Ephedra, Chinese Ephedra, and epitonin are several names used for botanical products, primarily from Ephedra sinica Stapf, E. equistestina Bunge, E. intermedia var. tibetica Stapf and E. distachya L. (the Ephedras), that are sources of ephedrine alkaloids. These alkaloids, ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, norpseudoephedrine, norephedrine, methylephedrine, methylpseudoephedrine, and related alkaloids, are naturally occurring chemical stimulants (Refs. 4 through 8). Although the proportions of the various ephedrine alkaloids in botanical species vary from one species to another, in most species used commercially, ephedrine is the most predominant alkaloid. The ephedrine and related alkaloids are amphetamine-like compounds. They exhibit some common types of effects but vary in the relative intensity of these effects (Table 1) (Refs. 5, 6, and 9 through 15). For example, ephedrine is a cardiovascular system (CVS) and nervous system (NS) stimulant. Pseudoephedrine has some CVS and NS stimulatory effects but is less potent than ephedrine. Norephedrine (also called phenylpropanolamine) is similar to ephedrine in its NS stimulant effects but has fewer CVS stimulant effects than ephedrine (Refs. 12 and 16 through 18). Although norephedrine is often a minor ephedrine alkaloid constituent, in humans it can be produced from ingested ephedrine through normal metabolic processes (Refs. 9, 19, and 20). Thus, its presence in body tissues and fluids may be detected, and its physiological effects can occur, even if norephedrine is not contained in meaningful amounts in the original supplement product. Data on the other ephedrine alkaloids and related alkaloids are limited, and thus their physiological and pharmacological effects are largely unknown (Ref. 15).

B. The Availability of Ephedrine Alkaloids To determine the types of ephedrine alkaloid-containing dietary supplements available in the marketplace, the agency has collected over 125 dietary supplement products labeled as containing a known source of ephedrine alkaloids during the past 2 years (Refs. 1 and 2). These products show that ephedrine alkaloid-containing-dietary supplements are marketed in a variety of forms, including capsules, tablets, powders, and liquids. The source of the ephedrine alkaloids in these supplements vary from the raw botanical to powdered plant material and concentrated extracts; however, most of the products contain concentrated extracts. Although FDA is aware that some companies have changed their labeling and formulation since the market review, this review of the marketplace reflects the general contours of products currently sold in the United States. Ephedrine alkaloids are present in some products as a single ingredient, but more commonly, they are combined with other ingredients, including vitamins, minerals, amino acids, and other botanicals (Refs. 1, 2, and 21). Most of the dietary supplements that contain an ingredient source of the ephedrine alkaloids also contain between 6 and 20 other ingredients. Some of these other ingredients have known or suspected physiological and pharmacological activities that have the potential for interacting with the ephedrine alkaloids so as to increase their effects. For example, the majority of dietary supplements containing ephedrine alkaloids also contain a source of xanthine alkaloids (e.g., caffeine), another stimulant substance that is known to increase the effects of ephedrine alkaloids (Refs. 7, 16, 22, and 23). Because product labels do not usually provide information on product composition (Ref. 24), and there are no data bases containing such data, FDA laboratories analyzed the products collected to quantify the levels of ephedrine alkaloids (Refs. 1, 2, 21, and  25). Results of the analyses show that these products, taking into account the labeled recommended serving instructions, are likely to provide intakes of ephedrine alkaloids that range from below the detectible limits of FDA's analytical method to 110 mg per serving (i.e., per single use) (Refs. 1, 2, 21, 25, and 26). Most of the products, regardless of their promoted use, had ephedrine alkaloid levels at or above 10 mg per serving. Many of the dietary supplement products that FDA collected were promoted for uses such as weight loss, body building, increased energy, increased mental concentration, increased sexual sensations, or euphoria or as alternatives to illicit street drugs (Refs. 1, 2, and 25). The majority of the products collected also bore warning statements on their labels (Refs. 1, 2, and 27). The warning statements varied from general precautions, suggesting that the consumer check with a health care professional before beginning any diet or exercise program, to more specific warning statements. The more specific warning statements contained several elements, including cautions that the consumer not use the product if they have certain diseases or health conditions or are using certain drugs, and to stop the use of the product if they develop certain symptoms (Refs. 1, 2, 25, and 27). C. Adverse Events Associated With Ephedrine Alkaloids Since 1993, FDA has received more than 800 reports of illnesses and injuries (AER's) associated with the use of more than 100 different dietary supplement products that contained, or were suspected to contain, ephedrine alkaloids. These adverse events tended to involve CVS effects and NS effects. FDA evaluated the AER's showing CVS and NS effects and found that the single most common element was that the products contained, or were thought to contain, a source of ephedrine alkaloids. Approximately 50 to 60 percent of the AER's associated with use of dietary supplements were for such products.  The AER's associated with the ephedrine alkaloid-containing products included consistent patterns of signs and symptoms among both otherwise healthy individuals and those with underlying diseases or conditions. These signs and symptoms included rapid and irregular heart rhythms, increased blood pressure, chest pain, anxiety, nervousness, tremor, hyperactivity, and insomnia (i.e., inability or difficulty in sleeping) and were associated with clinically significant conditions, including heart attack, stroke, psychoses, seizure, and, in a few cases, death. Many of these signs and symptoms occurred in young adults who generally would not have been expected to be at high risk for such conditions (e.g., heart attack and stroke). Many adverse events were reported to occur with the first use or within the first 2 weeks of use. Although the majority occurred in women, men also reported experiencing adverse events. The nature and patterns of these AER's are consistent with the known physiological and pharmacological effects of ephedrine alkaloids as described in: (1) Pharmacology texts for single ephedrine alkaloid products, (2) case reports of adverse effects from the scientific literature related to the pharmaceutical use of ephedrine alkaloids, (3) adverse events reported in controlled clinical trials using ephedrine in the treatment of obesity, and (4) known safety concerns with traditional medical uses of botanicals that contain ephedrine alkaloids. As a result, FDA focused its investigation on ephedrine alkaloids as a likely factor in the rapidly increasing number of serious AER's associated with the use of dietary supplement products. D. Review Activities The growing number and consistency of reports of serious adverse events associated with a wide variety of ephedrine alkaloid-containing dietary supplements, and the virtual absence of publicly available safety data on these supplements, prompted FDA to convene an ad hoc Working Group of its Food   30680  Federal Register / Vol. 62, No. 107 / Wednesday, June 4, 1997 / Proposed Rules 2. The Food Advisory Committee Meeting In the 6 months that followed the Working Group meeting, the number of reports of adverse events associated with the use of dietary supplements thought to contain ephedrine alkaloids doubled. In addition, FDA received information on two deaths of young adult males in which the medical examiners specifically attributed the cause of death to use of ephedrine alkaloid-containing dietary supplements (see medical examiners' reports in Adverse Reaction Monitoring System (ARMS) No. 10862 and 11134). FDA analyzed samples of products that consumers claimed that they had consumed and suffered an adverse event and found that the ephedrine alkaloid levels in many of these products were below the 25-mg limit suggested by certain members of the Working Group. In light of the rapidly increasing numbers of adverse events as well as of the new analytical information on AERrelated intakes of ephedrine alkaloids, FDA recognized that a determination on how to deal with dietary supplements that contained these substances could not be further delayed. Thus, FDA convened its Food Advisory Committee in conjunction with the Working Group to review and provide final recommendations on what to do with ephedrine alkaloid-containing dietary supplements. The Food Advisory Committee met on August 27 and 28, 1996. The meeting included all members from the Working Group who were available to attend the meeting, as well as additional experts to replace those experts unable to attend or to fill out the range of expertise needed to appropriately evaluate the subject. FDA asked the Food Advisory Committee to consider the safety of using dietary supplements containing ephedrine alkaloids and to make specific recommendations on how to resolve the public health concerns surrounding their use (Ref. 25). The Food Advisory Committee reviewed the evidence that had been presented to the Working Group as well as new data and information that had become available since the October 1995 Working Group meeting. Following a review of the totality of the available evidence, the October 1995 recommendations of the Working Group, public comments, and considerable discussion, the Food Advisory Committee agreed that FDA should take action to address the rapidly evolving and serious public health concerns associated with the use of ephedrine alkaloid-containing dietary supplements (Ref. 25). The Food Advisory Committee could not, however, come to consensus on a specific approach to the public health concerns. Over half of the Food Advisory Committee members stated that, based on the available data, no safe level of ephedrine alkaloids could be identified for use in dietary supplements (Ref. 25). Many of these members expressed concern that many individuals who would be at risk if they were to use products were unaware of that risk because many of the conditions that increase the risk of adverse events may not be self-evident (Ref. 25). Consequently, they recommended removing dietary supplements containing ephedrine alkaloids from the market (Ref. 25). Other members of the Food Advisory Committee suggested that the agency establish conditions of use that would reduce the risk of adverse events, including establishing ``reasonably'' safe per serving and daily use levels for both ephedrine alkaloids and ephedrine as well as other requirements (Ref. 25). II. FDA's Response Following the August 1996 meeting of the Food Advisory Committee, the agency completed its review of the majority of the AER's associated with these products and reviewed the discussions and the recommendations of the Food Advisory Committee, the scientific literature, the views expressed in public comments, and other data. Based on this information, the agency has tentatively concluded that use of ephedrine alkaloids raises important public health concerns, that the risks these substances create are potentially very serious, and that action must be taken to protect the public health. A. Summary of Initial Considerations Between 1993 and 1996, FDA received a rapidly escalating number of AER's associated with the use of dietary supplements, some that contained ephedrine alkaloids, some that did not (Refs. 32 through 34). Figure 1 shows that in the 3 years since the initiation of an adverse event monitoring system for special nutritional products, the number of AER's received by the agency on dietary supplements has quadrupled. BILLING CODE 416001P  Advisory Committee (the Working Group) (Refs. 27 through 29). 1. The Food Advisory Committee Working Group Meeting on Dietary Supplements Containing Ephedrine Alkaloids On October 11 and 12, 1995, the Working Group, which consisted of medical and other scientific experts from outside FDA as well as industry and consumer representatives, considered the potential public health problems associated with the use of dietary supplements and other food products containing ephedrine alkaloids. The Working Group reviewed the evidence on the occurrence of adverse events associated with the use of ephedrine alkaloids. This evidence included the known pharmacology of ephedrine alkaloids, numerous case reports published in the scientific literature, and published findings from clinical studies investigating the use of ephedrine in the treatment of obesity (Ref. 30). The evidence also included over 325 AER's that had been received by FDA that were associated with the consumption of dietary supplements known to contain, or suspected of containing, ephedrine alkaloids (Refs. 29 and 31). The Working Group also considered public comments made during the meeting (Ref. 27). Following their review of this evidence, the members of the Working Group agreed that the use of certain dietary supplements containing ephedrine alkaloids may cause consumers to experience serious adverse events. On this basis, the Working Group recommended that FDA: (1) Establish single serving and daily total use limits for ephedrine and total ephedrine alkaloids; (2) require warning or cautionary statements on the labels of these products; and (3) establish good manufacturing practice (GMP) requirements, including proper botanical identification and standardization of the ephedrine alkaloid and ephedrine content in concentrated extracts. Several members of the Working Group suggested that ephedrine alkaloids be limited to 25 mg per single serving and 100 mg total daily use. Other members suggested a variety of lower levels of ephedrine alkaloids per serving. The Working Group also discussed specific warning label statements but failed to agree on the wording of the warning statements.   Federal Register / Vol. 62, No. 107 / Wednesday, June 4, 1997 / Proposed Rules  30681  BILLING CODE 416001C   30682  Federal Register / Vol. 62, No. 107 / Wednesday, June 4, 1997 / Proposed Rules to the age and gender of individuals experiencing an adverse event). When FDA examined the products reported to be associated with the CVS and NS effects, the most common element among them was that they involved products that contained or were believed to contain an ingredient source of ephedrine alkaloids. Thus, FDA focused its investigation on the ephedrine alkaloids in dietary supplement products. BILLING CODE 416001P  Many of these reports have been for clinically significant events (e.g., heart attack, stroke, seizures) that were observed most often in young adults for whom the risk of these types of events are generally low (see Figure 2, which summarizes data from the AER's relative  BILLING CODE 416001C  However, many of the ephedrine alkaloid-containing products also contained other ingredients (e.g., amino acids, vitamins and minerals, other botanicals) whose possible influence on the observed AER's could not be ignored. Upon examination of the types of other ingredients, FDA tentatively concluded that these other ingredients should not be the primary focus of its evaluation because these ingredients, unlike the ephedrine alkaloids, did not have a history (in the amounts likely to be found in dietary supplements) of being able to produce the types of serious adverse events being observed. For example, many ephedrine alkaloidcontaining dietary supplements also contain known stimulants (e.g., sources of caffeine). While caffeine is known to stimulate the NS, in the amounts likely to be found in dietary supplements it is not expected to produce effects such as stroke, heart attack, and seizure.  Nonetheless, FDA remained aware of the possibility that other ingredients in these dietary supplement products contributed to the adverse events reported. For example, other stimulants in the ephedrine-containing dietary supplements could enhance the known stimulant effects of ephedrine alkaloids. Likewise, substances that affect kidney function (e.g., sources of salicin, concentrated amino acids) could influence the body's ability to ``clear'' or rid itself of ingested ephedrine alkaloids. The agency also considered in its evaluation the fact that botanical sources contain mixtures of ephedrine alkaloids that may have slightly different effects (e.g., additive or interactive effects) than those from a single ephedrine alkaloid, as found in over-the-counter (OTC) products. The agency compared the observed effects of supplement products with the known  physiological and pharmacological effects of single sources of the alkaloids that are used as ingredients in several drugs (e.g., ephedrine in OTC bronchodilator products, pseudoephedrine in cough and cold preparations, and phenylpropanolamine in anoretic products). However, the agency was not able to find definitive evidence to evaluate whether ephedrine alkaloids from botanical sources are metabolized differently than those from pharmaceutical sources, and in the absence of more directly relevant data for dietary supplement products, the agency considered it appropriate to rely on evidence from pharmaceutical sources of single ephedrine alkaloids in assessing the effects of botanical sources (see section II.C.2. of this document). B. FDA's Strategy for Evaluation FDA considered five questions in evaluating the reports of adverse events involving ephedrine alkaloids that it   Federal Register / Vol. 62, No. 107 / Wednesday, June 4, 1997 / Proposed Rules had received. These questions were designed to help the agency discern relationships among AER's where direct and readily interpretable clinical studies were not available, and where multiple host or product factors may have affected any association (Refs. 35 through 37). The questions focused the evaluation on whether there was a likely association between the ephedrine alkaloids and the adverse events that had been reported and on the strength, nature, and biological plausibility of any association. These questions were: (1) Using the AER's on marketed ephedrine alkaloid-containing dietary supplements from FDA's passive surveillance system, are there consistent patterns of signs and symptoms associated with the use of a number of different ephedrine alkaloid-containing dietary supplement products? (2) Are the patterns of the signs and symptoms consistent with the available scientific evidence and known physiologic and pharmacologic effects of ephedrine alkaloids? (3) Is there sufficient evidence that the relationships are temporally correct, that is, does exposure occur temporally before the onset of the observed patterns of signs and symptoms? (4) Is there other evidence of causality, even in the absence of controlled trials, e.g., evidence of dechallenge (improvement or resolution of the signs and symptoms when use of the product is discontinued) or positive rechallenge (reoccurrence of the signs and symptoms when reexposed to ephedrine alkaloids)? (5) Considering the totality of the available information, is there a biologically plausible explanation for the adverse events? Finally, in fully evaluating the public health concerns associated with these products, the agency evaluated the potential impact of other factors that could influence final decisions on the best approach to addressing the public health concerns. C. Evaluation and Tentative Conclusions of the Agency 1. Using the AER's From FDA's Passive Surveillance System for Dietary Supplements, FDA Has Tentatively Concluded That There Are Consistent Patterns of Signs and Symptoms Associated With the Use of a Number of Different Ephedrine AlkaloidContaining Dietary Supplement Products In preparation for its August 27 and 28, 1996, Food Advisory Meeting, FDA reviewed each of the approximately 600 AER's that it had received before June 7, 1996 (Refs. 31 and 38). The adverse events associated with ephedrine alkaloid-containing dietary supplement products ranged from those with clinically serious sequelae (such as abnormal heart rhythms, chest pain, heart attack, stroke, significant elevations in blood pressure, seizure, hepatitis, coma, psychosis, and death) to those with less clinically significant signs and symptoms (such as nervousness, dizziness, tremor, minor alterations in blood pressure or heart rate, headache, and gastrointestinal distress) (see Table 1). Although many of the AER's crossed clinical categories, approximately 15 percent of the reports described serious cardiovascular effects, including abnormal heart rhythms, stroke, heart attack, and cardiomyopathy (disease of the heart muscle). Approximately 16 percent of the reports mentioned serious NS effects, including seizure, psychosis, mania, severe depression, vestibular (inner ear) disturbances, and loss of consciousness. Other clinically serious or potentially serious adverse effects reported to be associated with the use of these products included elevations of liver function tests or overt hepatitis (4 percent), myopathies (disease of muscle, particularly skeletal muscle) (3 percent), disturbances of the genitourinary system (e.g., urinary retention, urinary infection, prostatitis (inflammation of the prostate gland), and epididymitis (inflammation of the epididymis, part of the male genitourinary tract)) (3 percent), and dermatologic manifestations (including systemic rashes which appear to be immune mediated or allergic in nature) (6 percent). Approximately 30 percent of the reports mentioned other effects, including gastrointestinal distress, abnormal blood sugar levels or diabetes, blood disorders (including increased bleeding tendencies and abnormal blood cell counts), thyroid disorders, and addiction to the product. Finally, approximately 60 percent of the adverse events were characterized by general stimulant effects on the CVS and NS of a ``less clinically serious'' nature, including anxiety, nervousness, hyperactivity, tremor, insomnia, and altered heart rate or rhythms. However, FDA recognized that these reports of less clinically significant effects could be indicative of early warnings of serious cardiovascular or nervous system risks if product use were to continue. Serious adverse events were reported for a number of different products promoted for a variety of uses and marketed in a variety of formulations  30683  (Refs. 27, 31, and 38). Of these, where there was sufficient information to evaluate how the product was marketed or used, approximately 92 percent of the adverse events were related to the use of products marketed for weight loss and energy purposes, and 5 percent were related to products promoted for enhancing athletic performance or body building, although there was overlap among these uses. Approximately 2 percent of the adverse events were related to products marketed as alternatives to illicit street drugs or for euphoric purposes. (This distribution of types of products parallels the observations made from FDA's market review, which found that most of the dietary supplements containing ephedrine alkaloids bear weight loss and energy claims on their labels or in their labeling (Refs. 1 and 2).) Moreover, specific types of adverse events did not appear to be limited to products promoted for any single use, such as weight loss, energy, or euphoria. The adverse events were reported to occur in both healthy individuals and in individuals with underlying diseases or conditions that may have influenced the frequency, pattern, or severity of the adverse event (Refs. 25, 27, 31, and 38). Of great concern to the agency are the heart attacks, strokes, seizures, and other clinically serious illnesses and injuries reported to occur in young adults (Figure 2). In approximately 56 percent of the reported adverse events, the injured party was less than 40 years of age, and approximately 25 percent of injuries occurred in those between 40 and 49 years of age. Generally, significant CVS or NS risk factors are not expected in these age groups. Almost 75 percent of the adverse events were reported to occur in females, often using products promoted for weight loss. The higher frequency of adverse events in women most likely reflects a difference in product use (i.e., women predominantly use products marketed for weight loss and energy purposes). However, gender predominance in these ratios may also occur because of genderrelated differences in metabolism of ephedrine alkaloids, or gender-related differences in the numbers and types of tissue receptors interacting with ephedrine alkaloids (Refs. 39 through 41). Data on duration of use of ephedrine alkaloid-containing dietary supplements relative to the occurrence of AER's can also be used to examine the similarity of patterns of adverse events across different types of exposures and individual sensitivities. Figure 3 summarizes the duration of use data collected from the AER's associated   30684  Federal Register / Vol. 62, No. 107 / Wednesday, June 4, 1997 / Proposed Rules dietary supplement (Ref. 38) (see ARMS No. 10009 and 11619 in the Appendix to this document) and, in a few cases, on the initial use (Ref. 38) (ARMS No. 11401 in the Appendix to this document). Of equal concern to the agency are reports of serious adverse events occurring within a relatively short time period after consumers began to use the products or consumers began to start using the products after having stopped use for a period of time (ARMS No. 11076 in the Appendix to this document). BILLING CODE 416001P  with products containing ephedrine alkaloids. As shown in Figure 3, this information reveals that about 59 percent of the adverse events were reported to occur within 4 weeks of starting to use the product. About 14 percent of the reported adverse events occurred on the first day of using the  BILLING CODE 416001C  Adverse events appear to reflect different inherent types of individual sensitivities relative to dose levels, frequency or duration of use, and subsequent results of sympathomimetic stimulation. In some cases, particular events appear to occur as the result of increased individual susceptibility to the effects of sympathetic stimulation (Refs. 39 through 42). For example, in one report (ARMS No. 10862 in the Appendix to this document), three young adult males consumed similar amounts of a dietary supplement containing ephedrine alkaloids, yet only one male experienced serious adverse effects, which resulted in his death (see Police and Medical Examiner's Reports in ARMS No. 10862 in public docket number 95N0304). This report is illustrative of numerous AER's  suggesting an unpredictable pattern and severity of adverse events when consuming ephedrine alkaloidcontaining dietary supplements, even when used according to package directions or under ordinary conditions of use. In other cases, some of the adverse events were associated with consumption of relatively low levels of ephedrine alkaloids (e.g., approximately 10 mg or less total ephedrine alkaloids per serving), some occurring shortly after onset of use. These variations in the occurrence of adverse events relative to duration, frequency, and levels of exposure are suggestive that multiple factors influence sensitivity to ephedrine alkaloid intakes and could be indicative that some of the adverse effects are the result of increased individual  susceptibility to the acute or chronic effects of ephedrine alkaloids. In summary, in reviewing the AER's associated with ephedrine alkaloidcontaining dietary supplements, the agency noted a consistency of signs and symptoms across a large number of products, across a range of products with a variety of intended uses, across products with many different formulations, and across a heterogeneous group of individuals with respect to gender, age, and health condition. Generally, the overall pattern of observed results was consistent with stimulant CVS and NS effects, even though not every product showed the same effect or the same seriousness of effect, not every case involved CVS or NS effects, and not all reports were complete or uncomplicated. The patterns of duration of use and dosage   Federal Register / Vol. 62, No. 107 / Wednesday, June 4, 1997 / Proposed Rules levels suggest patterns of adverse events that are influenced by variations in individual sensitivities. Overall, however, there was a remarkable consistency in the types of signs and symptoms of adverse effects reported. This consistency was recognized by the Working Group (Ref. 27). The foregoing discussion summarizes the AER's from a descriptive statistical perspective. Many of these reports are summarized in the Appendix to this document. An abbreviated description of all reports is in public docket number 95N0304. A few examples of experiences of particular individuals are given below. ARMS No. 11134--A 23-year-old male college student used an ephedrine alkaloid-containing ergogenic product for approximately 2 years, along with several other dietary supplement products. He was previously healthy and was known to have a healthy life style. He was found dead by his sister in the apartment that they shared. The Medical Examiner's report stated that the cause of death was due to ``patchy myocardial necrosis associated with ephedrine toxicity from protein drink containing Ma huang extract.'' ARMS No. 9552--A 35-year-old female, who was on no medications and who had a negative past medical history, developed a non-Q wave myocardial infarction (heart attack) while using an ephedrine alkaloidcontaining dietary supplement within the dosage recommended on the label. She used the product for approximately 30 days, stopped for 1 week while on vacation, and then reinitiated the use of the product. About 11 days after restarting the product, she developed acute throbbing, anterior chest pain at rest, with radiation to the left shoulder, numbness of the left arm and hand, diaphoresis (sweating), and shortness of breath. In the hospital, clinical evaluations (electrocardiogram and cardiac enzymes) indicated an acute non-Q wave myocardial infarction, thought to be secondary to coronary artery spasm. Cardiac catheterization showed normal coronary arteries. ARMS No. 10009--A 35-year-old male took an ephedrine alkaloidcontaining dietary supplement (2 capsules at noon, 3 capsules at 4:30 pm). He worked out from 5:30 to 6:30 pm, developing chest pain at 7:30 pm. He was admitted to the hospital with an acute myocardial infarction (by electrocardiogram and cardiac enzymes) and was treated medically. Subsequent cardiac catheterization demonstrated normal coronary arteries. ARMS No. 11144--A 28-year-old man used an ephedrine alkaloid-containing product for 10 months (1 capsule per day) for energy. His father found him bloody and responding inappropriately. In the emergency department, his blood pressure was 168/90, with a pulse of 116. Results of extensive clinical and laboratory evaluations were all within normal limits. He was diagnosed with syncope and a closed head injury. His neurologist concluded that ``most likely he had a seizure secondary to ephedrine'' from the health food substance he was taking. He was advised to avoid the product and dispose of it. This man was on no other medications and had no significant past medical history. In particular, he never had problems with dizziness or passing out. ARMS No. 10974--A 19-year-old woman took an ephedrine alkaloidcontaining product, one before each meal, three times per day (1/2 of recommended amount) for 1 month, for weight loss. Her family witnessed seizure activity at mealtime and took her to the emergency room. Evaluations there were essentially normal (CT scan of the head and electroencephalogram or EEG). The neurologist's evaluation found no other risk factors for seizure. No other products had been used, and there was no significant past medical history. ARMS No. 10088--A 38-year-old female took two products containing ephedrine alkaloids for 4 days, and she developed syncope (light-headedness) and an extremely elevated blood pressure, measured at 180/110. She was seen in the emergency department with severe headache, nausea, and sweating. The consumer had been seen every 3 to 4 months for the 5 years before this event and had no history of high blood pressure. After stopping the products, her blood pressure returned to normal. ARMS No. 10919--A 49-year-old woman used an ephedrine alkaloidcontaining product, 3 capsules three times daily for 3 weeks for weight loss. She developed weakness, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, and palpitations and went to the emergency room, where she was found to have vertigo (type of dizziness), serous otitis media (middle ear inflammation) bilaterally, hypertension (150/102), and elevated liver enzymes. The consumer reported that when she stopped the product, her blood pressure returned to normal without any medical treatment. She did not have a history of high blood pressure. ARMS No. 10946--A 42-year-old female used an ephedrine alkaloidcontaining product, 1 capsule twice daily for 3 days for weight loss. She was also taking vitamin B12 and an  30685  antioxidant supplement. She developed a rash over her entire body and stopped all three products. She restarted the ephedrine alkaloid-containing product 3 days after the onset of her rash. Three days later, on a visit to her doctor for a nonproductive cough and congestion, she was found to be seriously hypertensive (170/114). She had no history of hypertension and had been seen by her gynecologist 1 week before starting the ephedrine alkaloidcontaining product, where a normal blood pressure (120/78) was documented. 2. The Patterns of the Signs and Symptoms of Adverse Events Associated With Ephedrine AlkaloidContaining Dietary Supplements Are Consistent With the Available Scientific Evidence and Known Physiologic and Pharmacologic Effects of Ephedrine Alkaloids The observed CVS and NS effects associated with use of ephedrine alkaloid-containing dietary supplements are consistent with the known pharmacologic and physiologic effects of ephedrine alkaloids. Because there is a general paucity of scientific data or other information on the physiologic or pharmacologic properties of ephedrine alkaloids from botanical sources, and particularly from marketed dietary supplement products, FDA reviewed other available evidence on ephedrine and other ephedrine alkaloids for information on their effects. This evidence included data from clinical and animal studies in support of drugs containing a single, synthetic ephedrine alkaloid in a well-defined and characterized product, case reports from the literature of adverse events with ephedrine alkaloid-containing products, and traditional medical uses of ephedrine alkaloid-containing botanicals. Although there may be some differences in the pharmacokinetic properties of synthetic ephedrine alkaloids used in drug products as compared to the botanical sources of these alkaloids as used in dietary supplements (e.g., differences in enantiomer forms, dissolution, absorption, and bioavailability or differences that result from interactions with other components of the botanical), given that once absorbed, the botanical and synthetic sources of ephedrine alkaloids undergo similar metabolic processes (Refs. 24 and 43), the agency considered it appropriate to rely on evidence from pharmaceutical sources of single ephedrine alkaloids in assessing the effects of botanical sources. This judgment is supported by   30686  Federal Register / Vol. 62, No. 107 / Wednesday, June 4, 1997 / Proposed Rules sympathetic nervous system and thus are classified as sympathomimetic agents (i.e., agents stimulating the sympathetic nervous system) (Refs. 7, 9 through 13, and 44 through 48). Ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, and norephedrine are naturally occurring sympathomimetic amines in some botanicals. Ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, and norephedrine each have varying effects because of interaction with specific receptors in the human body (i.e., alpha, beta-1, and beta-2 adrenergic receptors) (Refs. 9 through 13). (Table 2 summarizes some of the major receptor effects, and Table 3 summarizes the adrenergic activity of ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, phenylpropanolamine (dlnorephedrine), and norepinephrine.) Some of the physiological roles of alpha receptors are central NS stimulation, vasoconstriction (i.e., narrowing of blood vessels), uterine contraction, centrally mediated cardiovascular depression, and decreased insulin secretion. Alpha receptors also have an effect on the urinary bladder, which can result in urinary retention. The major physiological roles of beta receptors include cardiac (i.e., heart) stimulation and bronchodilation (enlargement of the bronchial or breathing tube secondary to relaxation of bronchial smooth muscle).  the fact that adverse events reported for dietary supplements containing ephedrine alkaloids from botanical sources are similar to those that are reported in the literature for drugs containing an ephedrine alkaloid from synthetic sources. FDA's Working Group agreed that evidence on synthetic sources of ephedrine alkaloids could be considered in evaluating botanical sources (Ref. 27). Ephedrine and its related alkaloids are known to elicit physiological responses similar to catecholamines (i.e., groups of chemically related neurotransmitters, such as epinephrine, norepinephrine, and dopamine) that have stimulant effects on the  TABLE 2.--ADRENERGIC ACTIVITY OF SYMPATHOMIMETIC AGENTS (MODIFIED FROM REF. 9) Type of effects adrenergic receptors Organ/system Nervous system (NS) .........

The different types of ephedrine alkaloids exhibit some similar effects but vary in the intensity of these effects (Refs. 10 through 13). For example, ephedrine increases arterial blood pressure in humans both by peripheral vasoconstriction (narrowing of the blood vessels in the periphery of the body)  and by cardiac stimulation, resulting in increased heart rate and cardiac output. The magnitude of these cardiovascular responses can vary on an individual basis and may be dependent on a number of factors, including genetic characteristics, a history of certain diseases or conditions, or the use of  certain medications. Other actions of ephedrine include stimulation of oxygen uptake and thermogenesis (heat or energy production). Pseudoephedrine is less potent than ephedrine both in its bronchodilatory and vasopressor effects (i.e., effect of elevating blood pressure). It produces about one half the   Federal Register / Vol. 62, No. 107 / Wednesday, June 4, 1997 / Proposed Rules bronchodilation and one quarter of the vasopressor effects of ephedrine (Refs. 9 and 13). a. Physiologic and pharmacologic evidence: cardiovascular effects of ephedrine alkaloids. The adverse events involving the CVS reported to FDA that are associated with dietary supplements containing ephedrine alkaloids are consistent with the known effects of sympathomimetic agents on the CVS. Cardiovascular effects resulting from the use of sympathomimetic agents are well documented in the literature (Refs. 49 through 52). For example, use of ephedrine has been reported to interfere with the regulation of serum potassium levels (Refs. 53 through 55) and thus may predispose certain individuals to cardiac dysrhythmias (i.e., abnormal heart rhythms) (Refs. 18 and 56); myocardial ischemia (i.e., inadequate circulation of blood and oxygen to the heart muscle); and infarction (i.e., death or damage of heart cells, also called heart attack) (Refs. 57 through 61). Cardiac damage has also been reported with the use of pseudoephedrine and phenylpropanolamine (norephedrine) (Refs. 16, 56, 60, and 62 through 64). Results of several studies on blood pressure effects with the use of ephedrine alkaloids have indicated that individuals with hypertension may be at greater risk of blood pressure elevations with the use of ephedrine (reviewed in (Ref. 64)). The signs and symptoms observed in the AER's are consistent with the available scientific literature on the effects of ephedrine alkaloids. Serious cardiovascular adverse events are the major cause of death reported in the AER's with the use of ephedrine alkaloid-containing products and primarily involve ischemia (inadequate blood flow) which can cause heart attacks and strokes. These events have occurred in asymptomatic, otherwise healthy young adults with normal coronary or cerebral blood vessels (Ref. 25), a finding also noted with pharmaceutical preparations of ephedrine alkaloids (Refs. 60, 61, and 65), where vasospasm with subsequent ischemia is a proposed mechanism of tissue injury. Besides causing damage by affecting blood flow, sympathomimetic agents, such as ephedrine, can damage the heart and other tissues or organs by other mechanisms. Cardiomyopathy (i.e., disease of the heart muscle) related to catecholamine mediated cytotoxicity (cell damage) has been reported with chronic use of ephedrine alkaloids (durations of use generally at or above the recommended dose that occur over many months or years) (Refs. 62 and 66 through 68). Fatal cardiomyopathies have also been reported with chronic use of ephedrine alkaloid-containing dietary supplements (ARMS No. 11134 in Ref. 149a). Ephedrine and pseudoephedrine have been implicated also in stroke secondary to intracranial (i.e., inside the brain) and subarachnoid (i.e., underneath the membrane that covers the brain and spinal cord) hemorrhage and vasculitis (i.e., inflammation of blood vessels), as well as in ischemic strokes (Refs. 9 and 69 through 71), particularly when used in combinations with phenylpropanolamine (norephedrine) or caffeine (Refs. 65 and 72 through 78) or in the presence of monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOI) (Ref. 72). These effects are noted to be similar to the necrotizing angiitis (severe inflammation with destruction of the blood vessels) seen in chronic amphetamine abuse (Refs. 16, 74, and 77 through 79).  30687  b. Physiologic and pharmacologic evidence: NS effects of ephedrine alkaloids. The adverse events involving the NS reported to FDA that are associated with dietary supplements containing ephedrine alkaloids are consistent with the known effects of sympathomimetic agents on the NS. These effects, such as seizure (Refs. 63, 65, and 80), psychosis, and mania (Refs. 81 through 99), have been reported with the use and the abuse of ephedrine alkaloids. More recently, a case report in the scientific literature reported ephedrine-induced mania associated with the use of a botanical dietary supplement (Ref. 100). Neuropsychiatric effects reported in AER's related to ephedrine alkaloidcontaining dietary supplements also are consistent with the known physiologic and pharmacologic actions of ephedrine alkaloids documented in the scientific literature. Mania and psychosis have occurred in individuals without identifiable risk factors who have used these products, as well as in people who used them who had possible predisposing factors, such as a personal history of mood disorders (i.e., depression or manic depression), a family history of manic depression, or concurrent use of products that increase sensitivity of an individual to the effects of ephedrine alkaloids (see Table 4). AER's noting neuropsychiatric adverse effects in persons using non-MAOI antidepressant drugs concurrently with dietary supplements containing ephedrine alkaloids are consistent with a report of the serotonin syndrome associated with the concurrent use of serotonin reuptake inhibitors (a new class of antidepressant drugs) and OTC cold remedies containing pseudoephedrine (Ref. 101).

Vascular spasm; stroke and myocardial infarction may influence the type and severity of adverse events in the sensitive individual.  c. Variability in individual responses to ephedrine alkaloids. The unpredictability of individual responses to ephedrine alkaloid-containing dietary supplement products, as reported in AER's, is also consistent with what is  known about the physiological and pharmacological properties of these alkaloids (Refs. 7, 10 through 12, 39 through 41, and 48). Individual variability in the effects of ephedrine has been reported in several clinical  investigations (Refs. 5 and 102 through 104). The marked sensitivity of some individuals to the effects of ephedrine has been recognized in the Western scientific literature almost from the time that ephedrine was introduced as a   30688  Federal Register / Vol. 62, No. 107 / Wednesday, June 4, 1997 / Proposed Rules A Danish group of researchers investigated the usefulness of ephedrine and caffeine alone and in combination for the treatment of obesity (Refs. 105, 106, and 112). One hundred and eighty subjects were randomized to one of four treatment groups: (1) Ephedrine--20 mg, (2) ephedrine--20 mg and caffeine--200 mg, (3) caffeine--200 mg, and (4) placebo control. The treatments were administered three times a day for 24 weeks in conjunction with a defined low calorie diet. One hundred and fortyone individuals completed the trial. Subject withdrawals were reported to be equally distributed across the four groups with no statistical differences among the groups. More side effects were noted in the treatment groups compared to the placebo control group in both those subjects continuing in, and those withdrawing from, the trial. Study results showed that 60 percent of the ephedrine and caffeine treatment group, 44 percent of the ephedrine treatment group, and 36 percent of the caffeine treatment group experienced side effects compared to 24 percent of the placebo control group. These results were statistically significant (p<0.05) (Ref. 105). This study showed that there was a possibility of rebound symptoms (symptoms occurring as a consequence of withdrawal of an agent, especially headache and fatigue) once the treatment was stopped. Rebound symptoms were seen most in the ephedrine and caffeine treatment group but also occurred in the ephedrine alone group (Refs. 105 and 106). Astrup et al. enrolled 127 of the subjects completing the above clinical trial into an open label study where all subjects received the same treatment (diet and ephedrine plus caffeine) for 24 weeks (Refs. 106 through 108). Five of the 38 subjects that withdrew or dropped out of this study did so because they experienced adverse drug reactions (NS and CVS effects). Adverse drug reactions occurred in 102 subjects during weeks 1 through 24 of the open trial. Most symptoms (75 percent) started during the first 4 weeks of treatment and lasted about 4 weeks. Symptoms related to the CVS were primarily palpitations and tachycardia. The most frequent NS symptoms were tremor, agitation, insomnia, increased sweating, and nervousness. Breum et al., in another clinical trial in which the effects of ephedrine plus caffeine (EC) were evaluated, conducted a randomized, double blind, controlled 15 week clinical trial comparing the effects of EC to that of dexfenfluramine (DF), a serotoninergic agonist, in the treatment of obesity (Ref. 113). Fifty four percent of the subjects in the EC group compared to 43 percent of the DF group experienced adverse reactions. The majority of these occurred within the first 4 weeks. At week one, 38 percent of the EC group subjects experienced adverse drug reactions compared to 30 percent in the DF group. NS effects (particularly insomnia and agitation) were statistically increased (p < 0.05) in the EC treatment group (46 percent) compared to the DF group (26 percent), whereas gastrointestinal adverse effects were significantly increased in the DF group. Eight percent of the EC group reported cardiovascular symptoms. All symptoms remitted after cessation of the trial drugs. The above studies demonstrate that adverse effects can occur with the use of ephedrine in the treatment of obesity even in carefully designed and conducted, physician-monitored clinical trials and even in persons prescreened to be in good health, free of known risk factors, and not using medications or other products known to adversely interact with ephedrine-like drugs. Furthermore, the study population of obese individuals is recognized to be less sensitive to the effects of sympathomimetic agents than the general population (Ref. 120). Certain of these studies also evidence that there is an increased frequency of adverse effects occurring in lean subjects, secondary to sympathetic stimulation, compared to obese subjects that is unrelated to dose per body weight (Ref. 119). Thus, these studies suggest that the general population may be more sensitive to the effects of ephedrine alkaloids than the obese population. There are a number of recognized limitations inherent in these published trials, including those associated with study design, methods, and conduct (e.g., small number of subjects enrolled in these trials, narrow targeted populations, short evaluation periods, and selective presentation of data are among the concerns) as are the multiple publications of the same data. Yet despite these factors, the adverse effects observed in these studies remain a cause for concern, although these factors make it difficult to identify subpopulations that may be particularly sensitive to the effects of ephedrine or to identify adverse effects that occur infrequently. These studies were carefully monitored, so that subjects were withdrawn from the study when adverse effects became evident. Therefore, although the observed adverse effects in these studies were not as severe or as serious as some observed with dietary supplement use (e.g., heart attacks, seizures, strokes), they are indicative of the potential for  therapeutic agent in the mid-1920's (Refs. 5 and 102). Two early studies by different investigators recommended a 10 mg initial oral test dose to assess the individual's sensitivity to sources of ephedrine (Refs. 5 and 102). Factors that appear to influence individual susceptibility to sympathomimetic agents are diverse (see Table 4) and are not yet well defined by biological bases. These factors include genetics, particularly those genes controlling metabolic functions; receptor numbers and types; gender; age; and certain physiological states or disease conditions (reviewed in Refs. 39 through 42). In addition, the dosage and duration of use may influence the effects seen with ephedrine alkaloids, as tachyphylaxis (i.e., decrease or diminution of some effect) is known to occur with chronic use of these agents (i.e., there are decreases in certain effects with chronic use that are thought to be due to occupation of all adrenergic receptor sites; discontinuation of ephedrines for a few days results in receptor availability and receptor mediated effects). An example of tachyphylaxis could be tremor or insomnia, which occurs soon after starting ephedrine alkaloid-containing products but which may resolve in certain individuals with continued use of ephedrine alkaloids. d. Clinical trials using ephedrine in the treatment of obesity. Although many dietary supplements containing ephedrine alkaloids are marketed for weight loss or energy purposes, there is a paucity of meaningful data on the safe use of these products for this purpose. A number of controlled clinical trials reported in the scientific literature evaluated the effects of pharmaceutical preparations of ephedrine, either singly or combined with caffeine or aspirin, on weight loss in the treatment of obesity (Refs. 105 through 119). While the primary purpose of these trials was to evaluate efficacy of ephedrine for purposes of weight loss in grossly obese individuals, these clinical trials also document that clinically significant adverse effects can occur in populations with no known risk factors with the use of ephedrine, and that synergistic adverse effects can result when ephedrine and caffeine are combined. The patterns and types of the adverse effects reported in these trials are consistent with the known effects of sympathomimetic agents, that is, they mainly involved NS and CVS effects. A summary of these studies follows. (In this document, the agency makes no evaluation or judgment of the effectiveness of the use of ephedrine in the treatment of obesity.)   Federal Register / Vol. 62, No. 107 / Wednesday, June 4, 1997 / Proposed Rules greater risk with continued use. Moreover, their occurrence is remarkable given the careful prescreening of study subjects such that high risk persons were not included in the study. The greatest limitation, however, is that these studies were designed to evaluate the effectiveness of ephedrine in the treatment of obesity. They were not designed to test the safety of the use of ephedrine in the obese, or any other population (Ref. 121), or to test its safety under the conditions under which marketed dietary supplements containing sources of ephedrine alkaloids are used. Therefore, these study results cannot be used to definitively demonstrate safety, or the lack of safety, of ephedrine alkaloidcontaining supplements for use by the general population. Nonetheless, despite the shortcomings of these studies, the results raise serious concerns about the safety of using ephedrine, from any source, including dietary supplements, in both obese individuals and the general public in nonmedically monitored situations. e. Other physiologic and pharmacologic effects. Some of the adverse events reported to FDA that were unrelated to the CVS and NS also bear a recognized relationship to the known physiologic and pharmacologic effects of ephedrine alkaloids. For example, urinary retention, particularly in males with no history of prostatic hypertrophy (enlargement of the prostate gland), has been associated with the use of ephedrine (Refs. 102, 103, and 122 through 124). Urinary retention has a well recognized relationship with urinary tract infections, which have been reported to FDA with the use of products containing ephedrine alkaloids. Myopathy (disease of muscle), besides being reported for the heart (Refs. 62 and 66 through 68), is also recognized to involve skeletal muscles and may result in acute renal failure (Ref. 125). Certain gastrointestinal adverse effects, including impaired colonic motility and ischemic colitis, have been associated with the usage of amphetamines (Refs. 102 and 126). Similarly, ischemic colitis has also been reported with the usage of a long-acting decongestant containing pseudoephedrine (Ref. 127). Additionally, acute hepatitis (inflammation in the liver) has been associated with the use of a Chinese medicinal product containing Ma huang (Ref. 128). Other types of adverse effects, such as the reports of dermatologic reactions, while not known to be related to the recognized physiologic or pharmacologic effects of ephedrine alkaloids, are consistent with adverse effects reported in published case reports. For example, there are more than 11 published case reports, at least 12 patients, of systemic dermatologic reactions, including rashes occurring in a particular distribution on the body, contact dermatitis (inflammation of the skin resulting usually from local contact with a substance), a toxic shock-like syndrome, angioedema (extreme swelling of tissues and structures of the body secondary to leaking of fluids from capillaries (small blood vessels)), and erythematous (reddish) rash and subsequent desquamation (loss of part of the skin surface) that occurred with the use of ephedrine or pseudoephedrine (Refs. 114 and 129 through 138). Concerns about toxicity to the fetus with maternal exposure to ephedrine alkaloids during pregnancy remain unresolved. Increased fetal heart rate has been associated with maternal use of pseudoephedrine (Ref. 139). In addition, the administration of intramuscular ephedrine to treat maternal hypotension has been associated with increases in fetal heart rate and beat-to-beat variability (cited in Ref. 139). Certain animal studies also raise concern about potential teratogenic effects that may be caused by the use of ephedrine during pregnancy (Refs. 140 through 143). Potential toxicity for a breast-fed infant whose mother is using a dietary supplement containing ephedrine alkaloids is unknown, but toxicity has been reported in a breastfed infant whose mother had been taking a long-acting oral decongestant containing d-isoephedrine for the relief of allergy symptoms (Ref. 144). Little is known about the potential consequences of long term use of ephedrine alkaloids, other than the risk of cardiomyopathy as stated above. Park et al., however, recently implicated adrenergic agents like ephedrine in the etiology of a type of lung cancer, particularly in persons simultaneously exposed to carcinogenic environmental factors such as smoking (Ref. 145). This report indicates the need for long-term followup to adequately assess the risks associated with product use, as well as the importance of particular group characteristics (e.g., smoking status) in evaluating risk. f. Traditional uses of botanical sources of ephedrine alkaloids: adverse effects. In the traditional medicinal use of Ephedra, the raw botanical was administered, either alone or more commonly combined with other specific botanicals, in the form of a water infusion (tea), three times a day.  30689  Traditional treatment was prescribed by a trained health practitioner based on the evaluation of a particular patient and was predominately for short term use. Commonly used dosages of the raw botanical ranged from 1.5 to 9 grams (g), generally averaging 5 to 6 g of Ephedra per dose (Refs. 14 and 146). Tyler has estimated that a tea made from 2 g of the raw botanical Ephedra (containing 1.25 percent ephedrine) will yield a dose of 15 to 30 mg ephedrine (cited in Ref. 147). Thus, use of 5 to 6 g of the raw botanical Ephedra, an average amount used in a tea could yield a dose of ephedrine ranging from approximately 38 mg to 75 mg. FDA has no knowledge of any systematic collection of morbidity and mortality data on individuals treated with Ephedra in traditional medicine. Ephedra was historically considered a medium or middle class herb, meaning that recognized toxicities could be associated with its use (Refs. 14, 146, and 148). Several reference texts, in fact, list precautions and contraindications for the use of the botanical Ephedra in traditional medicinal preparations (Refs. 14 and 146). Another reference warns against overdosage (Ref. 25). While there is a paucity of data in the scientific literature on the safety of the use of Ephedra, several scientific references report adverse effects associated with the use of Ephedra. One early study in the United States reported two cases of urinary retention in men aged 56 and 65 years. These men all noted bladder pain and difficulty in voiding which developed after one to three doses of a fluid extract of Ephedra. The symptoms resolved after the use of the extract was discontinued. More recently, a published case report notes the occurrence of erythroderma associated with the use of an herbal product containing Ma huang which was obtained from a Chinese herbalist for the relief of cold-like symptoms (Ref. 138). The woman who was the subject of this report had a history of similar episodes following usage of OTC cold preparations containing ephedrine alkaloids. These references document that adverse effects occurred with the traditional use of Ephedra, and that these effects are consistent with effects occurring with modern pharmaceutical preparations of synthetic ephedrine. 3. The Relationship is Temporally Correct One possible source of serious error in evaluating observational data, such as that found in FDA's postmarketing surveillance system, is the potential for inappropriately assuming that a cause and effect relationship exists between a   30690  Federal Register / Vol. 62, No. 107 / Wednesday, June 4, 1997 / Proposed Rules over 26 percent of AER's provided information suggesting successful dechallenge, and 4 percent of reports provided information of rechallenge, suggesting that the product was the direct cause of the adverse event. A number of the previously described cases are particularly good examples of positive dechallenge in that symptoms resolved spontaneously on cessation of use of the product without medical treatment (see Arms Nos. 10088, 11065, and 11112 in the Appendix to this document). Furthermore, some specific AER's suggest that a pattern of starting and stopping use of dietary supplements containing ephedrine alkaloids may increase an individual's susceptibility to experiencing adverse events as has been suggested in reviews of adverse events occurring with the use of phenylpropanolamine (Ref. 73). One case described above, ARMS No. 9552, in which a woman suffered a heart attack soon after she restarted using an ephedrine alkaloid-containing product, may be an example of such increased sensitivity. Thus, FDA tentatively concludes that there is evidence of dechallenge and rechallenge from the AER's that supports a causal relationship between the ingestion of ephedrine alkaloids and the types of CVS and NS and other effects observed with use of the ephedrine alkaloid-containing dietary supplement products. Additional support for this conclusion is also provided in the published clinical trials in the treatment of obesity described above. 5. A Biologically Plausible Explanation for the Adverse Events Considering the totality of the available information, FDA tentatively concludes that the available evidence strongly supports that the adverse effects that are occurring with the use of dietary supplements containing ephedrine alkaloids are caused by the ephedrine alkaloids. This tentative conclusion derives from the previous discussions in this document. The observed adverse effects predominately involve the CVS and NS and are consistent with the known physiological and pharmacological effects of ephedrine alkaloids noted in medical/ pharmacological texts. Furthermore, similar patterns of CVS and NS effects have been documented both in anecdotal reports in the scientific literature and in the published results of controlled clinical trials using pharmaceutical preparations of various ephedrine alkaloids. The available data further suggest that these types of adverse events should be anticipated and expected with the use of ephedrine alkaloid-containing products by the general population. D. Additional Concerns The agency is aware of a number of factors related to currently marketed dietary supplements that may contribute to the likelihood of adverse events but that the available data are inadequate to evaluate fully. These factors weighed heavily on the minds of many members of the Food Advisory Committee as they discussed the public health concerns associated with the use of these products. These factors include: (1) The size of the population that is susceptible to experiencing adverse events with the use of ephedrine alkaloids, because there are neither good data on the number and pattern of supplement users in the United States nor good data on the full range of characteristics that cause or increase risk. Nonetheless, the potential population at risk is quite large if one considers the following likely risk factors: (a) The large number of persons who have diseases or conditions, or who are at risk for such conditions, for whom the use of ephedrine alkaloid-containing dietary supplements is inappropriate (Table 5).  particular exposure and a particular adverse event without evaluating the true relationship of the adverse event to the exposure. Unless there are data that ensure that there is the correct temporal relationship between exposure and effect (i.e., that the adverse effects follow exposure), there is a potential for serious misinterpretation of data. To evaluate this potential source of serious error, FDA evaluated the AER's to determine whether there was clear evidence of the correct temporal sequence having occurred. FDA found evidence of the correct relationship in the AER's that it received (see, e.g., ARMS Nos. 10088, 8475, 9747, and 11112). Further support that the temporal relationship is correct can be found in clinical studies that described the pharmacological and physiological effects of different ephedrine alkaloids and in the clinical trials with obese subjects. 4. There is Other Evidence, Even in the Absence of Controlled Trials, Such as Evidence of Dechallenge That Suggests a Causal Relationship Between the Use of Ephedrine Alkaloid-Containing Dietary Supplements and Adverse Events Causality is most readily demonstrated in well-designed and conducted clinical trials, in which the multiple factors that may influence study results and interpretations can be controlled. However, evidence of causality can be inferred from observational studies, including individual case reports, particularly where there is evidence of positive dechallenge and rechallenge, that is, where, when the consumer stopped using the product, the signs and symptoms resolved or improved, and when the consumer began using the product again, the symptoms reoccurred. Although many of the AER's did not provide enough information to adequately evaluate these questions,  TABLE 5.--IDENTIFIABLE AT RISK POPULATION WITH USE OF EPHEDRINE ALKALOIDS Disease or condition Cardiovascular disease ............................................................................................................................

These variables include gender, age, genetics, certain physiologic states, and the use of certain products (e.g., foods and drugs) (Ref. 25). (2) The potential for interactive and unpredictable effects from the mixture of ephedrine alkaloids found in botanical sources, which may serve to increase the likelihood, frequency, or severity of an adverse event. Unlike drugs which contain only a single, wellcharacterized ephedrine alkaloid, botanical sources contain a mixture of these alkaloids. The potential for interactive effects among these alkaloids is likely but largely unknown (Ref. 25). (3) The potential for other ingredients in the dietary supplement products to interact with the ephedrine alkaloids to increase the likelihood or severity of an adverse event (Ref. 25). (4) The natural or formulation variations in levels and relative proportions of the ephedrine alkaloids in marketed dietary supplement products and the resultant risk for persons who can tolerate one level or mixture but who unknowingly are exposed to different levels or mixtures because they change brands, or because the composition of the brand that they typically use is altered (Ref. 25). (5) The formulations of the products themselves (including the numbers, types, and forms of ingredients used in the product and the form of the final product) may influence the likelihood, frequency, or severity of adverse effects because product characteristics may influence dissolution, absorption, bioavailability, and metabolism of active and inactive ingredients in the product and thus influence the effects of the product (Ref. 25). E. General Summary and Tentative Conclusions FDA has received more than 800 AER's involving more than 100 dietary supplement products. Among these products the most common and consistent finding is the presence of ephedrine alkaloids. The products associated with these adverse events are marketed in diverse formulations and for a variety of uses. Sympathetic nervous system and cardiovascular system stimulant effects account for the majority of the reported adverse events associated with dietary supplements containing ephedrine alkaloids. These effects include heart attack, stroke, seizure, chest pain, psychosis, anxiety, nervousness, tremor, and hyperactivity (Refs. 25 and 27). The type and patterns of these adverse effects are consistent with the CVS and NS effects known and expected to occur with the use of sympathomimetic agents, such as the ephedrine alkaloids. The known physiological and pharmacological activities of ephedrine alkaloids and the adverse events that have occurred in controlled clinical trials using ephedrine corroborate this conclusion. The biological plausibility of these types of adverse events occurring with the use of ephedrine alkaloids, the temporal relationship between the use of the dietary supplements and the onset of the adverse events, and the evidence of dechallenge and rechallenge also support a causal relationship between the use of ephedrine alkaloid-containing products and subsequent adverse events. Both the Working Group and the Food Advisory Committee reviewed the available data and information on the occurrence of adverse events associated with the use of dietary supplements containing ephedrine alkaloids in certain individuals. The Working Group was specifically asked whether the available information contains sufficient evidence to demonstrate that the use of dietary supplements containing ephedrine alkaloids may cause consumers to experience serious adverse events. The Working Group concluded that it was. Although not asked this question, those members of the Food Advisory Committee who addressed the question agreed with the Working Groups's conclusion. Thus, FDA tentatively concludes that there is a consistent, large, and growing body of evidence that establishes a causal association between the use of ephedrine alkaloids and subsequent adverse events. The agency also tentatively concludes that the use of ephedrine alkaloid-containing dietary supplements is associated with a serious and significant public health concern because of the nature of the adverse events and the size of the population at risk. III. The Proposed Regulation A. The Scope of This Proposal This proposal applies to dietary supplements containing one or more ephedrine alkaloids and related alkaloids, including those from the botanical species Ephedra sinica Stapf, Ephedra equistestina Bunge, Ephedra intermedia var., tibetica Stapf, Ephedra distachya L., and Sida cordifolia or their extracts.  30691  Conventional food products that contain ephedrine alkaloids, including snack bars, cookies, and beverages, are not covered by this proposal. Conventional food products are subject to section 409 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act) (21 U.S.C. 348) and, given the adverse events associated with the use of ephedrine alkaloids, these substances are unapproved food additives when used in conventional foods. Use of botanical sources of ephedrine alkaloids in traditional herbal therapies is beyond the scope of this proposal. Although several Ephedra species (including those considered as Ma huang) have been reported to have a long history of use in traditional Asian medicine for the treatment of the symptoms of colds, to relieve respiratory symptoms, and to regulate water metabolism (Refs. 4, 6, 14, and 146), products bearing claims evidencing that they are intended for therapeutic use are regulated as drugs under the act. This proposal also does not cover OTC or prescription drugs that contain ephedrine alkaloids. Ephedrine is approved as an active ingredient in oral OTC bronchodilator drugs for use in the treatment of medically diagnosed mild asthma (21 CFR 341.76). However, in the Federal Register of July 27, 1995 (60 F.R. 38643), FDA proposed to amend the final monograph for OTC bronchodilator drug products to remove the ingredients ephedrine, ephedrine hydrochloride, ephedrine sulfate, and racephedrine hydrochloride and to classify these ingredients as not generally recognized as safe and effective for OTC use. FDA issued the proposal to amend the final monograph for OTC bronchodilator products in response to a request from the U.S. Department of Justice, Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), to restrict OTC availability of ephedrine because of its illicit use as the primary precursor in the synthesis of the controlled substances methamphetamine and methylcathinone. The agency also issued the proposal because of new information that showed that misuse and abuse of OTC ephedrine drug products can cause potential harm, and because of comments made by FDA's Pulmonary-Allergy Drugs Advisory Committee and the Nonprescription Drugs Advisory Committee. FDA is currently evaluating public comments to that proposal and will be addressing this subject in a future issue of the Federal Register.   30692  Federal Register / Vol. 62, No. 107 / Wednesday, June 4, 1997 / Proposed Rules histamine at which FDA is likely to take action against the fish because it is adulterated (Ref. 151). Moreover, in  109.4(b) (21 CFR 109.4(b)), the agency has said that it will establish regulatory limits that represent the level at which an added poisonous or deleterious substance adulterates a food within the meaning of section 402(a)(1) of the act (21 U.S.C. 342(a)(1)). The agency has attempted to be flexible and practical in tailoring its strategy for dealing with public health risks, taking into account the nature and type of the risk and the potential effectiveness of various alternative approaches. In the case of ephedrine alkaloids in dietary supplements, there are many factors and underlying etiologies that can influence individual sensitivity to these substances. Some of these factors are easily identified or readily controlled; many are not. Factors that are known to influence the likelihood, frequency, and severity of adverse events associated with the use of sympathomimetic agents, including ephedrine alkaloids, include genetics, age (e.g., children and the elderly are at increased risk), preexisting conditions (e.g., kidney disease, heart disease, hypertension, diabetes, thyroid disease, glaucoma, and enlarged prostate), pregnancy, concurrent use of medications (e.g., MAOI, methyldopa), or excessive consumption (see Table 4) (Refs. 39 through 42, 152, and 153). Other factors that may increase an individual's susceptibility to experience adverse events with the use of ephedrine alkaloids include exercise, body size (i.e., lean and normal weight individuals appear to be more susceptible than obese individuals), and dietary intake (i.e., severe caloric and fluid restrictions increase the likelihood of adverse events) (Refs. 39, 42, 119, and 154 through 156). Significantly, however, many adverse events associated with ephedrine alkaloid-containing dietary supplements occur in individuals who have no apparent risk factors, or who are unaware that they are at risk. Additionally, approximately 40 percent of the reported adverse events occur with the first use or within 1 week of first use, providing little or no warning to consumers of potential risk (see Figure 3). The agency tentatively concludes, therefore, that neither disclosure of the presence of ephedrine alkaloids on the product label nor the use of a warning statement, alone, will be sufficient to protect consumers because many individuals are not aware, and are unable to determine, that they are at risk from consuming ephedrine alkaloids, and serious adverse events may occur on the first use or with very short-term use. Therefore, the agency has tentatively determined that several measures are needed if the observed adverse events associated with the use of ephedrine alkaloid-containing dietary supplements are to be effectively addressed. These measures are discussed below. C. Proposal for Dietary Supplements Containing Ephedrine Alkaloids 1. Dietary Ingredient Limit for Ephedrine Alkaloids: Per Serving Basis One possible strategy for addressing the significant number of adverse effects associated with ephedrine alkaloids in dietary supplements is to restrict the level of the ephedrine alkaloids in these products. In considering this possibility, FDA evaluated two issues: (a) Is there a level at which ephedrine alkaloids cause safety concerns; and (b) if there is, will restricting dietary supplements from containing ephedrine alkaloids at or above that level be adequate, alone, to protect the public health, or will additional steps be necessary. In considering these questions, FDA evaluated the evidence that provides information on the adverse effects of ephedrine alkaloids that is most relevant to the uses and formulations of marketed dietary supplement products: (a) The published findings from the clinical studies investigating the use of ephedrine for weight loss for the treatment of obesity, and (b) the numerous AER's associated with the consumption of dietary supplements containing ephedrine alkaloids. First, the agency reviewed clinical trials that have been performed to explore therapeutic uses for ephedrine alone and in combination with other pharmaceutical substances (see earlier discussion in section II.C.2.d. of this document (Refs. 105 through 119)). Information from these trials show that 20 mg ephedrine per dose can cause adverse events to occur in a significant percentage of obese persons (up to 60 percent) prescreened to be free of known risk factors while using these products for a relatively short time (i.e., most adverse events occurred during the first 4 weeks of use). Thus, these studies establish that 20 mg per serving of ephedrine presents potential risks for a subpopulation of morbidly obese persons but provide no information on risk at levels below 20 mg per serving for obese persons. These studies also provide no information on risk at levels below 20 mg per serving for use by persons in the general population (e.g., lean or moderately overweight persons), who are known to be more sensitive to  B. Rationale for the Proposal It is incumbent upon the agency to respond to the concerns raised by the number, seriousness, and pattern of adverse events associated with the use of ephedrine alkaloid-containing dietary supplements. Given the AER's, the case reports in the scientific literature, controlled clinical trials, published reports of adverse effects with traditional uses of ephedrine alkaloidcontaining botanicals, and other data, it is apparent that there are serious and well-documented public health risks attendant to the use of ephedrine alkaloids in marketed dietary supplement products, and that the agency needs to propose actions to address these risks. Over the years, FDA has employed a variety of strategies in addressing food ingredients that created significant public health risks. In cases where small subpopulations have faced serious, even potentially deadly, risks because of ingredients with allergic potential (e.g., nuts and shellfish), FDA has required that the presence of the allergen be declared on the food label so that consumers who are at risk can avoid products that contain the problem ingredient ( 101.4 (21 CFR 101.4)). In other cases where a food or food ingredient has presented special health risks to consumers under certain use conditions, the agency has required warning label statements to ensure that consumers are alerted to the potential health hazards associated with use of the product. For example, FDA has required a special warning statement to appear on the label of protein products intended for use in weight reduction, stating in part that very low calorie protein diets may cause serious illness or death ( 101.17(d) (21 CFR 101.17(d))). In other cases, e.g., the proposed regulations for poisonings in young children because of high intakes of iron-containing dietary supplements, the agency was concerned that, for high potency products, warning labels alone would not be effective in preventing serious harm. Therefore, the agency has decided to require, at least in some cases, warning labels plus special packaging requirements to reduce the risk of serious harm (Ref. 150). In other cases, where a substance contained in a food may be harmful to health, it has been the agency's policy to define a level at which the harmful substance may render the food adulterated. For example, to address the public health problem of histamine poisoning associated with the consumption of certain fish, the agency issued guidance on the level of   Federal Register / Vol. 62, No. 107 / Wednesday, June 4, 1997 / Proposed Rules sympathomimetic substances like ephedrine alkaloids than are the morbidly obese persons who constituted the study population (see section II.C.2.d. of this document). FDA is not aware of any well-designed and conducted studies that evaluate the risks of intakes of ephedrine levels below 20 mg per serving in any population group. Second, FDA, through its postmarketing surveillance program, has found consistent patterns of adverse events across a broad range of marketed dietary supplement products that contain a variety of ephedrine alkaloid levels per serving. FDA's laboratory analyses of the ephedrine alkaloid levels in the small number of available dietary supplement products that consumers who suffered adverse events turned over to the agency showed that these adverse events were related to ephedrine alkaloid levels from approximately 1 to over 50 mg per serving (Ref. 149). These data, as well as analytical data from samples collected from the marketplace after FDA received AER's from consumers who no longer possessed the product, show a pattern of clinically significant adverse events, including neuropsychiatric effects (e.g., severe depression, seizure), malignant (i.e., extremely high) blood pressure, and myocardial necrosis (i.e., death of the heart muscle) with subsequent cardiac arrest and death, with the use of ephedrine alkaloids at levels approaching and above 10 mg per serving (e.g., seven reports of clinically serious adverse events were associated with products that contained 10 to 15 mg per serving) (Ref. 149a). Clinically significant adverse events were also reported with the use of ephedrine alkaloids at levels that exceeded this range. FDA has also received a few reports of adverse events, some clinically significant, including tremor, extremely high blood pressure, severe headache, nausea, chest pain, increased heart rate, and insomnia, associated with the use of ephedrine alkaloids at levels below 8 mg (e.g., 2 to 8 mg ephedrine alkaloids per serving) (Ref. 149a). The true clinical significance of these levels of ephedrine alkaloids is difficult to interpret because of the lack of the data (e.g., too few reports with analysis to identify a pattern of clinically serious adverse events at any specific level). Thus, the available information from the AER's and the scientific literature does not provide sufficient data to adequately evaluate risk below approximately 10 mg per serving. Given the available evidence, it is difficult to ascertain whether there is a threshold level of ephedrine alkaloids below which the general population and susceptible individuals will not experience serious adverse events. The shape of an intake-response curve for any particular adverse effect related to ephedrine alkaloid intakes is not known. In the absence of data that allow a systematic evaluation of intakes of ephedrine and other related alkaloids below 10 mg per serving, it is not possible to adequately define or describe the potential risks and at-risk groups from ephedrine alkaloids. However, the available data, including the AER's and the known physiological and pharmacological effects of ephedrine, provide convincing evidence that clinically serious adverse events will occur at intake levels above 10 mg ephedrine alkaloids per serving. FDA recognizes, however, that this 10-mg level is also subject to some uncertainty because of such factors as intra-assay variabilities (i.e., difference in analytical results from one run to the next with the same method), natural variabilities in the alkaloid content of botanical ingredients, variations in formulation levels from batch to batch, and inaccuracies in the amounts reported to be taken by consumers. When these sources of variability are considered, given that they are likely to be additive, the range around the 10 mg per serving estimated intake can be expected to deviate by 10 to 20 percent. Thus, FDA tentatively concludes that the life-threatening adverse events associated with the use of ephedrine alkaloids can reasonably be expected to occur at intake levels as low as 8 to 9 mg ephedrine alkaloids per serving. However, given the limitations in the available data, the agency requests comments on whether it is more appropriate to focus on the 10 mg level. Based on the available evidence and the likely sources of measurement error around estimated intake levels, the agency tentatively concludes that the use of dietary supplements containing 8 mg or more ephedrine alkaloids per serving may render the dietary supplement injurious to health. The agency also tentatively concludes that consumption of dietary supplements that contain this level or more of ephedrine alkaloids presents a significant and unreasonable risk of illness or injury under the conditions of use recommended or suggested in the labeling or under ordinary conditions of use, and that, therefore, products that  30693  contain this or higher levels of ephedrine alkaloids are adulterated. 1 To reflect this tentative conclusion, FDA is proposing to adopt  111.100(a)(1) which states that dietary supplements that contain 8 mg or more ephedrine alkaloids (the total of ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, norpseudoephedrine, norephedrine, methylephedrine, methylpseudoephedrine and related alkaloids) per single serving shall be deemed to be adulterated under section 402(a)(1) and (f)(1)(A) of the act. FDA is proposing to adopt this provision under sections 402(a)(1), (f)(1)(A), and 701(a) (21 U.S.C. 371(a)) of the act. Under section 402(a)(1) of the act, a food, including a dietary supplement, is adulterated if it bears or contains any added poisonous or deleterious substance that may render it injurious to health. Section 402(f)(1)(A) of the act provides that a dietary supplement is adulterated if it, or one of its ingredients, poses a significant or unreasonable risk of injury or illness when used as directed or under ordinary conditions of use. Under section 701(a) of the act, FDA has authority to issue regulations for the efficient enforcement of the act. These sections authorize FDA to issue a regulation that establishes a level of ephedrine alkaloids that, the available evidence makes clear, will render a dietary supplement adulterated as a matter of law. FDA tentatively concludes that such a regulation will advance the purposes of the act in two significant ways. First, it will provide guidance to the dietary supplement industry as to a level of ephedrine alkaloids that can be used in their products with some confidence that such products will not be subject to regulatory action. Second, it will make clear that if products that contain higher levels of ephedrine alkaloids are marketed; such products will be considered unsafe and adulterated and will be subject to all the relevant sanctions under the act. Eight mg per serving and above represent levels at which the presence of ephedrine alkaloids in a dietary supplement may render the product injurious to health and presents a significant and unreasonable risk. FDA cannot say that it is a safe level, nor has 1 FDA has limited information on which ingredients dietary supplement manufacturers are likely to substitute for ephedrine alkaloids. Given this uncertainty, FDA cannot comment on the safety of potential substitutes. FDA notes that manufacturers bear the burden of ensuring that any ingredients that they may substitute for sources of ephedrine alkaloids meet all safety standards for dietary supplements.   30694  Federal Register / Vol. 62, No. 107 / Wednesday, June 4, 1997 / Proposed Rules CVS stimulatory effects of ephedrine and thus exacerbate the adverse effect. The agency requests comments on whether a separate dietary ingredient limit should be established for ephedrine in addition to ephedrine alkaloids, and if so, what that limit should be. 2. Proposed Compliance Procedures In proposed  111.100(a)(2), the agency states that it will use the high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method as specified in LIB No. 4053 to determine the level of ephedrine alkaloids in a dietary supplement. The agency developed this HPLC analytical method to identify and quantify ephedrine alkaloids from botanical sources. It was necessary for the agency to develop an analytical method because the official analytical methods used for the determination of ephedrine alkaloids in pharmaceutical dosage forms are unsuitable for botanical products. Current official analytical methods do not discriminate between ephedrine alkaloids and other alkaloids that may be in the botanicals (e.g., ephedroxane and methylbenzylamine) (Ref. 157). This HPLC method has made possible the resolution and quantification of the several different ephedrine alkaloids known to occur in the Ephedras and other botanicals, including ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, norephedrine, methylephedrine, methylpsuedoephedrine, norpseudoephedrine, and related alkaloids. This method is currently undergoing collaborative evaluation and testing. FDA strongly recommends that manufacturers also use this or other methods that the agency adopts, although manufacturers will be free to use any alternative method that they find appropriate. However, FDA will use whatever method it adopts in this proceeding as the basis for its enforcement actions, and this method will be the legally established method. Therefore, manufacturers would be advised to compare their method of choice to the HPLC method to ensure that the alternative method produces similar results. 3. Proposed Limit for Ephedrine Alkaloids: Frequency and Per Total Daily Intake Basis In addition to proposing a level for ephedrine alkaloids in dietary supplements at or above which their presence will render the product adulterated, the agency is proposing to address its concern that products containing ephedrine alkaloids below the dietary ingredient limit may be used in a manner that increases the likelihood, frequency, and severity of adverse events. Intake of multiple servings of ephedrine alkaloidcontaining dietary supplements, particularly when such intake occurs within a relatively short timeframe (e.g., hours or within a day), can result in an excessive level of ephedrine alkaloids in the body that will increase the likelihood of an acute adverse event and the severity of the event that occurs. Concern over the hazards of taking several servings of ephedrine alkaloidcontaining dietary supplements in a short period of time led several members of the Working Group and of the Food Advisory Committee to recommend that FDA limit the intake of dietary supplements containing ephedrine alkaloids to no more than four to five times per day and establish daily use limits, e.g., the amount of ephedrine alkaloids the consumer should not exceed in a day. In light of this, FDA evaluated the risks associated with different patterns of daily intake of ephedrine alkaloid-containing dietary supplements. The average plasma half-lives for pharmaceutical ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, and phenylpropanolamine are approximately 6 hours (range 3 to 11 hours), 6 hours, and 4 hours, respectively (Refs. 10 through 12, 20, and 46). Generally, this means that after one half-life (e.g., 4 to 6 hours) half of the ephedrine alkaloids still remain in the blood. More than 24 hours are needed for complete clearance of a single serving of ephedrine alkaloids from the body. Because ephedrine alkaloids remain in the body for hours, when additional servings of an ephedrine alkaloid-containing dietary supplement are consumed, the ingested alkaloids are additive to those already in the body. This process will result in an increase in blood and tissue concentrations of ephedrine alkaloids. Generally, the higher the blood and other body tissue levels of ephedrine alkaloids, the greater the likelihood and severity of adverse events (Ref. 46). Given the pharmacological evidence that average plasma half-lives of ephedrine alkaloids are approximately 4 to 6 hours, elevated blood levels of ephedrine alkaloids will be maintained if a serving is consumed every 4 to 6 hours. Because ephedrine alkaloids are stimulant substances, they can cause insomnia if taken close to sleeping hours. Thus, if 6 to 8 hours in a day are typically used for sleeping, there is a period of 16 to 18 hours per day in which consumers of ephedrinecontaining dietary supplements would  it been arrived at in a way that factored in some margin of safety. The evidence does not exist to establish a safe level. FDA notes that many members of the Food Advisory Committee stated that they were unaware of a basis for determining a safe level (Ref. 25). Thus, the agency is concerned about the potential for risk at levels below 8 mg per serving for individuals who are particularly sensitive to the effects of ephedrine alkaloids, or whose sensitivity could be increased through chronic use of these products or other processes (e.g., physical exercise). Given the seriousness of the public health concerns and the uncertainty surrounding the risks attendant upon consumption of ephedrine alkaloids below 8 mg per serving, the agency solicits comments, and asks that they include data, particularly clinical data, on the safety of the use of less than 8 mg of ephedrine alkaloids per serving in dietary supplements. Should data and information become available that demonstrate that the use of less than 8 mg of ephedrine alkaloids per serving in dietary supplements poses a hazard to the public health, or that the level of ephedrine alkaloids that will render a product adulterated is higher than 8 mg per serving, the agency will consider modifying  111.100 accordingly. At this time, the agency is not proposing a level at which ephedrine, as opposed to the mixture of ephedrine alkaloids found in products containing botanicals, may render a product adulterated, even though some members of FDA's Working Group and of the Food Advisory Committee recommended that the agency establish a separate level for ephedrine (Refs. 25 and 27). There is some reason to believe that ephedrine may be particularly significant in contributing to the occurrence of many of the cardiovascular effects seen in the reports of adverse events because ephedrine is often the predominant alkaloid in botanical sources. In addition, ephedrine is known to exhibit more intense cardiovascular effects relative to the other ephedrine alkaloids (Refs. 5 and 9 through 13). For example, serious adverse events have been reported with the use of dietary supplements containing less than 5 mg ephedrine. However, the available data are difficult to interpret because of the uncertainties about the potentially interactive effects of the other ephedrine alkaloids in the raw botanical or botanical extract and the presence of other physiologically and pharmacologically active ingredients in the dietary supplement products that may act to potentiate the overall NS and   Federal Register / Vol. 62, No. 107 / Wednesday, June 4, 1997 / Proposed Rules have interest in consuming this substance. By dividing the 16 to 18 waking hours in a day by the largest average half-life for ephedrine alkaloids (i.e., 6 hours), the results reveal the possibility of taking a maximum of three servings per day. Three servings of a dietary supplement that contains the proposed maximum per serving amount of ephedrine alkaloids (less than 8 mg) would yield a daily intake level of less than 24 mg ephedrine alkaloids. Thus, a dietary supplement product that contains ephedrine alkaloids and whose label or labeling instructs consumers to take 24 mg or more per day would present a significant and unreasonable risk of injury and illness under the conditions of use suggested or recommended in the labeling and thus would render the product adulterated under section 402(f)(1)(A) of the act. Similarly, an ephedrine alkaloidcontaining product whose label or labeling instructs consumers to take 8 mg or more during a 6-hour period would instruct consumers to consume an amount of ephedrine alkaloids that has been shown to cause injury. This labeling also would present a significant and unreasonable risk and render the product adulterated under section 402(f)(1)(A) of the act. FDA tentatively concludes that without a daily use limit, the per serving limit cannot be effective in reducing the potential for adverse events because consumers may unknowingly consume an excessive amount of ephedrine alkaloids by taking several servings of dietary supplements in a relatively short period of time. Therefore, FDA is proposing in  111.100(b) that the labeling of dietary supplements that contain ephedrine alkaloids shall not suggest or recommend conditions of use that would result in intake of 8 mg or more ephedrine alkaloids within a 6-hour period or a total daily intake of 24 mg or more of ephedrine alkaloids. FDA is proposing this regulation under sections 402(f)(1)(A) and 701(a) of the act to ensure that ephedrine alkaloidcontaining dietary supplements do not bear directions for use that will create a significant and unreasonable risk. In some cases, the label directions for use of dietary supplements containing ephedrine alkaloids can cause consumers to exceed the per serving limit or to consume servings more frequently than every 6 hours. For example, FDA would consider the following label instructions to increase the risk of adverse events: ``take what your body needs'' or ``take 1 tablet (containing 7 mg ephedrine alkaloids) per serving, not to exceed 3 tablets per day.'' In the later example, the consumer may believe that it is safe to consume 3 tablets (21 mg ephedrine alkaloids) at one serving or servings separated by less than 6 hours. Examples where the agency would not consider that the directions for use would cause consumers to exceed the per serving limit or take serving more frequently than every 6 hours include ``take 1 tablet per day,'' ``take 1 tablet every 6 hours, do not take more than 3 tablets per day,'' or ``take 1 tablet not more than every 8 hours, do not take more than 2 tablets per day.'' 4. Proposed Limitation on Duration of Use The available data suggest that some types of adverse events may be related to the duration of using ephedrine alkaloids. Long-term use of sympathomimetic agents, such as ephedrine alkaloids, even at relatively low levels, is related to serious adverse events, including cardiomyopathy (i.e., disease of the heart muscle) and myocardial necrosis (death of heart cells and tissue), that can result in death (Refs. 7, 16, 49, 51, and 52). The scientific literature establishes that use of ephedrine alkaloids for a period of several months or years can result in cardiomyopathy (Refs. 66 through 68). Similarly, fatal cardiomyopathies have been seen in the AER's associated with chronic use of ephedrine alkaloidcontaining dietary supplements at serving levels close to the dietary ingredient limit the agency proposed above (ARMS No. 11134 in Refs. 29 and 149a). Concern about these types of adverse events with the long-term use of ephedrine alkaloids led several members of the Working Group (Ref. 27) and of the Food Advisory Committee (Ref. 25) to recommend that, in conjunction with a per serving dietary ingredient limit, FDA require a statement on the label of ephedrine alkaloid-containing dietary supplements to warn consumers not to use the product for a period longer than 7 days. These members stated that a 7-day use limit is standard guidance for the use of pharmacoactive drug substances, including ephedrine alkaloids, and may reduce the occurrence of adverse events related to long-term use of ephedrine alkaloids (Ref. 25). Moreover, a 7-day limit on the use of ephedrine alkaloids is supported by the AER's data, which show that over 60 percent of the adverse events occurred when ephedrine alkaloid-containing dietary supplements were used for more than 7 days.  30695  For these reasons, FDA tentatively concludes that ephedrine alkaloidcontaining dietary supplements that do not bear the statement ``Do not use this product for more than 7 days'' present a significant and unreasonable risk of injury and illness under the recommended or suggested conditions of use. Therefore, under sections 402(f)(1)(A) and 701(a) of the act, to reduce the potential for adverse events occurring as a result of consumers using ephedrine alkaloids for more than a period of 7 days, FDA is proposing to require in  111.100(c) that the label of dietary supplements that contain ephedrine alkaloids state ``Do not use this product for more than 7 days.'' The agency notes that this warning focuses on duration of use, not on when reinstitution of use of ephedrine alkaloids is appropriate. FDA is not aware of definitive data on whether there is a period of time when the reinstitution of use of ephedrine alkaloids will not present a risk of adverse events. FDA solicits comments, particularly data, on this matter. In addition, FDA solicits comments on how consumers will interpret this label statement in terms of reintroducing dietary supplements containing ephedrine alkaloids in their diets. 5. Proposed Prohibition of Ingredients With Stimulant Effects As previously discussed, because the nature and patterns of adverse events observed in the AER's were consistent with the known physiological and pharmacological effects of the ephedrine alkaloids, the agency focused its evaluation on the ephedrine alkaloids. However, the majority of the adverse events that have been reported to FDA have involved the use of dietary supplements that contain ephedrine alkaloids in combination with other ingredients, some with known physiological or pharmacological effects, including kola nut, yohimbe, willow bark, senna, and Uva ursi (Ref. 164). In many cases, the AER's showed that more severe adverse effects (e.g., heart attack, stroke, seizure) occurred with the use of dietary supplements that contained ephedrine alkaloids at levels below 20 mg together with other ingredients than were noted in the scientific literature with the use of ephedrine at 20 mg (Ref. 149a). These observations suggest that the other ingredients may act, in combination with the ephedrine alkaloids, to produce more frequent, more severe, or potentially different patterns of adverse effects than those noted with the use of an ephedrine alkaloid alone.   30696  Federal Register / Vol. 62, No. 107 / Wednesday, June 4, 1997 / Proposed Rules effects include an increased frequency of certain signs and symptoms, e.g., increased heart rate, insomnia, nervousness, and increased blood pressure, that are considered characteristic of sympathomimetic stimulation. Other substances with stimulant effects in combination with ephedrine alkaloids may act to increase the likelihood of an adverse event. Yohimbine from the botanical yohimbe, in small doses, is reported to stimulate part of the nervous system and to cause elevated blood pressure, increased heart rate, tremor, and anxiety (Refs. 176 through 178). Because of their stimulant effects on the nervous system, combining sources of yohimbine with the ephedrine alkaloids may increase the likelihood, frequency, and severity of adverse events. Therefore, the agency tentatively concludes that, based on the available evidence, adverse events may be related to the interactive or additive effects of stimulant substances in combination with ephedrine alkaloids in dietary supplements. This tentative conclusion is supported by statements made by several members of the Food Advisory Committee at the August 27 and 28, 1996, meeting (Ref. 25). For these reasons, the agency tentatively concludes that any dietary supplement that contains ephedrine alkaloids in combination with ingredients that produce the aforementioned effects presents a significant or unreasonable risk of injury or illness under the conditions of use suggested in the labeling or under ordinary conditions of use and are adulterated. To eliminate this risk, under sections 402(f)(1)(A) and 701(a) of the act, FDA is proposing  111.100(d), which states that no ingredient, or ingredient that contains a substance, that has a known stimulant effect (e.g., sources of caffeine, yohimbine) may be included in a dietary supplement that contains ephedrine alkaloids. The agency is aware that several manufacturers and distributors of ephedrine alkaloid-containing dietary supplements also market caffeinecontaining dietary supplements that are intended to be used with a ``companion'' ephedrine alkaloidcontaining dietary supplement. The caffeine-containing dietary supplements are often promoted as ``boosters'' or ``enhancers'' for the ephedrine alkaloidcontaining product. Under these conditions of use, both the caffeinecontaining and the ephedrine alkaloidcontaining dietary supplement products present a significant and unreasonable risk of illness and injury under their labeled conditions of use and consequently are adulterated under section 402(f)(1)(A) of the act. The agency is concerned that many of the dietary supplements implicated in the AER's contained substances that are known to have physiological or pharmacological effects that could increase the risk of adverse events when taken in combination with ephedrine alkaloids. For example, substances that reduce renal clearance interfere with the elimination of ephedrine alkaloids from the body by the kidneys (i.e., renal excretion) (Refs. 180 and 181) and thus may increase the risk of adverse effects when consumed in combination with ephedrine alkaloids. These substances include salicin, which is found in the botanical commonly known as willow bark, and amino acids in high concentrations (Refs. 181 and 182). By reducing renal clearance, higher levels of ephedrine alkaloids are maintained in the blood for longer periods of time, thus prolonging the effects of ephedrine alkaloids. The maintenance of high blood levels of ephedrine alkaloids increases the likelihood of adverse events, particularly in those who may be sensitive to the effects of ephedrine alkaloids. In addition, consumers may experience adverse events if more ephedrine alkaloids are consumed while blood levels are maintained because the absorption of additional ephedrine alkaloids into the bloodstream will result in even higher blood and tissue concentrations of ephedrine alkaloids and in any effects that may follow. Generally, the higher the blood levels of ephedrine alkaloids, the greater the risk of adverse events and the greater the likelihood that the adverse effects that do occur will be severe (Ref. 46). Diuretics and laxative substances in an ephedrine-alkaloid-containing dietary supplement may also increase the likelihood, frequency, and severity of adverse events (Refs. 182 through 186). Uva ursi is a botanical diuretic contained in many ephedrine alkaloid products (Ref. 184). The compounds ursolic acid and isoquercetin found in Uva ursi are mild diuretics. The ephedrine alkaloids also exhibit diuretic effects (Ref. 4). For example, ephedrine has a mild diuretic effect, and pseudoephedrine has a marked diuretic effect. The use of a product that contains ephedrine alkaloids in combination with other substances with diuretic effects increases the likelihood and severity of consequent fluid and electrolyte imbalances, both of which could affect CVS and NS risks. Senna and Cascara are examples of botanicals that contain potent stimulant laxative substances called  Moreover, the clinically significant adverse events that occurred with amounts of ephedrine alkaloids below the 8 mg per serving limit may have been related to the compounding effects of ephedrine alkaloids in combination with other ingredients. Because of the known additive effects that occur when ephedrine alkaloids are combined with certain types of other ingredients, such as stimulants, proposed  111.100(a)(1), by itself, will likely not be effective in reducing the potential for adverse events. Certain types of other substances interact with the ephedrine alkaloids to increase the effects of the ephedrine alkaloids, thereby acting like more ephedrine alkaloids were contained in the product. For example, caffeine is a nervous system stimulant that can induce nervousness, insomnia, and tachycardia (increased heart rate) (Refs. 7, 165, and 166). Intake of toxic levels of caffeine can cause death resulting from CV stimulatory effects (Ref. 46). Various botanicals are known to be sources of caffeine, including green tea, guarana, yerba mate (also known as Ilex paraguariensis), and kola nut (Refs. 167 through 172). The scientific literature reveals that the frequency and severity of adverse effects increase when ephedrine alkaloids and caffeine are combined (Refs. 22, 73, 105, and 106). Recent clinical trials have focused on whether a combination of ephedrine and caffeine would be more effective in the treatment of obesity than ephedrine alone. The usual dosage of ephedrine and caffeine was 20 mg and 200 mg, respectively, given three times a day before meals. The results of these trials, certain of which were carefully designed and conducted to eliminate potential confounders to the interpretation of study results (e.g., concurrent medication usage, underlying diseases and conditions or other risk factors), indicate that the effects, including adverse effects, of combining ephedrine and caffeine are synergistic (Refs. 105, 173, and 174). Caffeine and ephedrine also appear to be synergistic in thermogenesis, i.e., they increase the rate of thermogenesis by influencing different parts of the metabolic pathways (Refs. 173 and 175). While the resulting effects of combining ephedrine and caffeine could have a potentially positive impact on thermogenesis because of their effects on metabolic pathways, it may also account for increased adverse effects seen with combinations of these agents because of increased sympathetic stimulation of other organ-systems (e.g., CVS and NS). The synergistic adverse   Federal Register / Vol. 62, No. 107 / Wednesday, June 4, 1997 / Proposed Rules anthraquinone glucosides (Refs. 185 through 187). Use of excessive amounts of stimulant laxatives can cause stomach cramps, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Chronic use may lead to laxative dependence, diarrhea, and, in severe cases, dehydration and electrolyte disorders (Ref. 188). Ephedrine is known to influence cellular potassium (an electrolyte) concentrations (Refs. 53 and 54). Use of laxative substances in combination with ephedrine alkaloids may act to increase the likelihood, frequency, and severity of adverse events. The agency requests comments, particularly data, on the interactive effects of other ingredients and the ephedrine alkaloids in dietary supplements. Based on the comments and data received by FDA, the agency may prohibit the use of ingredients that produce the aforementioned effects in a dietary supplement that contain ephedrine alkaloids. 6. Proposed Prohibitions on Claims As described previously in section II.C.1. of this document, FDA has received numerous reports of adverse events associated with ephedrine alkaloid-containing dietary supplements promoted for use for weight loss, increased energy, body building, enhanced athletic performance, increased mental concentration, and enhanced well-being and with products promoted to be used as an alternative to illicit street drugs. While many of the products that were associated with adverse events contained more than one type of claim or representation on their label or in their labeling, the majority of adverse events reported to FDA are related to the use of products promoted or used for weight loss or energy purposes. Although fewer of the AER's were associated with products promoted for body building and enhanced wellbeing, clinically serious adverse events, including seizure, heart attack, and death, have been reported to FDA that were associated with the use of products represented for these purposes. At least one death in a young man has been reported with the use of a product promoted as an alternative to an illicit street drug. In reviewing the AER's, it was evident that specific types of claims contained in the labeling of dietary supplements containing ephedrine alkaloids promoted different patterns of use. Claims such as weight loss and body building encouraged long-term use to achieve the product's purported effect (Ref. 189). In addition, claims of increased energy, increased mental concentration, or enhanced well-being, in a number of cases, encouraged shortterm excessive consumption to achieve more of the product's purported effect (Ref. 190). Finally, the agency found that claims that suggest that the product is intended to be used as a substitute for an illicit street drug fostered abuse. Because claims in product labeling may influence how a consumer uses the product, claims in product labeling are a condition of use for dietary supplements. Several Food Advisory Committee members identified a number of significant risks attendant to using dietary supplements containing ephedrine alkaloids for purposes such as weight loss, energy, or as an illicit street drug alternative, including adverse events that are associated with long-term use, excessive consumption, and abuse of ephedrine alkaloids (Ref. 25). Because the identified types of claims promote use patterns that are associated with adverse events, the agency has tentatively concluded that claim restrictions are necessary to maintain the integrity of the limit on the level of ephedrine alkaloids in dietary supplements that it is proposing in  111.100(a)(1) and of the other proposed restrictions on the conditions of use of these dietary supplements. a. Claims that promote long-term use. Claims in the labeling of dietary supplements that use of a product may result in effects such as weight loss or body building promote long-term use of the product because these effects cannot be achieved in a short period of time. Weight loss occurs when caloric intake is reduced or energy expenditure (e.g., exercise) is increased. To lose 1 pound (lb), approximately 3,500 kilocalories (kcal) must be expended by reducing caloric intake or by increasing energy expenditures (e.g., physical activity) or both (Ref. 191). Rapid weight loss is associated with health risks, including increased protein loss from the body stores and increased risk of gallstone formation (Ref. 27). In fasting, over 50 percent of rapid weight reduction is attributable to the loss of body fluids. Risks associated with rapid loss of fluids from the body include hypotension (i.e., reduction in blood pressure) and electrolyte disturbances. Steady weight loss over a longer period of time results in a true weight loss with a reduction of fat stores (Ref. 193). Guidelines recommend that a safe rate of weight loss is 1/2 to 1 lb per week (Ref. 194). Therefore, depending upon the amount of weight loss that the individual desires to achieve, weight loss programs may extend from weeks to months (Ref. 195). Long-term weight loss practices have been documented in the scientific  30697  literature. A survey of weight control practices among 1,431 adults indicated that the average respondent participating in the survey had a weight loss attempt lasting from 5 to 6 months and had averaged one attempt a year for the past 2 years (Ref. 196). In addition, approximately 30 percent of persons trying to lose weight were chronic dieters and had been on weight loss plans at least 1 year (Ref. 196). Thus, this survey indicates that common weight loss practices can be characterized as long-term in duration and recurrent in nature. Conversely, body building involves the building of lean muscle mass by strength and endurance training. The addition of muscle mass can be accomplished only through regular muscle work (weight training or similar conditions) coupled with a caloric increase (Ref. 197). To increase size and strength, a muscle must be exercised at 60 to 80 percent of its capacity several times a week. In addition, a gain of 1 lb of muscle requires about 2,500 extra calories, in addition to the calories needed for the training (Ref. 197). An increase of 700 to 1,000 calories (cal) to the daily diet should support a gain of 1 to 2 lb of lean muscle in 7 days (Ref. 197). Body building systems that include intensive physical training programs, controlled diet, and dietary supplementation purport to achieve results in 6 weeks (Ref. 198), and the individual must continue a training program to maintain or increase the muscle mass. As previously mentioned in section III.C.4. of this document, long-term use of ephedrine alkaloids, even at relatively low levels, is related to serious adverse events, including cardiomyopathy (i.e., disease of the heart muscle) and myocardial necrosis (death of heart cells and tissue), that can result in death. After reviewing the scientific literature and the AER's as well as recommendations by the Working Group and by the Food Advisory Committee, FDA has tentatively concluded that ephedrine alkaloid-containing dietary supplements must bear the statement ``Do not use this product for more than 7 days,'' and that those that do not present a significant and unreasonable risk of injury and illness under the recommended or suggested conditions of use. Significant and safe results from weight loss or body building should not and cannot be achieved within a period of 7 days. An individual could lose approximately 4 lb of body fat in 7 days under complete fasting conditions if the normal energy requirements are 2,000 cal per day. (This assumption is based   30698  Federal Register / Vol. 62, No. 107 / Wednesday, June 4, 1997 / Proposed Rules alkaloids that were promoted for one or more of these purposes. In a number of instances, the consumer took more than directed on the product label and experienced an adverse event (Ref. 190). Claims that promote excessive consumption, even for one or a very limited number of uses, are inconsistent with proposed  111.100 (a)(1) and (b), because they encourage the consumer to take more than directed in the conditions of use set out on the label so that the consumer can achieve the purported effect. In section II.C.2.a. and II.C.2.b. of this document, FDA described data from the clinical literature and AER's that show that consumption of an excessive amount of ephedrine alkaloids in a relatively short period of time is associated with serious adverse events, including seizure, psychosis, mania, heart attack, and death. The agency tentatively concludes that the potential for these serious adverse events to occur with excessive consumption of ephedrine alkaloids is a material fact with respect to consequences that may result from the use of a dietary supplement promoted for short-term effects that encourage excessive consumption, and therefore a material fact that must be disclosed on the label. FDA's authority to require disclosure statements in the labeling of dietary supplement products derives from sections 201(n), 403(a)(1), and 701(a) of the act. Section 201(n) of the act states, ``If an article (e.g., a food or dietary supplement product) is alleged to be misbranded because the labeling or advertising is misleading, then in determining whether the labeling or advertising is misleading there shall be taken into account (among other things) not only representations made or suggested by statement, word, design, device, or any combination thereof, but also the extent to which the labeling or advertising fails to reveal facts material in light of such representations or material with respect to consequences that may result from the use of the article to which the labeling or advertising thereof or under such conditions of use prescribed in the labeling or advertising thereof or under such conditions of use as are customary or usual.'' Under section 403(a)(1) of the act, a food is misbranded if its labeling is false or misleading in any particular. Thus, the omission of a material fact from the label or labeling would misbrand a product. These statutory provisions, combined with section 701(a) of the act, authorize FDA to issue a regulation designed to ensure that persons using ephedrine alkaloidcontaining dietary supplements will receive information that is material with respect to consequences that may result from the use of the supplement under its labeled conditions. Therefore, FDA is proposing in  111.100(f)(1) that the label or labeling for dietary supplements that contain ephedrine alkaloids that purport to be or are represented, either expressly or implicitly, to be used for short-term effects, such as increased energy, increased mental concentration, or enhanced well-being, must state ``Taking more than the recommended serving may cause heart attack, stroke, seizure, or death.'' However, given the significance and the potentially lifethreatening nature of the adverse events that may occur when individuals consume excessive amounts of ephedrine alkaloids, the agency requests comments on whether this statement should appear on the label of dietary supplements containing ephedrine alkaloids, regardless of any claims appearing on the label or in labeling. FDA wants to provide an approach to placement of this information that will give it a prominence that will ensure that it will be read and understood by consumers but that will result in its presentation only once on the label panel or on each page of the labeling. Because the consequences of excessive use of ephedrine alkaloids can be serious, the agency tentatively concludes that this information should be on the same label panel or on the same page of the labeling (i.e., the same field of vision) as the claim. However, FDA is proposing to provide for the use of one disclaimer on the label panel or on each page of labeling in situations in which multiple claims appear on the label panel or page of labeling where repetitive presentation of the disclaimer could be burdensome. FDA tentatively concludes that where the label panel or page of labeling contains multiple claims, and the relationship between each of those statements and the disclaimer can be made obvious, the disclaimer need only appear once on each label panel or in each page of labeling. FDA experience has been that one of the most effective ways of tying two label statements that are physically separate on the same panel is through the use of a symbol such as an asterisk. Symbols have been used within nutrition labeling since its inception in 1973 and have proven to be an effective way of relating labeling information to explanatory footnotes. For example, asterisks have been used adjacent to names of vitamins and minerals present at very low levels to refer the consumer to a footnote stating ``Contains less than  on the fact that 3,500 kcal must be expended to achieve 1 lb of weight loss.) As discussed above, however, this rate of weight loss is not safe or recommended. Regarding body building, lean muscle mass cannot be built in 7 days (Ref. 197). Moreover, the scientific literature evidences that the use of ephedrine alkaloids during intense physical activity, such as body building, increases the risks of serious adverse events. Use of ephedrine alkaloids during periods of intense physical activity results in enhanced or synergistic actions on the sympathetic nervous system. It is through such enhanced physiological processes that chronic effects on the heart, such as myocardial necrosis (i.e., death of heart cells and tissue), can occur with prolonged use of ephedrine alkaloids (Refs. 16 and 197a). Because safe and significant weight loss and body building cannot be achieved in a 7-day period, claims that promote these uses promote long-term use of ephedrine alkaloid-containing dietary supplements, which has been associated with serious adverse events. For this reason, FDA tentatively concludes that any claims that promote long-term use of ephedrine alkaloid dietary supplements, such as those for weight loss and body building, promote conditions of use that present a significant and unreasonable risk of illness and injury. Therefore, under sections 402(f)(1)(A) and 701(a) of the act, the agency is proposing in  111.100(e) to prohibit dietary supplements that contain ephedrine alkaloids from being represented, either expressly or implicitly, for use for longterm effects such as weight loss or body building. b. Claims that promote short-term excessive consumption. Many claims found on the labels of, or in the labeling for, ephedrine alkaloid-containing dietary supplements, including increased energy, increased mental concentration, and enhanced wellbeing, encourage the consumer to take more of the product than is indicated on the label to achieve more of the purported effect. Several members of the Food Advisory Committee stated that when a product is promoted to increase these types of effects, the claim encourages the consumer to exceed the labeled directions for use to gain more of the desired effects (Ref. 25). For example, if a product is promoted for energy, the consumer is encouraged to take more to gain greater energy. Many of the AER's received by the agency were associated with dietary supplements containing ephedrine   Federal Register / Vol. 62, No. 107 / Wednesday, June 4, 1997 / Proposed Rules 2 percent of the Daily Value (formerly the U.S. Recommended Daily Allowance).'' FDA is unaware of any data indicating consumer difficulties with such use of symbols. The use of symbols would also help differentiate between the label statements to which the disclaimer is referring and the other label claims to which the disclaimer does not apply (e.g., authorized health claims or nutrient content claims). The agency points out that the proposed requirements for the disclaimer also extend to labeling: There are potentially many vehicles (e.g., placards, pamphlets, catalogs, books) that would have to bear the disclaimer. The agency is concerned that the disclaimer be prominent in these forms of labeling. Even with the flexibility of the use of an asterisk to tie the claim and the disclaimer to a single claim, the disclaimer could be obscured in pages of text of a package insert, pamphlet, or book if it did not appear on the same page or panel (i.e., in the same field of vision) as the claim itself. Because of the variety of possibilities for the presentation of the disclaimer, the agency tentatively concludes that for labeling, as for labels, it is important that the disclaimer appear within the same field of vision, that is, on each package panel or page where a claim is made. Section 403(f) of the act requires mandatory label or labeling information to be prominently placed on the label with such conspicuousness (compared with other words, statements, designs, or devices, in the labeling) as to render it likely to be read and understood by the ordinary individual under customary conditions of use. In other instances where information must appear in a prominent and conspicuous manner on the product label, FDA has proposed that the information be ``in easily legible print or type in distinct contrast to other printed or graphic matter'' (e.g.,  101.13(d)(2)). Therefore, to be consistent with previous actions and to ensure that the information is presented in a way that makes it likely to be read, FDA tentatively concludes that the information be presented in easily legible print or type in distinct contrast to other printed or graphic matter. FDA has long held that accompanying information should be in a size reasonably related to that of the information it modifies (e.g.,  101.22(i)(2) and 102.5(b)(2)(ii)). More recently, this relative prominence has been expressed as a size no less than that required by  101.105(i) for the net quantity of contents statement, except where the size of the claim is less than two times the required size of the net quantity of contents statement, in which case the accompanying information can be no less than one-half the type size of the information modified, but no smaller than one-sixteenth of an inch (see e.g.,  101.13(g) (1) and (i)(2)). The agency also has long held that onesixteenth of an inch is the minimum type size for disclaimer statements, unless the package complies with  101.2(c)(5) (see e.g.,  101.13(g)(1) and (i)(2)). One-sixteenth of an inch is specified in  101.2(c) as the minimum type size for most other mandatory information on the principal display panel or information panel, e.g., designation of ingredients, name and place of business, and quantitative information for relative claims. Consequently, the agency tentatively concludes that the minimum type size for such information should be onesixteenth of an inch. Accordingly, FDA is proposing to provide for the disclaimer, as outlined above, in  111.100(f)(2). If FDA adopts  111.100(f)(2), the labeling of a dietary supplement that contains ephedrine alkaloids and that purports to be, or that is represented as, useful for short-term effects, such as increased energy, increased mental concentration, or enhanced well-being, would be misleading, and thus misbranded, if it does not include the disclaimer set out in  111.100(f)(1). The agency recognizes that most of the claims that will require the use of the disclaimer, if this proposal is adopted, will be statements that are made subject to section 403(r)(6) of the act. That provision also requires that a disclaimer accompany the statements. In the Federal Register of December 28, 1995 (60 FR 67176), FDA proposed requirements for the disclaimer that is required to accompany statements made under section 403(r)(6) of the act. FDA requests comments on how best to place the disclaimer proposed in this document in conjunction with the disclaimer required under section 403(r)(6) of the act on the label or in labeling of dietary supplements so that both disclaimers will be read and understood by consumers. c. Claims that suggest that the product is intended to be used as a substitute for an illicit street drug. FDA is aware that some ephedrine alkaloid-containing products are being promoted as alternatives or substitutes for such illicit street drugs as MDMA (4-methyl-2, dimethoxyamphetamine), a methamphetamine analogue. MDMA is also known as ``ecstasy,'' ``XTC,'' and ``X.'' The precursor of MDMA is MDA (3,4 methylene dioxyamphetamine), an  30699  amphetamine whose use results in destruction of serotonin-producing neurons that play a direct role in regulating aggression, mood, sexual activity, and tolerance to pain (Ref. 16). Many products claiming to be herbal alternatives to MDMA bear claims on their label or in the labeling that highlight these mood-or mind-altering effects. Such street drug alternative claims do not fall within the scope of the claims that Congress intended to permit on the labels or in the labeling of dietary supplements. The Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994 (the DSHEA) added section 201(ff) to the act (21 U.S.C. 321(ff)), which provides, in part, that the term dietary supplement means a product ``intended to supplement the diet'' that bears or contains one or more dietary ingredients. While Congress did not elaborate in the legislative history on what it intended the phrase ``intended to supplement the diet'' to mean, many of the congressional findings set forth in the DSHEA suggest that Congress intended dietary supplements to augment the diet to promote health and reduce the risk of disease. In using the term ``diet'' in section 201(ff) of the act, Congress did not define this term in either the act or the legislative history. The term ``diet'' is defined in Webster's Dictionary as ``an organism's usual food and drink'' (Ref. 200). Dorland's Medical Dictionary defines ``diet'' as ``the customary allowance of food and drink taken by any person from day-to-day, particularly one especially planned to meet specific requirements of the individual, and including or excluding certain items of food'' (Ref. 201). These definitions suggest that the diet is composed of usual food and drink that may be designed to meet specific nutritional requirements. Under section 201(ff) of the act, dietary supplements are food except for purposes of section 201(g) of the act and thus may be part of, or augment, the diet. These common sense definitions for the term ``diet'' do not encompass alternatives to illicit street drugs. Products promoted to be an alternative to or substitute for an illicit street drug are intended to be used for recreational purposes to effect psychological states (e.g., to ``get high'' or to promote feelings of euphoria). Illicit street drugs are not food or drink and thus, cannot supplement the diet. In addition, use of products claiming to be alternatives to illicit street drugs does not promote health or reduce the risk of disease, the intended use for dietary supplements suggested in the   30700  Federal Register / Vol. 62, No. 107 / Wednesday, June 4, 1997 / Proposed Rules observed (Ref. 149a). Although these AER's are not sufficient to support a lower per serving limit, they do provide cause for concern for lower per serving levels. To reduce the potential for adverse events to occur at these lower per serving levels, FDA tentatively concludes that a warning statement on the labels of dietary supplements containing ephedrine alkaloids is necessary, in conjunction with dietary ingredient limitations and other requirements proposed in this document, to protect the public health. FDA is therefore proposing in  111.100(g) to require that a specific warning statement appear on the labels of dietary supplements containing ephedrine alkaloids. FDA's authority to require label warning statements on dietary supplement products derives from sections 201(n), 403(a)(1), and 701(a) of the act. These statutory provisions authorize FDA to issue a regulation designed to ensure that persons using dietary supplements will receive information that is material with respect to consequences that may result from the use of a product under its labeled conditions. a. Caution statement suggested by industry. Several dietary supplement industry trade groups met with FDA on November 30, 1995, and suggested that dietary supplements containing ephedrine alkaloids bear a specific warning statement (Ref. 199). Representatives from the National Nutritional Foods Association (NNFA), the American Herbal Products Association (AHPA), the Nonprescription Drug Manufacturers Association (NDMA), and the Utah Natural Products Alliance (UNPA) (hereinafter referred to as the dietary supplement industry 2) recommended the following statement: CAUTION: Taking more than the recommended amount will not necessarily increase benefits. Begin use with one-half or less the recommended dose to assess your tolerance. (If Pertinent) Please note: This product contains caffeine and should not be taken by those wishing to eliminate caffeine from their diet. Seek advice from a health care practitioner if you are pregnant or nursing or if you are at risk or are being treated for high blood pressure, heart, thyroid or psychiatric disease, diabetes, depression, seizure disorder, stroke or difficulty in urination due to prostate enlargement. Consult your health care professional before use if you are taking an MAO 2 FDA is using this shorthand for convenience. It does not intend to imply that these groups represent the entire dietary supplement industry.  congressional findings listed in the DSHEA. In fact, serious adverse events, including cardiac arrhythmia that resulted in death, are associated with the use and abuse of products promoted for use as an alternative to MDMA (see ARMS No. 10862 in Ref. 149a). Because alternatives to illicit street drugs are not intended to be used to supplement the diet, products that purport to be or that are represented, either expressly or implicitly, for use as an alternative to a street drug are not dietary supplements within the meaning of section 201(ff) of the act. Therefore, manufacturers, packers, and distributors cannot take advantage of the exemption for structure function claims from the drug definition in section 403(r)(6) of the act. Because these products are intended to be used to affect the structure and function of the body, they are drugs within the meaning of section 201(g)(1)(C) of the act. 7. Warning Label Statements Several members of the Working Group and of the Food Advisory Committee recommended that specific information be conveyed in a warning or cautionary statement for ephedrine alkaloid-containing dietary supplements (Refs. 25 and 27). Persons having certain diseases or taking specific medications known to interact with ephedrine alkaloids are at risk of suffering adverse events with the use of dietary supplements containing ephedrine alkaloids. Generally, use of ephedrine alkaloids at any intake level by these persons is contraindicated (Refs. 10 through 12, and 55). For these persons, a warning label statement can be a useful means of alerting them to potential consequences that can result from the use of the product. Table 5 identifies groups that are at risk if they use ephedrine alkaloids. In addition, many consumers who are unaware that they are sensitive to the effects of ephedrine alkaloids may not recognize the significance of early warning signs and symptoms as potential indicators of more serious side effects (e.g., dizziness or severe headache may be early symptoms of hypertension or stroke). Under these circumstances, a warning statement could provide information on what actions the consumer should take if certain symptoms occur. FDA has received several AER's, some clinically significant, that were associated with the use of dietary supplements containing ephedrine alkaloids at levels below the level proposed in  111.100(a)(1) where signs and symptoms including high blood pressure, chest pain, increased heart rate, severe headache, and nausea were  inhibitor or any other prescription drug. Discontinue use and consult your health care professional if dizziness, nausea, sleeplessness, tremors, nervousness, headache, heart palpitations or tingling sensations occur. NOT INTENDED FOR SALE TO OR USE BY PERSONS UNDER THE AGE OF 18. KEEP OUT OF REACH OF CHILDREN. DO NOT EXCEED RECOMMENDED DOSE. FDA has carefully considered proposing adoption of the statement suggested by industry. While the agency considers the industry suggestion to be a good starting point, FDA tentatively concludes that some changes are necessary in the statement if it is to fulfill its purpose of fairly warning consumers about the special risks attendant to use of dietary supplements that contain ephedrine alkaloids. b. Tentative conclusions. The dietary supplement industry suggested that the warning statement begin with the term ``caution.'' FDA, however, questions whether this term is adequate to convey the severity of the harm that can result from the use of the product. Because use of ephedrine alkaloid-containing dietary supplements has the potential to cause serious injury to certain subgroups of the population, the agency tentatively concludes that the use of the term ``WARNING'' is warranted. The term ``WARNING'' is commonly used to denote danger, and, therefore, the use of this term will communicate to consumers the harm that could result to the special populations that are the subject of the warning. The dietary supplement industry suggested that the statement include the instruction ``Seek advice from a health care provider if you are pregnant or nursing or if you are at risk or are being treated for high blood pressure, heart or thyroid disease, diabetes, difficulty in urination due to prostate enlargement.'' Several members of the Working Group and of the Food Advisory Committee recommended that a warning statement direct consumers who have certain diseases or conditions that increase the risk of adverse events not to use the product or to see a health care provider prior to using the product (Refs. 25 and 27). The feeling of these members was that a health care provider could assess the potential risks for the individual consumer if he or she uses the product. FDA concurs with this portion of the industry's labeling recommendation. As discussed in section II.C. of this document, based on the scientific literature and the known physiological and pharmacologic effects of ephedrine alkaloids, an individual who is pregnant or nursing, has high blood pressure, heart or thyroid disease, or difficulty in   Federal Register / Vol. 62, No. 107 / Wednesday, June 4, 1997 / Proposed Rules urination because of prostate enlargement has an increased risk for experiencing serious adverse effects with the use of ephedrine alkaloids. However, FDA also tentatively finds that the warning statement should be broadened to address other individuals who may place themselves at particular risk if they consume the product. The relevant scientific literature, case reports and AER's suggest that persons suffering from depression or other psychiatric conditions, glaucoma, or seizure disorders are also at increased risk of experiencing an adverse event if they consume ephedrine alkaloidcontaining products. Use of ephedrine alkaloids during pregnancy or while nursing can cause adverse effects in the fetus or the infant. Ephedrine alkaloids can cross the placental wall and can be absorbed by the fetus when taken by a pregnant woman (Refs. 10 through 12 and 55). Similarly, ephedrine is excreted in the breast milk and can be consumed by the nursing infant. The fetus, infants, and children are sensitive to the effects of ephedrine alkaloids and thus are more likely to experience adverse events (Refs. 39 and 41). Use of ephedrine alkaloids by persons with high blood pressure can result in blood pressure elevations or loss of adequate medical control of hypertension (Ref. 64) which increases the risk of serious consequences (e.g., stroke and heart attack) (Refs. 62 and 70). Because ephedrine alkaloids also interfere with the regulation of serum potassium levels (Refs. 53 through 55), individuals with heart disease who use ephedrine alkaloids are at greater risk of cardiac dysrhythmias (i.e., abnormal heart rhythms) (Refs. 18 and 56), myocardial ischemia (i.e., inadequate circulation of blood and oxygen to the heart muscle), and infarction (i.e., death or damage of heart cells, also called heart attack) (Refs. 57 through 61). With respect to thyroid disease, individuals with hyperthyroidism (resulting from increased secretion of thyroid hormone) show increased sensitivity to adrenergic agents, such as ephedrine alkaloids, which can result in thyroid storm with dire consequences (e.g., cardiac dysrhythmias, congestive heart failure, coma, and death) (Refs. 39, 41, 55, and 202). For persons with diabetes, use of sympathomimetics can result in an increase in blood sugar and loss of diabetic control (Refs. 29, 41, and 51). In addition, ephedrine can cause constriction of the urinary bladder sphincter and ultimately lead to dysuria (increased, painful, or difficulty in urination). This condition is not only associated with prostate enlargement or only seen in men. Published case reports and AER's received by the agency document the finding that urinary retention following the use of ephedrine alkaloid-containing products can occur in both females and males, including young boys without any history of prostate enlargement (see ARMS No. 10298 and 11164 in Ref. 149a and Refs. 102, 103, 123, and 124). Use of ephedrine alkaloids by persons suffering from depression or other psychiatric conditions increases the risk for the occurrence of serious adverse events, including psychosis and mania (Refs. 81 through 96, 98, 99, 109, and 220). Because ephedrine can cause an increase in intraocular pressure (i.e., pressure inside the eyeball), use of ephedrine alkaloids by persons with glaucoma will worsen this disease, which over time, can result in blindness (Refs. 39 and 41). Finally, persons with seizure disorders who use ephedrine alkaloids have an increased risk for experiencing a seizure (Refs. 63, 65, and 80). Because the nature of the risks associated with the use of ephedrine alkaloids for persons who have the diseases and health-related conditions listed above, it is important that these consumers be advised to consult a health care provider before using ephedrine alkaloid-containing dietary supplements. With regard to the statement in industry's suggested statement ``if you are at risk or are being treated for high blood pressure * * *,'' the agency considers it unlikely that consumers will be able to adequately evaluate their risk for developing the conditions listed in this statement. Most of these conditions are not self-diagnoseable. In addition, individuals who have a disease or condition listed in this statement, but who are not currently being treated, may believe that they are not at risk of experiencing an adverse event. Consequently, the agency tentatively concludes that the warning statement needs to include an instruction to consult a health care provider before using an ephedrine alkaloid-containing dietary supplement. The dietary supplement industry statement only instructs the consumer to consult his or her health care professional before use if he or she is taking an MAOI or any other prescription drug. FDA tentatively concludes that this statement should be broader because of the need for professional help in assessing the risks of ephedrine alkaloid intake with a range of conditions. However, people using MAOI drugs should not use ephedrine alkaloid-  30701  containing products at all. Several members of the Working Group and of the Food Advisory Committee recommended that the warning statement advise consumers not to use the dietary supplements containing ephedrine alkaloids if they are taking these types of drugs (Refs. 25 and 27). Because the use of MAOI drugs in combination with ephedrine alkaloids results in blood pressure elevations and increases the risk of serious consequences (e.g., stroke and heart attack), FDA is proposing to warn against use of ephedrine alkaloidcontaining products in this circumstance (Refs. 10 through 12, 39, 41, and 55). Because persons remain at risk while the MAOI drug remains in the body, FDA tentatively concludes that consumers need to be informed that it may take up to 2 weeks for the MAOI drug to clear the body (Refs. 203 and 204). Because MAOI drugs increase the effects of sympathomimetic agents, and consequently will increase the frequency and severity of adverse effects, persons taking such drugs should be given as much information as possible. The agency is concerned that some patients may not be fully informed about MAOI drugs, may not fully understand or remember all the information given to them, or with the passage of time, may forget or lose information that has been provided. Thus, the warning statement needs to be as informative as possible. Rather than include general language, such as ``any prescription drug'' in the warning statement, FDA tentatively finds that it is important to identify specific types of prescription and OTC drugs that contain ingredients that in combination with ephedrine alkaloids are known or expected to increase the likelihood, frequency, or severity of adverse effects. Therefore, FDA tentatively concludes that consumers need to be warned not to use ephedrine alkaloid-containing dietary supplement in combination with specific drugs, such as drugs for depression, psychiatric or emotional conditions (Refs. 10 through 12, 55, and 205); drugs for Parkinson's disease (Ref. 55); methyldopa (Ref. 206); or any product containing ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, or phenylpropanolamine (ingredients often found in allergy, asthma, cough/ cold and weight control products) (Refs. 180 and 207 through 209). FDA tentatively finds that the drug methyldopa needs to be identified on the label. It increases the pressor results of sympathomimetic agents, such as ephedrine alkaloids, resulting in hypertension (Ref. 206). FDA has   30702  Federal Register / Vol. 62, No. 107 / Wednesday, June 4, 1997 / Proposed Rules symptoms occur. A health care professional will be able to evaluate the significance of the signs and symptoms, determine the risks of more serious adverse events occurring, and prescribe any treatment that may be necessary. The effects, such as tremor, sleeplessness, and tingling sensations, that are included in the instruction suggested by the industry are not usually clinically serious and will likely cease once the product use is discontinued (Refs. 210). For these reasons, FDA tentatively concludes that the statement needs to include the instruction to ``Stop use and call a health care professional immediately if dizziness, severe headache, rapid or irregular heart beat, chest pain, shortness of breath, nausea, noticeable changes in behavior, or loss of consciousness occur.'' The dietary supplement industry suggested that the statement include a direction for the consumer not to exceed the recommended dose. Members of the Working Group and of the Food Advisory Committee recommended that the warning statement include a direction for the consumer not to exceed the recommended serving or dose (Refs. 25 and 27). The agency concurs with the industry's suggestion. FDA tentatively finds that this type of statement is necessary to provide information instructing the user not to consume the product excessively. Excessive consumption of ephedrine alkaloids is associated with adverse events, including heart attack, stroke, seizure, and death. Therefore, the statement is a material fact about the consequences of use of the product. However, FDA has used the term ``serving'' rather than ``dose,'' because the agency considers the term ``serving'' to be more appropriate for use on a food label. The dietary supplement industry suggested that the statement include the instruction that ``Taking more than the recommended amount will not necessarily increase benefits.'' Similarly, the Working Group suggested that the warning statement contain the instruction that ``Larger quantities may not be more effective.'' The agency is not aware of any data or other information that establishes that there are benefits from the use of dietary supplements containing ephedrine alkaloids. Therefore, the agency would be concerned about requiring a statement on the label that implies a judgment (that the product has benefits) that the agency has not made. While some questions can be raised in this regard under section 403(r)(6) of the act, the agency considers them to be moot because the instruction for the consumer not to exceed the recommended serving eliminates the need for the ``Taking more than recommended * * *'' statement. The dietary supplement industry suggested that the statement advise the consumer to: ``Begin use with one-half or less the recommended dose to assess your tolerance.'' The agency addressed limiting the levels of ephedrine alkaloids contained in dietary supplements in proposed  111.100 (a)(1) and (b). In addition, because of label space constraints, the agency is trying to keep the warning statement as short as possible. Therefore, FDA tentatively concludes that there is no reason to require inclusion of this information. The dietary supplement industry recommended the following in a caution statement, if appropriate for the product: ``This product contains caffeine and should not be taken by those wishing to eliminate caffeine from their diet.'' The Food Advisory Committee also suggested that other stimulants with their source, such as caffeine from Kola nut, be identified on the label of a dietary supplement containing ephedrine alkaloids. However, the agency is proposing to prohibit stimulant substances in combination with ephedrine alkaloids in dietary supplements. Therefore, FDA tentatively concludes that there is no reason to require the inclusion of such a statement. The dietary supplement industry recommended that the direction ``Not for use by persons under the age of 18'' be included in the warning statement. Several members of the Working Group and of the Food Advisory Committee suggested that the warning statement include a direction that the product is not intended for use by persons under the age of 18. The agency has received limited reports of adolescents abusing or misusing ephedrine alkaloid-containing dietary supplements. Moreover, the agency has stated elsewhere in this document that claims implying usefulness of these products as alternatives to illicit street drugs render the product an unauthorized drug. FDA considers that removal of alternative street drug claims from the labeling of dietary supplements will significantly reduce or eliminate the appeal of these products to adolescents and therefore is not proposing to require that this direction be included in the warning. However, the agency requests comments on whether the direction ``not for persons under the age of 18'' should be included.  reached a similar tentative judgment with respect to ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, and phenylpropanolamine because each of these substances, in combination with an ephedrine alkaloid-containing dietary supplement, could lead to an additive effect and consequently increase the risk of serious adverse events. While many consumers may not be familiar with the term ``ephedrine,'' ``pseudoephedrine,'' or ``phenylpropanolamine,'' they may be aware of the type of product being taken for a specific condition or ailment, e.g., allergy, asthma, cough/cold, and weight control products. The agency recognizes that because of the large number of drugs for depression, psychiatric or emotional conditions, and Parkinson's disease that are contraindicated for use with ephedrine alkaloids and the limited amount of space on the labels of dietary supplements, not all of them can be listed on the label. However, the conditions for which the consumer is taking the drug can be identified, using less label space. If consumers are unsure whether their drug may interact with the ephedrine alkaloids, they should be cautioned to check with their health care professional before using the dietary supplement. The dietary supplement industry suggested that the statement include the instruction ``Discontinue use and consult your health care professional if dizziness, nausea, sleeplessness, tremors, nervousness, headache, heart palpitations or tingling sensations occur.'' Several members of the Working Group and of the Food Advisory Committee also recommended that any warning statement include information on what actions the consumer should take if certain symptoms occur (Refs. 25 and 27). Signs and symptoms, such as dizziness, severe headache, rapid or irregular heart beat, chest pain, shortness of breath, nausea, sleeplessness, noticeable changes in behavior, or loss of consciousness are often early warning signs of serious illness or injury, including heart attack, stroke, or seizure. It is important that the consumer stop using the product if these signs or symptoms occur because continued use of the product may aggravate the adverse effects. The agency tentatively finds that the terms ``stop'' and ``call'' should be used for ``discontinue'' and ``consult,'' respectively, because they are more simple and direct terms. The proposed warning statement instructs the consumer to call a health care professional if any of the listed   Federal Register / Vol. 62, No. 107 / Wednesday, June 4, 1997 / Proposed Rules The industry group's statement included the instruction ``Keep out of reach of children.'' Children show increased sensitivity to the effects of sympathomimetic agents compared to adults (Refs. 39 and 41) and are, therefore, at increased risk for experiencing adverse events from the use of ephedrine alkaloids. The agency has limited data and information that dietary supplements containing ephedrine alkaloids are being given to, or are associated with accidental overdosage by, children. FDA requests comment, particularly data, on whether this statement is necessary to alert consumers to the fact that ephedrine alkaloid-containing dietary supplements should not be made available to children. c. The agency's proposal. Based on FDA's authority under sections 201(n), 403(a)(1), and 701(a) of the act, the agency proposes to require manufacturers to include the warning statement set out in  111.100(g)(1) in the labeling of their ephedrine alkaloidcontaining products. The agency tentatively finds that the warning statement is necessary to disclose material facts about the consequences of using the product, and that it will help to reduce the risk that some individuals will experience an adverse event from using this type of product. The agency solicits comments on all aspects of the warning statement, including data to support any specific instruction. The agency also solicits comments on approaches to shorten or simplify the warning statement. Because substances contained in ingredients (e.g., ephedrine alkaloids contained in Ephedra) are not required to be listed in the ingredient list on the label of dietary supplements, the agency is concerned that consumers and health care providers may not be aware that ephedrine alkaloids are contained in the product and thus may not necessarily recognize the seriousness of the symptoms listed in the statement, when they occur. FDA requests comments on whether the warning statement should disclose that ephedrine alkaloids are contained in the product. In addition, the agency is concerned that some AER's suggest that a pattern of starting and stopping use of dietary supplements containing ephedrine alkaloids may increase an individual's susceptibility to experiencing adverse events. FDA requests comments on whether the warning statement should disclose the possibility of increasing the risk of adverse events by a pattern of stopping and starting use. Based on the comments received by FDA, the warning statement proposed below may need to be modified. In an effort to promote uniformity in labeling, FDA is proposing to require that the warning statement appear on the labels of ephedrine alkaloidcontaining dietary supplements in the exact manner presented in proposed  111.100(g)(1), except when the disclaimer proposed in  111.100(f) appears on the same label panel as the warning statement, in which case the instruction ``Do not exceed recommended serving'' would not have to appear in the warning statement. However, the agency recognizes that other ingredients that may be used in ephedrine alkaloid-containing dietary supplements may have consequences of use that need to be disclosed on the label. The agency requests comments on how to allow for warning statements for other ingredients in conjunction with the ephedrine alkaloid warning statement on the label of dietary supplements. In addition, the agency solicits comments on the format of the warning statement to improve its clarity (e.g., should the statement be set out in bullets). d. Placement of warning statement on label. The agency intends to provide an approach to the placement of the warning label statement to give manufacturers flexibility to design their own label warning formats, while ensuring that consumers are given adequate notice of the information contained in the warning. Section 403(f) of the act requires that information appearing on the label or labeling be prominently placed and appear with such conspicuousness (as compared with other words, statements, designs, or devices, in the labeling) as to render it likely to be read by the ordinary individual under customary conditions of use. In the agency's rulemaking that mandated warning statements on certain protein products, the agency decided not to mandate specific requirements for type size and other format elements. However, the agency did require that the warning statement appear ``prominently and conspicuously on the principal display panel of the package label'' ( 101.17). In addressing the placement of the label warning, the agency noted that the seriousness and nature of the risks associated with the use of protein products in very low calorie diets was sufficient to require placement of the warning statement on the principal display panel ( 101.17). FDA tentatively concludes that the warning statement that it is proposing must appear prominently and conspicuously on the label of dietary  30703  supplements containing ephedrine alkaloids so that consumers are given adequate notice of the information contained in the warning. While the risks associated with the use of dietary supplements containing ephedrine alkaloids are serious, the agency is not proposing to require that the warning label statement for dietary supplements containing ephedrine alkaloids appear on the principal display panel. The agency recognizes that, because of the length of the required warning statement, in many cases it may be impracticable for the warning statement to appear on the principal display panel without interfering with the placement of other information that is required to appear on that panel. The requirement in the act for prominent display means that the warning statement must be presented on the label or labeling in a manner that renders it as readily observable and likely to be read. In this regard, the agency's experience with the graphic requirements for the new nutrition label has been that a box around required label information greatly increases the prominence of the information placed inside the box. Moreover, focus group discussions regarding warning labels show that messages put in a boxed area help consumers to distinguish the message from other information as well as draw attention to it (Ref. 210a). Therefore, FDA is proposing to require in  111.100(g)(3) that the warning statement for ephedrine alkaloidcontaining dietary supplements be separated from other information by a box. If FDA adopts these regulations, manufacturers will have the flexibility to design their own label and warning label format subject to  111.100(g)(3). Section 201(k) of the act defines the term ``label'' as ``a display of written, printed, or graphic matter upon the immediate container of any article'' and further states a requirement that ``any word, statement, or other information appear on the label shall not be considered to be complied with unless such word, statement, or other information also appears on the outside container or wrapper, if any there be, of the retail package of such article * * *.'' Thus, if FDA adopts its proposal to require that a warning statement appear on the label of ephedrine alkaloid-containing dietary supplements, the warning statement would also have to appear on the retail package of such a product, if that package is not the immediate container. FDA requests comments on these proposed requirements for placement of the warning statement.   30704  Federal Register / Vol. 62, No. 107 / Wednesday, June 4, 1997 / Proposed Rules applicable to humans, or whose results establish intake-response curves for ephedrine alkaloids in dietary supplements and that could be used to establish a level of ephedrine alkaloids that are safe for consumers to use in dietary supplements. The intakeresponse relationships between ephedrine alkaloids and their effects in humans are unknown for both botanical sources and marketed dietary supplement products containing ephedrine alkaloids. Moreover, because there are consumers who may be sensitive to the effects of ephedrine alkaloids because of a variety of factors that are not readily identifiable or predictable, a margin of safety based on classical toxicological principles likely cannot be determined. For these reasons, the agency tentatively finds that the use of a classical toxicological approach to determine a safe level of ephedrine alkaloids in dietary supplements is not a usable approach. Several members of the Food Advisory Committee recommended that FDA consider the risk associated with the use of dietary supplements containing ephedrine alkaloids in the context of any benefit that the consumer may receive from the use of these products (Ref. 25). In applying a risk-tobenefit calculation, a certain amount of risk may be accepted if there is a meaningful benefit to be gained by the consumer (Ref. 25). However, the Food Advisory Committee members were unable to identify a benefit for ephedrine alkaloids in terms of supplementing the diet (Ref. 25). Moreover, risk-benefit analysis is something that is done under the act for drugs, not food. Several members of the Working Group suggested that any limitations on the level of ephedrine alkaloids in dietary supplements be based on the use of pharmaceutical ephedrine in OTC oral bronchodilator drugs and the use of Ephedra in traditional herbal medicine (Ref. 27). Other members of the Working Group and several members of the Food Advisory Committee found difficulty in extrapolating from OTC drug data because the products, the populations using the products, and intended use of the products are dissimilar (Ref. 25). In addition, the latter members were concerned about the potential for adverse events to occur, particularly in populations sensitive to the effects of ephedrine alkaloids, if therapeutic levels of ephedrine are used in dietary supplements (Ref. 25). Several members of the Food Advisory Committee were also concerned about using data from the use of Ephedra in traditional herbal therapies to support the safety of the use of ephedrine alkaloids in dietary supplements because the therapeutic use of ephedrine alkaloids has traditionally not involved the same conditions, the same populations, or the same purposes as those under which dietary supplements are used (Ref. 25). The agency considered the applicability of OTC drug data and tentatively concluded that these data, which involve use in a restricted population (physician-diagnosed mild asthmatics) under limited directions for use (i.e., not to exceed 12.5 to 25 mg every 4 hours, not to exceed 150 mg in 24 hours) and with warnings and contraindications for use, has no application here. The determination of safety for drugs is based on a weighing of the proven benefits of the use of the product against the risks. This approach may not be used with foods under section 402(a) of the act. The only question for food use under this section is whether it will cause harm or not. While the concept of ``unreasonable risk'' as stated in section 402(f)(1)(A) of the act, may imply that some evaluation of effects, including risks and benefits, is appropriate for dietary supplements, it is not necessary to reach that question here, because, as stated above, there are no demonstrated benefits for ephedrine alkaloids. Moreover, the risks attendant on consuming dietary supplements containing levels of ephedrine permitted in oral bronchodilator drugs (12.5 to 25 mg ephedrine per dose) are manifest. In addition, there is no basis for extrapolating from data from a subgroup of the population, diagnosed asthmatics, who may be less sensitive to the effects of ephedrine (Ref. 25) than the general population, to the general population, among which a significant number of people are known or suspected of being very sensitive to ephedrine. Finally, the agency finds it inappropriate to extrapolate data from the use of OTC ephedrine-containing drugs because dietary supplements contain a mixture of several ephedrine alkaloids and a variety of other ingredients, including vitamins, minerals, other botanicals, and other physiological and pharmacologically active substances, while OTC drugs contain only a single ephedrine alkaloid. The presence of other alkaloids and substances in dietary supplements may act to increase the likelihood, frequency, and severity of adverse events from the use of these products. In fact, clinical studies show that adverse events are more likely to occur when ephedrine is combined with other substances, such as caffeine. Therefore, the fact that pharmaceutical ephedrine  In addition to this proposed regulation, the agency has issued proposed and final rules on dietary supplements, including premarket notification procedures for new dietary ingredients (61 FR 50774, September 27, 1996) and label warning statements and unit dose packaging requirements for iron containing dietary supplements (62 FR 2218, January 15, 1997). The agency has proposed to codify each of the proposed and final regulations in different parts of the Code of Federal Regulations. The agency believes that it would be easier for consumers as well as for the dietary supplement industry to find and use regulations for dietary supplements if they were consolidated into one part of the CFR. Accordingly, FDA is proposing to revise part 111 to consolidate the regulations for dietary supplements. FDA is proposing to change the title of part 111 from ``Current Good Manufacturing Practice for Dietary Supplements'' to ``Dietary Supplements.'' This is necessary to reflect that other regulations for dietary supplements in addition to regulations for current good manufacturing practice will be contained in this part. FDA is proposing to establish four subparts in part 111: Subpart A--General Provisions, Subpart B--Current Good Manufacturing Practice for Dietary Supplements, Subpart C--New Dietary Ingredients, and Subpart D--Restricted Dietary Ingredients. The labeling provisions for dietary supplements will continue to be placed in 21 CFR part 101. D. Other Approaches Considered by the Agency In choosing the proposed approach to limit the risks presented by ephedrine alkaloids in dietary supplements, the agency considered, but rejected, several other approaches. Because the act does not allow premarket review authority for dietary supplements, FDA has no data and information to establish conditions of use that will ensure the safe use of ephedrine alkaloidcontaining dietary supplements. Therefore, the only viable approach available to FDA is one in which the agency prohibits levels of a substance in, or conditions of use for, a dietary supplement that it can prove may render the product injurious to health or that present a significant or unreasonable risk of illness and injury under the conditions of use suggested or recommended in the labeling or under ordinary conditions of use. The agency is unaware of any classical toxicological studies whose results identify ``no adverse effect levels'' for ephedrine alkaloids directly   Federal Register / Vol. 62, No. 107 / Wednesday, June 4, 1997 / Proposed Rules has been approved by FDA for an OTC use does not provide assurance of safety for the use of ephedrine alkaloids in dietary supplements. The agency considered the applicability of traditional use of botanical sources of ephedrine alkaloids in establishing dietary ingredient levels for ephedrine alkaloids in dietary supplements. A history of long usage of a medicinal herb in traditional therapies does not provide an assurance of safety for a component of a dietary supplement because these conditions of use are so different. The history of use of Ephedra in traditional Asian medicine primarily for the treatment or relief of respiratory symptoms provides insufficient assurance that ephedrine alkaloids will not present a significant or an unreasonable risk of injury to consumers who use dietary supplement products containing ephedrine alkaloids to supplement the diet. Not only are dietary supplements marketed for different uses than the traditional use of Ephedra, most dietary supplements are marketed in a form that is different than the form in which it has been traditionally used, e.g., as a concentrated extract in capsules and tablets, in the presence of other substances rather than the raw botanical in a tea. FDA is not aware of any systematic collection of data related to adverse effects occurring in individuals treated with Ephedra in traditional medicine. However, several reference texts list precautions and contraindications for the use of the botanical Ephedra in traditional medicine preparations (Refs. 6, 14, and 146). Thus, FDA tentatively concludes that use of ephedrine alkaloids in traditional Asian medicine does not provide the basis on which to establish a safe level of use of ephedrine alkaloids in dietary supplements. IV. Analysis of Impacts FDA has examined the impacts of the proposed rule under Executive Order 12866 and the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601612). Executive Order 12866 directs agencies to assess all costs and benefits of available regulatory alternatives and, when regulation is necessary, to select the regulatory approach that maximizes net benefits (including potential economic, environmental, public health and safety, and other advantages; distributive impacts; and equity). Executive Order 12866 classifies a rule as significant if it meets any one of a number of specified conditions, including having an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or adversely affecting in a material way a sector of the economy, competition, or jobs, or if it raises novel legal or policy issues. If a rule has a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities, the Regulatory Flexibility Act requires agencies to analyze regulatory options that would minimize the economic impact of that rule on small entities. FDA finds that this proposed rule is an economically significant rule as defined by Executive Order 12866, and finds under the Regulatory Flexibility Act that this proposed rule will have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. Finally, FDA, in conjunction with the Administrator of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), finds that this proposed rule is a major rule for the purposes of congressional review (Pub. L. 104121). A. Market Failure The market failure addressed by this regulation is that some consumers may not have sufficient information on the health risks associated with dietary supplements containing ephedrine alkaloids to make informed choices concerning the consumption of these products, despite the presence of warning labels of various types on many of these products. Ordinarily, consumers would be expected to seek out and pay for the level of information they consider appropriate with respect to consumption decisions. However, the level of information currently utilized by consumers with respect to these products may be less than optimal because of consumer perceptions that products marketed as foods or derived from botanical sources are inherently safe, and the cost of generating evidence to evaluate the safety of these products may be quite high. In addition, the onset of the adverse health events associated with these products is frequently quite unexpected or occurs without identifiable risk factors, and consumers may have little or no opportunity to adapt their behavior based on experience with the risks of these products prior to suffering a severe adverse event. B. Regulatory Options FDA has the following primary options: 1. Take no action. 2. Take no regulatory action, but generate additional information on which to base a future regulatory action. 3. Take proposed action. 4. Take proposed action, but with a higher potency limit. 5. Ban dietary supplements that contain ephedrine alkaloids.  30705  6. Take proposed action, but do not require warning statement. 7. Require warning statements only. C. Benefits and Costs 1. Option 1--Take No Action By convention, the option of taking no action is the baseline in comparison with which the costs and benefits of the other options are determined. Therefore, neither additional costs nor benefits are associated with taking no action. Although no regulatory costs or benefits are generated if no regulatory action is taken, preventable adverse events will continue to occur if no regulatory action is taken. The number of such adverse events is expected to increase over time because the marketplace for these types of products has been increasing rapidly since the 1994 passage of the DSHEA, and the number of AER's associated with use of these products has also been increasing sharply over the last few years (Figure 1). 2. Option 2--Take No Regulatory Action, but Generate Additional Information on Which To Base a Future Regulatory Action FDA has the option of taking no regulatory action but generating additional information on which to base future regulatory action on this issue. The benefit of generating additional information is a reduction in the substantial uncertainty concerning the specific nature of the relationship of the adverse events associated with dietary supplements containing ephedrine alkaloids and, possibly, a more precisely targeted regulation. A more precisely targeted regulation could imply potency limits either higher or lower than the proposed potency limits, and either more or fewer ingredient and labeling restrictions than those proposed. The cost of generating additional information is the cost of whatever activity is undertaken to generate the additional information and the health cost of any adverse events to these products that would occur if regulatory action were delayed but that would not occur if regulatory action were not delayed. 3. Option 3--Take Proposed Action a. Benefits. The benefit of the proposed action is a potential reduction in the number or severity of adverse events associated with dietary supplements containing ephedrine alkaloids. The proposed rule consists of the following four actions: (1) Per day and per serving potency limits on total ephedrine alkaloids (TEA), (2) restrictions on caffeine and other   30706  Federal Register / Vol. 62, No. 107 / Wednesday, June 4, 1997 / Proposed Rules all ephedrine alkaloids from these products. First, the functional effect, as perceived by consumers, of removing all ephedrine alkaloids from a product is probably greater than the perceived functional effect of removing some of the ephedrine alkaloids and removing some ingredients that interact with those ephedrine alkaloids. Second, if only some firms remove ephedrine alkaloids from their products, relatively close substitutes will exist for the prior formulations of those products because other firms might not remove ephedrine alkaloids from their products. However, if all firms make the same changes in their products, then relatively close substitutes will not exist for the prior formulations of those products. Therefore, the proposed potency limits and other ingredient restrictions are estimated to reduce the number of people consuming these products by between 0 to 33 percent. The effect of the potency limits on the probability of an adverse event for those who continue to consume these products will be addressed later in this section. The proposed warning statement is also likely to reduce the number of people consuming these products because a few of the relevant products do not currently have warning statements, and because, in some cases, the proposed warning statement is more comprehensive, more focused, and more strongly worded than existing warning statements. The only information available on the effect of warning statements on sales concerns diet soft drinks containing saccharin. Following the introduction of warning statements relating to saccharin, annual sales of diet soft drinks containing saccharin were reported to be 15 percent below what they would otherwise have been (Ref. 212). The effect of the proposed warning statement for dietary supplements containing ephedrine alkaloids will probably be smaller than the effect of the saccharin warning label on diet soft drinks because most such supplements already have some type of warning statement. Therefore, the proposed warning statement will probably reduce the number of people consuming these products by 0 to 15 percent. The proposed label claim restrictions are also likely to reduce the number of people consuming these products by making the marketing of these products more difficult. The only information available on the potential effects of label claims on sales concerns ready-to-eat breakfast cereals. Following an advertising campaign relating bran consumption to a reduced risk of developing cancer, sales of high bran breakfast cereals were reported to have increased approximately 40 percent (Ref. 213). The effect of eliminating label claims on dietary supplements containing ephedrine alkaloids will probably be smaller because the claims involved are more general, and because other sources of information on the purported effects of ephedrine alkaloids are readily available or have been used recently enough that consumers are familiar with them. However, approximately 10 percent of the AER's involved supplements labeled as alternatives to street drugs. Assuming that consumers of these products will not purchase these products if they are not labeled as alternatives to street drugs, the labeling restriction will reduce expected adverse events by at least 10 percent. Therefore, the proposed restriction on label claims will probably reduce the number of people consuming these products by between 10 percent and 40 percent. In addition to these consumption effects, the proposed potency limits and ingredient restrictions will probably also decrease the likelihood that those who continue to consume these products will suffer an adverse event. FDA is not aware of clinical information, particularly evidence from well-designed and conducted human studies on the relationship between intakes of ephedrine alkaloids from botanicals and the probability of an adverse event. One method of approaching the estimation of the health benefits of reduced exposure to ephedrine alkaloids is to consider the proportion of adverse event reports that involve products with TEA levels greater than that allowed under the proposed potency limits. FDA was able to obtain information on the actual exposures associated with adverse events for 13 products that provided intakes of less than 20 mg TEA per reported use by multiplying the consumer's reported use level against an FDA product analysis result. These reports provided information on the lower end of the range of estimated intakes by consumers. Among these 13 reports of adverse events associated with intakes of less than 20 mg, 9 involved consumer intakes of between 8 mg and 20 mg/per serving. This approach suggests that the proposed potency limit might reduce the expected number of adverse events by at least 80 percent, although the actual reduction is probably higher because the 13 reports did not include the many adverse event reports that occurred at intakes above 20 mg TEA per serving. On the other hand, the actual reduction might also be lower because the 13 reports did not include  stimulants, (3) mandatory warning statement, and (4) labeling restrictions. To estimate the benefits of these actions, a percentage decrease in the current number of adverse events associated with dietary supplements containing ephedrine alkaloids will be estimated for each regulatory action listed above. The estimated effects of all proposed actions will then be combined to obtain a total reduction in the expected annual number of adverse events. This percentage reduction will then be applied to an estimate of the current number of such adverse events to obtain an estimated number of adverse events avoided per year. The estimate of the current number of adverse events will be based on, but not identical to, the current number of relevant AER's because of uncertainty over a number of issues including, for example, the degree to which the relevant adverse events are reported. These sources of uncertainty will be discussed in greater detail later. Each of the proposed actions may affect the number of adverse events by reducing the number of people who consume the relevant products or by modifying their use of these products in a manner that reduces the risk of an adverse effect. In addition, the potency limits and ingredient restrictions may affect the number of adverse events by reducing the probability that those who consume these products will suffer an adverse event. Each of these effects will be considered in turn, beginning with the effect of the proposed actions on the number of people who consume these products. The proposed potency limits and other ingredient restrictions may affect the number of people consuming these products because they may affect the value placed by consumers on the use of these products. Some information on the likely effect of the proposed potency limits on the consumption of these products comes from a report from one firm that marketed an ephedrine alkaloid-free substitute for a supplement that previously contained ephedrine alkaloids. The sales of the substitute product were reportedly approximately 33 percent lower than the sales of the ephedrine alkaloid-containing product (Ref. 211). In the absence of more specific information, it is reasonable to suppose that a given reduction in sales is associated with a proportionate reduction in the number of people consuming these products. It would not be reasonable to suppose the proposed potency limits and other ingredient restrictions would have a greater effect on the sales of these products than complete elimination of   Federal Register / Vol. 62, No. 107 / Wednesday, June 4, 1997 / Proposed Rules all adverse event reports that occurred at intakes below 20 mg TEA per serving. This approach to estimating the impact of the proposed potency limits assumes that the probability of an adverse event is related to intakes of TEA. If the probability of an adverse event is not related to TEA intake, then the potency limits may result in little or no reduction in the expected number of adverse event reports. For example, if individual sensitivities to ephedrine alkaloids are the major underlying factor in the reported adverse events, then it is possible that there may be no ``safe'' intake for these persons. Based on this information, all that can be said concerning the proposed potency limits is that they may reduce the expected number of adverse events by between 0 to 80 percent. The restriction on other stimulants, including caffeine, should also reduce the probability of an adverse event. Combinations of ephedrine alkaloids and caffeine, at sufficiently high doses, are associated with an increased probability of an adverse event. For example, one study found that 60 percent of the study subjects had an adverse reaction to a combination of 20 mg ephedrine and 200 mg caffeine, while only 44 percent had an adverse reaction to 20 mg ephedrine alone (Ref. 105). Thus, in this study, the presence of 200 mg caffeine appears to have increased the probability of an adverse event from consumption of 20 mg ephedrine by about 50 percent. Comparable information is not available on the effect of combinations of ephedrine and caffeine at lower levels of either ephedrine or caffeine. Similarly, no information is available on the effect of other stimulants or other ephedrine alkaloids. An informal review of 217 adverse event reports featuring dietary supplements suspected of containing ephedrine alkaloids found that 99 reports featured products for which labeled ingredient information was available. Of those reports, 70 percent involved products labeled as containing a source of caffeine. The levels of caffeine and ephedrine alkaloids in these products is not known. Assuming that these adverse event reports are typical of all relevant adverse event reports and that 50 percent of the reported adverse events to products labeled as containing caffeine may have been due to the presence of caffeine in conjunction with ephedrine alkaloids, the restriction on stimulants is estimated to reduce the expected number of adverse events by up to 35 percent. However, the impact of the proposed stimulant restrictions may be somewhat lower because the impact may depend on the levels of stimulants and ephedrine alkaloids involved, and the levels of stimulants and ephedrine alkaloids found in dietary supplements may be lower than the levels used in the study on which this estimate is based. In order to address this possibility, the restrictions on stimulants will be assumed to reduce the expected number of adverse reactions by 25 percent. In order to use the estimated risk reductions discussed above to derive an expected reduction in the number of adverse events, the current number of adverse events must be estimated. There are a number of issues involved in estimating the current number of adverse events based on the number of reported adverse events. The first issue is that the data base of over 600 AER's includes all reports thought to be related to the consumption of ephedrine alkaloidcontaining dietary supplements, even though the nature of the available evidence did not allow specific cause and effect determinations for the majority of individual reports. FDA, therefore, used additional information to provide assurance that the patterns of signs and symptoms associated with the ephedrine alkaloid-containing dietary supplements were likely due to the presence of ephedrine alkaloids in these products. One approach to addressing this issue is to examine the evidence for positive dechallenge and rechallenge when product use is discontinued and reinitiated, respectively. The relationship of the reported adverse events to the consumption of dietary supplements categorized as containing ephedrine alkaloids has been corroborated by dechallenge in about 27 percent of the AER's. Positive rechallenge was reported in about 4 percent of the AER's. The majority of AER's, however, lacked sufficient information to evaluate the presence or absence of dechallenge or rechallenge effects. Therefore, the number of cases in which dechallenge alone or in combination with rechallenge was tried but did not occur is not available; nor is there information on whether dechallenge and rechallenge would have occurred in the large number of reports which lack such information. It is possible that all cases might have been associated with positive dechallenge and rechallenge results if such information were available. On the other hand, a certain number of false reports might also be expected. The proportion of reported adverse events actually related to the consumption of dietary supplements suspected of containing ephedrine alkaloids is  30707  probably between 27 and 90 percent. Within this range, FDA believes the most likely value is around 80 percent and, therefore, tentatively assumes that 80 percent of the reported adverse events are actually related to the consumption of dietary supplements. FDA requests comments on this assumption. The second issue is the uncertainty that all 600 AER's involved products that actually contained ephedrine alkaloids. Confirmation of the presence of ephedrine alkaloids in problem products is not available in all cases. The likelihood of the presence of ephedrine alkaloids is based on the labeling of the products involved, FDA's own market survey (including laboratory analysis of 125 marketed products), and the similarity of the reported adverse events to the known effects of ephedrine alkaloids. The proportion of reported adverse events associated with dietary supplements that involve supplements containing ephedrine alkaloids is probably between 25 and 90 percent. Within this range, FDA believes the most likely value is around 80 percent and, therefore, tentatively assumes that 80 percent of the reported adverse events associated with consumption of dietary supplements involve supplements that contain ephedrine. FDA requests comments on this assumption. The third issue is that the actual number of adverse events is likely to differ from the reported number of adverse events because all adverse events are probably not reported. This issue is particularly important with respect to passive reporting systems that rely on the voluntary submission of data, such as the system used to gather the AER's relevant to this issue. Typical reporting rates for passive reporting systems addressed to adverse events associated with drugs are generally assumed to be on the order of 10 percent. Reporting rates are higher than usual if the potential health risks associated with a particular substance are widely publicized, if the adverse events are considered to be otherwise unusual, and if reports are gathered from a variety of sources. On the other hand, reporting rates would be lower than usual if consumers and physicians assume that dietary supplements are incapable of producing adverse events because they are not drugs or because they are ``natural.'' In order to incorporate this uncertainty, the reporting rate for the relevant adverse events is assumed to be 10 percent. Based on the current number of reported adverse events and the assumptions discussed above   30708  Federal Register / Vol. 62, No. 107 / Wednesday, June 4, 1997 / Proposed Rules myocardial infarctions, dysrhythmias, strokes, and cardiomyopathies. ``Serious NS'' refers to serious nervous system events, including seizures, loss of consciousness, vestibular events, and psychiatric events. ``Less clinically significant'' events may include certain types of dermatological events and gastrointestinal events. The second column is the average annual number of AER's from January 1993 to June 1996. Because the sales of these products is increasing rapidly, and the reports of adverse events are also increasing rapidly (see Figure 1), FDA believes that this is a conservative estimate of benefits. The 3-year average has been used rather than the growth trend because extrapolating short-term growth trends into the future can result in large errors. The third column is the estimated average annual number of adverse events over this time period based on what FDA believes are the most likely values for the relevant assumptions. The fourth column is the estimated reduction in adverse events from all proposed actions, given as a range from low to high. These estimated reductions are based on adding the effects of the proposed actions as summarized in Table 7. The low end of this range represents a 35 percent reduction in the estimated annual adverse events and the high end represents a 100 percent reduction. The estimates have been rounded to the nearest ten. The fifth column is the value of reducing the risk of particular adverse events such that one expected adverse event is avoided per year across the at-risk population, in thousands of dollars. The sixth column is the estimated value of the annual risk reductions for the various adverse events in millions of dollars, given as a range from low to high, rounded to the nearest million.  concerning the relationship between the number of reported adverse events and the underlying number of adverse events, the expected annual number of adverse events involving these products is approximately 1,100 cases. Applying the risk reductions discussed previously for the proposed actions implies a reduction in the health risks from these products such that the expected number of adverse events involving these products will be reduced by between approximately 400 cases and 1,100 cases per year. Based on published estimates of the value consumers might place on reducing the risk of the general types of adverse events involved, these benefits are valued at between $240 million and $670 million per year (Ref. 215). Table 6 summarizes these results. The first column is the type of adverse event. ``Serious CVS'' refers to serious cardiovascular system events, including  TABLE 6.--ESTIMATED VALUE OF ANNUAL RISK REDUCTION FROM PROPOSED ACTIONS Annual reported cases 1 Estimated annual cases 2 Value of estimated risk estiReduction in reduction per Value ofrisk mated estimated ancase reduction nual cases 3 ($ thou($ millions) 5 sands) 4 1040 60170 70190 2050 3080 210600 3901,110 5,000 837 1,483 3 775 0.4 NA 70190 50140 100280 0 2060 0 240670  Type of event  Death ..........................................................................................................

Trends in the data were not extrapolated because of the short timeframe involved. 2 Estimated annual cases are based on the following assumptions: (1) 80 percent of the reported adverse events involving the consumption of dietary supplements suspected of containing ephedrine alkaloids are actually related to the consumption of dietary supplements, (2) 80 percent of the supplements involved in the reported adverse events that are related to the consumption of supplements actually contain ephedrine alkaloids, and (3) 10 percent of adverse events to the dietary supplements containing ephedrine alkaloids are reported. Thus, the estimated number of annual cases is 0.8  0.8  10 times the number of annual reported cases. Considerable uncertainty exists with respect to the validity of the assumptions on which this estimate is based and the actual number of annual cases may be higher or lower than the estimate. 3 The low end of the range of the reduction in estimated annual cases represents a 35 percent reduction in estimated annual cases. The high end of this range represents a 100 percent reduction in estimated annual cases. The 35 percent and 100 percent estimates are based on adding up the estimated effects of the proposed actions, as indicated in Table 7. 4 The value of the risk reduction per case is based on published estimates of the value consumers place on reducing the risk of the general types of adverse events involved (Ref. 215). 5 The value of the estimated risk reduction is based on multiplying the risk reduction per case times the reduction in the estimated annual cases.

Costs. The primary social costs of the proposed actions are the compliance costs, which include the one-time costs associated with relabeling and reformulating the affected supplements and the recurring costs associated with testing for the level of ephedrine alkaloids in conjunction with future product reformulations or changes in ingredients, and the value of the utility losses to any consumers who do not value the reformulated supplements as highly as supplements currently found on the market. This cost must be considered somewhat paradoxical because the cause of this loss of value, the reduction or removal of ephedrine alkaloids, would also reduce or eliminate the risks associated with using these products. In addition, indirect social costs in the form of capital losses and temporary unemployment may arise from the distributive effects of the proposed action, which are discussed below. Some portion of the compliance costs will be borne by manufacturers and distributors of these products, and some portion will be passed on to consumers of these products. Costs borne by manufactures and distributors will be borne by the owners, stockholders, and employees of those firms. In addition to the potential impact of compliance costs, manufacturers and distributors of the dietary supplements containing ephedrine alkaloids will be adversely affected by the reduction in consumption of these products caused by the proposed actions. Also, manufacturers, distributors, and importers of raw or bulk Ma huang and other affected ingredients may be affected by these consumption effects. These effects are distributive effects rather than social costs because they do not involve the loss of productive resources, and because a loss of business in one sector of the economy is generally associated with an increase in business in competing sectors. However, as indicated above, social costs may be involved to the extent that otherwise productive capital investment is lost and temporary unemployment is generated. In addition, distributive effects are obviously very significant to the affected parties.  FDA has previously estimated the cost of relabeling all dietary supplements in the economic impact analysis for the proposal on nutrition labeling of dietary supplements that was published in the Federal Register of December 28, 1995 (60 FR 67184) (the December 1995 proposal). Total discounted labeling costs based on an 18 month compliance period were estimated to be between $52 and $85 million. This cost included recurring testing or analytical costs based on testing the nutrient content of each product an average of once every 5 years. Based on comments to the December 1995 proposal, these estimates were revised in the economic impact analysis of the final rule. The revised estimate was $194 million, with $91 million of these costs occurring in the first 18 months and the remainder being a discounted sum of future analytical costs. In order to use this estimate as a basis for estimating labeling costs for the current proposal, the previous estimate must be adjusted to account for the compliance period associated with this rule and the fact that not all dietary supplements contain ephedrine alkaloids. The proposed effective date of any regulation based on this proposal will be 180 days after the date of publication of the final rule. If the nutritional labeling rule had a compliance period of 180 days rather than 18 months, the total estimated labeling costs would have been $334 million, with $286 million of these costs occurring in the first 6 months. Adjusting the previous estimate to account for the fact that not all dietary supplements contain ephedrine alkaloids requires information on the proportion of dietary supplements that contain ephedrine alkaloids. The market surveys identified 125 dietary supplements suspected of containing ephedrine alkaloids. A public comment submitted to the Special Working Group of the Food Advisory Committee suggested the number of such products is at least 200 (Ref. 216). In the December 1995 proposal, the total number of dietary supplement products was estimated to be between 4,000 and 25,000. In the final rule entitled ``IronContaining Supplements and Drugs: Label Warning Statements and Unit-  Dose Packaging Requirements'' that published in the Federal Register of January 15, 1997 (62 FR 2218), this estimate was revised to 29,000. If 200 dietary supplements contain ephedrine alkaloids, then about 1 percent of the estimated total number of dietary supplements contain ephedrine alkaloids and the cost of changing the labels on dietary supplements containing ephedrine alkaloids would be about 1 percent of the costs estimated for changing the labels on all dietary supplements. Another method of estimating the proportion of dietary supplements that contain ephedrine alkaloids is to use sales data. This method is complicated by the fact that sales might not be evenly distributed across dietary supplements, implying that the proportion of dietary supplement sales accounted for by supplements that contain ephedrine alkaloids may not be the same as the proportion of dietary supplement products that contain ephedrine alkaloids. Ma huang and other ephedra products have been reported to represent 3.5 percent of individual botanical sales in selected health food stores, while individual sales of products containing single botanicals are estimated to make up about 53 percent of total botanical supplement use (Ref. 3). Information is not available on the proportion of products with multiple botanical ingredients that contain ephedrine alkaloids. Botanical supplement retail sales have been estimated to have accounted for approximately 26 percent of total dietary supplement retail sales in 1995 (Ref. 217). However, this estimate includes a number of product categories under dietary supplements that would not be considered dietary supplements under the legal definition of a dietary supplement. After adjusting for the definition of dietary supplements, supplements containing botanicals accounted for approximately 35 percent of dietary supplement retail sales in 1995. The definition of dietary supplement used in this estimate includes vitamins, minerals, and botanical (including herbal) supplements. If all supplements containing ephedrine alkaloids are characterized as   30710  Federal Register / Vol. 62, No. 107 / Wednesday, June 4, 1997 / Proposed Rules will either have to be reformulated or removed from the market. The number of dietary supplements containing ephedrine alkaloids has been estimated, above, to be between 200 and 5,000. Under this assumption, if all products were reformulated, the one-time cost of reformulating the affected products would be between $0.2 million and $25 million. The recurring costs associated with testing for ephedrine alkaloid levels in conjunction with future product reformulations was addressed in the labeling costs. Another cost associated with product reformulation is the cost of any inventory losses involving products produced prior to the publication of a final rule based on this proposal that cannot be sold by the date that final rule goes into effect. The proposed effective date of any final rule on this issue is 180 days after publication of the final rule. FDA has no information on the amount of inventory typically carried for these products, but tentatively assumes that 180 days will provide sufficient time to utilize existing stock. In addition to the compliance costs discussed above, the proposed action will also lead to utility losses for some consumers because it removes products with certain characteristics from the marketplace. Theoretically, the value of this utility loss is the difference in the value consumers placed on the eliminated products and the value of the products purchased in place of the eliminated products. Estimating this loss requires estimating demand curves for the eliminated products and for the products substituted for the eliminated products. Identifying likely substitutes for dietary supplements as currently formulated is complicated by the fact that a wide range of effects are attributed to these supplements, for example, energy, weight loss, body building, and increased mental concentration. However, little reliable information is available on the actual effects produced by these supplements. In addition, various other botanical substances exist that might be used in supplements to replace either some portion of the ephedrine alkaloids or the restricted ingredients and might produce effects that consumers may perceive to be similar to the effects that consumers attributed to these supplements as currently formulated. Finally, FDA has insufficient information to estimate demand curves for dietary supplements containing ephedrine alkaloids or potential substitutes for these products. Based on these considerations, FDA cannot place bounds on the value of the consumer utility losses that may be associated with this action. However, if substitute products could be identified, then the absolute price difference between the affected products and the substitute products would represent a lower bound on consumer utility losses. No comparable argument is available for the upper bound of the utility loss. In addition to compliance costs and utility losses, the proposed action will also generate distributive effects. The total reduction in the consumption of dietary supplements containing ephedrine alkaloids from all proposed actions including the potency limits, ingredient restrictions, labeling restrictions, and mandatory warning statement was estimated in the analysis of the benefits of this option to be between 10 percent and 33 percent. Total annual sales of supplements containing Ma huang have been estimated to be between $600 million and $700 million (Ref. 219). Therefore, sales of these products may be reduced by between $60 million and $230 million per year. Information is not available on the total annual sales of supplements containing sources of ephedrine alkaloids other than Ma huang. Countervailing effects may also take place which may reduce the impact of these negative distributive effects on affected firms. For example, the proposed rule may reduce the number of product liability lawsuits brought against manufacturers of dietary supplements containing ephedrine alkaloids. FDA has insufficient information on the current incidence or cost of these lawsuits to estimate the effect of this reduction, if any, on the negative distributive effects generated by consumption changes. Of course, distributive effects that are negative with respect to a given industry will be positive with respect to some other industry. Finally, social costs may be associated with these distributive effects. For example, some portion of the value of the capital invested in the production of these supplements may be lost and that loss might not be offset by other effects, such as an augmentation to the value of the capital invested in the production of substitutes. However, FDA has insufficient information to estimate the social costs that might be associated with these distributive effects. Under these assumptions, the proposed action will generate total compliance costs of between $3 million and $80 million, plus unquantifiable utility losses to consumers of these products. Between $3 million and $70 million of these costs will occur in the  botanical supplements, this information suggests that between 1 and 17 percent of dietary supplement use involves products that contain ephedrine alkaloids. If the proportion of dietary supplement products containing ephedrine alkaloids reflects the proportion of dietary supplement sales accounted for by products containing ephedrine alkaloids, then between 1 and 17 percent of the total number of dietary supplement products contain ephedrine alkaloids, or between 200 and 5,000 products. Based on the preceding information, labeling costs for this proposal are estimated to be between 1 and 17 percent of the costs previously estimated for changing the labels on all dietary supplements, after adjusting those costs for the length of the compliance period. Thus, total discounted labeling costs for this proposal are estimated to be between $3 million and $60 million, with between approximately $3 million and $50 million of these costs occurring in the first year and between a minimal amount and approximately $0.5 million in every year after the first year. If the proposed 180 day compliance period for making the proposed label changes coincided with some portion of the 18-month compliance period of the final rule requiring nutritional labeling of dietary supplements, then some portion of the combined labeling costs of the two regulations would be eliminated because some firms would be able to make both labeling changes during normally scheduled labeling changes. The degree of overlap of the compliance periods of these regulations depends on the date on which the final rule is published. If appropriate, this consideration will be addressed in the economic analyses of the final rule. Information is not available on the cost of reformulating the affected products. Reformulation may simply involve reducing the amount of the ingredient source of the ephedrine alkaloids and removing the restricted ingredients. One method of approaching this issue is to consider the types of personnel and the amount of effort that might be required for reformulation. A reasonable assumption is that it might take a scientist from 1 to 4 weeks to develop an acceptable reformulation. In this case, the cost of reformulating a product would be between $1,000 and $5,000, based on median weekly earnings data for 1994 and 50 percent overhead (Ref. 218). Many dietary supplements containing ephedrine alkaloids probably contain restricted ingredients or do not meet the proposed potency limits on TEA and   Federal Register / Vol. 62, No. 107 / Wednesday, June 4, 1997 / Proposed Rules first 6 months after publication of the final rule. In addition, the proposed action will produce distributive effects of between $60 million and $230 million per year and social costs might be associated with those distributive effects. Because the sales of these products are increasing rapidly, FDA believes that this is a conservative estimate of cost and distributive effects. Again, extrapolations have not been made on the growth trend because extrapolating short-term trends into the future can result in large errors. Costs and sales reductions of this magnitude may threaten the viability of many firms in this industry. If some of these firms go out of business, temporary unemployment of labor and permanent loss of capital resources may result. FDA has insufficient information to estimate these costs. 4. Option 4--Take Proposed Action, but With a Higher Potency Limit Another option is to take all proposed actions but adopt potency limits higher than the proposed potency limits. For example, some trade associations representing the dietary supplement industry have previously expressed support for potency limits of 12 mg/ serving and 50 mg/day TEA (Ref. 220). With respect to benefits arising from consumption effects (i.e., the likelihood of reducing the number or seriousness of adverse events), FDA has some information to estimate the effect of variations between the proposed potency limits and higher potency limits on the consumption effects associated with those limits. That is, of the 13 reports of adverse events for which exposure data for intakes less than 20 mg per serving were also available, 5 were in the range between 8 and 12 mg per serving intake. If consumption is sensitive to small changes in the potency limits, then higher potency limits would reduce the benefits resulting from consumption effects because higher potency limits would presumably have a smaller effect on the effects of these products than the proposed potency limits. Therefore, the effect of raising the potency limits on benefits arising from shifts in consumption will be to reduce those benefits below those generated under Option 3. Raising the proposed potency limits will not affect the one-time compliance costs but might reduce utility losses to consumers of these products and the distributive effects produced by consumption shifts. Again, these changes may occur because higher potency limits might have a somewhat smaller impact on the perceived benefits of these products than the proposed potency limits. However, as indicated above, FDA has insufficient information to estimate the effect of small changes in the potency limits on the consumption effects produced by those limits and cannot estimate the utility losses associated with various potency limits. 5. Option 5--Ban Dietary Supplements That Contain Ephedrine Alkaloids Based on the framework used earlier, banning dietary supplements that contain ephedrine alkaloids would lead to a somewhat higher lower bound on estimated benefits. In particular, banning these products would reduce the health risks from these products such that the expected number of adverse events are reduced by between approximately 120 cases and 1,400 cases per year. Banning dietary supplements that contain ephedrine alkaloids will not change the one time compliance costs estimated under Option 3 because all affected products were subject to reformulation and relabeling costs under Option 3. However, banning these products would decrease access to these products by consumers who may perceive benefits, thus substantially increasing the potential utility losses to consumers. With respect to distributive effects generated by consumption changes, the total reduction in the consumption of dietary supplements that now contain ephedrine would probably be approximately 33 percent under this option, that is, at the high end of the range of 10 to 33 percent estimated under Option 3. Therefore, sales of these products would be reduced by between $200 million and $230 million per year. Costs and sales reductions of this magnitude may threaten the viability of many of the firms producing these products. However, countervailing distributive effects are also possible in that some firms that currently produce dietary supplements containing ephedrine alkaloids may also produce or be able to produce substitute products. In that case, those firms would avoid some or all of the costs associated with producing dietary supplements containing ephedrine alkaloids. 6. Option 6--Take Proposed Action, but Do Not Require Warning Statement The purpose of the proposed warning statement is to focus existing warnings more precisely on the health risks posed by these products, particularly in cases where any use of these products may be contraindicated, and to add warnings to those products which do not already  30711  have warning statements. Even with the proposed potency limits and ingredient restrictions, some consumers may be at high risk of suffering an adverse event from consuming these products because of high individual sensitivity to these products, because of an increase in risk associated with simultaneous consumption of drug products, or because of an underlying health condition. Thus, the proposed warning statement is expected to have some benefit independent of the other proposed requirements. Eliminating the proposed mandatory warning statement will affect estimated labeling costs because, under this option, only those labels affected by the claims restrictions would have to be changed. However, the vast majority of the affected products have labels that would be affected by the claims restrictions. Among the products in the market surveys, 94 percent of the products investigated had one or more claims that would be restricted under this option. Thus, labeling costs under this option will be only approximately 6 percent lower than the labeling costs estimated for Option 3. Finally, under the framework developed earlier, this option will have little effect on the other costs and distributive effects estimated for the proposed action under Option 3 because of the influence of the other factors involved. 7. Option 7--Require Warning Statements Only Estimating the benefit of eliminating all proposed actions except the required warning statement involves a controversial value judgment concerning the evaluation of risks that are voluntarily accepted in the presence of the amount of information on those risks provided on the proposed warning statement. Under the assumption that any adverse events that may occur due to such behavior cannot represent net social costs, warning statements will eliminate all net social costs associated with these adverse events. This assumption is based on the notion that the proposed warning statement provides adequate information on the risks of consuming these products and the notion that if those consuming these products have adequate information on the risks involved, then their consumption decisions reflect their personal judgments concerning the relative value of the benefits and risks of consuming these products. If no existing warning statements provide adequate information while the proposed warning statement will   30712  Federal Register / Vol. 62, No. 107 / Wednesday, June 4, 1997 / Proposed Rules percent of those firms classified as small businesses. The proportion of dietary supplement manufacturers producing products containing ephedrine alkaloids is unknown. The two market surveys identified 85 manufacturers and distributors of dietary supplements suspected of containing ephedrine alkaloids. Assuming that the proportion of these firms that are small businesses is the same as the proportion of firms in the dietary supplement industry that are small businesses, 95 percent of these firms, or approximately 80 firms, are small businesses. Total compliance costs incurred by small businesses will be virtually equal to total compliance costs incurred by all businesses estimated earlier because the vast majority of the firms affected by the proposed action are small businesses. Relabeling, reformulation, and testing costs are fixed costs on a per product basis and will disproportionately affect small businesses. Total compliance costs of the proposed action were estimated to be between $3 million and $80 million, with between $3 million and $70 million of these costs occurring in the first 6 months after publication of the final rule. However, FDA has insufficient information to estimate the portion of these costs that will be borne by the owners, stockholders, and employees of these firms and the portion that will be passed on to consumers of these products through price increases. In addition, the proposed action will generate consumption shifts that were previously estimated to produce negative distributive effects of between $60 million and $230 million per year. Countervailing distributive effects are also possible. For example, the proposed rule may reduce the number of product liability lawsuits brought against manufacturers of dietary supplements containing ephedrine alkaloids. Based on reported annual retail sales of between $600 million and $700 million for products containing Ma huang, these costs and distributive effects may be significant. Most of the regulatory alternatives discussed earlier would reduce the impact of this rule on small businesses. The options of taking no action and taking no action other than generating additional information both reduce the impact on small businesses to zero. Requiring only warning statements would substantially reduce compliance costs to between $3 million and $60 million, with between $3 million and $50 million of these costs occurring in the first 6 months, and also substantially reduce negative distributive effects generated by consumption shifts to between $0 and $110 million per year. Taking the proposed action without requiring the warning statement would slightly reduce compliance costs to between $3 million and $80 million, with between $3 million and $70 million of these costs occurring in the first 6 months, but would not affect distributive effects because of the other factors influencing those effects. Taking the proposed action but raising the proposed potency limit to the level suggested by a trade group representing the dietary supplement industry would probably not significantly alter the impact of this rule on small businesses. Finally, banning dietary supplements containing ephedrine would not change reformulation or relabeling costs and would lead to distributive effects from consumption shifts in the range of $200 million to $230 million per year. This action would have the greatest negative impact on small businesses. VI. Conclusions The estimated benefits of Option 3, take the proposed action, are between $240 million and $670 million per year. The estimated quantifiable costs are between approximately $3 and $70 million in the first year, and between a minimal amount and about $0.5 million in every year after the first year. Thus, notwithstanding the considerable uncertainty concerning the marginal effectiveness of the individual requirements of the proposed rule, FDA is confident that it would generate benefits that far exceed the quantifiable costs. In addition to the quantifiable costs, however, the proposed action will also generate non-quantifiable utility losses for some consumers and distributive effects from consumption shifts with an estimated value of between approximately $60 million and $230 million per year, with possible countervailing distributive effects from a reduction of liability lawsuits. Social costs might be associated with these distributive effects. VII. Environmental Impact The agency has carefully considered the potential environmental effects of this action. Based on the available information, FDA has concluded that the action will not have a significant impact on the human environment, and that an environmental impact statement is not required. The agency's finding of no significant impact and the evidence supporting that finding, contained in an environmental assessment, may be seen in the Dockets Management Branch (address above) between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday (Ref. 221).  provide adequate information, then the social benefits of this option would be at least as great as the value of banning dietary supplements containing ephedrine alkaloids. On the other hand, if some existing warning statements already provide adequate information, then the benefits of this option would still be at least as great as the value of banning dietary supplements containing ephedrine alkaloids; however, the benefits of both options would be lower. Under the assumption that any adverse events that may occur due to such behavior represent social costs, eliminating all actions other than the proposed warning statement will substantially reduce the benefits from those estimated for Option 3. This assumption is based either on the notion that the level of information provided on the proposed warning statement is inadequate to ensure that consumers can make informed consumption decisions, or on the notion that public health risks require intervention even if those risks are voluntarily undertaken in the presence of adequate information on the benefits and risks of the relevant activity. Under this assumption, this option will reduce the health risks from these products such that the expected number of adverse events will be reduced by between 0 cases and approximately 210 cases per year. With respect to compliance costs, eliminating all actions except the warning statement would eliminate the costs associated with product reformulation and consumer utility losses. Finally, this option would substantially reduce the distributive effects of this action. Under this option, the estimated total reduction in the consumption of dietary supplements containing ephedrine alkaloids would be between 0 and 15 percent. Therefore, sales of these products would be reduced by between $0 and $110 million per year. A reduction in sales of this magnitude would threaten the viability of fewer firms than the proposed action, as estimated under Option 3. V. Regulatory Flexibility Analysis In the economic impact analysis for the December 1995 proposal, FDA estimated the number of dietary supplement manufacturers to be between 150 and 600, with the majority of those firms being small businesses. Based on additional information, these estimates were revised in the economic impact analysis of the final rule on nutritional labeling. The revised estimate was 500 to 850 firms, with 95   Federal Register / Vol. 62, No. 107 / Wednesday, June 4, 1997 / Proposed Rules The agency will reevaluate its environmental decision if new information is received suggesting that the action would have significant environmental effects.

Preface    The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), through its Evidence-Based    Practice Centers (EPCs), sponsors the development of evidence reports and technology    assessments to assist public- and private-sector organizations in their efforts    to improve the quality of health care in the United States. The reports and    assessments provide organizations with comprehensive, science-based information    on common, costly medical conditions and new health care technologies. The EPCs    systematically review the relevant scientific literature on topics assigned    to them by AHRQ and conduct additional analyses when appropriate prior to developing    their reports and assessments.   To bring the broadest range of experts into the development of evidence reports    and health technology assessments, AHRQ encourages the EPCs to form partnerships    and enter into collaborations with other medical and research organizations.    The EPCs work with these partner organizations to ensure that the evidence reports    and technology assessments they produce will become building blocks for health    care quality improvement projects throughout the Nation. The reports undergo    peer review prior to their release.     AHRQ expects that the EPC evidence reports and technology assessments will inform    individual health plans, providers, and purchasers as well as the health care    system as a whole by providing important information to help improve health    care quality.   We welcome written comments on this evidence report.

Summary   Overview   At the direction of the funding agencies (National Institute of Health Office    of Dietary Supplements (ODS), the National Center for Complementary and Alternative    Medicine (NCCAM), and the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ)),    and in consultation with our Technical Expert Panel, we addressed research questions    regarding the efficacy of herbal ephedra and ephedrine for weight loss and athletic    performance through a comprehensive literature review and synthesis of evidence.    We assessed the safety of these products through review of clinical trials.    Meta-analysis was performed where appropriate. In addition, we reviewed herbal    ephedra- and ephedrine-related adverse events reports on file with the U.S.    Food and Drug Administration (FDA), published case reports, and reports to a    manufacturer of ephedra-containing products. It is expected that the results    of this review will be used to direct further research.   Reporting the Evidence   The following questions were provided to us by the funding agencies and guided    this evidence report.   Weight Loss       What is the evidence for efficacy of ephedra-containing dietary supplement      products in weight loss, over a sustained period of time?      Can efficacy for weight loss be attributed to ephedra alone, or ephedra      in combination with other ingredients (e.g., caffeine)?       Does ephedra have additive effects with other agents?      What dosage levels of ephedra are necessary to achieve weight loss?     Athletic Performance        What is the evidence for efficacy of ephedra-containing dietary supplement      products in terms of energy enhancement and enhancement of athletic performance,      over a sustained period of time?      Can efficacy for energy enhancement and enhancement of athletic performance      be attributed to ephedra alone, or ephedra in combination with other ingredients      (e.g., caffeine) that produce energy enhancement and/or enhancement of athletic      performance?       Does ephedra have additive effects with other agents?      What dosage levels of ephedra are necessary to achieve energy enhancement      and enhancement of athletic performance?     Safety Assessment        Does use of ephedra-containing dietary supplement products over a sustained      period of time increase the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) or other      serious and life-threatening events in specific populations?      What populations are at risk of CVD and other life-threatening events through      use of ephedra over a sustained period of time?      Can the risk for adverse events in these populations be attributed to ephedra      alone, or in combination with other ingredients (e.g., caffeine)?       Does ephedra have additive effects with other agents?      What dosage levels of ephedra produce risk of CVD or other life-threatening      events?      Do ephedra-containing dietary supplement products alter physiologic markers      of cardiovascular function?       What are the metabolic actions of ephedra, so as to explain its beneficial      and adverse effects?     In addition to answering these 15 questions about ephedra-containing dietary    supplement products, we were also asked to synthesize the available information    on the same questions for the purified alkaloid, ephedrine.   After searching published reports, journal articles, conference presentations,    and various sources of unpublished studies, we identified 52 controlled clinical    trials of ephedrine or herbal ephedra for weight loss or athletic performance    in humans. The Food and Drug Administration provided us with copies of over    1,000 adverse event reports (AERs) related to herbal ephedra and 125 AERs related    to ephedrine. These reports often included interviews with patients and/ or    family members, extensive medical records, and copies of product labels. We    identified 70 case reports in the literature and received a disk of 15,951 reports    containing 18,502 cases from Metabolife, a manufacturer of ephedra products.     Methodology   Efficacy.  Data for the efficacy analysis were abstracted from reports    of controlled trials onto a specially designed form containing questions about    the study design, the number of patients and comorbidities, dosage, adverse    events, the types of outcome measures, and the time from intervention until    outcome measurement. We selected the variables for abstraction with input from    the project's technical experts. Two physicians, working independently, each    extracted data from the same reports and resolved disagreements by consensus.     In selecting studies for the meta-analysis of weight loss efficacy, we considered    only those trials of at least eight weeks treatment duration. Our technical    expert panel judged that shorter treatment durations were insufficient to assess    weight loss. In selecting studies on athletic performance, we found that these    studies varied widely with respect to intervention. Because of this heterogeneity,    we compared and contrasted these studies in a narrative review, rather than    performing a statistical synthesis.   The effects of ephedra/ephedrine on weight loss were examined in six different    types of comparisons: (1) ephedrine versus placebo; (2) ephedrine plus caffeine    versus placebo; (3) ephedrine plus caffeine versus ephedrine; (4) ephedrine    versus other active treatment; (5) ephedra versus placebo; and (6) ephedra plus    herbs containing caffeine versus placebo. The last comparison subgroup contained    only a single trial; thus, effect sizes were estimated only for the first five.    The effect size was calculated by dividing the outcome of a study (e.g., difference    in weight loss per month between the two groups) by its standard deviation,    which produces a unitless measure that is useful when comparing studies that    assess outcomes (such as weight) that are similar but are measured differently    (e.g., weight loss in pounds versus change in body mass index). Effect sizes    were pooled separately for each of the five comparison subgroups. In addition,    we used meta-regression to conduct a cross-subgroup synthesis on the effect    sizes of the subgroups with a placebo comparison: ephedrine versus placebo;    ephedrine plus caffeine versus placebo; and ephedra plus herbs containing caffeine    versus placebo.   Safety.  We reviewed each report of a controlled trial (regardless of    treatment duration) for data on adverse events. Adverse events were recorded    onto a spreadsheet that identified each study arm, the description of the adverse    event as listed in the original article, and the numbers of subjects and adverse    events in each arm. We then compared event rates in the ephedra or ephedrine    groups to those in the placebo groups. We conducted a meta-analysis on those    adverse event symptoms for which appreciable numbers of events were noted in    the controlled trials.    Adverse event reports compiled by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) concerning    ephedra or ephedrine were also reviewed by our physician reviewers. Within the    time and resource constraints of this report, we reviewed all available reports    of death, myocardial infarction (heart attack), cerebral vascular accident (stroke),    seizure, and serious psychiatric illness filed prior to September 30, 2001.    We also reviewed published case reports as well as event reports filed with    Metabolife, a manufacturer of ephedra-containing products. After screening,    all case reports were subjected to a review.   Based on input from our technical expert panel and the literature on methods    to assess adverse event reports, we identified three important criteria for    inclusion of such reports:         Documentation of an adverse event that met our selection criteria.      Documentation that the person having the adverse event took an ephedra-containing      supplement or ephedrine within 24 hours prior to the event (for cases of death,      myocardial infarction, stroke, or seizure).       Documentation that alternative explanations for the adverse event were      investigated and were excluded with reasonable certainty.      We classified cases that met all three of these criteria as ""sentinel    events."" Cases in which the event might have had other possible causes    but the pharmacology of ephedrine could have contributed were classified as    ""possible sentinel events."" Cases of death, myocardial infarction,    cerebral vascular accident, and seizure were reviewed by internists, with additional    review (as indicated) by a cardiologist, neurologist, or rheumatologist. Psychiatric    cases were reviewed by a psychiatrist specializing in addictions and a psychologist    with expertise in substance abuse. The criterion for use within 24 hours was    not required for psychiatric cases.   Findings   Efficacy for Weight Loss.  We identified 46 controlled trials that assessed    use of ephedra or ephedrine used for weight loss. Of these, 20 were excluded    from pooled analysis because they had a treatment duration of less than eight    weeks. Six additional trials were excluded for a variety of other reasons. Of    the remaining 20 trials included in the meta-analysis, only five tested herbal    ephedra-containing products. Together, these 20 trials assessed 678 persons    who consumed either ephedra or ephedrine. The majority of studies of both ephedra    and ephedrine are plagued by methodological problems (particularly, high attrition    rates) that might contribute to bias. These methodological limitations must    be considered when interpreting any conclusions regarding the efficacy of these    products. Nevertheless, the evidence we identified and assessed supports an    association between short-term use of ephedrine, ephedrine plus caffeine, or    dietary supplements that contain ephedra with or without herbs containing caffeine    and a statistically significant increase in short-term weight loss (compared    to placebo). Adding caffeine to ephedrine modestly increases the amount of weight    loss. There is no evidence that the effect of ephedra-containing dietary supplements    with herbs containing caffeine differs from that of ephedrine plus caffeine:    Both result in weight loss that is approximately two pounds per month greater    than that with placebo, for up to four to six months. No studies have assessed    the long-term effects of ephedra-containing dietary supplements or ephedrine    on weight loss; the longest duration of treatment in a published study was six    months.   Efficacy for Physical Performance Enhancement.  The effect of ephedrine    on athletic performance was assessed in seven studies. No studies have assessed    the effect of herbal ephedra-containing dietary supplements on athletic performance.    The few studies that assessed the effect of ephedrine on athletic performance    have, in general, included only small samples of fit individuals (young male    military recruits) and have assessed the effects only on very short-term immediate    performance. Thus, these studies did not assess ephedrine as it is used in the    general population. The data support a modest effect of ephedrine plus caffeine    on very short-term athletic performance. No studies have assessed the sustained    use of ephedrine on performance over time. The only study that assessed the    additive effects of these agents reported that ephedrine must be supplemented    with caffeine to affect athletic performance.   Safety Issues.  The data on adverse events were drawn from clinical trials    and case reports published in the literature, submitted to the FDA, and reported    to Metabolife, a manufacturer of ephedra-containing supplement products. The    strongest evidence for causality should come from clinical trials; however,    in most circumstances, such trials do not enroll sufficient numbers of patients    to adequately assess the possibility of rare outcomes. Such was the case with    our review of ephedrine and ephedra-containing dietary supplements. Even in    aggregate, the clinical trials enrolled only enough patients to detect a serious    adverse event rate of at least 1.0 per 1,000. For rare outcomes, we reviewed    case reports, but a causal relationship between ephedra or ephedrine use and    these events cannot be assumed or proven.    Evidence from controlled trials was sufficient to conclude that the use of    ephedrine and/or the use of ephedra-containing dietary supplements or ephedrine    plus caffeine is associated with two to three times the risk of nausea, vomiting,    psychiatric symptoms such as anxiety and change in mood, autonomic hyperactivity,    and palpitations.   The majority of case reports are insufficiently documented to make an informed    judgment about a relationship between the use of ephedrine or ephedra-containing    dietary supplements and the adverse event in question. For prior consumption    of ephedra-containing products, we identified two deaths, three myocardial infarctions,    nine cerebrovascular accidents, three seizures, and five psychiatric cases as    sentinel events; for prior consumption of ephedrine, we identified three deaths,    two myocardial infarctions, two cerebrovascular accidents, one seizure, and    three psychiatric cases as sentinel events. We identified 43 additional cases    as possible sentinel events with prior ephedra consumption and seven additional    cases as possible sentinel events for prior ephedrine consumption. About half    the sentinel events occurred in persons aged 30 years or younger. Classification    as a sentinel event does not imply a proven cause and effect relationship.   We did not assess the plethora of additional symptoms that have been reported    in the published literature and the FDA Medwatch file for ephedra-containing    dietary supplements and ephedrine products.    Future Research   Our analysis of the evidence reveals numerous gaps in the literature regarding    the efficacy and safety of ephedra-containing dietary supplements. First, long-term    assessments of the effectiveness of herbal ephedra or ephedrine for promoting    weight loss are lacking. We identified no study with a treatment duration longer    than six months. To improve health outcomes and reduce the risk of morbidities    associated with being overweight, sufficient weight loss (5 to 10 percent of    body weight) and long-term weight maintenance are necessary. Therefore, the    benefit of ephedrine or herbal ephedra-containing dietary supplements for health    outcomes is unknown.   Evidence regarding the effect of herbal ephedra or ephedrine on physical performance    that reflects its use in the general population (repeated or long-term use by    a representative sample) is also needed.   In order to assess a causal relationship between ephedra or ephedrine consumption    and serious adverse events, a hypothesis-testing study is needed. Continued    analysis of case reports cannot substitute for a properly designed study to    assess causality. A case-control study would probably be the study design of    choice.    ###     Additional materials:       Press Release     Fact Sheet     Sample Warning Letter     Federal Register     ""Ephedra      and Ephedrine for Weight Loss and Athletic Performance Enhancement: Clinical      Efficacy and Side Effects"" (Rand Report)            Media Contacts         |    FDA News Page    |         FDA Home Page        Office of Public Affairs      Web page created by  tg  2003-FEB-28"

ACTION: Proposed rule.   -----------------------------------------------------------------------   SUMMARY: The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is proposing to make a finding, which will have the force and effect of law, that a dietary supplement is adulterated if it contains 8 milligrams (mg) or more of ephedrine alkaloids per serving, or if its labeling suggests or recommends conditions of use that would result in intake of 8 mg or more in a 6-hour period or a total daily intake of 24 mg or more of ephedrine alkaloids; require that the label of dietary supplements that contain ephedrine alkaloids state ``Do not use this product for more than 7 days''; prohibit the use of ephedrine alkaloids with ingredients, or with ingredients that contain substances, that have a known stimulant effect (e.g., sources of caffeine or yohimbine), which may interact with ephedrine alkaloids; prohibit labeling claims that require long-term intake to achieve the purported effect (e.g., weight loss and body building); require a statement in conjunction with claims that encourage short-term excessive intake to enhance the purported effect (e.g., energy) that ``Taking more than the recommended serving may result in heart attack, stroke, seizure or death''; and require specific warning statements to appear on product labels. FDA is proposing these actions in response to serious illnesses and injuries, including multiple deaths, associated with the use of dietary supplement products that contain ephedrine alkaloids and the agency's investigations and analyses of these illnesses and injuries. FDA is also incorporating by reference its Laboratory Information Bulletin (LIB) No. 4053, that FDA will use in determining the level of ephedrine alkaloids in a dietary supplement.   DATES: Written comments by August 18, 1997. The agency proposes that any final rule that may issue based on this proposal become effective 180 days after date of publication of the final rule.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:   I. Background   A. Characteristics of Ephedrine Alkaloids       Dietary supplements containing ephedrine alkaloids are widely sold in the United States (Refs. 1 through 3). The ingredient sources of the ephedrine alkaloids include raw botanicals and extracts from botanical sources. Ma huang, Ephedra, Chinese Ephedra, and epitonin are several names used for botanical products, primarily from Ephedra sinica Stapf, E. equistestina Bunge, E. intermedia var. tibetica Stapf and E. distachya L. (the Ephedras), that are sources of ephedrine alkaloids. These alkaloids, ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, norpseudoephedrine, norephedrine, methylephedrine, methylpseudoephedrine, and related alkaloids, are naturally occurring chemical stimulants (Refs. 4 through 8). Although the proportions of the various ephedrine alkaloids in botanical species vary from one species to another, in most species used commercially, ephedrine is the most predominant alkaloid.     The ephedrine and related alkaloids are amphetamine-like compounds. They exhibit some common types of effects but vary in the relative intensity of these effects (Table 1) (Refs. 5, 6, and 9 through 15). For example, ephedrine is a cardiovascular system (CVS) and nervous system (NS) stimulant. Pseudoephedrine has some CVS and NS stimulatory effects but is less potent than ephedrine. Norephedrine (also called phenylpropanolamine) is similar to ephedrine in its NS stimulant effects but has fewer CVS stimulant effects than ephedrine (Refs. 12 and 16 through 18). Although norephedrine is often a minor ephedrine alkaloid constituent, in humans it can be produced from ingested ephedrine through normal metabolic processes (Refs. 9, 19, and 20). Thus, its presence in body tissues and fluids may be detected, and its physiological effects can occur, even if norephedrine is not contained in meaningful amounts in the original supplement product. Data on the other ephedrine alkaloids and related alkaloids are limited, and thus their physiological and pharmacological effects are largely unknown (Ref. 15).

B. The Availability of Ephedrine Alkaloids       To determine the types of ephedrine alkaloid-containing dietary supplements available in the marketplace, the agency has collected over 125 dietary supplement products labeled as containing a known source of ephedrine alkaloids during the past 2 years (Refs. 1 and 2). These products show that ephedrine alkaloid-containing-dietary supplements are marketed in a variety of forms, including capsules, tablets, powders, and liquids. The source of the ephedrine alkaloids in these supplements vary from the raw botanical to powdered plant material and concentrated extracts; however, most of the products contain concentrated extracts. Although FDA is aware that some companies have changed their labeling and formulation since the market review, this review of the marketplace reflects the general contours of products currently sold in the United States.     Ephedrine alkaloids are present in some products as a single ingredient, but more commonly, they are combined with other ingredients, including vitamins, minerals, amino acids, and other botanicals (Refs. 1, 2, and 21). Most of the dietary supplements that contain an ingredient source of the ephedrine alkaloids also contain between 6 and 20 other ingredients. Some of these other ingredients have known or suspected physiological and pharmacological activities that have the potential for interacting with the ephedrine alkaloids so as to increase their effects. For example, the majority of dietary supplements containing ephedrine alkaloids also contain a source of xanthine alkaloids (e.g., caffeine), another stimulant substance that is known to increase the effects of ephedrine alkaloids (Refs. 7, 16, 22, and 23).     Because product labels do not usually provide information on product composition (Ref. 24), and there are no data bases containing such data, FDA laboratories analyzed the products collected to quantify the levels of ephedrine alkaloids (Refs. 1, 2, 21, and 25). Results of the analyses show that these products, taking into account the labeled recommended serving instructions, are likely to provide intakes of ephedrine alkaloids that range from below the detectible limits of FDA's analytical method to 110 mg per serving (i.e., per single use) (Refs. 1, 2, 21, 25, and 26). Most of the products, regardless of their promoted use, had ephedrine alkaloid levels at or above 10 mg per serving.     Many of the dietary supplement products that FDA collected were promoted for uses such as weight loss, body building, increased energy, increased mental concentration, increased sexual sensations, or euphoria or as alternatives to illicit street drugs (Refs. 1, 2, and 25). The majority of the products collected also bore warning statements on their labels (Refs. 1, 2, and 27). The warning statements varied from general precautions, suggesting that the consumer check with a health care professional before beginning any diet or exercise program, to more specific warning statements. The more specific warning statements contained several elements, including cautions that the consumer not use the product if they have certain diseases or health conditions or are using certain drugs, and to stop the use of the product if they develop certain symptoms (Refs. 1, 2, 25, and 27).   C. Adverse Events Associated With Ephedrine Alkaloids       Since 1993, FDA has received more than 800 reports of illnesses and injuries (AER's) associated with the use of more than 100 different dietary supplement products that contained, or were suspected to contain, ephedrine alkaloids. These adverse events tended to involve CVS effects and NS effects. FDA evaluated the AER's showing CVS and NS effects and found that the single most common element was that the products contained, or were thought to contain, a source of ephedrine alkaloids. Approximately 50 to 60 percent of the AER's associated with use of dietary supplements were for such products.     The AER's associated with the ephedrine alkaloid-containing products included consistent patterns of signs and symptoms among both otherwise healthy individuals and those with underlying diseases or conditions. These signs and symptoms included rapid and irregular heart rhythms, increased blood pressure, chest pain, anxiety, nervousness, tremor, hyperactivity, and insomnia (i.e., inability or difficulty in sleeping) and were associated with clinically significant conditions, including heart attack, stroke, psychoses, seizure, and, in a few cases, death. Many of these signs and symptoms occurred in young adults who generally would not have been expected to be at high risk for such conditions (e.g., heart attack and stroke). Many adverse events were reported to occur with the first use or within the first 2 weeks of use. Although the majority occurred in women, men also reported experiencing adverse events.     The nature and patterns of these AER's are consistent with the known physiological and pharmacological effects of ephedrine alkaloids as described in: (1) Pharmacology texts for single ephedrine alkaloid products, (2) case reports of adverse effects from the scientific literature related to the pharmaceutical use of ephedrine alkaloids, (3) adverse events reported in controlled clinical trials using ephedrine in the treatment of obesity, and (4) known safety concerns with traditional medical uses of botanicals that contain ephedrine alkaloids. As a result, FDA focused its investigation on ephedrine alkaloids as a likely factor in the rapidly increasing number of serious AER's associated with the use of dietary supplement products.   D. Review Activities       The growing number and consistency of reports of serious adverse events associated with a wide variety of ephedrine alkaloid-containing dietary supplements, and the virtual absence of publicly available safety data on these supplements, prompted FDA to convene an ad hoc Working Group of its Food   Page 30680   Advisory Committee (the Working Group) (Refs. 27 through 29). 1. The Food Advisory Committee Working Group Meeting on Dietary Supplements Containing Ephedrine Alkaloids     On October 11 and 12, 1995, the Working Group, which consisted of medical and other scientific experts from outside FDA as well as industry and consumer representatives, considered the potential public health problems associated with the use of dietary supplements and other food products containing ephedrine alkaloids.     The Working Group reviewed the evidence on the occurrence of adverse events associated with the use of ephedrine alkaloids. This evidence included the known pharmacology of ephedrine alkaloids, numerous case reports published in the scientific literature, and published findings from clinical studies investigating the use of ephedrine in the treatment of obesity (Ref. 30). The evidence also included over 325 AER's that had been received by FDA that were associated with the consumption of dietary supplements known to contain, or suspected of containing, ephedrine alkaloids (Refs. 29 and 31). The Working Group also considered public comments made during the meeting (Ref. 27).     Following their review of this evidence, the members of the Working Group agreed that the use of certain dietary supplements containing ephedrine alkaloids may cause consumers to experience serious adverse events. On this basis, the Working Group recommended that FDA: (1) Establish single serving and daily total use limits for ephedrine and total ephedrine alkaloids; (2) require warning or cautionary statements on the labels of these products; and (3) establish good manufacturing practice (GMP) requirements, including proper botanical identification and standardization of the ephedrine alkaloid and ephedrine content in concentrated extracts. Several members of the Working Group suggested that ephedrine alkaloids be limited to 25 mg per single serving and 100 mg total daily use. Other members suggested a variety of lower levels of ephedrine alkaloids per serving. The Working Group also discussed specific warning label statements but failed to agree on the wording of the warning statements. 2. The Food Advisory Committee Meeting     In the 6 months that followed the Working Group meeting, the number of reports of adverse events associated with the use of dietary supplements thought to contain ephedrine alkaloids doubled. In addition, FDA received information on two deaths of young adult males in which the medical examiners specifically attributed the cause of death to use of ephedrine alkaloid-containing dietary supplements (see medical examiners' reports in Adverse Reaction Monitoring System (ARMS) No. 10862 and 11134). FDA analyzed samples of products that consumers claimed that they had consumed and suffered an adverse event and found that the ephedrine alkaloid levels in many of these products were below the 25-mg limit suggested by certain members of the Working Group.     In light of the rapidly increasing numbers of adverse events as well as of the new analytical information on AER-related intakes of ephedrine alkaloids, FDA recognized that a determination on how to deal with dietary supplements that contained these substances could not be further delayed. Thus, FDA convened its Food Advisory Committee in conjunction with the Working Group to review and provide final recommendations on what to do with ephedrine alkaloid-containing dietary supplements.     The Food Advisory Committee met on August 27 and 28, 1996. The meeting included all members from the Working Group who were available to attend the meeting, as well as additional experts to replace those experts unable to attend or to fill out the range of expertise needed to appropriately evaluate the subject. FDA asked the Food Advisory Committee to consider the safety of using dietary supplements containing ephedrine alkaloids and to make specific recommendations on how to resolve the public health concerns surrounding their use (Ref. 25). The Food Advisory Committee reviewed the evidence that had been presented to the Working Group as well as new data and information that had become available since the October 1995 Working Group meeting.     Following a review of the totality of the available evidence, the October 1995 recommendations of the Working Group, public comments, and considerable discussion, the Food Advisory Committee agreed that FDA should take action to address the rapidly evolving and serious public health concerns associated with the use of ephedrine alkaloid- containing dietary supplements (Ref. 25). The Food Advisory Committee could not, however, come to consensus on a specific approach to the public health concerns. Over half of the Food Advisory Committee members stated that, based on the available data, no safe level of ephedrine alkaloids could be identified for use in dietary supplements (Ref. 25). Many of these members expressed concern that many individuals who would be at risk if they were to use products were unaware of that risk because many of the conditions that increase the risk of adverse events may not be self-evident (Ref. 25). Consequently, they recommended removing dietary supplements containing ephedrine alkaloids from the market (Ref. 25). Other members of the Food Advisory Committee suggested that the agency establish conditions of use that would reduce the risk of adverse events, including establishing ``reasonably'' safe per serving and daily use levels for both ephedrine alkaloids and ephedrine as well as other requirements (Ref. 25).   II. FDA's Response       Following the August 1996 meeting of the Food Advisory Committee, the agency completed its review of the majority of the AER's associated with these products and reviewed the discussions and the recommendations of the Food Advisory Committee, the scientific literature, the views expressed in public comments, and other data. Based on this information, the agency has tentatively concluded that use of ephedrine alkaloids raises important public health concerns, that the risks these substances create are potentially very serious, and that action must be taken to protect the public health.   A. Summary of Initial Considerations       Between 1993 and 1996, FDA received a rapidly escalating number of AER's associated with the use of dietary supplements, some that contained ephedrine alkaloids, some that did not (Refs. 32 through 34). Figure 1 shows that in the 3 years since the initiation of an adverse event monitoring system for special nutritional products, the number of AER's received by the agency on dietary supplements has quadrupled.   BILLING CODE 4160-01-P   Page 30681   GRAPHIC  TIFF OMITTED  TP04JN97.000     BILLING CODE 4160-01-C   Page 30682       Many of these reports have been for clinically significant events (e.g., heart attack, stroke, seizures) that were observed most often in young adults for whom the risk of these types of events are generally low (see Figure 2, which summarizes data from the AER's relative to the age and gender of individuals experiencing an adverse event). When FDA examined the products reported to be associated with the CVS and NS effects, the most common element among them was that they involved products that contained or were believed to contain an ingredient source of ephedrine alkaloids. Thus, FDA focused its investigation on the ephedrine alkaloids in dietary supplement products.   BILLING CODE 4160-01-P GRAPHIC  TIFF OMITTED  TP04JN97.001     BILLING CODE 4160-01-C     However, many of the ephedrine alkaloid-containing products also contained other ingredients (e.g., amino acids, vitamins and minerals, other botanicals) whose possible influence on the observed AER's could not be ignored. Upon examination of the types of other ingredients, FDA tentatively concluded that these other ingredients should not be the primary focus of its evaluation because these ingredients, unlike the ephedrine alkaloids, did not have a history (in the amounts likely to be found in dietary supplements) of being able to produce the types of serious adverse events being observed. For example, many ephedrine alkaloid-containing dietary supplements also contain known stimulants (e.g., sources of caffeine). While caffeine is known to stimulate the NS, in the amounts likely to be found in dietary supplements it is not expected to produce effects such as stroke, heart attack, and seizure. Nonetheless, FDA remained aware of the possibility that other ingredients in these dietary supplement products contributed to the adverse events reported. For example, other stimulants in the ephedrine-containing dietary supplements could enhance the known stimulant effects of ephedrine alkaloids. Likewise, substances that affect kidney function (e.g., sources of salicin, concentrated amino acids) could influence the body's ability to ``clear'' or rid itself of ingested ephedrine alkaloids.     The agency also considered in its evaluation the fact that botanical sources contain mixtures of ephedrine alkaloids that may have slightly different effects (e.g., additive or interactive effects) than those from a single ephedrine alkaloid, as found in over-the-counter (OTC) products. The agency compared the observed effects of supplement products with the known physiological and pharmacological effects of single sources of the alkaloids that are used as ingredients in several drugs (e.g., ephedrine in OTC bronchodilator products, pseudoephedrine in cough and cold preparations, and phenylpropanolamine in anoretic products). However, the agency was not able to find definitive evidence to evaluate whether ephedrine alkaloids from botanical sources are metabolized differently than those from pharmaceutical sources, and in the absence of more directly relevant data for dietary supplement products, the agency considered it appropriate to rely on evidence from pharmaceutical sources of single ephedrine alkaloids in assessing the effects of botanical sources (see section II.C.2. of this document).   B. FDA's Strategy for Evaluation       FDA considered five questions in evaluating the reports of adverse events involving ephedrine alkaloids that it   Page 30683   had received. These questions were designed to help the agency discern relationships among AER's where direct and readily interpretable clinical studies were not available, and where multiple host or product factors may have affected any association (Refs. 35 through 37). The questions focused the evaluation on whether there was a likely association between the ephedrine alkaloids and the adverse events that had been reported and on the strength, nature, and biological plausibility of any association. These questions were:     (1) Using the AER's on marketed ephedrine alkaloid-containing dietary supplements from FDA's passive surveillance system, are there consistent patterns of signs and symptoms associated with the use of a number of different ephedrine alkaloid-containing dietary supplement products?     (2) Are the patterns of the signs and symptoms consistent with the available scientific evidence and known physiologic and pharmacologic effects of ephedrine alkaloids?     (3) Is there sufficient evidence that the relationships are temporally correct, that is, does exposure occur temporally before the onset of the observed patterns of signs and symptoms?     (4) Is there other evidence of causality, even in the absence of controlled trials, e.g., evidence of dechallenge (improvement or resolution of the signs and symptoms when use of the product is discontinued) or positive rechallenge (reoccurrence of the signs and symptoms when reexposed to ephedrine alkaloids)?     (5) Considering the totality of the available information, is there a biologically plausible explanation for the adverse events?     Finally, in fully evaluating the public health concerns associated with these products, the agency evaluated the potential impact of other factors that could influence final decisions on the best approach to addressing the public health concerns.   C. Evaluation and Tentative Conclusions of the Agency   1. Using the AER's From FDA's Passive Surveillance System for Dietary Supplements, FDA Has Tentatively Concluded That There Are Consistent Patterns of Signs and Symptoms Associated With the Use of a Number of Different Ephedrine Alkaloid-Containing Dietary Supplement Products     In preparation for its August 27 and 28, 1996, Food Advisory Meeting, FDA reviewed each of the approximately 600 AER's that it had received before June 7, 1996 (Refs. 31 and 38). The adverse events associated with ephedrine alkaloid-containing dietary supplement products ranged from those with clinically serious sequelae (such as abnormal heart rhythms, chest pain, heart attack, stroke, significant elevations in blood pressure, seizure, hepatitis, coma, psychosis, and death) to those with less clinically significant signs and symptoms (such as nervousness, dizziness, tremor, minor alterations in blood pressure or heart rate, headache, and gastrointestinal distress) (see Table 1). Although many of the AER's crossed clinical categories, approximately 15 percent of the reports described serious cardiovascular effects, including abnormal heart rhythms, stroke, heart attack, and cardiomyopathy (disease of the heart muscle). Approximately 16 percent of the reports mentioned serious NS effects, including seizure, psychosis, mania, severe depression, vestibular (inner ear) disturbances, and loss of consciousness. Other clinically serious or potentially serious adverse effects reported to be associated with the use of these products included elevations of liver function tests or overt hepatitis (4 percent), myopathies (disease of muscle, particularly skeletal muscle) (3 percent), disturbances of the genitourinary system (e.g., urinary retention, urinary infection, prostatitis (inflammation of the prostate gland), and epididymitis (inflammation of the epididymis, part of the male genitourinary tract)) (3 percent), and dermatologic manifestations (including systemic rashes which appear to be immune mediated or allergic in nature) (6 percent). Approximately 30 percent of the reports mentioned other effects, including gastrointestinal distress, abnormal blood sugar levels or diabetes, blood disorders (including increased bleeding tendencies and abnormal blood cell counts), thyroid disorders, and addiction to the product. Finally, approximately 60 percent of the adverse events were characterized by general stimulant effects on the CVS and NS of a ``less clinically serious'' nature, including anxiety, nervousness, hyperactivity, tremor, insomnia, and altered heart rate or rhythms. However, FDA recognized that these reports of less clinically significant effects could be indicative of early warnings of serious cardiovascular or nervous system risks if product use were to continue.     Serious adverse events were reported for a number of different products promoted for a variety of uses and marketed in a variety of formulations (Refs. 27, 31, and 38). Of these, where there was sufficient information to evaluate how the product was marketed or used, approximately 92 percent of the adverse events were related to the use of products marketed for weight loss and energy purposes, and 5 percent were related to products promoted for enhancing athletic performance or body building, although there was overlap among these uses. Approximately 2 percent of the adverse events were related to products marketed as alternatives to illicit street drugs or for euphoric purposes. (This distribution of types of products parallels the observations made from FDA's market review, which found that most of the dietary supplements containing ephedrine alkaloids bear weight loss and energy claims on their labels or in their labeling (Refs. 1 and 2).) Moreover, specific types of adverse events did not appear to be limited to products promoted for any single use, such as weight loss, energy, or euphoria.     The adverse events were reported to occur in both healthy individuals and in individuals with underlying diseases or conditions that may have influenced the frequency, pattern, or severity of the adverse event (Refs. 25, 27, 31, and 38). Of great concern to the agency are the heart attacks, strokes, seizures, and other clinically serious illnesses and injuries reported to occur in young adults (Figure 2). In approximately 56 percent of the reported adverse events, the injured party was less than 40 years of age, and approximately 25 percent of injuries occurred in those between 40 and 49 years of age. Generally, significant CVS or NS risk factors are not expected in these age groups. Almost 75 percent of the adverse events were reported to occur in females, often using products promoted for weight loss. The higher frequency of adverse events in women most likely reflects a difference in product use (i.e., women predominantly use products marketed for weight loss and energy purposes). However, gender predominance in these ratios may also occur because of gender-related differences in metabolism of ephedrine alkaloids, or gender-related differences in the numbers and types of tissue receptors interacting with ephedrine alkaloids (Refs. 39 through 41).     Data on duration of use of ephedrine alkaloid-containing dietary supplements relative to the occurrence of AER's can also be used to examine the similarity of patterns of adverse events across different types of exposures and individual sensitivities. Figure 3 summarizes the duration of use data collected from the AER's associated   Page 30684   with products containing ephedrine alkaloids. As shown in Figure 3, this information reveals that about 59 percent of the adverse events were reported to occur within 4 weeks of starting to use the product. About 14 percent of the reported adverse events occurred on the first day of using the dietary supplement (Ref. 38) (see ARMS No. 10009 and 11619 in the Appendix to this document) and, in a few cases, on the initial use (Ref. 38) (ARMS No. 11401 in the Appendix to this document). Of equal concern to the agency are reports of serious adverse events occurring within a relatively short time period after consumers began to use the products or consumers began to start using the products after having stopped use for a period of time (ARMS No. 11076 in the Appendix to this document).   BILLING CODE 4160-01-P GRAPHIC  TIFF OMITTED  TP04JN97.002     BILLING CODE 4160-01-C       Adverse events appear to reflect different inherent types of individual sensitivities relative to dose levels, frequency or duration of use, and subsequent results of sympathomimetic stimulation. In some cases, particular events appear to occur as the result of increased individual susceptibility to the effects of sympathetic stimulation (Refs. 39 through 42). For example, in one report (ARMS No. 10862 in the Appendix to this document), three young adult males consumed similar amounts of a dietary supplement containing ephedrine alkaloids, yet only one male experienced serious adverse effects, which resulted in his death (see Police and Medical Examiner's Reports in ARMS No. 10862 in public docket number 95N-0304). This report is illustrative of numerous AER's suggesting an unpredictable pattern and severity of adverse events when consuming ephedrine alkaloid-containing dietary supplements, even when used according to package directions or under ordinary conditions of use. In other cases, some of the adverse events were associated with consumption of relatively low levels of ephedrine alkaloids (e.g., approximately 10 mg or less total ephedrine alkaloids per serving), some occurring shortly after onset of use.     These variations in the occurrence of adverse events relative to duration, frequency, and levels of exposure are suggestive that multiple factors influence sensitivity to ephedrine alkaloid intakes and could be indicative that some of the adverse effects are the result of increased individual susceptibility to the acute or chronic effects of ephedrine alkaloids.     In summary, in reviewing the AER's associated with ephedrine alkaloid-containing dietary supplements, the agency noted a consistency of signs and symptoms across a large number of products, across a range of products with a variety of intended uses, across products with many different formulations, and across a heterogeneous group of individuals with respect to gender, age, and health condition. Generally, the overall pattern of observed results was consistent with stimulant CVS and NS effects, even though not every product showed the same effect or the same seriousness of effect, not every case involved CVS or NS effects, and not all reports were complete or uncomplicated. The patterns of duration of use and dosage   Page 30685   levels suggest patterns of adverse events that are influenced by variations in individual sensitivities. Overall, however, there was a remarkable consistency in the types of signs and symptoms of adverse effects reported. This consistency was recognized by the Working Group (Ref. 27).     The foregoing discussion summarizes the AER's from a descriptive statistical perspective. Many of these reports are summarized in the Appendix to this document. An abbreviated description of all reports is in public docket number 95N-0304. A few examples of experiences of particular individuals are given below.     ARMS No. 11134--A 23-year-old male college student used an ephedrine alkaloid-containing ergogenic product for approximately 2 years, along with several other dietary supplement products. He was previously healthy and was known to have a healthy life style. He was found dead by his sister in the apartment that they shared. The Medical Examiner's report stated that the cause of death was due to ``patchy myocardial necrosis associated with ephedrine toxicity from protein drink containing Ma huang extract.''     ARMS No. 9552--A 35-year-old female, who was on no medications and who had a negative past medical history, developed a non-Q wave myocardial infarction (heart attack) while using an ephedrine alkaloid- containing dietary supplement within the dosage recommended on the label. She used the product for approximately 30 days, stopped for 1 week while on vacation, and then reinitiated the use of the product. About 11 days after restarting the product, she developed acute throbbing, anterior chest pain at rest, with radiation to the left shoulder, numbness of the left arm and hand, diaphoresis (sweating), and shortness of breath. In the hospital, clinical evaluations (electrocardiogram and cardiac enzymes) indicated an acute non-Q wave myocardial infarction, thought to be secondary to coronary artery spasm. Cardiac catheterization showed normal coronary arteries.     ARMS No. 10009--A 35-year-old male took an ephedrine alkaloid- containing dietary supplement (2 capsules at noon, 3 capsules at 4:30 pm). He worked out from 5:30 to 6:30 pm, developing chest pain at 7:30 pm. He was admitted to the hospital with an acute myocardial infarction (by electrocardiogram and cardiac enzymes) and was treated medically. Subsequent cardiac catheterization demonstrated normal coronary arteries.     ARMS No. 11144--A 28-year-old man used an ephedrine alkaloid- containing product for 10 months (1 capsule per day) for energy. His father found him bloody and responding inappropriately. In the emergency department, his blood pressure was 168/90, with a pulse of 116. Results of extensive clinical and laboratory evaluations were all within normal limits. He was diagnosed with syncope and a closed head injury. His neurologist concluded that ``most likely he had a seizure secondary to ephedrine'' from the health food substance he was taking. He was advised to avoid the product and dispose of it. This man was on no other medications and had no significant past medical history. In particular, he never had problems with dizziness or passing out.     ARMS No. 10974--A 19-year-old woman took an ephedrine alkaloid- containing product, one before each meal, three times per day (\1/2\ of recommended amount) for 1 month, for weight loss. Her family witnessed seizure activity at mealtime and took her to the emergency room. Evaluations there were essentially normal (CT scan of the head and electroencephalogram or EEG). The neurologist's evaluation found no other risk factors for seizure. No other products had been used, and there was no significant past medical history.     ARMS No. 10088--A 38-year-old female took two products containing ephedrine alkaloids for 4 days, and she developed syncope (light- headedness) and an extremely elevated blood pressure, measured at 180/ 110. She was seen in the emergency department with severe headache, nausea, and sweating. The consumer had been seen every 3 to 4 months for the 5 years before this event and had no history of high blood pressure. After stopping the products, her blood pressure returned to normal.     ARMS No. 10919--A 49-year-old woman used an ephedrine alkaloid- containing product, 3 capsules three times daily for 3 weeks for weight loss. She developed weakness, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, and palpitations and went to the emergency room, where she was found to have vertigo (type of dizziness), serous otitis media (middle ear inflammation) bilaterally, hypertension (150/102), and elevated liver enzymes. The consumer reported that when she stopped the product, her blood pressure returned to normal without any medical treatment. She did not have a history of high blood pressure.     ARMS No. 10946--A 42-year-old female used an ephedrine alkaloid- containing product, 1 capsule twice daily for 3 days for weight loss. She was also taking vitamin B<INF>12</INF> and an antioxidant supplement. She developed a rash over her entire body and stopped all three products. She restarted the ephedrine alkaloid-containing product 3 days after the onset of her rash. Three days later, on a visit to her doctor for a nonproductive cough and congestion, she was found to be seriously hypertensive (170/114). She had no history of hypertension and had been seen by her gynecologist 1 week before starting the ephedrine alkaloid-containing product, where a normal blood pressure (120/78) was documented. 2. The Patterns of the Signs and Symptoms of Adverse Events Associated With Ephedrine Alkaloid-Containing Dietary Supplements Are Consistent With the Available Scientific Evidence and Known Physiologic and Pharmacologic Effects of Ephedrine Alkaloids     The observed CVS and NS effects associated with use of ephedrine alkaloid-containing dietary supplements are consistent with the known pharmacologic and physiologic effects of ephedrine alkaloids. Because there is a general paucity of scientific data or other information on the physiologic or pharmacologic properties of ephedrine alkaloids from botanical sources, and particularly from marketed dietary supplement products, FDA reviewed other available evidence on ephedrine and other ephedrine alkaloids for information on their effects. This evidence included data from clinical and animal studies in support of drugs containing a single, synthetic ephedrine alkaloid in a well-defined and characterized product, case reports from the literature of adverse events with ephedrine alkaloid-containing products, and traditional medical uses of ephedrine alkaloid-containing botanicals.     Although there may be some differences in the pharmacokinetic properties of synthetic ephedrine alkaloids used in drug products as compared to the botanical sources of these alkaloids as used in dietary supplements (e.g., differences in enantiomer forms, dissolution, absorption, and bioavailability or differences that result from interactions with other components of the botanical), given that once absorbed, the botanical and synthetic sources of ephedrine alkaloids undergo similar metabolic processes (Refs. 24 and 43), the agency considered it appropriate to rely on evidence from pharmaceutical sources of single ephedrine alkaloids in assessing the effects of botanical sources. This judgment is supported by   Page 30686   the fact that adverse events reported for dietary supplements containing ephedrine alkaloids from botanical sources are similar to those that are reported in the literature for drugs containing an ephedrine alkaloid from synthetic sources. FDA's Working Group agreed that evidence on synthetic sources of ephedrine alkaloids could be considered in evaluating botanical sources (Ref. 27).     Ephedrine and its related alkaloids are known to elicit physiological responses similar to catecholamines (i.e., groups of chemically related neurotransmitters, such as epinephrine, norepinephrine, and dopamine) that have stimulant effects on the sympathetic nervous system and thus are classified as sympathomimetic agents (i.e., agents stimulating the sympathetic nervous system) (Refs. 7, 9 through 13, and 44 through 48). Ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, and norephedrine are naturally occurring sympathomimetic amines in some botanicals. Ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, and norephedrine each have varying effects because of interaction with specific receptors in the human body (i.e., alpha, beta-1, and beta-2 adrenergic receptors) (Refs. 9 through 13). (Table 2 summarizes some of the major receptor effects, and Table 3 summarizes the adrenergic activity of ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, phenylpropanolamine (dl-norephedrine), and norepinephrine.) Some of the physiological roles of alpha receptors are central NS stimulation, vasoconstriction (i.e., narrowing of blood vessels), uterine contraction, centrally mediated cardiovascular depression, and decreased insulin secretion. Alpha receptors also have an effect on the urinary bladder, which can result in urinary retention. The major physiological roles of beta receptors include cardiac (i.e., heart) stimulation and bronchodilation (enlargement of the bronchial or breathing tube secondary to relaxation of bronchial smooth muscle).

For example, ephedrine increases arterial blood pressure in humans both by peripheral vasoconstriction (narrowing of the blood vessels in the periphery of the body) and by cardiac stimulation, resulting in increased heart rate and cardiac output. The magnitude of these cardiovascular responses can vary on an individual basis and may be dependent on a number of factors, including genetic characteristics, a history of certain diseases or conditions, or the use of certain medications. Other actions of ephedrine include stimulation of oxygen uptake and thermogenesis (heat or energy production). Pseudoephedrine is less potent than ephedrine both in its bronchodilatory and vasopressor effects (i.e., effect of elevating blood pressure). It produces about one half the   Page 30687   bronchodilation and one quarter of the vasopressor effects of ephedrine (Refs. 9 and 13).     a. Physiologic and pharmacologic evidence: cardiovascular effects of ephedrine alkaloids. The adverse events involving the CVS reported to FDA that are associated with dietary supplements containing ephedrine alkaloids are consistent with the known effects of sympathomimetic agents on the CVS. Cardiovascular effects resulting from the use of sympathomimetic agents are well documented in the literature (Refs. 49 through 52). For example, use of ephedrine has been reported to interfere with the regulation of serum potassium levels (Refs. 53 through 55) and thus may predispose certain individuals to cardiac dysrhythmias (i.e., abnormal heart rhythms) (Refs. 18 and 56); myocardial ischemia (i.e., inadequate circulation of blood and oxygen to the heart muscle); and infarction (i.e., death or damage of heart cells, also called heart attack) (Refs. 57 through 61). Cardiac damage has also been reported with the use of pseudoephedrine and phenylpropanolamine (norephedrine) (Refs. 16, 56, 60, and 62 through 64). Results of several studies on blood pressure effects with the use of ephedrine alkaloids have indicated that individuals with hypertension may be at greater risk of blood pressure elevations with the use of ephedrine (reviewed in (Ref. 64)).     The signs and symptoms observed in the AER's are consistent with the available scientific literature on the effects of ephedrine alkaloids. Serious cardiovascular adverse events are the major cause of death reported in the AER's with the use of ephedrine alkaloid- containing products and primarily involve ischemia (inadequate blood flow) which can cause heart attacks and strokes. These events have occurred in asymptomatic, otherwise healthy young adults with normal coronary or cerebral blood vessels (Ref. 25), a finding also noted with pharmaceutical preparations of ephedrine alkaloids (Refs. 60, 61, and 65), where vasospasm with subsequent ischemia is a proposed mechanism of tissue injury. Besides causing damage by affecting blood flow, sympathomimetic agents, such as ephedrine, can damage the heart and other tissues or organs by other mechanisms. Cardiomyopathy (i.e., disease of the heart muscle) related to catecholamine mediated cytotoxicity (cell damage) has been reported with chronic use of ephedrine alkaloids (durations of use generally at or above the recommended dose that occur over many months or years) (Refs. 62 and 66 through 68). Fatal cardiomyopathies have also been reported with chronic use of ephedrine alkaloid-containing dietary supplements (ARMS No. 11134 in Ref. 149a).     Ephedrine and pseudoephedrine have been implicated also in stroke secondary to intracranial (i.e., inside the brain) and subarachnoid (i.e., underneath the membrane that covers the brain and spinal cord) hemorrhage and vasculitis (i.e., inflammation of blood vessels), as well as in ischemic strokes (Refs. 9 and 69 through 71), particularly when used in combinations with phenylpropanolamine (norephedrine) or caffeine (Refs. 65 and 72 through 78) or in the presence of monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOI) (Ref. 72). These effects are noted to be similar to the necrotizing angiitis (severe inflammation with destruction of the blood vessels) seen in chronic amphetamine abuse (Refs. 16, 74, and 77 through 79).     b. Physiologic and pharmacologic evidence: NS effects of ephedrine alkaloids. The adverse events involving the NS reported to FDA that are associated with dietary supplements containing ephedrine alkaloids are consistent with the known effects of sympathomimetic agents on the NS. These effects, such as seizure (Refs. 63, 65, and 80), psychosis, and mania (Refs. 81 through 99), have been reported with the use and the abuse of ephedrine alkaloids. More recently, a case report in the scientific literature reported ephedrine-induced mania associated with the use of a botanical dietary supplement (Ref. 100).     Neuropsychiatric effects reported in AER's related to ephedrine alkaloid-containing dietary supplements also are consistent with the known physiologic and pharmacologic actions of ephedrine alkaloids documented in the scientific literature. Mania and psychosis have occurred in individuals without identifiable risk factors who have used these products, as well as in people who used them who had possible predisposing factors, such as a personal history of mood disorders (i.e., depression or manic depression), a family history of manic depression, or concurrent use of products that increase sensitivity of an individual to the effects of ephedrine alkaloids (see Table 4). AER's noting neuropsychiatric adverse effects in persons using non-MAOI antidepressant drugs concurrently with dietary supplements containing ephedrine alkaloids are consistent with a report of the serotonin syndrome associated with the concurrent use of serotonin reuptake inhibitors (a new class of antidepressant drugs) and OTC cold remedies containing pseudoephedrine (Ref. 101).

Variability in individual responses to ephedrine alkaloids. The unpredictability of individual responses to ephedrine alkaloid- containing dietary supplement products, as reported in AER's, is also consistent with what is known about the physiological and pharmacological properties of these alkaloids (Refs. 7, 10 through 12, 39 through 41, and 48). Individual variability in the effects of ephedrine has been reported in several clinical investigations (Refs. 5 and 102 through 104). The marked sensitivity of some individuals to the effects of ephedrine has been recognized in the Western scientific literature almost from the time that ephedrine was introduced as a   Page 30688   therapeutic agent in the mid-1920's (Refs. 5 and 102). Two early studies by different investigators recommended a 10 mg initial oral test dose to assess the individual's sensitivity to sources of ephedrine (Refs. 5 and 102).     Factors that appear to influence individual susceptibility to sympathomimetic agents are diverse (see Table 4) and are not yet well defined by biological bases. These factors include genetics, particularly those genes controlling metabolic functions; receptor numbers and types; gender; age; and certain physiological states or disease conditions (reviewed in Refs. 39 through 42). In addition, the dosage and duration of use may influence the effects seen with ephedrine alkaloids, as tachyphylaxis (i.e., decrease or diminution of some effect) is known to occur with chronic use of these agents (i.e., there are decreases in certain effects with chronic use that are thought to be due to occupation of all adrenergic receptor sites; discontinuation of ephedrines for a few days results in receptor availability and receptor mediated effects). An example of tachyphylaxis could be tremor or insomnia, which occurs soon after starting ephedrine alkaloid-containing products but which may resolve in certain individuals with continued use of ephedrine alkaloids.     d. Clinical trials using ephedrine in the treatment of obesity. Although many dietary supplements containing ephedrine alkaloids are marketed for weight loss or energy purposes, there is a paucity of meaningful data on the safe use of these products for this purpose.     A number of controlled clinical trials reported in the scientific literature evaluated the effects of pharmaceutical preparations of ephedrine, either singly or combined with caffeine or aspirin, on weight loss in the treatment of obesity (Refs. 105 through 119). While the primary purpose of these trials was to evaluate efficacy of ephedrine for purposes of weight loss in grossly obese individuals, these clinical trials also document that clinically significant adverse effects can occur in populations with no known risk factors with the use of ephedrine, and that synergistic adverse effects can result when ephedrine and caffeine are combined. The patterns and types of the adverse effects reported in these trials are consistent with the known effects of sympathomimetic agents, that is, they mainly involved NS and CVS effects. A summary of these studies follows. (In this document, the agency makes no evaluation or judgment of the effectiveness of the use of ephedrine in the treatment of obesity.)     A Danish group of researchers investigated the usefulness of ephedrine and caffeine alone and in combination for the treatment of obesity (Refs. 105, 106, and 112). One hundred and eighty subjects were randomized to one of four treatment groups: (1) Ephedrine--20 mg, (2) ephedrine--20 mg and caffeine--200 mg, (3) caffeine--200 mg, and (4) placebo control. The treatments were administered three times a day for 24 weeks in conjunction with a defined low calorie diet. One hundred and forty-one individuals completed the trial. Subject withdrawals were reported to be equally distributed across the four groups with no statistical differences among the groups. More side effects were noted in the treatment groups compared to the placebo control group in both those subjects continuing in, and those withdrawing from, the trial. Study results showed that 60 percent of the ephedrine and caffeine treatment group, 44 percent of the ephedrine treatment group, and 36 percent of the caffeine treatment group experienced side effects compared to 24 percent of the placebo control group. These results were statistically significant (p<0.05) (Ref. 105). This study showed that there was a possibility of rebound symptoms (symptoms occurring as a consequence of withdrawal of an agent, especially headache and fatigue) once the treatment was stopped. Rebound symptoms were seen most in the ephedrine and caffeine treatment group but also occurred in the ephedrine alone group (Refs. 105 and 106).     Astrup et al. enrolled 127 of the subjects completing the above clinical trial into an open label study where all subjects received the same treatment (diet and ephedrine plus caffeine) for 24 weeks (Refs. 106 through 108). Five of the 38 subjects that withdrew or dropped out of this study did so because they experienced adverse drug reactions (NS and CVS effects). Adverse drug reactions occurred in 102 subjects during weeks 1 through 24 of the open trial. Most symptoms (75 percent) started during the first 4 weeks of treatment and lasted about 4 weeks. Symptoms related to the CVS were primarily palpitations and tachycardia. The most frequent NS symptoms were tremor, agitation, insomnia, increased sweating, and nervousness.     Breum et al., in another clinical trial in which the effects of ephedrine plus caffeine (EC) were evaluated, conducted a randomized, double blind, controlled 15 week clinical trial comparing the effects of EC to that of dexfenfluramine (DF), a serotoninergic agonist, in the treatment of obesity (Ref. 113). Fifty four percent of the subjects in the EC group compared to 43 percent of the DF group experienced adverse reactions. The majority of these occurred within the first 4 weeks. At week one, 38 percent of the EC group subjects experienced adverse drug reactions compared to 30 percent in the DF group. NS effects (particularly insomnia and agitation) were statistically increased (p < 0.05) in the EC treatment group (46 percent) compared to the DF group (26 percent), whereas gastrointestinal adverse effects were significantly increased in the DF group. Eight percent of the EC group reported cardiovascular symptoms. All symptoms remitted after cessation of the trial drugs.     The above studies demonstrate that adverse effects can occur with the use of ephedrine in the treatment of obesity even in carefully designed and conducted, physician-monitored clinical trials and even in persons prescreened to be in good health, free of known risk factors, and not using medications or other products known to adversely interact with ephedrine-like drugs. Furthermore, the study population of obese individuals is recognized to be less sensitive to the effects of sympathomimetic agents than the general population (Ref. 120). Certain of these studies also evidence that there is an increased frequency of adverse effects occurring in lean subjects, secondary to sympathetic stimulation, compared to obese subjects that is unrelated to dose per body weight (Ref. 119). Thus, these studies suggest that the general population may be more sensitive to the effects of ephedrine alkaloids than the obese population.     There are a number of recognized limitations inherent in these published trials, including those associated with study design, methods, and conduct (e.g., small number of subjects enrolled in these trials, narrow targeted populations, short evaluation periods, and selective presentation of data are among the concerns) as are the multiple publications of the same data. Yet despite these factors, the adverse effects observed in these studies remain a cause for concern, although these factors make it difficult to identify subpopulations that may be particularly sensitive to the effects of ephedrine or to identify adverse effects that occur infrequently. These studies were carefully monitored, so that subjects were withdrawn from the study when adverse effects became evident. Therefore, although the observed adverse effects in these studies were not as severe or as serious as some observed with dietary supplement use (e.g., heart attacks, seizures, strokes), they are indicative of the potential for   Page 30689   greater risk with continued use. Moreover, their occurrence is remarkable given the careful prescreening of study subjects such that high risk persons were not included in the study.     The greatest limitation, however, is that these studies were designed to evaluate the effectiveness of ephedrine in the treatment of obesity. They were not designed to test the safety of the use of ephedrine in the obese, or any other population (Ref. 121), or to test its safety under the conditions under which marketed dietary supplements containing sources of ephedrine alkaloids are used. Therefore, these study results cannot be used to definitively demonstrate safety, or the lack of safety, of ephedrine alkaloid- containing supplements for use by the general population. Nonetheless, despite the shortcomings of these studies, the results raise serious concerns about the safety of using ephedrine, from any source, including dietary supplements, in both obese individuals and the general public in nonmedically monitored situations.     e. Other physiologic and pharmacologic effects. Some of the adverse events reported to FDA that were unrelated to the CVS and NS also bear a recognized relationship to the known physiologic and pharmacologic effects of ephedrine alkaloids. For example, urinary retention, particularly in males with no history of prostatic hypertrophy (enlargement of the prostate gland), has been associated with the use of ephedrine (Refs. 102, 103, and 122 through 124). Urinary retention has a well recognized relationship with urinary tract infections, which have been reported to FDA with the use of products containing ephedrine alkaloids. Myopathy (disease of muscle), besides being reported for the heart (Refs. 62 and 66 through 68), is also recognized to involve skeletal muscles and may result in acute renal failure (Ref. 125). Certain gastrointestinal adverse effects, including impaired colonic motility and ischemic colitis, have been associated with the usage of amphetamines (Refs. 102 and 126). Similarly, ischemic colitis has also been reported with the usage of a long-acting decongestant containing pseudoephedrine (Ref. 127). Additionally, acute hepatitis (inflammation in the liver) has been associated with the use of a Chinese medicinal product containing Ma huang (Ref. 128).     Other types of adverse effects, such as the reports of dermatologic reactions, while not known to be related to the recognized physiologic or pharmacologic effects of ephedrine alkaloids, are consistent with adverse effects reported in published case reports. For example, there are more than 11 published case reports, at least 12 patients, of systemic dermatologic reactions, including rashes occurring in a particular distribution on the body, contact dermatitis (inflammation of the skin resulting usually from local contact with a substance), a toxic shock-like syndrome, angioedema (extreme swelling of tissues and structures of the body secondary to leaking of fluids from capillaries (small blood vessels)), and erythematous (reddish) rash and subsequent desquamation (loss of part of the skin surface) that occurred with the use of ephedrine or pseudoephedrine (Refs. 114 and 129 through 138).     Concerns about toxicity to the fetus with maternal exposure to ephedrine alkaloids during pregnancy remain unresolved. Increased fetal heart rate has been associated with maternal use of pseudoephedrine (Ref. 139). In addition, the administration of intramuscular ephedrine to treat maternal hypotension has been associated with increases in fetal heart rate and beat-to-beat variability (cited in Ref. 139). Certain animal studies also raise concern about potential teratogenic effects that may be caused by the use of ephedrine during pregnancy (Refs. 140 through 143). Potential toxicity for a breast-fed infant whose mother is using a dietary supplement containing ephedrine alkaloids is unknown, but toxicity has been reported in a breast-fed infant whose mother had been taking a long-acting oral decongestant containing d-isoephedrine for the relief of allergy symptoms (Ref. 144).     Little is known about the potential consequences of long term use of ephedrine alkaloids, other than the risk of cardiomyopathy as stated above. Park et al., however, recently implicated <greek-b>-adrenergic agents like ephedrine in the etiology of a type of lung cancer, particularly in persons simultaneously exposed to carcinogenic environmental factors such as smoking (Ref. 145). This report indicates the need for long-term followup to adequately assess the risks associated with product use, as well as the importance of particular group characteristics (e.g., smoking status) in evaluating risk.     f. Traditional uses of botanical sources of ephedrine alkaloids: adverse effects. In the traditional medicinal use of Ephedra, the raw botanical was administered, either alone or more commonly combined with other specific botanicals, in the form of a water infusion (tea), three times a day. Traditional treatment was prescribed by a trained health practitioner based on the evaluation of a particular patient and was predominately for short term use. Commonly used dosages of the raw botanical ranged from 1.5 to 9 grams (g), generally averaging 5 to 6 g of Ephedra per dose (Refs. 14 and 146). Tyler has estimated that a tea made from 2 g of the raw botanical Ephedra (containing 1.25 percent ephedrine) will yield a dose of 15 to 30 mg ephedrine (cited in Ref. 147). Thus, use of 5 to 6 g of the raw botanical Ephedra, an average amount used in a tea could yield a dose of ephedrine ranging from approximately 38 mg to 75 mg.     FDA has no knowledge of any systematic collection of morbidity and mortality data on individuals treated with Ephedra in traditional medicine. Ephedra was historically considered a medium or middle class herb, meaning that recognized toxicities could be associated with its use (Refs. 14, 146, and 148). Several reference texts, in fact, list precautions and contraindications for the use of the botanical Ephedra in traditional medicinal preparations (Refs. 14 and 146). Another reference warns against overdosage (Ref. 25).     While there is a paucity of data in the scientific literature on the safety of the use of Ephedra, several scientific references report adverse effects associated with the use of Ephedra. One early study in the United States reported two cases of urinary retention in men aged 56 and 65 years. These men all noted bladder pain and difficulty in voiding which developed after one to three doses of a fluid extract of Ephedra. The symptoms resolved after the use of the extract was discontinued. More recently, a published case report notes the occurrence of erythroderma associated with the use of an herbal product containing Ma huang which was obtained from a Chinese herbalist for the relief of cold-like symptoms (Ref. 138). The woman who was the subject of this report had a history of similar episodes following usage of OTC cold preparations containing ephedrine alkaloids. These references document that adverse effects occurred with the traditional use of Ephedra, and that these effects are consistent with effects occurring with modern pharmaceutical preparations of synthetic ephedrine. 3. The Relationship is Temporally Correct     One possible source of serious error in evaluating observational data, such as that found in FDA's postmarketing surveillance system, is the potential for inappropriately assuming that a cause and effect relationship exists between a   Page 30690   particular exposure and a particular adverse event without evaluating the true relationship of the adverse event to the exposure. Unless there are data that ensure that there is the correct temporal relationship between exposure and effect (i.e., that the adverse effects follow exposure), there is a potential for serious misinterpretation of data. To evaluate this potential source of serious error, FDA evaluated the AER's to determine whether there was clear evidence of the correct temporal sequence having occurred. FDA found evidence of the correct relationship in the AER's that it received (see, e.g., ARMS Nos. 10088, 8475, 9747, and 11112).     Further support that the temporal relationship is correct can be found in clinical studies that described the pharmacological and physiological effects of different ephedrine alkaloids and in the clinical trials with obese subjects. 4. There is Other Evidence, Even in the Absence of Controlled Trials, Such as Evidence of Dechallenge That Suggests a Causal Relationship Between the Use of Ephedrine Alkaloid-Containing Dietary Supplements and Adverse Events     Causality is most readily demonstrated in well-designed and conducted clinical trials, in which the multiple factors that may influence study results and interpretations can be controlled. However, evidence of causality can be inferred from observational studies, including individual case reports, particularly where there is evidence of positive dechallenge and rechallenge, that is, where, when the consumer stopped using the product, the signs and symptoms resolved or improved, and when the consumer began using the product again, the symptoms reoccurred. Although many of the AER's did not provide enough information to adequately evaluate these questions, over 26 percent of AER's provided information suggesting successful dechallenge, and 4 percent of reports provided information of rechallenge, suggesting that the product was the direct cause of the adverse event. A number of the previously described cases are particularly good examples of positive dechallenge in that symptoms resolved spontaneously on cessation of use of the product without medical treatment (see Arms Nos. 10088, 11065, and 11112 in the Appendix to this document).     Furthermore, some specific AER's suggest that a pattern of starting and stopping use of dietary supplements containing ephedrine alkaloids may increase an individual's susceptibility to experiencing adverse events as has been suggested in reviews of adverse events occurring with the use of phenylpropanolamine (Ref. 73). One case described above, ARMS No. 9552, in which a woman suffered a heart attack soon after she restarted using an ephedrine alkaloid-containing product, may be an example of such increased sensitivity.     Thus, FDA tentatively concludes that there is evidence of dechallenge and rechallenge from the AER's that supports a causal relationship between the ingestion of ephedrine alkaloids and the types of CVS and NS and other effects observed with use of the ephedrine alkaloid-containing dietary supplement products. Additional support for this conclusion is also provided in the published clinical trials in the treatment of obesity described above. 5. A Biologically Plausible Explanation for the Adverse Events     Considering the totality of the available information, FDA tentatively concludes that the available evidence strongly supports that the adverse effects that are occurring with the use of dietary supplements containing ephedrine alkaloids are caused by the ephedrine alkaloids. This tentative conclusion derives from the previous discussions in this document. The observed adverse effects predominately involve the CVS and NS and are consistent with the known physiological and pharmacological effects of ephedrine alkaloids noted in medical/pharmacological texts. Furthermore, similar patterns of CVS and NS effects have been documented both in anecdotal reports in the scientific literature and in the published results of controlled clinical trials using pharmaceutical preparations of various ephedrine alkaloids. The available data further suggest that these types of adverse events should be anticipated and expected with the use of ephedrine alkaloid-containing products by the general population.   D. Additional Concerns       The agency is aware of a number of factors related to currently marketed dietary supplements that may contribute to the likelihood of adverse events but that the available data are inadequate to evaluate fully. These factors weighed heavily on the minds of many members of the Food Advisory Committee as they discussed the public health concerns associated with the use of these products. These factors include:     (1) The size of the population that is susceptible to experiencing adverse events with the use of ephedrine alkaloids, because there are neither good data on the number and pattern of supplement users in the United States nor good data on the full range of characteristics that cause or increase risk. Nonetheless, the potential population at risk is quite large if one considers the following likely risk factors:     (a) The large number of persons who have diseases or conditions, or who are at risk for such conditions, for whom the use of ephedrine alkaloid-containing dietary supplements is inappropriate (Table 5).                       Table 5.--Identifiable At Risk Population With Use of Ephedrine Alkaloids ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                  Estimated number of affected persons in the United States (in             Disease or condition                                           millions) ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Cardiovascular disease......................  50 (Ref. 158).

These variables include gender, age, genetics, certain physiologic states, and the use of certain products (e.g., foods and drugs) (Ref. 25).     (2) The potential for interactive and unpredictable effects from the mixture of ephedrine alkaloids found in botanical sources, which may serve to increase the likelihood, frequency, or severity of an adverse event. Unlike drugs which contain only a single, well- characterized ephedrine alkaloid, botanical sources contain a mixture of these alkaloids. The potential for interactive effects among these alkaloids is likely but largely unknown (Ref. 25).     (3) The potential for other ingredients in the dietary supplement products to interact with the ephedrine alkaloids to increase the likelihood or severity of an adverse event (Ref. 25).     (4) The natural or formulation variations in levels and relative proportions of the ephedrine alkaloids in marketed dietary supplement products and the resultant risk for persons who can tolerate one level or mixture but who unknowingly are exposed to different levels or mixtures because they change brands, or because the composition of the brand that they typically use is altered (Ref. 25).     (5) The formulations of the products themselves (including the numbers, types, and forms of ingredients used in the product and the form of the final product) may influence the likelihood, frequency, or severity of adverse effects because product characteristics may influence dissolution, absorption, bioavailability, and metabolism of active and inactive ingredients in the product and thus influence the effects of the product (Ref. 25).   E. General Summary and Tentative Conclusions       FDA has received more than 800 AER's involving more than 100 dietary supplement products. Among these products the most common and consistent finding is the presence of ephedrine alkaloids. The products associated with these adverse events are marketed in diverse formulations and for a variety of uses.     Sympathetic nervous system and cardiovascular system stimulant effects account for the majority of the reported adverse events associated with dietary supplements containing ephedrine alkaloids. These effects include heart attack, stroke, seizure, chest pain, psychosis, anxiety, nervousness, tremor, and hyperactivity (Refs. 25 and 27). The type and patterns of these adverse effects are consistent with the CVS and NS effects known and expected to occur with the use of sympathomimetic agents, such as the ephedrine alkaloids. The known physiological and pharmacological activities of ephedrine alkaloids and the adverse events that have occurred in controlled clinical trials using ephedrine corroborate this conclusion. The biological plausibility of these types of adverse events occurring with the use of ephedrine alkaloids, the temporal relationship between the use of the dietary supplements and the onset of the adverse events, and the evidence of dechallenge and rechallenge also support a causal relationship between the use of ephedrine alkaloid-containing products and subsequent adverse events.     Both the Working Group and the Food Advisory Committee reviewed the available data and information on the occurrence of adverse events associated with the use of dietary supplements containing ephedrine alkaloids in certain individuals. The Working Group was specifically asked whether the available information contains sufficient evidence to demonstrate that the use of dietary supplements containing ephedrine alkaloids may cause consumers to experience serious adverse events. The Working Group concluded that it was. Although not asked this question, those members of the Food Advisory Committee who addressed the question agreed with the Working Groups's conclusion.     Thus, FDA tentatively concludes that there is a consistent, large, and growing body of evidence that establishes a causal association between the use of ephedrine alkaloids and subsequent adverse events. The agency also tentatively concludes that the use of ephedrine alkaloid-containing dietary supplements is associated with a serious and significant public health concern because of the nature of the adverse events and the size of the population at risk.   III. The Proposed Regulation   A. The Scope of This Proposal       This proposal applies to dietary supplements containing one or more ephedrine alkaloids and related alkaloids, including those from the botanical species Ephedra sinica Stapf, Ephedra equistestina Bunge, Ephedra intermedia var., tibetica Stapf, Ephedra distachya L., and Sida cordifolia or their extracts.     Conventional food products that contain ephedrine alkaloids, including snack bars, cookies, and beverages, are not covered by this proposal. Conventional food products are subject to section 409 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act) (21 U.S.C. 348) and, given the adverse events associated with the use of ephedrine alkaloids, these substances are unapproved food additives when used in conventional foods.     Use of botanical sources of ephedrine alkaloids in traditional herbal therapies is beyond the scope of this proposal. Although several Ephedra species (including those considered as Ma huang) have been reported to have a long history of use in traditional Asian medicine for the treatment of the symptoms of colds, to relieve respiratory symptoms, and to regulate water metabolism (Refs. 4, 6, 14, and 146), products bearing claims evidencing that they are intended for therapeutic use are regulated as drugs under the act.     This proposal also does not cover OTC or prescription drugs that contain ephedrine alkaloids. Ephedrine is approved as an active ingredient in oral OTC bronchodilator drugs for use in the treatment of medically diagnosed mild asthma (21 CFR 341.76). However, in the Federal Register of July 27, 1995 (60 F.R. 38643), FDA proposed to amend the final monograph for OTC bronchodilator drug products to remove the ingredients ephedrine, ephedrine hydrochloride, ephedrine sulfate, and racephedrine hydrochloride and to classify these ingredients as not generally recognized as safe and effective for OTC use.     FDA issued the proposal to amend the final monograph for OTC bronchodilator products in response to a request from the U.S. Department of Justice, Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), to restrict OTC availability of ephedrine because of its illicit use as the primary precursor in the synthesis of the controlled substances methamphetamine and methylcathinone. The agency also issued the proposal because of new information that showed that misuse and abuse of OTC ephedrine drug products can cause potential harm, and because of comments made by FDA's Pulmonary-Allergy Drugs Advisory Committee and the Nonprescription Drugs Advisory Committee. FDA is currently evaluating public comments to that proposal and will be addressing this subject in a future issue of the Federal Register.   Page 30692   B. Rationale for the Proposal       It is incumbent upon the agency to respond to the concerns raised by the number, seriousness, and pattern of adverse events associated with the use of ephedrine alkaloid-containing dietary supplements. Given the AER's, the case reports in the scientific literature, controlled clinical trials, published reports of adverse effects with traditional uses of ephedrine alkaloid-containing botanicals, and other data, it is apparent that there are serious and well-documented public health risks attendant to the use of ephedrine alkaloids in marketed dietary supplement products, and that the agency needs to propose actions to address these risks.     Over the years, FDA has employed a variety of strategies in addressing food ingredients that created significant public health risks. In cases where small subpopulations have faced serious, even potentially deadly, risks because of ingredients with allergic potential (e.g., nuts and shellfish), FDA has required that the presence of the allergen be declared on the food label so that consumers who are at risk can avoid products that contain the problem ingredient (Sec. 101.4 (21 CFR 101.4)). In other cases where a food or food ingredient has presented special health risks to consumers under certain use conditions, the agency has required warning label statements to ensure that consumers are alerted to the potential health hazards associated with use of the product. For example, FDA has required a special warning statement to appear on the label of protein products intended for use in weight reduction, stating in part that very low calorie protein diets may cause serious illness or death (Sec. 101.17(d) (21 CFR 101.17(d))). In other cases, e.g., the proposed regulations for poisonings in young children because of high intakes of iron-containing dietary supplements, the agency was concerned that, for high potency products, warning labels alone would not be effective in preventing serious harm. Therefore, the agency has decided to require, at least in some cases, warning labels plus special packaging requirements to reduce the risk of serious harm (Ref. 150).     In other cases, where a substance contained in a food may be harmful to health, it has been the agency's policy to define a level at which the harmful substance may render the food adulterated. For example, to address the public health problem of histamine poisoning associated with the consumption of certain fish, the agency issued guidance on the level of histamine at which FDA is likely to take action against the fish because it is adulterated (Ref. 151). Moreover, in Sec. 109.4(b) (21 CFR 109.4(b)), the agency has said that it will establish regulatory limits that represent the level at which an added poisonous or deleterious substance adulterates a food within the meaning of section 402(a)(1) of the act (21 U.S.C. 342(a)(1)).     The agency has attempted to be flexible and practical in tailoring its strategy for dealing with public health risks, taking into account the nature and type of the risk and the potential effectiveness of various alternative approaches. In the case of ephedrine alkaloids in dietary supplements, there are many factors and underlying etiologies that can influence individual sensitivity to these substances. Some of these factors are easily identified or readily controlled; many are not. Factors that are known to influence the likelihood, frequency, and severity of adverse events associated with the use of sympathomimetic agents, including ephedrine alkaloids, include genetics, age (e.g., children and the elderly are at increased risk), preexisting conditions (e.g., kidney disease, heart disease, hypertension, diabetes, thyroid disease, glaucoma, and enlarged prostate), pregnancy, concurrent use of medications (e.g., MAOI, methyldopa), or excessive consumption (see Table 4) (Refs. 39 through 42, 152, and 153). Other factors that may increase an individual's susceptibility to experience adverse events with the use of ephedrine alkaloids include exercise, body size (i.e., lean and normal weight individuals appear to be more susceptible than obese individuals), and dietary intake (i.e., severe caloric and fluid restrictions increase the likelihood of adverse events) (Refs. 39, 42, 119, and 154 through 156).     Significantly, however, many adverse events associated with ephedrine alkaloid-containing dietary supplements occur in individuals who have no apparent risk factors, or who are unaware that they are at risk. Additionally, approximately 40 percent of the reported adverse events occur with the first use or within 1 week of first use, providing little or no warning to consumers of potential risk (see Figure 3). The agency tentatively concludes, therefore, that neither disclosure of the presence of ephedrine alkaloids on the product label nor the use of a warning statement, alone, will be sufficient to protect consumers because many individuals are not aware, and are unable to determine, that they are at risk from consuming ephedrine alkaloids, and serious adverse events may occur on the first use or with very short-term use.     Therefore, the agency has tentatively determined that several measures are needed if the observed adverse events associated with the use of ephedrine alkaloid-containing dietary supplements are to be effectively addressed. These measures are discussed below.   C. Proposal for Dietary Supplements Containing Ephedrine Alkaloids   1. Dietary Ingredient Limit for Ephedrine Alkaloids: Per Serving Basis     One possible strategy for addressing the significant number of adverse effects associated with ephedrine alkaloids in dietary supplements is to restrict the level of the ephedrine alkaloids in these products. In considering this possibility, FDA evaluated two issues: (a) Is there a level at which ephedrine alkaloids cause safety concerns; and (b) if there is, will restricting dietary supplements from containing ephedrine alkaloids at or above that level be adequate, alone, to protect the public health, or will additional steps be necessary.     In considering these questions, FDA evaluated the evidence that provides information on the adverse effects of ephedrine alkaloids that is most relevant to the uses and formulations of marketed dietary supplement products: (a) The published findings from the clinical studies investigating the use of ephedrine for weight loss for the treatment of obesity, and (b) the numerous AER's associated with the consumption of dietary supplements containing ephedrine alkaloids.     First, the agency reviewed clinical trials that have been performed to explore therapeutic uses for ephedrine alone and in combination with other pharmaceutical substances (see earlier discussion in section II.C.2.d. of this document (Refs. 105 through 119)). Information from these trials show that 20 mg ephedrine per dose can cause adverse events to occur in a significant percentage of obese persons (up to 60 percent) prescreened to be free of known risk factors while using these products for a relatively short time (i.e., most adverse events occurred during the first 4 weeks of use). Thus, these studies establish that 20 mg per serving of ephedrine presents potential risks for a subpopulation of morbidly obese persons but provide no information on risk at levels below 20 mg per serving for obese persons. These studies also provide no information on risk at levels below 20 mg per serving for use by persons in the general population (e.g., lean or moderately overweight persons), who are known to be more sensitive to   Page 30693   sympathomimetic substances like ephedrine alkaloids than are the morbidly obese persons who constituted the study population (see section II.C.2.d. of this document). FDA is not aware of any well- designed and conducted studies that evaluate the risks of intakes of ephedrine levels below 20 mg per serving in any population group.     Second, FDA, through its postmarketing surveillance program, has found consistent patterns of adverse events across a broad range of marketed dietary supplement products that contain a variety of ephedrine alkaloid levels per serving. FDA's laboratory analyses of the ephedrine alkaloid levels in the small number of available dietary supplement products that consumers who suffered adverse events turned over to the agency showed that these adverse events were related to ephedrine alkaloid levels from approximately 1 to over 50 mg per serving (Ref. 149). These data, as well as analytical data from samples collected from the marketplace after FDA received AER's from consumers who no longer possessed the product, show a pattern of clinically significant adverse events, including neuropsychiatric effects (e.g., severe depression, seizure), malignant (i.e., extremely high) blood pressure, and myocardial necrosis (i.e., death of the heart muscle) with subsequent cardiac arrest and death, with the use of ephedrine alkaloids at levels approaching and above 10 mg per serving (e.g., seven reports of clinically serious adverse events were associated with products that contained 10 to 15 mg per serving) (Ref. 149a). Clinically significant adverse events were also reported with the use of ephedrine alkaloids at levels that exceeded this range.     FDA has also received a few reports of adverse events, some clinically significant, including tremor, extremely high blood pressure, severe headache, nausea, chest pain, increased heart rate, and insomnia, associated with the use of ephedrine alkaloids at levels below 8 mg (e.g., 2 to 8 mg ephedrine alkaloids per serving) (Ref. 149a). The true clinical significance of these levels of ephedrine alkaloids is difficult to interpret because of the lack of the data (e.g., too few reports with analysis to identify a pattern of clinically serious adverse events at any specific level). Thus, the available information from the AER's and the scientific literature does not provide sufficient data to adequately evaluate risk below approximately 10 mg per serving.     Given the available evidence, it is difficult to ascertain whether there is a threshold level of ephedrine alkaloids below which the general population and susceptible individuals will not experience serious adverse events. The shape of an intake-response curve for any particular adverse effect related to ephedrine alkaloid intakes is not known. In the absence of data that allow a systematic evaluation of intakes of ephedrine and other related alkaloids below 10 mg per serving, it is not possible to adequately define or describe the potential risks and at-risk groups from ephedrine alkaloids. However, the available data, including the AER's and the known physiological and pharmacological effects of ephedrine, provide convincing evidence that clinically serious adverse events will occur at intake levels above 10 mg ephedrine alkaloids per serving.     FDA recognizes, however, that this 10-mg level is also subject to some uncertainty because of such factors as intra-assay variabilities (i.e., difference in analytical results from one run to the next with the same method), natural variabilities in the alkaloid content of botanical ingredients, variations in formulation levels from batch to batch, and inaccuracies in the amounts reported to be taken by consumers. When these sources of variability are considered, given that they are likely to be additive, the range around the 10 mg per serving estimated intake can be expected to deviate by <plus-minus>10 to 20 percent. Thus, FDA tentatively concludes that the life-threatening adverse events associated with the use of ephedrine alkaloids can reasonably be expected to occur at intake levels as low as 8 to 9 mg ephedrine alkaloids per serving. However, given the limitations in the available data, the agency requests comments on whether it is more appropriate to focus on the 10 mg level.     Based on the available evidence and the likely sources of measurement error around estimated intake levels, the agency tentatively concludes that the use of dietary supplements containing 8 mg or more ephedrine alkaloids per serving may render the dietary supplement injurious to health. The agency also tentatively concludes that consumption of dietary supplements that contain this level or more of ephedrine alkaloids presents a significant and unreasonable risk of illness or injury under the conditions of use recommended or suggested in the labeling or under ordinary conditions of use, and that, therefore, products that contain this or higher levels of ephedrine alkaloids are adulterated. \1\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------       \1\ FDA has limited information on which ingredients dietary supplement manufacturers are likely to substitute for ephedrine alkaloids. Given this uncertainty, FDA cannot comment on the safety of potential substitutes. FDA notes that manufacturers bear the burden of ensuring that any ingredients that they may substitute for sources of ephedrine alkaloids meet all safety standards for dietary supplements. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------       To reflect this tentative conclusion, FDA is proposing to adopt Sec. 111.100(a)(1) which states that dietary supplements that contain 8 mg or more ephedrine alkaloids (the total of ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, norpseudoephedrine, norephedrine, methylephedrine, methylpseudoephedrine and related alkaloids) per single serving shall be deemed to be adulterated under section 402(a)(1) and (f)(1)(A) of the act. FDA is proposing to adopt this provision under sections 402(a)(1), (f)(1)(A), and 701(a) (21 U.S.C. 371(a)) of the act.     Under section 402(a)(1) of the act, a food, including a dietary supplement, is adulterated if it bears or contains any added poisonous or deleterious substance that may render it injurious to health. Section 402(f)(1)(A) of the act provides that a dietary supplement is adulterated if it, or one of its ingredients, poses a significant or unreasonable risk of injury or illness when used as directed or under ordinary conditions of use. Under section 701(a) of the act, FDA has authority to issue regulations for the efficient enforcement of the act. These sections authorize FDA to issue a regulation that establishes a level of ephedrine alkaloids that, the available evidence makes clear, will render a dietary supplement adulterated as a matter of law.     FDA tentatively concludes that such a regulation will advance the purposes of the act in two significant ways. First, it will provide guidance to the dietary supplement industry as to a level of ephedrine alkaloids that can be used in their products with some confidence that such products will not be subject to regulatory action. Second, it will make clear that if products that contain higher levels of ephedrine alkaloids are marketed; such products will be considered unsafe and adulterated and will be subject to all the relevant sanctions under the act.     Eight mg per serving and above represent levels at which the presence of ephedrine alkaloids in a dietary supplement may render the product injurious to health and presents a significant and unreasonable risk. FDA cannot say that it is a safe level, nor has   Page 30694   it been arrived at in a way that factored in some margin of safety. The evidence does not exist to establish a safe level. FDA notes that many members of the Food Advisory Committee stated that they were unaware of a basis for determining a safe level (Ref. 25). Thus, the agency is concerned about the potential for risk at levels below 8 mg per serving for individuals who are particularly sensitive to the effects of ephedrine alkaloids, or whose sensitivity could be increased through chronic use of these products or other processes (e.g., physical exercise).     Given the seriousness of the public health concerns and the uncertainty surrounding the risks attendant upon consumption of ephedrine alkaloids below 8 mg per serving, the agency solicits comments, and asks that they include data, particularly clinical data, on the safety of the use of less than 8 mg of ephedrine alkaloids per serving in dietary supplements. Should data and information become available that demonstrate that the use of less than 8 mg of ephedrine alkaloids per serving in dietary supplements poses a hazard to the public health, or that the level of ephedrine alkaloids that will render a product adulterated is higher than 8 mg per serving, the agency will consider modifying Sec. 111.100 accordingly.     At this time, the agency is not proposing a level at which ephedrine, as opposed to the mixture of ephedrine alkaloids found in products containing botanicals, may render a product adulterated, even though some members of FDA's Working Group and of the Food Advisory Committee recommended that the agency establish a separate level for ephedrine (Refs. 25 and 27). There is some reason to believe that ephedrine may be particularly significant in contributing to the occurrence of many of the cardiovascular effects seen in the reports of adverse events because ephedrine is often the predominant alkaloid in botanical sources. In addition, ephedrine is known to exhibit more intense cardiovascular effects relative to the other ephedrine alkaloids (Refs. 5 and 9 through 13). For example, serious adverse events have been reported with the use of dietary supplements containing less than 5 mg ephedrine. However, the available data are difficult to interpret because of the uncertainties about the potentially interactive effects of the other ephedrine alkaloids in the raw botanical or botanical extract and the presence of other physiologically and pharmacologically active ingredients in the dietary supplement products that may act to potentiate the overall NS and CVS stimulatory effects of ephedrine and thus exacerbate the adverse effect. The agency requests comments on whether a separate dietary ingredient limit should be established for ephedrine in addition to ephedrine alkaloids, and if so, what that limit should be. 2. Proposed Compliance Procedures     In proposed Sec. 111.100(a)(2), the agency states that it will use the high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method as specified in LIB No. 4053 to determine the level of ephedrine alkaloids in a dietary supplement. The agency developed this HPLC analytical method to identify and quantify ephedrine alkaloids from botanical sources. It was necessary for the agency to develop an analytical method because the official analytical methods used for the determination of ephedrine alkaloids in pharmaceutical dosage forms are unsuitable for botanical products. Current official analytical methods do not discriminate between ephedrine alkaloids and other alkaloids that may be in the botanicals (e.g., ephedroxane and methylbenzylamine) (Ref. 157). This HPLC method has made possible the resolution and quantification of the several different ephedrine alkaloids known to occur in the Ephedras and other botanicals, including ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, norephedrine, methylephedrine, methylpsuedoephedrine, norpseudoephedrine, and related alkaloids. This method is currently undergoing collaborative evaluation and testing.     FDA strongly recommends that manufacturers also use this or other methods that the agency adopts, although manufacturers will be free to use any alternative method that they find appropriate. However, FDA will use whatever method it adopts in this proceeding as the basis for its enforcement actions, and this method will be the legally established method. Therefore, manufacturers would be advised to compare their method of choice to the HPLC method to ensure that the alternative method produces similar results. 3. Proposed Limit for Ephedrine Alkaloids: Frequency and Per Total Daily Intake Basis     In addition to proposing a level for ephedrine alkaloids in dietary supplements at or above which their presence will render the product adulterated, the agency is proposing to address its concern that products containing ephedrine alkaloids below the dietary ingredient limit may be used in a manner that increases the likelihood, frequency, and severity of adverse events. Intake of multiple servings of ephedrine alkaloid-containing dietary supplements, particularly when such intake occurs within a relatively short timeframe (e.g., hours or within a day), can result in an excessive level of ephedrine alkaloids in the body that will increase the likelihood of an acute adverse event and the severity of the event that occurs. Concern over the hazards of taking several servings of ephedrine alkaloid-containing dietary supplements in a short period of time led several members of the Working Group and of the Food Advisory Committee to recommend that FDA limit the intake of dietary supplements containing ephedrine alkaloids to no more than four to five times per day and establish daily use limits, e.g., the amount of ephedrine alkaloids the consumer should not exceed in a day. In light of this, FDA evaluated the risks associated with different patterns of daily intake of ephedrine alkaloid- containing dietary supplements.     The average plasma half-lives for pharmaceutical ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, and phenylpropanolamine are approximately 6 hours (range 3 to 11 hours), 6 hours, and 4 hours, respectively (Refs. 10 through 12, 20, and 46). Generally, this means that after one half-life (e.g., 4 to 6 hours) half of the ephedrine alkaloids still remain in the blood. More than 24 hours are needed for complete clearance of a single serving of ephedrine alkaloids from the body. Because ephedrine alkaloids remain in the body for hours, when additional servings of an ephedrine alkaloid-containing dietary supplement are consumed, the ingested alkaloids are additive to those already in the body. This process will result in an increase in blood and tissue concentrations of ephedrine alkaloids. Generally, the higher the blood and other body tissue levels of ephedrine alkaloids, the greater the likelihood and severity of adverse events (Ref. 46).     Given the pharmacological evidence that average plasma half-lives of ephedrine alkaloids are approximately 4 to 6 hours, elevated blood levels of ephedrine alkaloids will be maintained if a serving is consumed every 4 to 6 hours. Because ephedrine alkaloids are stimulant substances, they can cause insomnia if taken close to sleeping hours. Thus, if 6 to 8 hours in a day are typically used for sleeping, there is a period of 16 to 18 hours per day in which consumers of ephedrine- containing dietary supplements would   Page 30695   have interest in consuming this substance. By dividing the 16 to 18 waking hours in a day by the largest average half-life for ephedrine alkaloids (i.e., 6 hours), the results reveal the possibility of taking a maximum of three servings per day.     Three servings of a dietary supplement that contains the proposed maximum per serving amount of ephedrine alkaloids (less than 8 mg) would yield a daily intake level of less than 24 mg ephedrine alkaloids. Thus, a dietary supplement product that contains ephedrine alkaloids and whose label or labeling instructs consumers to take 24 mg or more per day would present a significant and unreasonable risk of injury and illness under the conditions of use suggested or recommended in the labeling and thus would render the product adulterated under section 402(f)(1)(A) of the act. Similarly, an ephedrine alkaloid- containing product whose label or labeling instructs consumers to take 8 mg or more during a 6-hour period would instruct consumers to consume an amount of ephedrine alkaloids that has been shown to cause injury. This labeling also would present a significant and unreasonable risk and render the product adulterated under section 402(f)(1)(A) of the act.     FDA tentatively concludes that without a daily use limit, the per serving limit cannot be effective in reducing the potential for adverse events because consumers may unknowingly consume an excessive amount of ephedrine alkaloids by taking several servings of dietary supplements in a relatively short period of time. Therefore, FDA is proposing in Sec. 111.100(b) that the labeling of dietary supplements that contain ephedrine alkaloids shall not suggest or recommend conditions of use that would result in intake of 8 mg or more ephedrine alkaloids within a 6-hour period or a total daily intake of 24 mg or more of ephedrine alkaloids. FDA is proposing this regulation under sections 402(f)(1)(A) and 701(a) of the act to ensure that ephedrine alkaloid-containing dietary supplements do not bear directions for use that will create a significant and unreasonable risk.     In some cases, the label directions for use of dietary supplements containing ephedrine alkaloids can cause consumers to exceed the per serving limit or to consume servings more frequently than every 6 hours. For example, FDA would consider the following label instructions to increase the risk of adverse events: ``take what your body needs'' or ``take 1 tablet (containing 7 mg ephedrine alkaloids) per serving, not to exceed 3 tablets per day.'' In the later example, the consumer may believe that it is safe to consume 3 tablets (21 mg ephedrine alkaloids) at one serving or servings separated by less than 6 hours. Examples where the agency would not consider that the directions for use would cause consumers to exceed the per serving limit or take serving more frequently than every 6 hours include ``take 1 tablet per day,'' ``take 1 tablet every 6 hours, do not take more than 3 tablets per day,'' or ``take 1 tablet not more than every 8 hours, do not take more than 2 tablets per day.'' 4. Proposed Limitation on Duration of Use     The available data suggest that some types of adverse events may be related to the duration of using ephedrine alkaloids. Long-term use of sympathomimetic agents, such as ephedrine alkaloids, even at relatively low levels, is related to serious adverse events, including cardiomyopathy (i.e., disease of the heart muscle) and myocardial necrosis (death of heart cells and tissue), that can result in death (Refs. 7, 16, 49, 51, and 52). The scientific literature establishes that use of ephedrine alkaloids for a period of several months or years can result in cardiomyopathy (Refs. 66 through 68). Similarly, fatal cardiomyopathies have been seen in the AER's associated with chronic use of ephedrine alkaloid-containing dietary supplements at serving levels close to the dietary ingredient limit the agency proposed above (ARMS No. 11134 in Refs. 29 and 149a).     Concern about these types of adverse events with the long-term use of ephedrine alkaloids led several members of the Working Group (Ref. 27) and of the Food Advisory Committee (Ref. 25) to recommend that, in conjunction with a per serving dietary ingredient limit, FDA require a statement on the label of ephedrine alkaloid-containing dietary supplements to warn consumers not to use the product for a period longer than 7 days. These members stated that a 7-day use limit is standard guidance for the use of pharmacoactive drug substances, including ephedrine alkaloids, and may reduce the occurrence of adverse events related to long-term use of ephedrine alkaloids (Ref. 25). Moreover, a 7-day limit on the use of ephedrine alkaloids is supported by the AER's data, which show that over 60 percent of the adverse events occurred when ephedrine alkaloid-containing dietary supplements were used for more than 7 days.     For these reasons, FDA tentatively concludes that ephedrine alkaloid-containing dietary supplements that do not bear the statement ``Do not use this product for more than 7 days'' present a significant and unreasonable risk of injury and illness under the recommended or suggested conditions of use. Therefore, under sections 402(f)(1)(A) and 701(a) of the act, to reduce the potential for adverse events occurring as a result of consumers using ephedrine alkaloids for more than a period of 7 days, FDA is proposing to require in Sec. 111.100(c) that the label of dietary supplements that contain ephedrine alkaloids state ``Do not use this product for more than 7 days.''     The agency notes that this warning focuses on duration of use, not on when reinstitution of use of ephedrine alkaloids is appropriate. FDA is not aware of definitive data on whether there is a period of time when the reinstitution of use of ephedrine alkaloids will not present a risk of adverse events. FDA solicits comments, particularly data, on this matter. In addition, FDA solicits comments on how consumers will interpret this label statement in terms of reintroducing dietary supplements containing ephedrine alkaloids in their diets. 5. Proposed Prohibition of Ingredients With Stimulant Effects     As previously discussed, because the nature and patterns of adverse events observed in the AER's were consistent with the known physiological and pharmacological effects of the ephedrine alkaloids, the agency focused its evaluation on the ephedrine alkaloids. However, the majority of the adverse events that have been reported to FDA have involved the use of dietary supplements that contain ephedrine alkaloids in combination with other ingredients, some with known physiological or pharmacological effects, including kola nut, yohimbe, willow bark, senna, and Uva ursi (Ref. 164). In many cases, the AER's showed that more severe adverse effects (e.g., heart attack, stroke, seizure) occurred with the use of dietary supplements that contained ephedrine alkaloids at levels below 20 mg together with other ingredients than were noted in the scientific literature with the use of ephedrine at 20 mg (Ref. 149a). These observations suggest that the other ingredients may act, in combination with the ephedrine alkaloids, to produce more frequent, more severe, or potentially different patterns of adverse effects than those noted with the use of an ephedrine alkaloid alone.   Page 30696       Moreover, the clinically significant adverse events that occurred with amounts of ephedrine alkaloids below the 8 mg per serving limit may have been related to the compounding effects of ephedrine alkaloids in combination with other ingredients. Because of the known additive effects that occur when ephedrine alkaloids are combined with certain types of other ingredients, such as stimulants, proposed Sec. 111.100(a)(1), by itself, will likely not be effective in reducing the potential for adverse events. Certain types of other substances interact with the ephedrine alkaloids to increase the effects of the ephedrine alkaloids, thereby acting like more ephedrine alkaloids were contained in the product.     For example, caffeine is a nervous system stimulant that can induce nervousness, insomnia, and tachycardia (increased heart rate) (Refs. 7, 165, and 166). Intake of toxic levels of caffeine can cause death resulting from CV stimulatory effects (Ref. 46). Various botanicals are known to be sources of caffeine, including green tea, guarana, yerba mate (also known as Ilex paraguariensis), and kola nut (Refs. 167 through 172).     The scientific literature reveals that the frequency and severity of adverse effects increase when ephedrine alkaloids and caffeine are combined (Refs. 22, 73, 105, and 106). Recent clinical trials have focused on whether a combination of ephedrine and caffeine would be more effective in the treatment of obesity than ephedrine alone. The usual dosage of ephedrine and caffeine was 20 mg and 200 mg, respectively, given three times a day before meals. The results of these trials, certain of which were carefully designed and conducted to eliminate potential confounders to the interpretation of study results (e.g., concurrent medication usage, underlying diseases and conditions or other risk factors), indicate that the effects, including adverse effects, of combining ephedrine and caffeine are synergistic (Refs. 105, 173, and 174).     Caffeine and ephedrine also appear to be synergistic in thermogenesis, i.e., they increase the rate of thermogenesis by influencing different parts of the metabolic pathways (Refs. 173 and 175). While the resulting effects of combining ephedrine and caffeine could have a potentially positive impact on thermogenesis because of their effects on metabolic pathways, it may also account for increased adverse effects seen with combinations of these agents because of increased sympathetic stimulation of other organ-systems (e.g., CVS and NS). The synergistic adverse effects include an increased frequency of certain signs and symptoms, e.g., increased heart rate, insomnia, nervousness, and increased blood pressure, that are considered characteristic of sympathomimetic stimulation.     Other substances with stimulant effects in combination with ephedrine alkaloids may act to increase the likelihood of an adverse event. Yohimbine from the botanical yohimbe, in small doses, is reported to stimulate part of the nervous system and to cause elevated blood pressure, increased heart rate, tremor, and anxiety (Refs. 176 through 178). Because of their stimulant effects on the nervous system, combining sources of yohimbine with the ephedrine alkaloids may increase the likelihood, frequency, and severity of adverse events.     Therefore, the agency tentatively concludes that, based on the available evidence, adverse events may be related to the interactive or additive effects of stimulant substances in combination with ephedrine alkaloids in dietary supplements. This tentative conclusion is supported by statements made by several members of the Food Advisory Committee at the August 27 and 28, 1996, meeting (Ref. 25). For these reasons, the agency tentatively concludes that any dietary supplement that contains ephedrine alkaloids in combination with ingredients that produce the aforementioned effects presents a significant or unreasonable risk of injury or illness under the conditions of use suggested in the labeling or under ordinary conditions of use and are adulterated. To eliminate this risk, under sections 402(f)(1)(A) and 701(a) of the act, FDA is proposing Sec. 111.100(d), which states that no ingredient, or ingredient that contains a substance, that has a known stimulant effect (e.g., sources of caffeine, yohimbine) may be included in a dietary supplement that contains ephedrine alkaloids.     The agency is aware that several manufacturers and distributors of ephedrine alkaloid-containing dietary supplements also market caffeine- containing dietary supplements that are intended to be used with a ``companion'' ephedrine alkaloid-containing dietary supplement. The caffeine-containing dietary supplements are often promoted as ``boosters'' or ``enhancers'' for the ephedrine alkaloid-containing product. Under these conditions of use, both the caffeine-containing and the ephedrine alkaloid-containing dietary supplement products present a significant and unreasonable risk of illness and injury under their labeled conditions of use and consequently are adulterated under section 402(f)(1)(A) of the act.     The agency is concerned that many of the dietary supplements implicated in the AER's contained substances that are known to have physiological or pharmacological effects that could increase the risk of adverse events when taken in combination with ephedrine alkaloids. For example, substances that reduce renal clearance interfere with the elimination of ephedrine alkaloids from the body by the kidneys (i.e., renal excretion) (Refs. 180 and 181) and thus may increase the risk of adverse effects when consumed in combination with ephedrine alkaloids. These substances include salicin, which is found in the botanical commonly known as willow bark, and amino acids in high concentrations (Refs. 181 and 182). By reducing renal clearance, higher levels of ephedrine alkaloids are maintained in the blood for longer periods of time, thus prolonging the effects of ephedrine alkaloids. The maintenance of high blood levels of ephedrine alkaloids increases the likelihood of adverse events, particularly in those who may be sensitive to the effects of ephedrine alkaloids. In addition, consumers may experience adverse events if more ephedrine alkaloids are consumed while blood levels are maintained because the absorption of additional ephedrine alkaloids into the bloodstream will result in even higher blood and tissue concentrations of ephedrine alkaloids and in any effects that may follow. Generally, the higher the blood levels of ephedrine alkaloids, the greater the risk of adverse events and the greater the likelihood that the adverse effects that do occur will be severe (Ref. 46).     Diuretics and laxative substances in an ephedrine-alkaloid- containing dietary supplement may also increase the likelihood, frequency, and severity of adverse events (Refs. 182 through 186). Uva ursi is a botanical diuretic contained in many ephedrine alkaloid products (Ref. 184). The compounds ursolic acid and isoquercetin found in Uva ursi are mild diuretics. The ephedrine alkaloids also exhibit diuretic effects (Ref. 4). For example, ephedrine has a mild diuretic effect, and pseudoephedrine has a marked diuretic effect. The use of a product that contains ephedrine alkaloids in combination with other substances with diuretic effects increases the likelihood and severity of consequent fluid and electrolyte imbalances, both of which could affect CVS and NS risks.     Senna and Cascara are examples of botanicals that contain potent stimulant laxative substances called   Page 30697   anthraquinone glucosides (Refs. 185 through 187). Use of excessive amounts of stimulant laxatives can cause stomach cramps, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Chronic use may lead to laxative dependence, diarrhea, and, in severe cases, dehydration and electrolyte disorders (Ref. 188). Ephedrine is known to influence cellular potassium (an electrolyte) concentrations (Refs. 53 and 54). Use of laxative substances in combination with ephedrine alkaloids may act to increase the likelihood, frequency, and severity of adverse events. The agency requests comments, particularly data, on the interactive effects of other ingredients and the ephedrine alkaloids in dietary supplements. Based on the comments and data received by FDA, the agency may prohibit the use of ingredients that produce the aforementioned effects in a dietary supplement that contain ephedrine alkaloids. 6. Proposed Prohibitions on Claims     As described previously in section II.C.1. of this document, FDA has received numerous reports of adverse events associated with ephedrine alkaloid-containing dietary supplements promoted for use for weight loss, increased energy, body building, enhanced athletic performance, increased mental concentration, and enhanced well-being and with products promoted to be used as an alternative to illicit street drugs. While many of the products that were associated with adverse events contained more than one type of claim or representation on their label or in their labeling, the majority of adverse events reported to FDA are related to the use of products promoted or used for weight loss or energy purposes. Although fewer of the AER's were associated with products promoted for body building and enhanced well- being, clinically serious adverse events, including seizure, heart attack, and death, have been reported to FDA that were associated with the use of products represented for these purposes. At least one death in a young man has been reported with the use of a product promoted as an alternative to an illicit street drug.     In reviewing the AER's, it was evident that specific types of claims contained in the labeling of dietary supplements containing ephedrine alkaloids promoted different patterns of use. Claims such as weight loss and body building encouraged long-term use to achieve the product's purported effect (Ref. 189). In addition, claims of increased energy, increased mental concentration, or enhanced well-being, in a number of cases, encouraged short-term excessive consumption to achieve more of the product's purported effect (Ref. 190). Finally, the agency found that claims that suggest that the product is intended to be used as a substitute for an illicit street drug fostered abuse. Because claims in product labeling may influence how a consumer uses the product, claims in product labeling are a condition of use for dietary supplements.     Several Food Advisory Committee members identified a number of significant risks attendant to using dietary supplements containing ephedrine alkaloids for purposes such as weight loss, energy, or as an illicit street drug alternative, including adverse events that are associated with long-term use, excessive consumption, and abuse of ephedrine alkaloids (Ref. 25). Because the identified types of claims promote use patterns that are associated with adverse events, the agency has tentatively concluded that claim restrictions are necessary to maintain the integrity of the limit on the level of ephedrine alkaloids in dietary supplements that it is proposing in Sec. 111.100(a)(1) and of the other proposed restrictions on the conditions of use of these dietary supplements.     a. Claims that promote long-term use. Claims in the labeling of dietary supplements that use of a product may result in effects such as weight loss or body building promote long-term use of the product because these effects cannot be achieved in a short period of time. Weight loss occurs when caloric intake is reduced or energy expenditure (e.g., exercise) is increased. To lose 1 pound (lb), approximately 3,500 kilocalories (kcal) must be expended by reducing caloric intake or by increasing energy expenditures (e.g., physical activity) or both (Ref. 191). Rapid weight loss is associated with health risks, including increased protein loss from the body stores and increased risk of gallstone formation (Ref. 27). In fasting, over 50 percent of rapid weight reduction is attributable to the loss of body fluids. Risks associated with rapid loss of fluids from the body include hypotension (i.e., reduction in blood pressure) and electrolyte disturbances. Steady weight loss over a longer period of time results in a true weight loss with a reduction of fat stores (Ref. 193). Guidelines recommend that a safe rate of weight loss is \1/2\ to 1 lb per week (Ref. 194). Therefore, depending upon the amount of weight loss that the individual desires to achieve, weight loss programs may extend from weeks to months (Ref. 195).     Long-term weight loss practices have been documented in the scientific literature. A survey of weight control practices among 1,431 adults indicated that the average respondent participating in the survey had a weight loss attempt lasting from 5 to 6 months and had averaged one attempt a year for the past 2 years (Ref. 196). In addition, approximately 30 percent of persons trying to lose weight were chronic dieters and had been on weight loss plans at least 1 year (Ref. 196). Thus, this survey indicates that common weight loss practices can be characterized as long-term in duration and recurrent in nature.     Conversely, body building involves the building of lean muscle mass by strength and endurance training. The addition of muscle mass can be accomplished only through regular muscle work (weight training or similar conditions) coupled with a caloric increase (Ref. 197). To increase size and strength, a muscle must be exercised at 60 to 80 percent of its capacity several times a week. In addition, a gain of 1 lb of muscle requires about 2,500 extra calories, in addition to the calories needed for the training (Ref. 197). An increase of 700 to 1,000 calories (cal) to the daily diet should support a gain of 1 to 2 lb of lean muscle in 7 days (Ref. 197). Body building systems that include intensive physical training programs, controlled diet, and dietary supplementation purport to achieve results in 6 weeks (Ref. 198), and the individual must continue a training program to maintain or increase the muscle mass.     As previously mentioned in section III.C.4. of this document, long- term use of ephedrine alkaloids, even at relatively low levels, is related to serious adverse events, including cardiomyopathy (i.e., disease of the heart muscle) and myocardial necrosis (death of heart cells and tissue), that can result in death. After reviewing the scientific literature and the AER's as well as recommendations by the Working Group and by the Food Advisory Committee, FDA has tentatively concluded that ephedrine alkaloid-containing dietary supplements must bear the statement ``Do not use this product for more than 7 days,'' and that those that do not present a significant and unreasonable risk of injury and illness under the recommended or suggested conditions of use.     Significant and safe results from weight loss or body building should not and cannot be achieved within a period of 7 days. An individual could lose approximately 4 lb of body fat in 7 days under complete fasting conditions if the normal energy requirements are 2,000 cal per day. (This assumption is based   Page 30698   on the fact that 3,500 kcal must be expended to achieve 1 lb of weight loss.) As discussed above, however, this rate of weight loss is not safe or recommended.     Regarding body building, lean muscle mass cannot be built in 7 days (Ref. 197). Moreover, the scientific literature evidences that the use of ephedrine alkaloids during intense physical activity, such as body building, increases the risks of serious adverse events. Use of ephedrine alkaloids during periods of intense physical activity results in enhanced or synergistic actions on the sympathetic nervous system. It is through such enhanced physiological processes that chronic effects on the heart, such as myocardial necrosis (i.e., death of heart cells and tissue), can occur with prolonged use of ephedrine alkaloids (Refs. 16 and 197a).     Because safe and significant weight loss and body building cannot be achieved in a 7-day period, claims that promote these uses promote long-term use of ephedrine alkaloid-containing dietary supplements, which has been associated with serious adverse events. For this reason, FDA tentatively concludes that any claims that promote long-term use of ephedrine alkaloid dietary supplements, such as those for weight loss and body building, promote conditions of use that present a significant and unreasonable risk of illness and injury. Therefore, under sections 402(f)(1)(A) and 701(a) of the act, the agency is proposing in Sec. 111.100(e) to prohibit dietary supplements that contain ephedrine alkaloids from being represented, either expressly or implicitly, for use for long-term effects such as weight loss or body building.     b. Claims that promote short-term excessive consumption. Many claims found on the labels of, or in the labeling for, ephedrine alkaloid-containing dietary supplements, including increased energy, increased mental concentration, and enhanced well-being, encourage the consumer to take more of the product than is indicated on the label to achieve more of the purported effect. Several members of the Food Advisory Committee stated that when a product is promoted to increase these types of effects, the claim encourages the consumer to exceed the labeled directions for use to gain more of the desired effects (Ref. 25). For example, if a product is promoted for energy, the consumer is encouraged to take more to gain greater energy.     Many of the AER's received by the agency were associated with dietary supplements containing ephedrine alkaloids that were promoted for one or more of these purposes. In a number of instances, the consumer took more than directed on the product label and experienced an adverse event (Ref. 190). Claims that promote excessive consumption, even for one or a very limited number of uses, are inconsistent with proposed Sec. 111.100 (a)(1) and (b), because they encourage the consumer to take more than directed in the conditions of use set out on the label so that the consumer can achieve the purported effect.     In section II.C.2.a. and II.C.2.b. of this document, FDA described data from the clinical literature and AER's that show that consumption of an excessive amount of ephedrine alkaloids in a relatively short period of time is associated with serious adverse events, including seizure, psychosis, mania, heart attack, and death. The agency tentatively concludes that the potential for these serious adverse events to occur with excessive consumption of ephedrine alkaloids is a material fact with respect to consequences that may result from the use of a dietary supplement promoted for short-term effects that encourage excessive consumption, and therefore a material fact that must be disclosed on the label.     FDA's authority to require disclosure statements in the labeling of dietary supplement products derives from sections 201(n), 403(a)(1), and 701(a) of the act. Section 201(n) of the act states, ``If an article (e.g., a food or dietary supplement product) is alleged to be misbranded because the labeling or advertising is misleading, then in determining whether the labeling or advertising is misleading there shall be taken into account (among other things) not only representations made or suggested by statement, word, design, device, or any combination thereof, but also the extent to which the labeling or advertising fails to reveal facts material in light of such representations or material with respect to consequences that may result from the use of the article to which the labeling or advertising thereof or under such conditions of use prescribed in the labeling or advertising thereof or under such conditions of use as are customary or usual.'' Under section 403(a)(1) of the act, a food is misbranded if its labeling is false or misleading in any particular. Thus, the omission of a material fact from the label or labeling would misbrand a product. These statutory provisions, combined with section 701(a) of the act, authorize FDA to issue a regulation designed to ensure that persons using ephedrine alkaloid-containing dietary supplements will receive information that is material with respect to consequences that may result from the use of the supplement under its labeled conditions.     Therefore, FDA is proposing in Sec. 111.100(f)(1) that the label or labeling for dietary supplements that contain ephedrine alkaloids that purport to be or are represented, either expressly or implicitly, to be used for short-term effects, such as increased energy, increased mental concentration, or enhanced well-being, must state ``Taking more than the recommended serving may cause heart attack, stroke, seizure, or death.'' However, given the significance and the potentially life- threatening nature of the adverse events that may occur when individuals consume excessive amounts of ephedrine alkaloids, the agency requests comments on whether this statement should appear on the label of dietary supplements containing ephedrine alkaloids, regardless of any claims appearing on the label or in labeling.     FDA wants to provide an approach to placement of this information that will give it a prominence that will ensure that it will be read and understood by consumers but that will result in its presentation only once on the label panel or on each page of the labeling. Because the consequences of excessive use of ephedrine alkaloids can be serious, the agency tentatively concludes that this information should be on the same label panel or on the same page of the labeling (i.e., the same field of vision) as the claim. However, FDA is proposing to provide for the use of one disclaimer on the label panel or on each page of labeling in situations in which multiple claims appear on the label panel or page of labeling where repetitive presentation of the disclaimer could be burdensome. FDA tentatively concludes that where the label panel or page of labeling contains multiple claims, and the relationship between each of those statements and the disclaimer can be made obvious, the disclaimer need only appear once on each label panel or in each page of labeling.     FDA experience has been that one of the most effective ways of tying two label statements that are physically separate on the same panel is through the use of a symbol such as an asterisk. Symbols have been used within nutrition labeling since its inception in 1973 and have proven to be an effective way of relating labeling information to explanatory footnotes. For example, asterisks have been used adjacent to names of vitamins and minerals present at very low levels to refer the consumer to a footnote stating ``Contains less than   Page 30699   2 percent of the Daily Value (formerly the U.S. Recommended Daily Allowance).'' FDA is unaware of any data indicating consumer difficulties with such use of symbols. The use of symbols would also help differentiate between the label statements to which the disclaimer is referring and the other label claims to which the disclaimer does not apply (e.g., authorized health claims or nutrient content claims).     The agency points out that the proposed requirements for the disclaimer also extend to labeling: There are potentially many vehicles (e.g., placards, pamphlets, catalogs, books) that would have to bear the disclaimer. The agency is concerned that the disclaimer be prominent in these forms of labeling. Even with the flexibility of the use of an asterisk to tie the claim and the disclaimer to a single claim, the disclaimer could be obscured in pages of text of a package insert, pamphlet, or book if it did not appear on the same page or panel (i.e., in the same field of vision) as the claim itself. Because of the variety of possibilities for the presentation of the disclaimer, the agency tentatively concludes that for labeling, as for labels, it is important that the disclaimer appear within the same field of vision, that is, on each package panel or page where a claim is made.     Section 403(f) of the act requires mandatory label or labeling information to be prominently placed on the label with such conspicuousness (compared with other words, statements, designs, or devices, in the labeling) as to render it likely to be read and understood by the ordinary individual under customary conditions of use. In other instances where information must appear in a prominent and conspicuous manner on the product label, FDA has proposed that the information be ``in easily legible print or type in distinct contrast to other printed or graphic matter'' (e.g., Sec. 101.13(d)(2)). Therefore, to be consistent with previous actions and to ensure that the information is presented in a way that makes it likely to be read, FDA tentatively concludes that the information be presented in easily legible print or type in distinct contrast to other printed or graphic matter.     FDA has long held that accompanying information should be in a size reasonably related to that of the information it modifies (e.g., Secs. 101.22(i)(2) and 102.5(b)(2)(ii)). More recently, this relative prominence has been expressed as a size no less than that required by Sec. 101.105(i) for the net quantity of contents statement, except where the size of the claim is less than two times the required size of the net quantity of contents statement, in which case the accompanying information can be no less than one-half the type size of the information modified, but no smaller than one-sixteenth of an inch (see e.g., Sec. 101.13(g) (1) and (i)(2)). The agency also has long held that one-sixteenth of an inch is the minimum type size for disclaimer statements, unless the package complies with Sec. 101.2(c)(5) (see e.g., Sec. 101.13(g)(1) and (i)(2)). One-sixteenth of an inch is specified in Sec. 101.2(c) as the minimum type size for most other mandatory information on the principal display panel or information panel, e.g., designation of ingredients, name and place of business, and quantitative information for relative claims. Consequently, the agency tentatively concludes that the minimum type size for such information should be one-sixteenth of an inch.     Accordingly, FDA is proposing to provide for the disclaimer, as outlined above, in Sec. 111.100(f)(2). If FDA adopts Sec. 111.100(f)(2), the labeling of a dietary supplement that contains ephedrine alkaloids and that purports to be, or that is represented as, useful for short-term effects, such as increased energy, increased mental concentration, or enhanced well-being, would be misleading, and thus misbranded, if it does not include the disclaimer set out in Sec. 111.100(f)(1).     The agency recognizes that most of the claims that will require the use of the disclaimer, if this proposal is adopted, will be statements that are made subject to section 403(r)(6) of the act. That provision also requires that a disclaimer accompany the statements. In the Federal Register of December 28, 1995 (60 FR 67176), FDA proposed requirements for the disclaimer that is required to accompany statements made under section 403(r)(6) of the act. FDA requests comments on how best to place the disclaimer proposed in this document in conjunction with the disclaimer required under section 403(r)(6) of the act on the label or in labeling of dietary supplements so that both disclaimers will be read and understood by consumers.     c. Claims that suggest that the product is intended to be used as a substitute for an illicit street drug. FDA is aware that some ephedrine alkaloid-containing products are being promoted as alternatives or substitutes for such illicit street drugs as MDMA (4-methyl-2, dimethoxyamphetamine), a methamphetamine analogue. MDMA is also known as ``ecstasy,'' ``XTC,'' and ``X.'' The precursor of MDMA is MDA (3,4 methylene dioxyamphetamine), an amphetamine whose use results in destruction of serotonin-producing neurons that play a direct role in regulating aggression, mood, sexual activity, and tolerance to pain (Ref. 16). Many products claiming to be herbal alternatives to MDMA bear claims on their label or in the labeling that highlight these mood-or mind-altering effects.     Such street drug alternative claims do not fall within the scope of the claims that Congress intended to permit on the labels or in the labeling of dietary supplements. The Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994 (the DSHEA) added section 201(ff) to the act (21 U.S.C. 321(ff)), which provides, in part, that the term dietary supplement means a product ``intended to supplement the diet'' that bears or contains one or more dietary ingredients. While Congress did not elaborate in the legislative history on what it intended the phrase ``intended to supplement the diet'' to mean, many of the congressional findings set forth in the DSHEA suggest that Congress intended dietary supplements to augment the diet to promote health and reduce the risk of disease.     In using the term ``diet'' in section 201(ff) of the act, Congress did not define this term in either the act or the legislative history. The term ``diet'' is defined in Webster's Dictionary as ``an organism's usual food and drink'' (Ref. 200). Dorland's Medical Dictionary defines ``diet'' as ``the customary allowance of food and drink taken by any person from day-to-day, particularly one especially planned to meet specific requirements of the individual, and including or excluding certain items of food'' (Ref. 201). These definitions suggest that the diet is composed of usual food and drink that may be designed to meet specific nutritional requirements. Under section 201(ff) of the act, dietary supplements are food except for purposes of section 201(g) of the act and thus may be part of, or augment, the diet. These common sense definitions for the term ``diet'' do not encompass alternatives to illicit street drugs.     Products promoted to be an alternative to or substitute for an illicit street drug are intended to be used for recreational purposes to effect psychological states (e.g., to ``get high'' or to promote feelings of euphoria). Illicit street drugs are not food or drink and thus, cannot supplement the diet. In addition, use of products claiming to be alternatives to illicit street drugs does not promote health or reduce the risk of disease, the intended use for dietary supplements suggested in the   Page 30700   congressional findings listed in the DSHEA. In fact, serious adverse events, including cardiac arrhythmia that resulted in death, are associated with the use and abuse of products promoted for use as an alternative to MDMA (see ARMS No. 10862 in Ref. 149a).     Because alternatives to illicit street drugs are not intended to be used to supplement the diet, products that purport to be or that are represented, either expressly or implicitly, for use as an alternative to a street drug are not dietary supplements within the meaning of section 201(ff) of the act. Therefore, manufacturers, packers, and distributors cannot take advantage of the exemption for structure function claims from the drug definition in section 403(r)(6) of the act. Because these products are intended to be used to affect the structure and function of the body, they are drugs within the meaning of section 201(g)(1)(C) of the act. 7. Warning Label Statements     Several members of the Working Group and of the Food Advisory Committee recommended that specific information be conveyed in a warning or cautionary statement for ephedrine alkaloid-containing dietary supplements (Refs. 25 and 27). Persons having certain diseases or taking specific medications known to interact with ephedrine alkaloids are at risk of suffering adverse events with the use of dietary supplements containing ephedrine alkaloids. Generally, use of ephedrine alkaloids at any intake level by these persons is contraindicated (Refs. 10 through 12, and 55). For these persons, a warning label statement can be a useful means of alerting them to potential consequences that can result from the use of the product. Table 5 identifies groups that are at risk if they use ephedrine alkaloids. In addition, many consumers who are unaware that they are sensitive to the effects of ephedrine alkaloids may not recognize the significance of early warning signs and symptoms as potential indicators of more serious side effects (e.g., dizziness or severe headache may be early symptoms of hypertension or stroke). Under these circumstances, a warning statement could provide information on what actions the consumer should take if certain symptoms occur.     FDA has received several AER's, some clinically significant, that were associated with the use of dietary supplements containing ephedrine alkaloids at levels below the level proposed in Sec. 111.100(a)(1) where signs and symptoms including high blood pressure, chest pain, increased heart rate, severe headache, and nausea were observed (Ref. 149a). Although these AER's are not sufficient to support a lower per serving limit, they do provide cause for concern for lower per serving levels. To reduce the potential for adverse events to occur at these lower per serving levels, FDA tentatively concludes that a warning statement on the labels of dietary supplements containing ephedrine alkaloids is necessary, in conjunction with dietary ingredient limitations and other requirements proposed in this document, to protect the public health.     FDA is therefore proposing in Sec. 111.100(g) to require that a specific warning statement appear on the labels of dietary supplements containing ephedrine alkaloids. FDA's authority to require label warning statements on dietary supplement products derives from sections 201(n), 403(a)(1), and 701(a) of the act. These statutory provisions authorize FDA to issue a regulation designed to ensure that persons using dietary supplements will receive information that is material with respect to consequences that may result from the use of a product under its labeled conditions.     a. Caution statement suggested by industry. Several dietary supplement industry trade groups met with FDA on November 30, 1995, and suggested that dietary supplements containing ephedrine alkaloids bear a specific warning statement (Ref. 199). Representatives from the National Nutritional Foods Association (NNFA), the American Herbal Products Association (AHPA), the Nonprescription Drug Manufacturers Association (NDMA), and the Utah Natural Products Alliance (UNPA) (hereinafter referred to as the dietary supplement industry <SUP>2</SUP>) recommended the following statement: ---------------------------------------------------------------------------       \2\ FDA is using this shorthand for convenience. It does not intend to imply that these groups represent the entire dietary supplement industry. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------       CAUTION: Taking more than the recommended amount will not necessarily increase benefits. Begin use with one-half or less the recommended dose to assess your tolerance. (If Pertinent) Please note: This product contains caffeine and should not be taken by those wishing to eliminate caffeine from their diet. Seek advice from a health care practitioner if you are pregnant or nursing or if you are at risk or are being treated for high blood pressure, heart, thyroid or psychiatric disease, diabetes, depression, seizure disorder, stroke or difficulty in urination due to prostate enlargement. Consult your health care professional before use if you are taking an MAO inhibitor or any other prescription drug. Discontinue use and consult your health care professional if dizziness, nausea, sleeplessness, tremors, nervousness, headache, heart palpitations or tingling sensations occur. NOT INTENDED FOR SALE TO OR USE BY PERSONS UNDER THE AGE OF 18. KEEP OUT OF REACH OF CHILDREN. DO NOT EXCEED RECOMMENDED DOSE.     FDA has carefully considered proposing adoption of the statement suggested by industry. While the agency considers the industry suggestion to be a good starting point, FDA tentatively concludes that some changes are necessary in the statement if it is to fulfill its purpose of fairly warning consumers about the special risks attendant to use of dietary supplements that contain ephedrine alkaloids.     b. Tentative conclusions. The dietary supplement industry suggested that the warning statement begin with the term ``caution.'' FDA, however, questions whether this term is adequate to convey the severity of the harm that can result from the use of the product. Because use of ephedrine alkaloid-containing dietary supplements has the potential to cause serious injury to certain subgroups of the population, the agency tentatively concludes that the use of the term ``WARNING'' is warranted. The term ``WARNING'' is commonly used to denote danger, and, therefore, the use of this term will communicate to consumers the harm that could result to the special populations that are the subject of the warning.     The dietary supplement industry suggested that the statement include the instruction ``Seek advice from a health care provider if you are pregnant or nursing or if you are at risk or are being treated for high blood pressure, heart or thyroid disease, diabetes, difficulty in urination due to prostate enlargement.'' Several members of the Working Group and of the Food Advisory Committee recommended that a warning statement direct consumers who have certain diseases or conditions that increase the risk of adverse events not to use the product or to see a health care provider prior to using the product (Refs. 25 and 27). The feeling of these members was that a health care provider could assess the potential risks for the individual consumer if he or she uses the product.     FDA concurs with this portion of the industry's labeling recommendation. As discussed in section II.C. of this document, based on the scientific literature and the known physiological and pharmacologic effects of ephedrine alkaloids, an individual who is pregnant or nursing, has high blood pressure, heart or thyroid disease, or difficulty in   Page 30701   urination because of prostate enlargement has an increased risk for experiencing serious adverse effects with the use of ephedrine alkaloids. However, FDA also tentatively finds that the warning statement should be broadened to address other individuals who may place themselves at particular risk if they consume the product. The relevant scientific literature, case reports and AER's suggest that persons suffering from depression or other psychiatric conditions, glaucoma, or seizure disorders are also at increased risk of experiencing an adverse event if they consume ephedrine alkaloid- containing products.     Use of ephedrine alkaloids during pregnancy or while nursing can cause adverse effects in the fetus or the infant. Ephedrine alkaloids can cross the placental wall and can be absorbed by the fetus when taken by a pregnant woman (Refs. 10 through 12 and 55). Similarly, ephedrine is excreted in the breast milk and can be consumed by the nursing infant. The fetus, infants, and children are sensitive to the effects of ephedrine alkaloids and thus are more likely to experience adverse events (Refs. 39 and 41).     Use of ephedrine alkaloids by persons with high blood pressure can result in blood pressure elevations or loss of adequate medical control of hypertension (Ref. 64) which increases the risk of serious consequences (e.g., stroke and heart attack) (Refs. 62 and 70). Because ephedrine alkaloids also interfere with the regulation of serum potassium levels (Refs. 53 through 55), individuals with heart disease who use ephedrine alkaloids are at greater risk of cardiac dysrhythmias (i.e., abnormal heart rhythms) (Refs. 18 and 56), myocardial ischemia (i.e., inadequate circulation of blood and oxygen to the heart muscle), and infarction (i.e., death or damage of heart cells, also called heart attack) (Refs. 57 through 61).     With respect to thyroid disease, individuals with hyperthyroidism (resulting from increased secretion of thyroid hormone) show increased sensitivity to adrenergic agents, such as ephedrine alkaloids, which can result in thyroid storm with dire consequences (e.g., cardiac dysrhythmias, congestive heart failure, coma, and death) (Refs. 39, 41, 55, and 202).     For persons with diabetes, use of sympathomimetics can result in an increase in blood sugar and loss of diabetic control (Refs. 29, 41, and 51). In addition, ephedrine can cause constriction of the urinary bladder sphincter and ultimately lead to dysuria (increased, painful, or difficulty in urination). This condition is not only associated with prostate enlargement or only seen in men. Published case reports and AER's received by the agency document the finding that urinary retention following the use of ephedrine alkaloid-containing products can occur in both females and males, including young boys without any history of prostate enlargement (see ARMS No. 10298 and 11164 in Ref. 149a and Refs. 102, 103, 123, and 124).     Use of ephedrine alkaloids by persons suffering from depression or other psychiatric conditions increases the risk for the occurrence of serious adverse events, including psychosis and mania (Refs. 81 through 96, 98, 99, 109, and 220). Because ephedrine can cause an increase in intraocular pressure (i.e., pressure inside the eyeball), use of ephedrine alkaloids by persons with glaucoma will worsen this disease, which over time, can result in blindness (Refs. 39 and 41). Finally, persons with seizure disorders who use ephedrine alkaloids have an increased risk for experiencing a seizure (Refs. 63, 65, and 80). Because the nature of the risks associated with the use of ephedrine alkaloids for persons who have the diseases and health-related conditions listed above, it is important that these consumers be advised to consult a health care provider before using ephedrine alkaloid-containing dietary supplements.     With regard to the statement in industry's suggested statement ``if you are at risk or are being treated for high blood pressure * * *,'' the agency considers it unlikely that consumers will be able to adequately evaluate their risk for developing the conditions listed in this statement. Most of these conditions are not self-diagnoseable. In addition, individuals who have a disease or condition listed in this statement, but who are not currently being treated, may believe that they are not at risk of experiencing an adverse event. Consequently, the agency tentatively concludes that the warning statement needs to include an instruction to consult a health care provider before using an ephedrine alkaloid-containing dietary supplement.     The dietary supplement industry statement only instructs the consumer to consult his or her health care professional before use if he or she is taking an MAOI or any other prescription drug. FDA tentatively concludes that this statement should be broader because of the need for professional help in assessing the risks of ephedrine alkaloid intake with a range of conditions.     However, people using MAOI drugs should not use ephedrine alkaloid- containing products at all. Several members of the Working Group and of the Food Advisory Committee recommended that the warning statement advise consumers not to use the dietary supplements containing ephedrine alkaloids if they are taking these types of drugs (Refs. 25 and 27). Because the use of MAOI drugs in combination with ephedrine alkaloids results in blood pressure elevations and increases the risk of serious consequences (e.g., stroke and heart attack), FDA is proposing to warn against use of ephedrine alkaloid-containing products in this circumstance (Refs. 10 through 12, 39, 41, and 55). Because persons remain at risk while the MAOI drug remains in the body, FDA tentatively concludes that consumers need to be informed that it may take up to 2 weeks for the MAOI drug to clear the body (Refs. 203 and 204).     Because MAOI drugs increase the effects of sympathomimetic agents, and consequently will increase the frequency and severity of adverse effects, persons taking such drugs should be given as much information as possible. The agency is concerned that some patients may not be fully informed about MAOI drugs, may not fully understand or remember all the information given to them, or with the passage of time, may forget or lose information that has been provided. Thus, the warning statement needs to be as informative as possible.     Rather than include general language, such as ``any prescription drug'' in the warning statement, FDA tentatively finds that it is important to identify specific types of prescription and OTC drugs that contain ingredients that in combination with ephedrine alkaloids are known or expected to increase the likelihood, frequency, or severity of adverse effects. Therefore, FDA tentatively concludes that consumers need to be warned not to use ephedrine alkaloid-containing dietary supplement in combination with specific drugs, such as drugs for depression, psychiatric or emotional conditions (Refs. 10 through 12, 55, and 205); drugs for Parkinson's disease (Ref. 55); methyldopa (Ref. 206); or any product containing ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, or phenylpropanolamine (ingredients often found in allergy, asthma, cough/ cold and weight control products) (Refs. 180 and 207 through 209).     FDA tentatively finds that the drug methyldopa needs to be identified on the label. It increases the pressor results of sympathomimetic agents, such as ephedrine alkaloids, resulting in hypertension (Ref. 206). FDA has   Page 30702   reached a similar tentative judgment with respect to ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, and phenylpropanolamine because each of these substances, in combination with an ephedrine alkaloid-containing dietary supplement, could lead to an additive effect and consequently increase the risk of serious adverse events. While many consumers may not be familiar with the term ``ephedrine,'' ``pseudoephedrine,'' or ``phenylpropanolamine,'' they may be aware of the type of product being taken for a specific condition or ailment, e.g., allergy, asthma, cough/cold, and weight control products.     The agency recognizes that because of the large number of drugs for depression, psychiatric or emotional conditions, and Parkinson's disease that are contraindicated for use with ephedrine alkaloids and the limited amount of space on the labels of dietary supplements, not all of them can be listed on the label. However, the conditions for which the consumer is taking the drug can be identified, using less label space. If consumers are unsure whether their drug may interact with the ephedrine alkaloids, they should be cautioned to check with their health care professional before using the dietary supplement.     The dietary supplement industry suggested that the statement include the instruction ``Discontinue use and consult your health care professional if dizziness, nausea, sleeplessness, tremors, nervousness, headache, heart palpitations or tingling sensations occur.'' Several members of the Working Group and of the Food Advisory Committee also recommended that any warning statement include information on what actions the consumer should take if certain symptoms occur (Refs. 25 and 27).     Signs and symptoms, such as dizziness, severe headache, rapid or irregular heart beat, chest pain, shortness of breath, nausea, sleeplessness, noticeable changes in behavior, or loss of consciousness are often early warning signs of serious illness or injury, including heart attack, stroke, or seizure. It is important that the consumer stop using the product if these signs or symptoms occur because continued use of the product may aggravate the adverse effects. The agency tentatively finds that the terms ``stop'' and ``call'' should be used for ``discontinue'' and ``consult,'' respectively, because they are more simple and direct terms.     The proposed warning statement instructs the consumer to call a health care professional if any of the listed symptoms occur. A health care professional will be able to evaluate the significance of the signs and symptoms, determine the risks of more serious adverse events occurring, and prescribe any treatment that may be necessary. The effects, such as tremor, sleeplessness, and tingling sensations, that are included in the instruction suggested by the industry are not usually clinically serious and will likely cease once the product use is discontinued (Refs. 210). For these reasons, FDA tentatively concludes that the statement needs to include the instruction to ``Stop use and call a health care professional immediately if dizziness, severe headache, rapid or irregular heart beat, chest pain, shortness of breath, nausea, noticeable changes in behavior, or loss of consciousness occur.''     The dietary supplement industry suggested that the statement include a direction for the consumer not to exceed the recommended dose. Members of the Working Group and of the Food Advisory Committee recommended that the warning statement include a direction for the consumer not to exceed the recommended serving or dose (Refs. 25 and 27).     The agency concurs with the industry's suggestion. FDA tentatively finds that this type of statement is necessary to provide information instructing the user not to consume the product excessively. Excessive consumption of ephedrine alkaloids is associated with adverse events, including heart attack, stroke, seizure, and death. Therefore, the statement is a material fact about the consequences of use of the product. However, FDA has used the term ``serving'' rather than ``dose,'' because the agency considers the term ``serving'' to be more appropriate for use on a food label.     The dietary supplement industry suggested that the statement include the instruction that ``Taking more than the recommended amount will not necessarily increase benefits.'' Similarly, the Working Group suggested that the warning statement contain the instruction that ``Larger quantities may not be more effective.'' The agency is not aware of any data or other information that establishes that there are benefits from the use of dietary supplements containing ephedrine alkaloids. Therefore, the agency would be concerned about requiring a statement on the label that implies a judgment (that the product has benefits) that the agency has not made. While some questions can be raised in this regard under section 403(r)(6) of the act, the agency considers them to be moot because the instruction for the consumer not to exceed the recommended serving eliminates the need for the ``Taking more than recommended * * *'' statement.     The dietary supplement industry suggested that the statement advise the consumer to: ``Begin use with one-half or less the recommended dose to assess your tolerance.'' The agency addressed limiting the levels of ephedrine alkaloids contained in dietary supplements in proposed Sec. 111.100 (a)(1) and (b). In addition, because of label space constraints, the agency is trying to keep the warning statement as short as possible. Therefore, FDA tentatively concludes that there is no reason to require inclusion of this information.     The dietary supplement industry recommended the following in a caution statement, if appropriate for the product: ``This product contains caffeine and should not be taken by those wishing to eliminate caffeine from their diet.'' The Food Advisory Committee also suggested that other stimulants with their source, such as caffeine from Kola nut, be identified on the label of a dietary supplement containing ephedrine alkaloids. However, the agency is proposing to prohibit stimulant substances in combination with ephedrine alkaloids in dietary supplements. Therefore, FDA tentatively concludes that there is no reason to require the inclusion of such a statement.     The dietary supplement industry recommended that the direction ``Not for use by persons under the age of 18'' be included in the warning statement. Several members of the Working Group and of the Food Advisory Committee suggested that the warning statement include a direction that the product is not intended for use by persons under the age of 18. The agency has received limited reports of adolescents abusing or misusing ephedrine alkaloid-containing dietary supplements. Moreover, the agency has stated elsewhere in this document that claims implying usefulness of these products as alternatives to illicit street drugs render the product an unauthorized drug. FDA considers that removal of alternative street drug claims from the labeling of dietary supplements will significantly reduce or eliminate the appeal of these products to adolescents and therefore is not proposing to require that this direction be included in the warning. However, the agency requests comments on whether the direction ``not for persons under the age of 18'' should be included.   Page 30703       The industry group's statement included the instruction ``Keep out of reach of children.'' Children show increased sensitivity to the effects of sympathomimetic agents compared to adults (Refs. 39 and 41) and are, therefore, at increased risk for experiencing adverse events from the use of ephedrine alkaloids. The agency has limited data and information that dietary supplements containing ephedrine alkaloids are being given to, or are associated with accidental overdosage by, children. FDA requests comment, particularly data, on whether this statement is necessary to alert consumers to the fact that ephedrine alkaloid-containing dietary supplements should not be made available to children.     c. The agency's proposal. Based on FDA's authority under sections 201(n), 403(a)(1), and 701(a) of the act, the agency proposes to require manufacturers to include the warning statement set out in Sec. 111.100(g)(1) in the labeling of their ephedrine alkaloid- containing products. The agency tentatively finds that the warning statement is necessary to disclose material facts about the consequences of using the product, and that it will help to reduce the risk that some individuals will experience an adverse event from using this type of product.     The agency solicits comments on all aspects of the warning statement, including data to support any specific instruction. The agency also solicits comments on approaches to shorten or simplify the warning statement. Because substances contained in ingredients (e.g., ephedrine alkaloids contained in Ephedra) are not required to be listed in the ingredient list on the label of dietary supplements, the agency is concerned that consumers and health care providers may not be aware that ephedrine alkaloids are contained in the product and thus may not necessarily recognize the seriousness of the symptoms listed in the statement, when they occur. FDA requests comments on whether the warning statement should disclose that ephedrine alkaloids are contained in the product. In addition, the agency is concerned that some AER's suggest that a pattern of starting and stopping use of dietary supplements containing ephedrine alkaloids may increase an individual's susceptibility to experiencing adverse events. FDA requests comments on whether the warning statement should disclose the possibility of increasing the risk of adverse events by a pattern of stopping and starting use. Based on the comments received by FDA, the warning statement proposed below may need to be modified.     In an effort to promote uniformity in labeling, FDA is proposing to require that the warning statement appear on the labels of ephedrine alkaloid-containing dietary supplements in the exact manner presented in proposed Sec. 111.100(g)(1), except when the disclaimer proposed in Sec. 111.100(f) appears on the same label panel as the warning statement, in which case the instruction ``Do not exceed recommended serving'' would not have to appear in the warning statement. However, the agency recognizes that other ingredients that may be used in ephedrine alkaloid-containing dietary supplements may have consequences of use that need to be disclosed on the label. The agency requests comments on how to allow for warning statements for other ingredients in conjunction with the ephedrine alkaloid warning statement on the label of dietary supplements. In addition, the agency solicits comments on the format of the warning statement to improve its clarity (e.g., should the statement be set out in bullets).     d. Placement of warning statement on label. The agency intends to provide an approach to the placement of the warning label statement to give manufacturers flexibility to design their own label warning formats, while ensuring that consumers are given adequate notice of the information contained in the warning.     Section 403(f) of the act requires that information appearing on the label or labeling be prominently placed and appear with such conspicuousness (as compared with other words, statements, designs, or devices, in the labeling) as to render it likely to be read by the ordinary individual under customary conditions of use. In the agency's rulemaking that mandated warning statements on certain protein products, the agency decided not to mandate specific requirements for type size and other format elements. However, the agency did require that the warning statement appear ``prominently and conspicuously on the principal display panel of the package label'' (Sec. 101.17). In addressing the placement of the label warning, the agency noted that the seriousness and nature of the risks associated with the use of protein products in very low calorie diets was sufficient to require placement of the warning statement on the principal display panel (Sec. 101.17).     FDA tentatively concludes that the warning statement that it is proposing must appear prominently and conspicuously on the label of dietary supplements containing ephedrine alkaloids so that consumers are given adequate notice of the information contained in the warning. While the risks associated with the use of dietary supplements containing ephedrine alkaloids are serious, the agency is not proposing to require that the warning label statement for dietary supplements containing ephedrine alkaloids appear on the principal display panel. The agency recognizes that, because of the length of the required warning statement, in many cases it may be impracticable for the warning statement to appear on the principal display panel without interfering with the placement of other information that is required to appear on that panel.     The requirement in the act for prominent display means that the warning statement must be presented on the label or labeling in a manner that renders it as readily observable and likely to be read. In this regard, the agency's experience with the graphic requirements for the new nutrition label has been that a box around required label information greatly increases the prominence of the information placed inside the box. Moreover, focus group discussions regarding warning labels show that messages put in a boxed area help consumers to distinguish the message from other information as well as draw attention to it (Ref. 210a). Therefore, FDA is proposing to require in Sec. 111.100(g)(3) that the warning statement for ephedrine alkaloid- containing dietary supplements be separated from other information by a box. If FDA adopts these regulations, manufacturers will have the flexibility to design their own label and warning label format subject to Sec. 111.100(g)(3).     Section 201(k) of the act defines the term ``label'' as ``a display of written, printed, or graphic matter upon the immediate container of any article'' and further states a requirement that ``any word, statement, or other information appear on the label shall not be considered to be complied with unless such word, statement, or other information also appears on the outside container or wrapper, if any there be, of the retail package of such article * * *.'' Thus, if FDA adopts its proposal to require that a warning statement appear on the label of ephedrine alkaloid-containing dietary supplements, the warning statement would also have to appear on the retail package of such a product, if that package is not the immediate container.     FDA requests comments on these proposed requirements for placement of the warning statement.   Page 30704       In addition to this proposed regulation, the agency has issued proposed and final rules on dietary supplements, including premarket notification procedures for new dietary ingredients (61 FR 50774, September 27, 1996) and label warning statements and unit dose packaging requirements for iron containing dietary supplements (62 FR 2218, January 15, 1997). The agency has proposed to codify each of the proposed and final regulations in different parts of the Code of Federal Regulations. The agency believes that it would be easier for consumers as well as for the dietary supplement industry to find and use regulations for dietary supplements if they were consolidated into one part of the CFR. Accordingly, FDA is proposing to revise part 111 to consolidate the regulations for dietary supplements. FDA is proposing to change the title of part 111 from ``Current Good Manufacturing Practice for Dietary Supplements'' to ``Dietary Supplements.'' This is necessary to reflect that other regulations for dietary supplements in addition to regulations for current good manufacturing practice will be contained in this part. FDA is proposing to establish four subparts in part 111: Subpart A--General Provisions, Subpart B--Current Good Manufacturing Practice for Dietary Supplements, Subpart C--New Dietary Ingredients, and Subpart D--Restricted Dietary Ingredients. The labeling provisions for dietary supplements will continue to be placed in 21 CFR part 101.   D. Other Approaches Considered by the Agency       In choosing the proposed approach to limit the risks presented by ephedrine alkaloids in dietary supplements, the agency considered, but rejected, several other approaches. Because the act does not allow premarket review authority for dietary supplements, FDA has no data and information to establish conditions of use that will ensure the safe use of ephedrine alkaloid-containing dietary supplements. Therefore, the only viable approach available to FDA is one in which the agency prohibits levels of a substance in, or conditions of use for, a dietary supplement that it can prove may render the product injurious to health or that present a significant or unreasonable risk of illness and injury under the conditions of use suggested or recommended in the labeling or under ordinary conditions of use.     The agency is unaware of any classical toxicological studies whose results identify ``no adverse effect levels'' for ephedrine alkaloids directly applicable to humans, or whose results establish intake- response curves for ephedrine alkaloids in dietary supplements and that could be used to establish a level of ephedrine alkaloids that are safe for consumers to use in dietary supplements. The intake-response relationships between ephedrine alkaloids and their effects in humans are unknown for both botanical sources and marketed dietary supplement products containing ephedrine alkaloids. Moreover, because there are consumers who may be sensitive to the effects of ephedrine alkaloids because of a variety of factors that are not readily identifiable or predictable, a margin of safety based on classical toxicological principles likely cannot be determined. For these reasons, the agency tentatively finds that the use of a classical toxicological approach to determine a safe level of ephedrine alkaloids in dietary supplements is not a usable approach.     Several members of the Food Advisory Committee recommended that FDA consider the risk associated with the use of dietary supplements containing ephedrine alkaloids in the context of any benefit that the consumer may receive from the use of these products (Ref. 25). In applying a risk-to-benefit calculation, a certain amount of risk may be accepted if there is a meaningful benefit to be gained by the consumer (Ref. 25). However, the Food Advisory Committee members were unable to identify a benefit for ephedrine alkaloids in terms of supplementing the diet (Ref. 25). Moreover, risk-benefit analysis is something that is done under the act for drugs, not food.     Several members of the Working Group suggested that any limitations on the level of ephedrine alkaloids in dietary supplements be based on the use of pharmaceutical ephedrine in OTC oral bronchodilator drugs and the use of Ephedra in traditional herbal medicine (Ref. 27). Other members of the Working Group and several members of the Food Advisory Committee found difficulty in extrapolating from OTC drug data because the products, the populations using the products, and intended use of the products are dissimilar (Ref. 25). In addition, the latter members were concerned about the potential for adverse events to occur, particularly in populations sensitive to the effects of ephedrine alkaloids, if therapeutic levels of ephedrine are used in dietary supplements (Ref. 25). Several members of the Food Advisory Committee were also concerned about using data from the use of Ephedra in traditional herbal therapies to support the safety of the use of ephedrine alkaloids in dietary supplements because the therapeutic use of ephedrine alkaloids has traditionally not involved the same conditions, the same populations, or the same purposes as those under which dietary supplements are used (Ref. 25).     The agency considered the applicability of OTC drug data and tentatively concluded that these data, which involve use in a restricted population (physician-diagnosed mild asthmatics) under limited directions for use (i.e., not to exceed 12.5 to 25 mg every 4 hours, not to exceed 150 mg in 24 hours) and with warnings and contraindications for use, has no application here. The determination of safety for drugs is based on a weighing of the proven benefits of the use of the product against the risks. This approach may not be used with foods under section 402(a) of the act. The only question for food use under this section is whether it will cause harm or not. While the concept of ``unreasonable risk'' as stated in section 402(f)(1)(A) of the act, may imply that some evaluation of effects, including risks and benefits, is appropriate for dietary supplements, it is not necessary to reach that question here, because, as stated above, there are no demonstrated benefits for ephedrine alkaloids. Moreover, the risks attendant on consuming dietary supplements containing levels of ephedrine permitted in oral bronchodilator drugs (12.5 to 25 mg ephedrine per dose) are manifest.     In addition, there is no basis for extrapolating from data from a subgroup of the population, diagnosed asthmatics, who may be less sensitive to the effects of ephedrine (Ref. 25) than the general population, to the general population, among which a significant number of people are known or suspected of being very sensitive to ephedrine.     Finally, the agency finds it inappropriate to extrapolate data from the use of OTC ephedrine-containing drugs because dietary supplements contain a mixture of several ephedrine alkaloids and a variety of other ingredients, including vitamins, minerals, other botanicals, and other physiological and pharmacologically active substances, while OTC drugs contain only a single ephedrine alkaloid. The presence of other alkaloids and substances in dietary supplements may act to increase the likelihood, frequency, and severity of adverse events from the use of these products. In fact, clinical studies show that adverse events are more likely to occur when ephedrine is combined with other substances, such as caffeine. Therefore, the fact that pharmaceutical ephedrine   Page 30705   has been approved by FDA for an OTC use does not provide assurance of safety for the use of ephedrine alkaloids in dietary supplements.     The agency considered the applicability of traditional use of botanical sources of ephedrine alkaloids in establishing dietary ingredient levels for ephedrine alkaloids in dietary supplements. A history of long usage of a medicinal herb in traditional therapies does not provide an assurance of safety for a component of a dietary supplement because these conditions of use are so different. The history of use of Ephedra in traditional Asian medicine primarily for the treatment or relief of respiratory symptoms provides insufficient assurance that ephedrine alkaloids will not present a significant or an unreasonable risk of injury to consumers who use dietary supplement products containing ephedrine alkaloids to supplement the diet. Not only are dietary supplements marketed for different uses than the traditional use of Ephedra, most dietary supplements are marketed in a form that is different than the form in which it has been traditionally used, e.g., as a concentrated extract in capsules and tablets, in the presence of other substances rather than the raw botanical in a tea.     FDA is not aware of any systematic collection of data related to adverse effects occurring in individuals treated with Ephedra in traditional medicine. However, several reference texts list precautions and contraindications for the use of the botanical Ephedra in traditional medicine preparations (Refs. 6, 14, and 146). Thus, FDA tentatively concludes that use of ephedrine alkaloids in traditional Asian medicine does not provide the basis on which to establish a safe level of use of ephedrine alkaloids in dietary supplements.   IV. Analysis of Impacts       FDA has examined the impacts of the proposed rule under Executive Order 12866 and the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601-612). Executive Order 12866 directs agencies to assess all costs and benefits of available regulatory alternatives and, when regulation is necessary, to select the regulatory approach that maximizes net benefits (including potential economic, environmental, public health and safety, and other advantages; distributive impacts; and equity). Executive Order 12866 classifies a rule as significant if it meets any one of a number of specified conditions, including having an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or adversely affecting in a material way a sector of the economy, competition, or jobs, or if it raises novel legal or policy issues. If a rule has a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities, the Regulatory Flexibility Act requires agencies to analyze regulatory options that would minimize the economic impact of that rule on small entities.     FDA finds that this proposed rule is an economically significant rule as defined by Executive Order 12866, and finds under the Regulatory Flexibility Act that this proposed rule will have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. Finally, FDA, in conjunction with the Administrator of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), finds that this proposed rule is a major rule for the purposes of congressional review (Pub. L. 104-121).   A. Market Failure       The market failure addressed by this regulation is that some consumers may not have sufficient information on the health risks associated with dietary supplements containing ephedrine alkaloids to make informed choices concerning the consumption of these products, despite the presence of warning labels of various types on many of these products. Ordinarily, consumers would be expected to seek out and pay for the level of information they consider appropriate with respect to consumption decisions. However, the level of information currently utilized by consumers with respect to these products may be less than optimal because of consumer perceptions that products marketed as foods or derived from botanical sources are inherently safe, and the cost of generating evidence to evaluate the safety of these products may be quite high. In addition, the onset of the adverse health events associated with these products is frequently quite unexpected or occurs without identifiable risk factors, and consumers may have little or no opportunity to adapt their behavior based on experience with the risks of these products prior to suffering a severe adverse event.   B. Regulatory Options       FDA has the following primary options:     1. Take no action.     2. Take no regulatory action, but generate additional information on which to base a future regulatory action.     3. Take proposed action.     4. Take proposed action, but with a higher potency limit.     5. Ban dietary supplements that contain ephedrine alkaloids.     6. Take proposed action, but do not require warning statement.     7. Require warning statements only.   C. Benefits and Costs   1. Option 1--Take No Action     By convention, the option of taking no action is the baseline in comparison with which the costs and benefits of the other options are determined. Therefore, neither additional costs nor benefits are associated with taking no action. Although no regulatory costs or benefits are generated if no regulatory action is taken, preventable adverse events will continue to occur if no regulatory action is taken. The number of such adverse events is expected to increase over time because the marketplace for these types of products has been increasing rapidly since the 1994 passage of the DSHEA, and the number of AER's associated with use of these products has also been increasing sharply over the last few years (Figure 1). 2. Option 2--Take No Regulatory Action, but Generate Additional Information on Which To Base a Future Regulatory Action     FDA has the option of taking no regulatory action but generating additional information on which to base future regulatory action on this issue. The benefit of generating additional information is a reduction in the substantial uncertainty concerning the specific nature of the relationship of the adverse events associated with dietary supplements containing ephedrine alkaloids and, possibly, a more precisely targeted regulation. A more precisely targeted regulation could imply potency limits either higher or lower than the proposed potency limits, and either more or fewer ingredient and labeling restrictions than those proposed. The cost of generating additional information is the cost of whatever activity is undertaken to generate the additional information and the health cost of any adverse events to these products that would occur if regulatory action were delayed but that would not occur if regulatory action were not delayed. 3. Option 3--Take Proposed Action     a. Benefits. The benefit of the proposed action is a potential reduction in the number or severity of adverse events associated with dietary supplements containing ephedrine alkaloids. The proposed rule consists of the following four actions: (1) Per day and per serving potency limits on total ephedrine alkaloids (TEA), (2) restrictions on caffeine and other   Page 30706   stimulants, (3) mandatory warning statement, and (4) labeling restrictions.     To estimate the benefits of these actions, a percentage decrease in the current number of adverse events associated with dietary supplements containing ephedrine alkaloids will be estimated for each regulatory action listed above. The estimated effects of all proposed actions will then be combined to obtain a total reduction in the expected annual number of adverse events. This percentage reduction will then be applied to an estimate of the current number of such adverse events to obtain an estimated number of adverse events avoided per year. The estimate of the current number of adverse events will be based on, but not identical to, the current number of relevant AER's because of uncertainty over a number of issues including, for example, the degree to which the relevant adverse events are reported. These sources of uncertainty will be discussed in greater detail later.     Each of the proposed actions may affect the number of adverse events by reducing the number of people who consume the relevant products or by modifying their use of these products in a manner that reduces the risk of an adverse effect. In addition, the potency limits and ingredient restrictions may affect the number of adverse events by reducing the probability that those who consume these products will suffer an adverse event. Each of these effects will be considered in turn, beginning with the effect of the proposed actions on the number of people who consume these products.     The proposed potency limits and other ingredient restrictions may affect the number of people consuming these products because they may affect the value placed by consumers on the use of these products. Some information on the likely effect of the proposed potency limits on the consumption of these products comes from a report from one firm that marketed an ephedrine alkaloid-free substitute for a supplement that previously contained ephedrine alkaloids. The sales of the substitute product were reportedly approximately 33 percent lower than the sales of the ephedrine alkaloid-containing product (Ref. 211). In the absence of more specific information, it is reasonable to suppose that a given reduction in sales is associated with a proportionate reduction in the number of people consuming these products.     It would not be reasonable to suppose the proposed potency limits and other ingredient restrictions would have a greater effect on the sales of these products than complete elimination of all ephedrine alkaloids from these products. First, the functional effect, as perceived by consumers, of removing all ephedrine alkaloids from a product is probably greater than the perceived functional effect of removing some of the ephedrine alkaloids and removing some ingredients that interact with those ephedrine alkaloids. Second, if only some firms remove ephedrine alkaloids from their products, relatively close substitutes will exist for the prior formulations of those products because other firms might not remove ephedrine alkaloids from their products. However, if all firms make the same changes in their products, then relatively close substitutes will not exist for the prior formulations of those products. Therefore, the proposed potency limits and other ingredient restrictions are estimated to reduce the number of people consuming these products by between 0 to 33 percent. The effect of the potency limits on the probability of an adverse event for those who continue to consume these products will be addressed later in this section.     The proposed warning statement is also likely to reduce the number of people consuming these products because a few of the relevant products do not currently have warning statements, and because, in some cases, the proposed warning statement is more comprehensive, more focused, and more strongly worded than existing warning statements. The only information available on the effect of warning statements on sales concerns diet soft drinks containing saccharin. Following the introduction of warning statements relating to saccharin, annual sales of diet soft drinks containing saccharin were reported to be 15 percent below what they would otherwise have been (Ref. 212). The effect of the proposed warning statement for dietary supplements containing ephedrine alkaloids will probably be smaller than the effect of the saccharin warning label on diet soft drinks because most such supplements already have some type of warning statement. Therefore, the proposed warning statement will probably reduce the number of people consuming these products by 0 to 15 percent.     The proposed label claim restrictions are also likely to reduce the number of people consuming these products by making the marketing of these products more difficult. The only information available on the potential effects of label claims on sales concerns ready-to-eat breakfast cereals. Following an advertising campaign relating bran consumption to a reduced risk of developing cancer, sales of high bran breakfast cereals were reported to have increased approximately 40 percent (Ref. 213). The effect of eliminating label claims on dietary supplements containing ephedrine alkaloids will probably be smaller because the claims involved are more general, and because other sources of information on the purported effects of ephedrine alkaloids are readily available or have been used recently enough that consumers are familiar with them.     However, approximately 10 percent of the AER's involved supplements labeled as alternatives to street drugs. Assuming that consumers of these products will not purchase these products if they are not labeled as alternatives to street drugs, the labeling restriction will reduce expected adverse events by at least 10 percent. Therefore, the proposed restriction on label claims will probably reduce the number of people consuming these products by between 10 percent and 40 percent.     In addition to these consumption effects, the proposed potency limits and ingredient restrictions will probably also decrease the likelihood that those who continue to consume these products will suffer an adverse event.     FDA is not aware of clinical information, particularly evidence from well-designed and conducted human studies on the relationship between intakes of ephedrine alkaloids from botanicals and the probability of an adverse event. One method of approaching the estimation of the health benefits of reduced exposure to ephedrine alkaloids is to consider the proportion of adverse event reports that involve products with TEA levels greater than that allowed under the proposed potency limits. FDA was able to obtain information on the actual exposures associated with adverse events for 13 products that provided intakes of less than 20 mg TEA per reported use by multiplying the consumer's reported use level against an FDA product analysis result. These reports provided information on the lower end of the range of estimated intakes by consumers. Among these 13 reports of adverse events associated with intakes of less than 20 mg, 9 involved consumer intakes of between 8 mg and 20 mg/per serving. This approach suggests that the proposed potency limit might reduce the expected number of adverse events by at least 80 percent, although the actual reduction is probably higher because the 13 reports did not include the many adverse event reports that occurred at intakes above 20 mg TEA per serving. On the other hand, the actual reduction might also be lower because the 13 reports did not include   Page 30707   all adverse event reports that occurred at intakes below 20 mg TEA per serving.     This approach to estimating the impact of the proposed potency limits assumes that the probability of an adverse event is related to intakes of TEA. If the probability of an adverse event is not related to TEA intake, then the potency limits may result in little or no reduction in the expected number of adverse event reports. For example, if individual sensitivities to ephedrine alkaloids are the major underlying factor in the reported adverse events, then it is possible that there may be no ``safe'' intake for these persons. Based on this information, all that can be said concerning the proposed potency limits is that they may reduce the expected number of adverse events by between 0 to 80 percent.     The restriction on other stimulants, including caffeine, should also reduce the probability of an adverse event. Combinations of ephedrine alkaloids and caffeine, at sufficiently high doses, are associated with an increased probability of an adverse event. For example, one study found that 60 percent of the study subjects had an adverse reaction to a combination of 20 mg ephedrine and 200 mg caffeine, while only 44 percent had an adverse reaction to 20 mg ephedrine alone (Ref. 105). Thus, in this study, the presence of 200 mg caffeine appears to have increased the probability of an adverse event from consumption of 20 mg ephedrine by about 50 percent. Comparable information is not available on the effect of combinations of ephedrine and caffeine at lower levels of either ephedrine or caffeine. Similarly, no information is available on the effect of other stimulants or other ephedrine alkaloids.     An informal review of 217 adverse event reports featuring dietary supplements suspected of containing ephedrine alkaloids found that 99 reports featured products for which labeled ingredient information was available. Of those reports, 70 percent involved products labeled as containing a source of caffeine. The levels of caffeine and ephedrine alkaloids in these products is not known. Assuming that these adverse event reports are typical of all relevant adverse event reports and that 50 percent of the reported adverse events to products labeled as containing caffeine may have been due to the presence of caffeine in conjunction with ephedrine alkaloids, the restriction on stimulants is estimated to reduce the expected number of adverse events by up to 35 percent. However, the impact of the proposed stimulant restrictions may be somewhat lower because the impact may depend on the levels of stimulants and ephedrine alkaloids involved, and the levels of stimulants and ephedrine alkaloids found in dietary supplements may be lower than the levels used in the study on which this estimate is based. In order to address this possibility, the restrictions on stimulants will be assumed to reduce the expected number of adverse reactions by 25 percent.     In order to use the estimated risk reductions discussed above to derive an expected reduction in the number of adverse events, the current number of adverse events must be estimated. There are a number of issues involved in estimating the current number of adverse events based on the number of reported adverse events.     The first issue is that the data base of over 600 AER's includes all reports thought to be related to the consumption of ephedrine alkaloid-containing dietary supplements, even though the nature of the available evidence did not allow specific cause and effect determinations for the majority of individual reports. FDA, therefore, used additional information to provide assurance that the patterns of signs and symptoms associated with the ephedrine alkaloid-containing dietary supplements were likely due to the presence of ephedrine alkaloids in these products. One approach to addressing this issue is to examine the evidence for positive dechallenge and rechallenge when product use is discontinued and reinitiated, respectively. The relationship of the reported adverse events to the consumption of dietary supplements categorized as containing ephedrine alkaloids has been corroborated by dechallenge in about 27 percent of the AER's. Positive rechallenge was reported in about 4 percent of the AER's. The majority of AER's, however, lacked sufficient information to evaluate the presence or absence of dechallenge or rechallenge effects. Therefore, the number of cases in which dechallenge alone or in combination with rechallenge was tried but did not occur is not available; nor is there information on whether dechallenge and rechallenge would have occurred in the large number of reports which lack such information. It is possible that all cases might have been associated with positive dechallenge and rechallenge results if such information were available. On the other hand, a certain number of false reports might also be expected. The proportion of reported adverse events actually related to the consumption of dietary supplements suspected of containing ephedrine alkaloids is probably between 27 and 90 percent. Within this range, FDA believes the most likely value is around 80 percent and, therefore, tentatively assumes that 80 percent of the reported adverse events are actually related to the consumption of dietary supplements. FDA requests comments on this assumption.     The second issue is the uncertainty that all 600 AER's involved products that actually contained ephedrine alkaloids. Confirmation of the presence of ephedrine alkaloids in problem products is not available in all cases. The likelihood of the presence of ephedrine alkaloids is based on the labeling of the products involved, FDA's own market survey (including laboratory analysis of 125 marketed products), and the similarity of the reported adverse events to the known effects of ephedrine alkaloids. The proportion of reported adverse events associated with dietary supplements that involve supplements containing ephedrine alkaloids is probably between 25 and 90 percent. Within this range, FDA believes the most likely value is around 80 percent and, therefore, tentatively assumes that 80 percent of the reported adverse events associated with consumption of dietary supplements involve supplements that contain ephedrine. FDA requests comments on this assumption.     The third issue is that the actual number of adverse events is likely to differ from the reported number of adverse events because all adverse events are probably not reported. This issue is particularly important with respect to passive reporting systems that rely on the voluntary submission of data, such as the system used to gather the AER's relevant to this issue.     Typical reporting rates for passive reporting systems addressed to adverse events associated with drugs are generally assumed to be on the order of 10 percent. Reporting rates are higher than usual if the potential health risks associated with a particular substance are widely publicized, if the adverse events are considered to be otherwise unusual, and if reports are gathered from a variety of sources. On the other hand, reporting rates would be lower than usual if consumers and physicians assume that dietary supplements are incapable of producing adverse events because they are not drugs or because they are ``natural.'' In order to incorporate this uncertainty, the reporting rate for the relevant adverse events is assumed to be 10 percent.     Based on the current number of reported adverse events and the assumptions discussed above   Page 30708   concerning the relationship between the number of reported adverse events and the underlying number of adverse events, the expected annual number of adverse events involving these products is approximately 1,100 cases. Applying the risk reductions discussed previously for the proposed actions implies a reduction in the health risks from these products such that the expected number of adverse events involving these products will be reduced by between approximately 400 cases and 1,100 cases per year. Based on published estimates of the value consumers might place on reducing the risk of the general types of adverse events involved, these benefits are valued at between $240 million and $670 million per year (Ref. 215).     Table 6 summarizes these results. The first column is the type of adverse event. ``Serious CVS'' refers to serious cardiovascular system events, including myocardial infarctions, dysrhythmias, strokes, and cardiomyopathies. ``Serious NS'' refers to serious nervous system events, including seizures, loss of consciousness, vestibular events, and psychiatric events. ``Less clinically significant'' events may include certain types of dermatological events and gastrointestinal events. The second column is the average annual number of AER's from January 1993 to June 1996. Because the sales of these products is increasing rapidly, and the reports of adverse events are also increasing rapidly (see Figure 1), FDA believes that this is a conservative estimate of benefits. The 3-year average has been used rather than the growth trend because extrapolating short-term growth trends into the future can result in large errors. The third column is the estimated average annual number of adverse events over this time period based on what FDA believes are the most likely values for the relevant assumptions. The fourth column is the estimated reduction in adverse events from all proposed actions, given as a range from low to high. These estimated reductions are based on adding the effects of the proposed actions as summarized in Table 7. The low end of this range represents a 35 percent reduction in the estimated annual adverse events and the high end represents a 100 percent reduction. The estimates have been rounded to the nearest ten. The fifth column is the value of reducing the risk of particular adverse events such that one expected adverse event is avoided per year across the at-risk population, in thousands of dollars. The sixth column is the estimated value of the annual risk reductions for the various adverse events in millions of dollars, given as a range from low to high, rounded to the nearest million.

Trends in the data were not extrapolated because of the short timeframe involved. <SUP>2 Estimated annual cases are based on the following assumptions: (1) 80 percent of the reported adverse events   involving the consumption of dietary supplements suspected of containing ephedrine alkaloids are actually   related to the consumption of dietary supplements, (2) 80 percent of the supplements involved in the reported   adverse events that are related to the consumption of supplements actually contain ephedrine alkaloids, and   (3) 10 percent of adverse events to the dietary supplements containing ephedrine alkaloids are reported. Thus,   the estimated number of annual cases is 0.8  x  0.8  x  10 times the number of annual reported cases.   Considerable uncertainty exists with respect to the validity of the assumptions on which this estimate is   based and the actual number of annual cases may be higher or lower than the estimate. <SUP>3 The low end of the range of the reduction in estimated annual cases represents a 35 percent reduction in   estimated annual cases. The high end of this range represents a 100 percent reduction in estimated annual   cases. The 35 percent and 100 percent estimates are based on adding up the estimated effects of the proposed   actions, as indicated in Table 7. <SUP>4 The value of the risk reduction per case is based on published estimates of the value consumers place on   reducing the risk of the general types of adverse events involved (Ref. 215). <SUP>5 The value of the estimated risk reduction is based on multiplying the risk reduction per case times the   reduction in the estimated annual cases.

Costs. The primary social costs of the proposed actions are the compliance costs, which include the one-time costs associated with relabeling and reformulating the affected supplements and the recurring costs associated with testing for the level of ephedrine alkaloids in conjunction with future product reformulations or changes in ingredients, and the value of the utility losses to any consumers who do not value the reformulated supplements as highly as supplements currently found on the market. This cost must be considered somewhat paradoxical because the cause of this loss of value, the reduction or removal of ephedrine alkaloids, would also reduce or eliminate the risks associated with using these products. In addition, indirect social costs in the form of capital losses and temporary unemployment may arise from the distributive effects of the proposed action, which are discussed below. Some portion of the compliance costs will be borne by manufacturers and distributors of these products, and some portion will be passed on to consumers of these products. Costs borne by manufactures and distributors will be borne by the owners, stockholders, and employees of those firms.     In addition to the potential impact of compliance costs, manufacturers and distributors of the dietary supplements containing ephedrine alkaloids will be adversely affected by the reduction in consumption of these products caused by the proposed actions. Also, manufacturers, distributors, and importers of raw or bulk Ma huang and other affected ingredients may be affected by these consumption effects. These effects are distributive effects rather than social costs because they do not involve the loss of productive resources, and because a loss of business in one sector of the economy is generally associated with an increase in business in competing sectors. However, as indicated above, social costs may be involved to the extent that otherwise productive capital investment is lost and temporary unemployment is generated. In addition, distributive effects are obviously very significant to the affected parties.     FDA has previously estimated the cost of relabeling all dietary supplements in the economic impact analysis for the proposal on nutrition labeling of dietary supplements that was published in the Federal Register of December 28, 1995 (60 FR 67184) (the December 1995 proposal). Total discounted labeling costs based on an 18 month compliance period were estimated to be between $52 and $85 million. This cost included recurring testing or analytical costs based on testing the nutrient content of each product an average of once every 5 years. Based on comments to the December 1995 proposal, these estimates were revised in the economic impact analysis of the final rule. The revised estimate was $194 million, with $91 million of these costs occurring in the first 18 months and the remainder being a discounted sum of future analytical costs. In order to use this estimate as a basis for estimating labeling costs for the current proposal, the previous estimate must be adjusted to account for the compliance period associated with this rule and the fact that not all dietary supplements contain ephedrine alkaloids.     The proposed effective date of any regulation based on this proposal will be 180 days after the date of publication of the final rule. If the nutritional labeling rule had a compliance period of 180 days rather than 18 months, the total estimated labeling costs would have been $334 million, with $286 million of these costs occurring in the first 6 months.     Adjusting the previous estimate to account for the fact that not all dietary supplements contain ephedrine alkaloids requires information on the proportion of dietary supplements that contain ephedrine alkaloids. The market surveys identified 125 dietary supplements suspected of containing ephedrine alkaloids. A public comment submitted to the Special Working Group of the Food Advisory Committee suggested the number of such products is at least 200 (Ref. 216). In the December 1995 proposal, the total number of dietary supplement products was estimated to be between 4,000 and 25,000. In the final rule entitled ``Iron-Containing Supplements and Drugs: Label Warning Statements and Unit-Dose Packaging Requirements'' that published in the Federal Register of January 15, 1997 (62 FR 2218), this estimate was revised to 29,000. If 200 dietary supplements contain ephedrine alkaloids, then about 1 percent of the estimated total number of dietary supplements contain ephedrine alkaloids and the cost of changing the labels on dietary supplements containing ephedrine alkaloids would be about 1 percent of the costs estimated for changing the labels on all dietary supplements.     Another method of estimating the proportion of dietary supplements that contain ephedrine alkaloids is to use sales data. This method is complicated by the fact that sales might not be evenly distributed across dietary supplements, implying that the proportion of dietary supplement sales accounted for by supplements that contain ephedrine alkaloids may not be the same as the proportion of dietary supplement products that contain ephedrine alkaloids.     Ma huang and other ephedra products have been reported to represent 3.5 percent of individual botanical sales in selected health food stores, while individual sales of products containing single botanicals are estimated to make up about 53 percent of total botanical supplement use (Ref. 3). Information is not available on the proportion of products with multiple botanical ingredients that contain ephedrine alkaloids. Botanical supplement retail sales have been estimated to have accounted for approximately 26 percent of total dietary supplement retail sales in 1995 (Ref. 217). However, this estimate includes a number of product categories under dietary supplements that would not be considered dietary supplements under the legal definition of a dietary supplement. After adjusting for the definition of dietary supplements, supplements containing botanicals accounted for approximately 35 percent of dietary supplement retail sales in 1995. The definition of dietary supplement used in this estimate includes vitamins, minerals, and botanical (including herbal) supplements.     If all supplements containing ephedrine alkaloids are characterized as   Page 30710   botanical supplements, this information suggests that between 1 and 17 percent of dietary supplement use involves products that contain ephedrine alkaloids. If the proportion of dietary supplement products containing ephedrine alkaloids reflects the proportion of dietary supplement sales accounted for by products containing ephedrine alkaloids, then between 1 and 17 percent of the total number of dietary supplement products contain ephedrine alkaloids, or between 200 and 5,000 products.     Based on the preceding information, labeling costs for this proposal are estimated to be between 1 and 17 percent of the costs previously estimated for changing the labels on all dietary supplements, after adjusting those costs for the length of the compliance period. Thus, total discounted labeling costs for this proposal are estimated to be between $3 million and $60 million, with between approximately $3 million and $50 million of these costs occurring in the first year and between a minimal amount and approximately $0.5 million in every year after the first year.     If the proposed 180 day compliance period for making the proposed label changes coincided with some portion of the 18-month compliance period of the final rule requiring nutritional labeling of dietary supplements, then some portion of the combined labeling costs of the two regulations would be eliminated because some firms would be able to make both labeling changes during normally scheduled labeling changes. The degree of overlap of the compliance periods of these regulations depends on the date on which the final rule is published. If appropriate, this consideration will be addressed in the economic analyses of the final rule.     Information is not available on the cost of reformulating the affected products. Reformulation may simply involve reducing the amount of the ingredient source of the ephedrine alkaloids and removing the restricted ingredients. One method of approaching this issue is to consider the types of personnel and the amount of effort that might be required for reformulation. A reasonable assumption is that it might take a scientist from 1 to 4 weeks to develop an acceptable reformulation. In this case, the cost of reformulating a product would be between $1,000 and $5,000, based on median weekly earnings data for 1994 and 50 percent overhead (Ref. 218).     Many dietary supplements containing ephedrine alkaloids probably contain restricted ingredients or do not meet the proposed potency limits on TEA and will either have to be reformulated or removed from the market. The number of dietary supplements containing ephedrine alkaloids has been estimated, above, to be between 200 and 5,000. Under this assumption, if all products were reformulated, the one-time cost of reformulating the affected products would be between $0.2 million and $25 million. The recurring costs associated with testing for ephedrine alkaloid levels in conjunction with future product reformulations was addressed in the labeling costs.     Another cost associated with product reformulation is the cost of any inventory losses involving products produced prior to the publication of a final rule based on this proposal that cannot be sold by the date that final rule goes into effect. The proposed effective date of any final rule on this issue is 180 days after publication of the final rule. FDA has no information on the amount of inventory typically carried for these products, but tentatively assumes that 180 days will provide sufficient time to utilize existing stock.     In addition to the compliance costs discussed above, the proposed action will also lead to utility losses for some consumers because it removes products with certain characteristics from the marketplace. Theoretically, the value of this utility loss is the difference in the value consumers placed on the eliminated products and the value of the products purchased in place of the eliminated products. Estimating this loss requires estimating demand curves for the eliminated products and for the products substituted for the eliminated products.     Identifying likely substitutes for dietary supplements as currently formulated is complicated by the fact that a wide range of effects are attributed to these supplements, for example, energy, weight loss, body building, and increased mental concentration. However, little reliable information is available on the actual effects produced by these supplements. In addition, various other botanical substances exist that might be used in supplements to replace either some portion of the ephedrine alkaloids or the restricted ingredients and might produce effects that consumers may perceive to be similar to the effects that consumers attributed to these supplements as currently formulated. Finally, FDA has insufficient information to estimate demand curves for dietary supplements containing ephedrine alkaloids or potential substitutes for these products.     Based on these considerations, FDA cannot place bounds on the value of the consumer utility losses that may be associated with this action. However, if substitute products could be identified, then the absolute price difference between the affected products and the substitute products would represent a lower bound on consumer utility losses. No comparable argument is available for the upper bound of the utility loss.     In addition to compliance costs and utility losses, the proposed action will also generate distributive effects. The total reduction in the consumption of dietary supplements containing ephedrine alkaloids from all proposed actions including the potency limits, ingredient restrictions, labeling restrictions, and mandatory warning statement was estimated in the analysis of the benefits of this option to be between 10 percent and 33 percent. Total annual sales of supplements containing Ma huang have been estimated to be between $600 million and $700 million (Ref. 219). Therefore, sales of these products may be reduced by between $60 million and $230 million per year. Information is not available on the total annual sales of supplements containing sources of ephedrine alkaloids other than Ma huang.     Countervailing effects may also take place which may reduce the impact of these negative distributive effects on affected firms. For example, the proposed rule may reduce the number of product liability lawsuits brought against manufacturers of dietary supplements containing ephedrine alkaloids. FDA has insufficient information on the current incidence or cost of these lawsuits to estimate the effect of this reduction, if any, on the negative distributive effects generated by consumption changes. Of course, distributive effects that are negative with respect to a given industry will be positive with respect to some other industry.     Finally, social costs may be associated with these distributive effects. For example, some portion of the value of the capital invested in the production of these supplements may be lost and that loss might not be offset by other effects, such as an augmentation to the value of the capital invested in the production of substitutes. However, FDA has insufficient information to estimate the social costs that might be associated with these distributive effects.     Under these assumptions, the proposed action will generate total compliance costs of between $3 million and $80 million, plus unquantifiable utility losses to consumers of these products. Between $3 million and $70 million of these costs will occur in the   Page 30711   first 6 months after publication of the final rule. In addition, the proposed action will produce distributive effects of between $60 million and $230 million per year and social costs might be associated with those distributive effects. Because the sales of these products are increasing rapidly, FDA believes that this is a conservative estimate of cost and distributive effects. Again, extrapolations have not been made on the growth trend because extrapolating short-term trends into the future can result in large errors. Costs and sales reductions of this magnitude may threaten the viability of many firms in this industry. If some of these firms go out of business, temporary unemployment of labor and permanent loss of capital resources may result. FDA has insufficient information to estimate these costs. 4. Option 4--Take Proposed Action, but With a Higher Potency Limit     Another option is to take all proposed actions but adopt potency limits higher than the proposed potency limits. For example, some trade associations representing the dietary supplement industry have previously expressed support for potency limits of 12 mg/serving and 50 mg/day TEA (Ref. 220). With respect to benefits arising from consumption effects (i.e., the likelihood of reducing the number or seriousness of adverse events), FDA has some information to estimate the effect of variations between the proposed potency limits and higher potency limits on the consumption effects associated with those limits. That is, of the 13 reports of adverse events for which exposure data for intakes less than 20 mg per serving were also available, 5 were in the range between 8 and 12 mg per serving intake.     If consumption is sensitive to small changes in the potency limits, then higher potency limits would reduce the benefits resulting from consumption effects because higher potency limits would presumably have a smaller effect on the effects of these products than the proposed potency limits. Therefore, the effect of raising the potency limits on benefits arising from shifts in consumption will be to reduce those benefits below those generated under Option 3.     Raising the proposed potency limits will not affect the one-time compliance costs but might reduce utility losses to consumers of these products and the distributive effects produced by consumption shifts. Again, these changes may occur because higher potency limits might have a somewhat smaller impact on the perceived benefits of these products than the proposed potency limits. However, as indicated above, FDA has insufficient information to estimate the effect of small changes in the potency limits on the consumption effects produced by those limits and cannot estimate the utility losses associated with various potency limits. 5. Option 5--Ban Dietary Supplements That Contain Ephedrine Alkaloids     Based on the framework used earlier, banning dietary supplements that contain ephedrine alkaloids would lead to a somewhat higher lower bound on estimated benefits. In particular, banning these products would reduce the health risks from these products such that the expected number of adverse events are reduced by between approximately 120 cases and 1,400 cases per year.     Banning dietary supplements that contain ephedrine alkaloids will not change the one time compliance costs estimated under Option 3 because all affected products were subject to reformulation and relabeling costs under Option 3. However, banning these products would decrease access to these products by consumers who may perceive benefits, thus substantially increasing the potential utility losses to consumers. With respect to distributive effects generated by consumption changes, the total reduction in the consumption of dietary supplements that now contain ephedrine would probably be approximately 33 percent under this option, that is, at the high end of the range of 10 to 33 percent estimated under Option 3. Therefore, sales of these products would be reduced by between $200 million and $230 million per year. Costs and sales reductions of this magnitude may threaten the viability of many of the firms producing these products. However, countervailing distributive effects are also possible in that some firms that currently produce dietary supplements containing ephedrine alkaloids may also produce or be able to produce substitute products. In that case, those firms would avoid some or all of the costs associated with producing dietary supplements containing ephedrine alkaloids. 6. Option 6--Take Proposed Action, but Do Not Require Warning Statement     The purpose of the proposed warning statement is to focus existing warnings more precisely on the health risks posed by these products, particularly in cases where any use of these products may be contraindicated, and to add warnings to those products which do not already have warning statements. Even with the proposed potency limits and ingredient restrictions, some consumers may be at high risk of suffering an adverse event from consuming these products because of high individual sensitivity to these products, because of an increase in risk associated with simultaneous consumption of drug products, or because of an underlying health condition. Thus, the proposed warning statement is expected to have some benefit independent of the other proposed requirements. Eliminating the proposed mandatory warning statement will affect estimated labeling costs because, under this option, only those labels affected by the claims restrictions would have to be changed. However, the vast majority of the affected products have labels that would be affected by the claims restrictions. Among the products in the market surveys, 94 percent of the products investigated had one or more claims that would be restricted under this option. Thus, labeling costs under this option will be only approximately 6 percent lower than the labeling costs estimated for Option 3.     Finally, under the framework developed earlier, this option will have little effect on the other costs and distributive effects estimated for the proposed action under Option 3 because of the influence of the other factors involved. 7. Option 7--Require Warning Statements Only     Estimating the benefit of eliminating all proposed actions except the required warning statement involves a controversial value judgment concerning the evaluation of risks that are voluntarily accepted in the presence of the amount of information on those risks provided on the proposed warning statement.     Under the assumption that any adverse events that may occur due to such behavior cannot represent net social costs, warning statements will eliminate all net social costs associated with these adverse events. This assumption is based on the notion that the proposed warning statement provides adequate information on the risks of consuming these products and the notion that if those consuming these products have adequate information on the risks involved, then their consumption decisions reflect their personal judgments concerning the relative value of the benefits and risks of consuming these products.     If no existing warning statements provide adequate information while the proposed warning statement will   Page 30712   provide adequate information, then the social benefits of this option would be at least as great as the value of banning dietary supplements containing ephedrine alkaloids. On the other hand, if some existing warning statements already provide adequate information, then the benefits of this option would still be at least as great as the value of banning dietary supplements containing ephedrine alkaloids; however, the benefits of both options would be lower.     Under the assumption that any adverse events that may occur due to such behavior represent social costs, eliminating all actions other than the proposed warning statement will substantially reduce the benefits from those estimated for Option 3. This assumption is based either on the notion that the level of information provided on the proposed warning statement is inadequate to ensure that consumers can make informed consumption decisions, or on the notion that public health risks require intervention even if those risks are voluntarily undertaken in the presence of adequate information on the benefits and risks of the relevant activity. Under this assumption, this option will reduce the health risks from these products such that the expected number of adverse events will be reduced by between 0 cases and approximately 210 cases per year.     With respect to compliance costs, eliminating all actions except the warning statement would eliminate the costs associated with product reformulation and consumer utility losses.     Finally, this option would substantially reduce the distributive effects of this action. Under this option, the estimated total reduction in the consumption of dietary supplements containing ephedrine alkaloids would be between 0 and 15 percent. Therefore, sales of these products would be reduced by between $0 and $110 million per year. A reduction in sales of this magnitude would threaten the viability of fewer firms than the proposed action, as estimated under Option 3.   V. Regulatory Flexibility Analysis       In the economic impact analysis for the December 1995 proposal, FDA estimated the number of dietary supplement manufacturers to be between 150 and 600, with the majority of those firms being small businesses. Based on additional information, these estimates were revised in the economic impact analysis of the final rule on nutritional labeling. The revised estimate was 500 to 850 firms, with 95 percent of those firms classified as small businesses.     The proportion of dietary supplement manufacturers producing products containing ephedrine alkaloids is unknown. The two market surveys identified 85 manufacturers and distributors of dietary supplements suspected of containing ephedrine alkaloids. Assuming that the proportion of these firms that are small businesses is the same as the proportion of firms in the dietary supplement industry that are small businesses, 95 percent of these firms, or approximately 80 firms, are small businesses.     Total compliance costs incurred by small businesses will be virtually equal to total compliance costs incurred by all businesses estimated earlier because the vast majority of the firms affected by the proposed action are small businesses. Relabeling, reformulation, and testing costs are fixed costs on a per product basis and will disproportionately affect small businesses. Total compliance costs of the proposed action were estimated to be between $3 million and $80 million, with between $3 million and $70 million of these costs occurring in the first 6 months after publication of the final rule. However, FDA has insufficient information to estimate the portion of these costs that will be borne by the owners, stockholders, and employees of these firms and the portion that will be passed on to consumers of these products through price increases. In addition, the proposed action will generate consumption shifts that were previously estimated to produce negative distributive effects of between $60 million and $230 million per year. Countervailing distributive effects are also possible. For example, the proposed rule may reduce the number of product liability lawsuits brought against manufacturers of dietary supplements containing ephedrine alkaloids. Based on reported annual retail sales of between $600 million and $700 million for products containing Ma huang, these costs and distributive effects may be significant.     Most of the regulatory alternatives discussed earlier would reduce the impact of this rule on small businesses. The options of taking no action and taking no action other than generating additional information both reduce the impact on small businesses to zero. Requiring only warning statements would substantially reduce compliance costs to between $3 million and $60 million, with between $3 million and $50 million of these costs occurring in the first 6 months, and also substantially reduce negative distributive effects generated by consumption shifts to between $0 and $110 million per year. Taking the proposed action without requiring the warning statement would slightly reduce compliance costs to between $3 million and $80 million, with between $3 million and $70 million of these costs occurring in the first 6 months, but would not affect distributive effects because of the other factors influencing those effects. Taking the proposed action but raising the proposed potency limit to the level suggested by a trade group representing the dietary supplement industry would probably not significantly alter the impact of this rule on small businesses. Finally, banning dietary supplements containing ephedrine would not change reformulation or relabeling costs and would lead to distributive effects from consumption shifts in the range of $200 million to $230 million per year. This action would have the greatest negative impact on small businesses.   VI. Conclusions       The estimated benefits of Option 3, take the proposed action, are between $240 million and $670 million per year. The estimated quantifiable costs are between approximately $3 and $70 million in the first year, and between a minimal amount and about $0.5 million in every year after the first year. Thus, notwithstanding the considerable uncertainty concerning the marginal effectiveness of the individual requirements of the proposed rule, FDA is confident that it would generate benefits that far exceed the quantifiable costs. In addition to the quantifiable costs, however, the proposed action will also generate non-quantifiable utility losses for some consumers and distributive effects from consumption shifts with an estimated value of between approximately $60 million and $230 million per year, with possible countervailing distributive effects from a reduction of liability lawsuits. Social costs might be associated with these distributive effects.   VII. Environmental Impact       The agency has carefully considered the potential environmental effects of this action. Based on the available information, FDA has concluded that the action will not have a significant impact on the human environment, and that an environmental impact statement is not required. The agency's finding of no significant impact and the evidence supporting that finding, contained in an environmental assessment, may be seen in the Dockets Management Branch (address above) between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday (Ref. 221).   Page 30713   The agency will reevaluate its environmental decision if new information is received suggesting that the action would have significant environmental effects.   VIII. Paperwork Reduction Act       This proposed rule contains no information collection or recordkeeping requirements under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.).   IX.

D   COMMISSIONER      FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION      BEFORE       THE SUBCOMMITTEE ON COMMERCE, TRADE AND CONSUMER PROTECTION     AND    THE SUBCOMMITTEE ON OVERSIGHT AND INVESTIGATIONS   COMMITTEE ON ENERGY AND COMMERCE      UNITED STATES HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES      JULY 24, 2003               INTRODUCTION   Thank you, Mr. Chairman for this opportunity testify before your Subcommittees    at this joint hearing on ephedrine alkaloid containing dietary supplements.   BACKGROUND ON REGULATION OF DIETARY SUPPLEMENTS   More than half of the population of the United States uses “dietary supplements.”    The Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994 (DSHEA) (P.L. 103-417)    set up a unique regulatory framework in an attempt to strike the right balance    between providing consumers access to dietary supplements that they may choose    to use to help maintain and improve their health, and giving FDA the necessary    regulatory authority to take action against supplements or supplement ingredients    that present safety problems, have false or misleading claims, or are otherwise    adulterated or misbranded. Although dietary supplements are generally regulated    as foods, there are special statutory provisions and implementing regulations    for dietary supplements that differ in some respects from those covering “conventional”    foods. Moreover, the regulatory requirements for dietary supplements also differ    from those that apply to drug products (prescription and over-the-counter).   Congress defined the term “dietary supplement” as a product that,    among other things, is ingested, is intended to supplement the diet, is labeled    as a dietary supplement, is not represented as a conventional food or as a sole    item of a meal or the diet, and contains a “dietary ingredient.”    The “dietary ingredients” in these products may include vitamins,    minerals, herbs or other botanicals, amino acids, and dietary substances such    as enzymes. Dietary ingredients also can be metabolites, constituents, extracts,    concentrates, or combinations of the preceding types of ingredients. Dietary    supplements may be found in many forms, such as tablets, capsules, liquids,    or bars. DSHEA placed dietary supplements in a special sub-category under the    general umbrella of “foods,” but products that meet the drug definition    are subject to regulation as drugs.    LABELING OF DIETARY SUPPLEMENTS   Under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic (FD&C) Act and FDA’s implementing    regulations, the label of a dietary supplement must bear a statement of identity    (product name) that identifies the product as a dietary supplement; nutrition    information in the form of a Supplement Facts panel; a list of any ingredients    not listed in the Supplement Facts panel; the name and address of the manufacturer,    packer, or distributor; and the net quantity of contents. In addition, if the    labeling includes a claim to affect the structure or function of the body, a    claim of general well-being, or a claim of a benefit related to a classical    nutrient deficiency disease, the product must also bear a disclaimer stating    that FDA has not evaluated the claim and that the product is not intended to    diagnose, treat, cure, mitigate, or prevent any disease.    Products containing ephedrine alkaloids have unusual features and present complex    regulatory issues. If the product is a botanical, it may meet the definition    of a dietary supplement regulated under DSHEA. On the other hand, if it contains    synthetic ephedrine, that ingredient and other synthetic ephedrine alkaloids    (including pseudoephedrine) are regulated as drugs, which are only marketed    for indications where safety and effectiveness have been demonstrated. Synthetic    ephedrine and pseudoephedrine are available as components of various over-the-counter    and some prescription drug products for treating allergies, asthma, nasal congestion,    and related upper respiratory symptoms. None of these drug products include    other ephedrine alkaloids, caffeine, or other stimulants that may interact with    their effects. Synthetic ephedrine drug products are subject to stringent manufacturing,    labeling, and dosing requirements. There are no synthetic ephedrine drug products    approved for long-term use. Some dietary supplements have been found to contain    synthetic ephedrine and FDA has taken enforcement action against their use.    Nevertheless, synthetic ephedrine poses serious law enforcement and public health    challenges, which are beyond the scope of this testimony.   ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING   DSHEA’s regulatory framework is primarily a postmarket program like the    bulk of food regulation. Thus, as with most foods, there is no requirement for    manufacturers to provide evidence of product safety to FDA prior to marketing    ephedra-containing dietary supplements. In contrast, drug regulation involves    an extensive premarket evaluation of safety and effectiveness with explicit    standards of evidence. This evidence provides a basis to guide not only approval    decisions but also conditions of use to manage benefits and risks. In addition,    there are post-market reporting requirements for drugs to support product safety    monitoring. These requirements do not exist for dietary supplements.   As a result, voluntary adverse event reports (AERs) are the primary means FDA    has for identifying potential safety problems with dietary supplements. Under    DSHEA, FDA must rely on AERs as a major component of its post-market regulatory    surveillance efforts under DSHEA. Also, unlike drug regulation, FDA cannot compel    reporting of adverse events by dietary supplement manufacturers.    FDA’s Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition (CFSAN) has recently    put in place the CFSAN Adverse Event Reporting System (CAERS) to monitor adverse    event reports on food, cosmetics and dietary supplement products. CAERS includes    a comprehensive single computerized system that captures and analyzes all reports    of consumer complaints and adverse events related to CFSAN-regulated products.    This state-of-the-art system started collecting reports after June 15, 2003,    and combines all existing CFSAN adverse event-reporting systems and logs reports    into one portal within CFSAN.     DIETARY SUPPLEMENTS CONTAINING EPHEDRINE ALKALOIDS   A number of plant genera, including ephedra, are known to contain ephedrine    alkaloids. Ma huang is a common name given to Chinese Ephedra, which is used    in traditional Chinese medicine. Ephedra has been shown to contain various chemical    stimulants, including the alkaloids ephedrine, pseudoephedrine and norpseudoephedrine,    as well as various tannins and related chemicals. The concentrations of these    alkaloids depend upon many factors, such as the species, parts of the plant    used, time of harvest, growing location, and production methods. Ephedrine and    pseudoephedrine are used in some over-the-counter and prescription drugs, where    they have been demonstrated to be safe and effective for the labeled use. Many    of these stimulants have known, and potentially serious, side effects. While    ephedra has been used in herbal medicine preparations for thousands of years,    in recent years ephedra has been sold primarily in dietary supplement products    for weight control, as well as in products promoted to boost energy levels or    to enhance athletic performance. Some ephedra-containing products have been    marketed as alternatives to illicit street drugs. Ephedra-containing products    often contain other stimulants, such as caffeine, that may have synergistic    effects and increase the potential for adverse effects.   A number of adverse effects associated with ephedrine alkaloid-containing dietary    supplements have been reported to FDA. These include elevated blood pressure,    rapid heartbeat, nerve damage, muscle injury, and psychosis and memory loss.    More serious effects have also been reported, including heart attack, stroke,    seizure and death.   As the tragic deaths of the Baltimore Orioles’ pitching prospect Steve    Bechler and of Sean Riggins, the sixteen year old from Illinois have reminded    us, use of ephedra, particularly in sports, raises serious concerns about safety    and has long posed difficult issues for health care professionals, regulators,    and for consumers. These concerns stem from both the mechanism of action of    ephedrine alkaloids on the sympathetic nervous system, and accumulating evidence    of potentially serious adverse events after use of ephedra-containing products.     While there has been considerable debate about the safety and effectiveness    of dietary supplements like ephedra, as well as the most effective approach    to regulating them, one thing is clear: Although dietary supplements are regulated    as foods and not drugs, the consumer should not assume they are always safe    to use. “Natural” does not necessarily mean safe. In particular,    botanical and herbal products may have active ingredients with pharmacologic    properties similar to, or in the case of ephedra identical to, drug products.   USE OF EPHEDRA BY ATHLETES   I want to take this opportunity to applaud the National Football League, National    Collegiate Athletic Association, and the International Olympic Committee for    banning the use of ephedra by their players. Although FDA is reviewing ephedrine    alkaloids under DSHEA to assess the safety concerns, FDA has particular concerns    about the use of ephedra by persons engaged in strenuous exercise. A recent    study by RAND, discussed in more detail below, concluded that ephedra has minimal    if any proven benefit for enhancing sports performance. Yet ephedra acts like    an adrenaline boost, stressing the heart, raising blood pressure, and increasing    metabolism. Moreover, the stimulating effects of ephedra may mask the signs    of fatigue, causing even the most well conditioned athletes to push beyond their    physical limits. Thus, ephedra’s risks are potentially much more serious    for competitive athletes than for the general population. As FDA has said before,    ephedra should not be used by people who engage in strenuous activity.        Because of the special risks of ephedra use in athletes, I believe that the    sports leagues that have acted to restrict ephedra use are making a prudent    decision. Even as the Agency evaluates the safety of ephedra use in the population    more generally, including its use for weight loss, I have clearly and repeatedly    indicated that ephedra poses special risks in the context of sports performance    with little or no identified benefit for athletes.   FDA’s RULEMAKING ON EPHEDRINE ALKALOIDS   Right now, the Agency’s professional, scientific and legal staffs are    working hard to address the extraordinary challenges presented by these products.    The regulatory actions in process now have several major components. Earlier    this year, the Agency published a  Federal Register  notice seeking comment    on proposed warning label for ephedra-containing dietary supplements. These    changes would make it clear to users, via a black-box warning on the front of    the product, as well as additional information elsewhere in the product labeling,    that serious adverse events and death have been reported after using ephedra,    and that risks of adverse events are particularly high with strenuous exercise    and/or use of stimulants including caffeine. In addition, the Agency reopened    the comment period on its 1997 proposed rule on dietary supplements containing    ephedrine alkaloids. There is now considerably more evidence available on ephedra’s    risks and benefits than when the proposed rule was published. In its recent     Federal Register  notice, FDA announced that it was seeking comments    from health professionals, the supplement industry, and the general public on    any additional data on ephedra’s safety, so that we can acquire the most    complete picture possible of the product’s potential risks, as a basis    for appropriate further regulatory action.   Our  Federal Register  announcement also sought comments on whether,    in light of current information, FDA should determine that dietary supplements    containing ephedrine alkaloids present a significant or unreasonable risk of    illness or injury under the conditions of use recommended or suggested in labeling    or under ordinary conditions of use if the labeling is silent. In FDA’s    view, “unreasonable risk” implies a risk-benefit calculus. Such    a calculus should examine the best available scientific evidence and take it    into account in assessing whether the product’s known or suspected risks    outweigh its known or suspected benefits. The “sentinel” events    identified by RAND, coupled with the adverse event information we have collected    at the Agency and our knowledge of ephedra’s pharmacology and mechanism    of action, have all raised serious concerns about whether ephedra use poses    an unreasonable risk.    By undertaking these regulatory actions and seeking public comments on these    issues, our intent is to give DSHEA the meaning in practice that many of its    supporters say it should have, by clarifying that public health authorities    can use the standard in the law to determine whether a product poses unreasonable,    albeit uncertain, safety risks and then take appropriate regulatory or enforcement    action. We are establishing an up-to-date public record for further, legally    sustainable actions based on the latest scientific evidence. We are currently    in the process of analyzing the over 16,000 public comments we received earlier    this summer. We are in the final stages of our deliberative review related to    finalizing our rule, so I cannot discuss the specifics of that process or the    anticipated outcome. However, I want to emphasize that we are committed to moving    forward expeditiously to make a determination that is well grounded in all available    scientific evidence and that is protective of the public health in accordance    with DSHEA.   While we are undertaking these regulatory procedures, under my leadership,    the Agency has dramatically increased its enforcement actions against ephedrine    alkaloids and other dietary supplement products making false or misleading claims.    These actions, many of which have been undertaken in collaboration with the    Federal Trade Commission (FTC), are having an impact on the marketing of dietary    supplements in general and ephedra in particular.   ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS   At the core of FDA’s enforcement efforts is our commitment to enhance    the legitimate manufacture, sale, and use of dietary supplements while enforcing    the law aggressively against fraudulent product claims and other illegal practices.    Achieving these goals relies on a number of strategies, including cooperation    and coordination with other Federal, state, and international law enforcement    agencies in protecting consumers against unapproved and potentially harmful    products offered by Internet outlets, some of which are based abroad.    With a mutual goal of consumer protection, FDA and FTC formed a Dietary Supplement    Enforcement Group to closely coordinate their enforcement efforts against health    care fraud. In addition, FDA and FTC chair an interagency health fraud steering    committee that meets regularly to coordinate activity on these issues. The workgroup    currently includes Federal agencies in the U.S. and Canada. Mexico has been    invited to join the group. As part of its effort to curb Internet health fraud,    FDA has conducted several “surfs” to identify fraudulent marketing    of health care products over the Internet. These actions were carried out in    partnership with the FTC and other law enforcement and public health authorities    in the United States and abroad.   Sports Uses of Ephedra    On February 28, 2003, based on the conclusions of the RAND study, FDA warned    26 firms to cease making unproven claims that ephedrine-containing dietary supplements    enhance athletic performance. The actions were primarily a result of the Agency’s    surveillance of the firms’ websites. Fourteen of the firms responded to    the warning letters by discontinuing the product or the claim. The remaining    twelve firms were inspected by FDA. Of those twelve inspected firms, all but    one either discontinued the product or the objectionable claims. Investigation    for consideration of regulatory action against the remaining firm is ongoing.    Since performance enhancement was one of the two principal ways in which ephedra    has been marketed, the impact of these warning letters has been substantial.    As a result of FDA’s enforcement actions, all but one of these products    are no longer being marketed for sports enhancement.   Street Drug Alternatives    In September 2002, FDA became aware of the tragic death of Sean Riggins, the    16-year-old high school football player who had taken the product, Yellow Jackets.    One source of the product was found to be a distributor in the Netherlands,    which promoted the product on the Internet as an alternative to street drugs.    The product was manufactured by NVE Pharmaceuticals in New Jersey.   Yellow Jackets capsules and Black Beauties capsules, another NVE product at    the time, were both “street” terms for controlled substances, and    are sold as herbal street drug alternatives. These products are labeled to contain    ephedra extract and other herbal ingredients, including kola nut extract, a    source of caffeine. Their sale as a substitute for controlled substances is    illegal. FDA issued a Cyber Letter to Mr. Xoch Linnebank, Sjamaan Internet Department,    The Netherlands, on October 4, 2002, regarding the sale of Yellow Jackets into    the United States and placed the company’s products on import alert on    October 7, 2002.    On October 8, 2002, FDA attempted to inspect NVE Pharmaceuticals, the manufacturer    of Yellow Jackets and Black Beauties. NVE refused to allow the inspection and    on October 11, FDA and the U.S. Marshal’s Service returned to NVE under    a limited administrative inspection warrant. Although NVE refused to provide    access to batch records and complaints during the October inspection, FDA obtained    sufficient evidence to support an additional warrant. In January 2003, FDA and    the U.S. Marshal’s Service returned to NVE under a comprehensive inspection    warrant and obtained both records and complaints. FDA witnessed the firm’s    voluntary destruction of both “street drug-alternative” products    with a retail value of between $4 and $5 million.   After NVE stopped marketing Yellow Jackets and Black Beauties, they began marketing    Yellow Swarm and Midnight Stallion as replacement products. These products appear    to be almost identical in formulation and appearance, but they no longer bear    street drug names or claims - yet safety issues associated with these types    of products remain.    On March 31, 2003, FDA also took new enforcement action against firms marketing    street drug alternative products, some of which contained ephedra or other sources    of ephedrine. FDA sent warning letters to eight firms, again based primarily    on an investigation of the firms’ websites. The investigation revealed    that the firms sold products for “recreational” purposes with claims    to produce such effects as euphoria, a “high” or hallucinations.    As with Yellow Jackets and Black Beauties, these street drug alternatives are    not dietary supplements under the legal definition, because they are not intended    to supplement the diet. These eight letters went to manufacturers of products    that contain the drugs ephedrine or norephedrine hydrochloride labeled as dietary    supplements for use in weight loss, suppression of appetite and enhanced libido.    The majority of the firms stopped selling these products or removed the street    drug alternative claims for these products. We are currently working to assure    that all of the firms are brought into full compliance.   DIETARY SUPPLEMENT GOOD MANUFACTURING PRACTICES   Another important arm of FDA’s regulatory and surveillance activities    to help ensure the safety of dietary supplement products is improving product    quality and consistency. DSHEA gave FDA the authority to promulgate regulations    for dietary supplement good manufacturing practices (GMPs).    Examples of product quality problems the GMPs will help prevent are: superpotent,    subpotent, wrong ingredient, drug contaminant, other contaminant (e.g., bacteria,    pesticide, glass, and lead), color variation, tablet size or size variation,    under-filled containers, foreign material in a dietary supplement container,    improper packaging, and mislabeling.    On March 7, 2003, FDA announced proposed rules to establish GMPs and labeling    standards for dietary supplements. FDA’s proposed rule, if adopted as    proposed, would establish GMPs to help reduce risks associated with adulterated    or misbranded dietary supplement products. FDA is soliciting comments from the    public and industry on this proposal. Written comments will be received until    August 11, 2003.    The proposed rule would:       Establish industry-wide standards necessary to ensure that dietary supplements      are manufactured consistently as to identity, purity, quality, strength, and      composition.     Include requirements on the design and construction of physical plants that      facilitate maintenance, cleaning, and proper manufacturing operations, for      quality control procedures, for testing final product or incoming and in process      materials, for handling consumer complaints, and for maintaining records.     Apply to all firms that manufacture, package, or hold dietary ingredients      or dietary supplements, including those involved with testing, quality control,      packaging and labeling, and distributing them. The proposed regulations also      would apply to both domestic firms and foreign firms that manufacture, package,      or hold dietary ingredients and dietary supplements for distribution into      the U.S.     FDA EFFORTS TO OBTAIN SCIENTIFIC DATA     In order to acquire the best available scientific data to support its regulatory    decisions relating to ephedra, the Agency has undertaken numerous credible and    appropriate steps to gain access to information, in the form of adverse event    information, clinical studies, and other scientific reviews that could be helpful    in evaluating the safety concerns identified by AERs associated with dietary    supplements containing ephedrine alkaloids. These successful efforts have put    the Agency in a better position to make meaningful science-based decisions about    these products. In particular, FDA has sought unredacted complaints from Metabolife    as well as the raw data from the six-month Boozer Daly study that was conducted    at the request of the makers of dietary supplements containing ephedra.   On February 28, 2003, Secretary Tommy Thompson and I held a press conference    and announced the conclusions from the RAND study, commissioned by the National    Institutes of Health, which reviewed recent evidence on the risks and benefits    of ephedra and ephedrine based on the adverse events reports provided by Metabolife.    In evaluating potential benefits of ephedra, the RAND report found only limited    evidence of an effect of ephedra on short-term weight loss, and minimal evidence    of an effect on performance enhancement in certain physical activities. Also,    the RAND study concluded that ephedra is associated with higher risks of mild    to moderate side effects such as heart palpitations, psychiatric and upper gastrointestinal    effects, and symptoms of autonomic hyperactivity such as tremor and insomnia,    especially when it is taken with other stimulants. Moreover, its review of some    16,000 adverse event reports revealed two deaths, four heart attacks, nine strokes,    one seizure, and five psychiatric cases involving ephedra in which the records    appeared thorough and no other contributing factors were identified. RAND called    such cases “sentinel events,” because they may indicate a safety    problem but do not prove that ephedra caused the adverse event. The study recognized    that such case studies are a limited form of scientific evidence. The study    also identified other adverse events potentially associated with ephedra, in    which other factors may have contributed to the adverse events or in which records    were inadequate.    The RAND review, along with the data provided to the Agency by Drs. Boozer and    Daly from their controlled clinical study of ephedra use are being reviewed    by the Agency and its outside experts, along with the adverse event information    the Agency has received in its own CAERS. All three of FDA’s outside reviewers    of the Boozer Daly weight loss study have raised serious concerns about that    study’s ability to prove the safety of dietary supplements containing    ephedra.   At this time, we have amassed a significant data set and conducted substantial    analyses on ephedrine alkaloids. This data set includes AERs from FDA’s    Medwatch and from Metabolife as well as detailed assessments by Agency experts    and outside experts at RAND that have identified ephedra as an ingredient of    particular concern. But as the General Accounting Office and the Rand report    have noted, AERs alone in this context are sentinel events indicative of a potential    safety problem, but are not enough alone to make an empirical, scientific determination    with a high degree of statistical confidence that ephedra causes serious adverse    events. In addition, our careful review of the Boozer Daly study and underlying    data have raised additional significant concerns about the empirical effects    of ephedra. At this point, we are in the final stages of our deliberative review    related to finalizing our rule, so while I cannot get into the specifics of    that process or the anticipated outcome, I want to emphasize that we are moving    forward as expeditiously as possible to make a determination that is well grounded    in the scientific evidence we have and that is protective of the public health    in accordance with DSHEA. Meanwhile, under my leadership the Agency will continue    to use all available resources to target our limited enforcement resources on    false and misleading dietary supplement claims among other top priorities.    Mr. Chairman, thank you for this opportunity to testify. I am happy to answer    your questions.

The transcript is far more accurate than any comments provided below:        Potential bias in referral of events to the safety monitoring board     The selection of cases could have been biased.  For the Clozaril subjects 268 were not referred in contrast to 233 for Zyprexa.  And for those referred there were 115 Clozaril subjects in contrast to 164 for Zyprexa.    Other forms of bias/problems were discussed.      There were 68 psychiatrists in the study and thus there was a higher potential to lose the blind.    Rating scale refers to the week before the visit.    No training to psychiatrists on how to evaluate entry criteria    The monitor was unblinded and could refer independently     No structured interview and so no standardization on diagnosis.    Psychiatrist could decide on appropriate dose.    Psychiatrist decided concomitant drugs    Concomitant drugs could make it worse and not have anything to do with clozaril (since more concomitant drugs were given to olanzapine subjects)    Hard to know how to interpret – maybe olanzapine makes suicide worse, instead of clozaril making it less likely to occur    Type 2 is mostly composed of type 1 events    Since some patients had blood draws and others did not, it is possible that subjects talked to their doctor about this and caused the blind to be broken.    No evaluation of appropriateness of diagnosis that were made    No data on how or if the sponsor checked source documents to validate data accuracy        Claim focusing on suicidality in schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder     There was a lengthy discussion on these two categories.  Those who believed that there was no data to support a schizoaffective claim believed that the DSM IV had not been used and so the claim could not be supported.  Others felt that the two categories represented the fact that the patients were psychotic and not just a suicidal patient from the general population.    There was also a discussion on whether it was appropriate to approve a drug for a symptom rather than for a specific claim.      And there was a discussion on the problem with the use of the word ""emergent"".  Some people viewed this to mean an acute event.  Others felt that the population was already high risk for suicide and thus one can’t call them emergent when they already were in the class.      There was concern that Clozaril will be used in primary care for any suicidal patient and not be restricted to the population that was studied.    The committee individually voted on whether they believe the data supported both claims or only schizophrenia.  (This is subject to interpretation of lengthy comments that some members made.)     4=Both claims   4= Only schizophrenia claim  1 abstention    (NOTE: 2 non-voters - Malone and Mehta)        Expansion of Clozaril claim beyond treatment resistant schizophrenia     This was not discussed     Interpretation of the InterSePT study with regard to olanzapine     It appears that Clozaril is better, not that olanzapine makes it worse.    Claim could say that Clozaril is superior to standard drug instead of stating the comparative drug.    Most consensus reached on stating that clozaril was effective not better than others (because we do not know if the comparison was fair).                 Adequacy of a single randomized controlled trial to support suicidality claim      Members felt that it would be hard to repeat because the next study would need to disclose to subjects that there had been a positive study with Clozaril.    One statistician pointed out that two studies could have initially been carried out so we would have had data from two studies while equipoise was still present.     Question for which FDA would like a committee vote:         Do the data from the InterSePT Study, along with other data provided in this NDA supplement, provide a sufficient basis for a new claim involving suicidality in schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder [ Note : Part of the challenge to the committee is to articulate what the new claim should be.]?         The committee voted on the adequacy of the study without specifying the actual indication.  They left the indication to the FDA to work out.   They had worked on the claim in question 2 and were about equally split on the indication.                Yes = 8  No =1                This vote is an interpretation of a lengthy discussion.  There was no formal vote.  And it is possible that a few of the yes votes were actually less definitive and not quite a yes.      For instance,    One member stated that assuming that non-blinding does not bother the FDA, then InterSePT and other studies are persuasive.    Another member stated that it is not a robust study in the normal sense of the word, but if it is real and not explained by bias then it is robust enough for approval.        A verbatim transcript of this meeting will be available on the FDA’s Dockets Management Branch Website approximately 30 days after the meeting.

GX257-39-10309990	"Summary Overview At the direction of the funding agencies (National Institute of Health Office of Dietary Supplements (ODS), the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM), and the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ)), and in consultation with our Technical Expert Panel, we addressed research questions regarding the efficacy of herbal ephedra and ephedrine for weight loss and athletic performance through a comprehensive literature review and synthesis of evidence. We assessed the safety of these products through review of clinical trials. Meta-analysis was performed where appropriate. In addition, we reviewed herbal ephedra and ephedrine-related adverse events reports on file with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), published case reports, and reports to a manufacturer of ephedra-containing products. It is expected that the results of this review will be used to direct further research.  Reporting the Evidence The following questions were provided to us by the funding agencies and guided this evidence report. Weight Loss 1. What is the evidence for efficacy of ephedra-containing dietary supplement products in weight loss, over a sustained period of time? 2. Can efficacy for weight loss be attributed to ephedra alone, or ephedra in combination with other ingredients (e.g., caffeine)? 3. Does ephedra have additive effects with other agents? 4. What dosage levels of ephedra are necessary to achieve weight loss? Athletic Performance 1. What is the evidence for efficacy of ephedra-containing dietary supplement products in terms of energy enhancement and enhancement of athletic performance, over a sustained period of time? 2. Can efficacy for energy enhancement and enhancement of athletic performance be attributed to ephedra alone, or ephedra in combination with other ingredients (e.g., caffeine) that produce energy enhancement and/or enhancement of athletic performance? 3. Does ephedra have additive effects with other agents? 4. What dosage levels of ephedra are necessary to achieve energy enhancement and enhancement of athletic performance? Safety Assessment 1. Does use of ephedra-containing dietary supplement products over a sustained period of time increase the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) or other serious and lifethreatening events in specific populations? 2. What populations are at risk of CVD and other life-threatening events through use of ephedra over a sustained period of time? xiii   3. Can the risk for adverse events in these populations be attributed to ephedra alone, or in combination with other ingredients (e.g., caffeine)? 4. Does ephedra have additive effects with other agents? 5. What dosage levels of ephedra produce risk of CVD or other life-threatening events? 6. Do ephedra-containing dietary supplement products alter physiologic markers of cardiovascular function? 7. What are the metabolic actions of ephedra, so as to explain its beneficial and adverse effects? In addition to answering these 15 questions about ephedra-containing dietary supplement products, we were also asked to synthesize the available information on the same questions for the purified alkaloid, ephedrine. After searching published reports, journal articles, conference presentations, and various sources of unpublished studies, we identified 52 controlled clinical trials of ephedrine or herbal ephedra for weight loss or athletic performance in humans. The Food and Drug Administration provided us with copies of over 1,000 adverse event reports (AERs) related to herbal ephedra and 125 AERs related to ephedrine. These reports often included interviews with patients and/ or family members, extensive medical records, and copies of product labels. We identified 65 case reports in the literature and received a disk of 15,951 reports containing 18,502 cases from Metabolife, a manufacturer of ephedra products.  Methodology Efficacy. Data for the efficacy analysis were abstracted from reports of controlled trials onto a specially designed form containing questions about the study design, the number of patients and comorbidities, dosage, adverse events, the types of outcome measures, and the time from intervention until outcome measurement. We selected the variables for abstraction with input from the project's technical experts. Two physicians, working independently, each extracted data from the same reports and resolved disagreements by consensus. In selecting studies for the meta-analysis of weight loss efficacy, we considered only those trials of at least eight weeks treatment duration. Our technical expert panel judged that shorter treatment durations were insufficient to assess weight loss. In selecting studies on athletic performance, we found that these studies varied widely with respect to intervention. Because of this heterogeneity, we compared and contrasted these studies in a narrative review, rather than performing a statistical synthesis. The effects of ephedra/ephedrine on weight loss were examined in six different types of comparisons: (1) ephedrine versus placebo; (2) ephedrine plus caffeine versus placebo; (3) ephedrine plus caffeine versus ephedrine; (4) ephedrine versus other active treatment; (5) ephedra versus placebo; and (6) ephedra plus herbs containing caffeine versus placebo. The last comparison subgroup contained only a single trial; thus, effect sizes were estimated only for the first five. The effect size was calculated by dividing the outcome of a study (e.g., difference in weight loss per month between the two groups) by its standard deviation, which produces a unitless measure that is useful when comparing studies that assess outcomes (such as weight) xiv   that are similar but are measured differently (e.g., weight loss in pounds versus change in body mass index). Effect sizes were pooled separately for each of the five comparison subgroups. In addition, we used meta-regression to conduct a cross-subgroup synthesis on the effect sizes of the subgroups with a placebo comparison: ephedrine versus placebo; ephedrine plus caffeine versus placebo; and ephedra plus herbs containing caffeine versus placebo. Safety. We reviewed each report of a controlled trial (regardless of treatment duration) for data on adverse events. Adverse events were recorded onto a spreadsheet that identified each study arm, the description of the adverse event as listed in the original article, and the numbers of subjects and adverse events in each arm. We then compared event rates in the ephedra or ephedrine groups to those in the placebo groups. We conducted a meta-analysis on those adverse event symptoms for which appreciable numbers of events were noted in the controlled trials. Adverse event reports compiled by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) concerning ephedra or ephedrine were also reviewed by our physician reviewers. Within the time and resource constraints of this report, we reviewed all available reports of death, myocardial infarction (heart attack), cerebral vascular accident (stroke), seizure, and serious psychiatric illness filed prior to September 30, 2001. We also reviewed published case reports as well as event reports filed with Metabolife, a manufacturer of ephedra-containing products. After screening, all case reports were subjected to a review. Based on input from our technical expert panel and the literature on methods to assess adverse event reports, we identified three important criteria for inclusion of such reports: 1. Documentation of an adverse event that met our selection criteria. 2. Documentation that the person having the adverse event took an ephedra-containing supplement or ephedrine within 24 hours prior to the event (for cases of death, myocardial infarction, stroke, or seizure). 3. Documentation that alternative explanations for the adverse event were investigated and were excluded with reasonable certainty. We classified cases that met all three of these criteria as ""sentinel events."" Cases in which the event might have had other possible causes but the pharmacology of ephedrine could have contributed were classified as ""possible sentinel events."" Cases of death, myocardial infarction, cerebral vascular accident, and seizure were reviewed by internists, with additional review (as indicated) by a cardiologist, neurologist, or rheumatologist. Psychiatric cases were reviewed by a psychiatrist specializing in addictions and a psychologist with expertise in substance abuse. The criterion for use within 24 hours was not required for psychiatric cases.  Findings Efficacy for Weight Loss. ephedrine used for weight loss. had a treatment duration of less variety of other reasons. Of the We identified 44 controlled trials that assessed use of ephedra or Of these, 18 were excluded from pooled analysis because they than eight weeks. Six additional trials were excluded for a remaining 20 trials included in the meta-analysis, only five tested xv   herbal ephedra-containing products. Together, these 20 trials assessed 678 persons who consumed either ephedra or ephedrine. The majority of studies of both ephedra and ephedrine are plagued by methodological problems (particularly, high attrition rates) that might contribute to bias. These methodological limitations must be considered when interpreting any conclusions regarding the efficacy of these products. Nevertheless, the evidence we identified and assessed supports an association between short-term use of ephedrine, ephedrine plus caffeine, or dietary supplements that contain ephedra with or without herbs containing caffeine and a statistically significant increase in short-term weight loss (compared to placebo). Adding caffeine to ephedrine modestly increases the amount of weight loss. There is no evidence that the effect of ephedra-containing dietary supplements with herbs containing caffeine differs from that of ephedrine plus caffeine: Both result in weight loss that is approximately two pounds per month greater than that with placebo, for up to four to six months. No studies have assessed the longterm effects of ephedra-containing dietary supplements or ephedrine on weight loss; the longest duration of treatment in a published study was six months. Efficacy for Physical Performance Enhancement. The effect of ephedrine on athletic performance was assessed in seven studies. No studies have assessed the effect of herbal ephedra-containing dietary supplements on athletic performance. The few studies that assessed the effect of ephedrine on athletic performance have, in general, included only small samples of fit individuals (young male military recruits) and have assessed the effects only on very shortterm immediate performance. Thus, these studies did not assess ephedrine as it is used in the general population. The data support a modest effect of ephedrine plus caffeine on very shortterm athletic performance. No studies have assessed the sustained use of ephedrine on performance over time. The only study that assessed the additive effects of these agents reported that ephedrine must be supplemented with caffeine to affect athletic performance. Safety Issues. The data on adverse events were drawn from clinical trials and case reports published in the literature, submitted to the FDA, and reported to Metabolife, a manufacturer of ephedra-containing supplement products. The strongest evidence for causality should come from clinical trials; however, in most circumstances, such trials do not enroll sufficient numbers of patients to adequately assess the possibility of rare outcomes. Such was the case with our review of ephedrine and ephedra-containing dietary supplements. Even in aggregate, the clinical trials enrolled only enough patients to detect a serious adverse event rate of at least 1.0 per 1,000. For rare outcomes, we reviewed case reports, but a causal relationship between ephedra or ephedrine use and these events cannot be assumed or proven. Evidence from controlled trials was sufficient to conclude that the use of ephedrine and/or the use of ephedra-containing dietary supplements or ephedrine plus caffeine is associated with two to three times the risk of nausea, vomiting, psychiatric symptoms such as anxiety and change in mood, autonomic hyperactivity, and palpitations. The majority of case reports are insufficiently documented to make an informed judgment about a relationship between the use of ephedrine or ephedra-containing dietary supplements and the adverse event in question. For prior consumption of ephedra-containing products, we identified two deaths, three myocardial infarctions, nine cerebrovascular accidents, three seizures, and five psychiatric cases as sentinel events; for prior consumption of ephedrine, we xvi   identified three deaths, two myocardial infarctions, two cerebrovascular accidents, one seizure, and three psychiatric cases as sentinel events. We identified 43 additional cases as possible sentinel events with prior ephedra consumption and seven additional cases as possible sentinel events for prior ephedrine consumption. About half the sentinel events occurred in persons aged 30 years or younger. Classification as a sentinel event does not imply a proven cause and effect relationship. We did not assess the plethora of additional symptoms that have been reported in the published literature and the FDA Medwatch file for ephedra-containing dietary supplements and ephedrine products.  Future Research Our analysis of the evidence reveals numerous gaps in the literature regarding the efficacy and safety of ephedra-containing dietary supplements. First, long-term assessments of the effectiveness of herbal ephedra or ephedrine for promoting weight loss are lacking. We identified no study with a treatment duration longer than six months. To improve health outcomes and reduce the risk of morbidities associated with being overweight, sufficient weight loss (5 to 10 percent of body weight) and long-term weight maintenance are necessary. Therefore, the benefit of ephedrine or herbal ephedra-containing dietary supplements for health outcomes is unknown. Evidence regarding the effect of herbal ephedra or ephedrine on physical performance that reflects its use in the general population (repeated or long-term use by a representative sample) is also needed. In order to assess a causal relationship between ephedra or ephedrine consumption and serious adverse events, a hypothesis-testing study is needed. Continued analysis of case reports cannot substitute for a properly designed study to assess causality. A case-control study would probably be the study design of choice.  xvii"

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Claudia V. Grillo, Office of Regulatory Policy (HFD-013), Food and Drug Administration, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, MD 20857, 240-453-6699.  SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984 (Public Law 98-417) and the Generic Animal Drug and Patent Term Restoration Act (Public Law 100-670) generally provide that a patent may be extended for a period of up to 5 years so long as the patented item (human drug product, animal drug product, medical device, food additive, or color additive) was subject to regulatory review by FDA before the item was marketed. Under these acts, a product's regulatory review period forms the basis for determining the amount of extension an applicant may receive.     A regulatory review period consists of two periods of time: A testing phase and an approval phase. For human drug products, the testing phase begins when the exemption to permit the clinical investigations of the drug becomes effective and runs until the approval phase begins. The approval phase starts with the initial submission of an application to market the human drug product and continues until FDA grants permission to market the drug product. Although only a portion of a regulatory review period may count toward the actual amount of extension that the Director of Patents and Trademarks may award (for example, half the testing phase must be subtracted, as well as any time that may have occurred before the patent was issued), FDA's determination of the length of a regulatory review period for a human drug product will include all of the testing phase and approval phase as specified in 35 U.S.C. 156(g)(1)(B).     FDA recently approved for marketing the human drug product ABILIFY (aripiprazole). ABILIFY is indicated for the treatment of schizophrenia. Subsequent to this approval, the Patent and Trademark Office received a patent term restoration application for ABILIFY (U.S. Patent No. 5,006,528) from Otsuka Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., and the Patent and Trademark Office requested FDA's assistance in determining this patent's eligibility for patent term restoration. In a letter dated July 16, 2003, FDA advised the Patent and Trademark Office that this human drug product had undergone a regulatory review period and that the approval of ABILIFY represented the first permitted commercial marketing or use of the product. Shortly thereafter, the Patent and Trademark Office requested that FDA determine the product's regulatory review period.     FDA has determined that the applicable regulatory review period for ABILIFY is 3,416 days. Of this time, 3,035 days occurred during the testing phase of the regulatory review period, while 381 days occurred during the approval phase. These periods of time were derived from the following dates:     1. The date an exemption under section 505 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act) (21 U.S.C. 355) became effective: July 11, 1993. The applicant claims July 10, 1993, as the date the investigational new drug application (IND) became effective. However, FDA records indicate that the IND effective date was July 11, 1993, which was 30 days after FDA receipt of the IND.     2. The date the application was initially submitted with respect to the human drug product under section 505 of the act: October 31, 2001. FDA has verified the applicant's claim that the new drug application (NDA) for ABILIFY (NDA 21-436) was initially submitted on October 31, 2001.     3. The date the application was approved: November 15, 2002. FDA has verified the applicant's claim that NDA 21-436 was approved on November 15, 2002.     This determination of the regulatory review period establishes the maximum potential length of a patent extension. However, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office applies several statutory limitations in its calculations of the actual period for patent extension. In its application for patent extension, this applicant seeks 5 years of patent term extension.     Anyone with knowledge that any of the dates as published are incorrect may submit to the Division of Dockets Management (see ADDRESSES) written comments and ask for a redetermination by January 26, 2004. Furthermore, any interested person may petition FDA for a determination regarding whether the applicant for extension acted with due diligence during the regulatory review period by May 24, 2004. To meet its burden, the petition must contain sufficient facts to merit an FDA investigation. (See H. Rept. 857, part 1, 98th Cong., 2d sess., pp. 41-42, 1984.) Petitions should be in the format specified in 21 CFR 10.30.     Comments and petitions should be submitted to the Division of Dockets Management. Three copies of any mailed information are to be submitted, except that individuals may submit one copy. Comments are to be identified with the docket number found in brackets in the heading of this document.

CLICK HERE FOR THE MARCH 19, 2002 GUIDANCE.  Office for Human Research Protections Department of Health and Human Services  Guidance for Investigators and Institutional Review Boards Regarding Research Involving Human Embryonic Stem Cells, Germ Cells and Cell-Derived Test Articles The Office for Human Research Protections of the Department of Health and Human Services offers the following guidance for Institutional Review Boards (IRBs), investigators and sponsors considering research activities involving human embryonic stem cells (HESCs), HESC- derived test articles, human embryonic germ cells derived from fetal tissue, and/or human embryonic germ cell- derived test articles. In vitro research using cell lines that are already derived and established, from wh ich the identity of the donor cannot readily be ascertained by the investigator, is not considered human subject research and therefore is not governed by 45 CFR 46 or 21 CFR 50&56. IRB review is not required for such research. Research using cell lines that are identifiable with a donor, including cells that retain links to coded information that would allow identification of donors, is generally considered human subject research, except for cases in which the investigator obtains a written agreement from the holder of the identifiable private information (e.g., the deriver of the cell line) that such information will not be released to the investigator or, if applicable, a consultant, under any circumstances, and that the research will be conducted within the terms of the applicable Assurance by all parties engaged in the research (see guidance offered at http://ohrp.osophs.dhhs.gov/humansubjects/assurance/engage.htm and http://ohrp.osophs.dhhs.gov/humansubjects/guidance/reposit.htm for additional details. All human subject research involving the use of cells derived from human embryos or fetal tissue is governed by 45 CFR 46 (see in particular Subpart B; state and local laws may also apply), may be subject to FDA regulations, and are required to have IRB review and approval.   All Federally supported research involving human embryonic germ cells derived from human fetal tissue must be conducted in compliance with the NIH Guidelines for Research Using Human Pluripotent Stem Cells, section on fetal tissue (http://www.nih.gov/news/stemcell/NOT- OD- 00- 050.html). Research involving the derivation of new human embryonic stem cells from human embryos cannot be conducted with Federal support. Research involving the derivation of human embryonic germ cells from fetal tissue can be conducted with Federal support. All research and clinical trials involving human transplantation of cells or test articles, such as differentiated cells derived from human embryos or human fetal tissue, must be conducted in compliance with FDA regulations and Public Law 103- 43, ""Research on Transplantation of Fetal Tissue"". Further information can be found on the OHRP website (http://ohrp.osophs.dhhs.gov/human subjects/guidance/publiclaw103- 43.htm) and in the NIH Grants Policy Statement (http://grants.nih.gov/grants/policy/nihgps_2001/). Investigators who engage in HHS- supported research or who are affiliated with institutions that  receive HHS support for such research must comply with the Office of Human Research  Protection (OHRP) requirements regarding an Assurance of Compliance for such research.  In addition to the considerations above, clinical trials involving HESCs, HESC- derived test  articles, human embryonic germ cells derived from fetal tissue, and/or human embryonic germ  cell- derived test articles are subject to regulation and oversight by FDA (see  http://www.fda.gov/cber/ltr/fetal113000.htm). Clinical research trials involving the use of stem  cells and stem cell derived test articles are subject to FDA=s IND regulations regardless of source  of funding. All human studies conducted under INDs require IRB review of the clinical  protocol(s). Anyone contemplating such trials should contact the Center for Biologics  Evaluation and Review (CBER) at http://www.fda.gov/cber/tiss.htm or 301- 827- 5102 for specific   advice regarding fulfillment of these requirements.  Institutional Review Board (IRB) review of human research involving stem cells derived from  human embryos or human fetal tissue research must be in accordance with the Department of  Health and Human Services (HHS) regulations for the Protection of Human Subjects, 45 CFR,  Part 46, and FDA regulations at 21 CFR 50 and 56 as appropriate.  The NIH policy for Just- in- Time IRB review does apply to such research.  For further information, please contact OHRP (ohrp@osophs.dhhs.gov or 301- 496- 7005).   November 16, 2001"

General Comments         THE AMERICAN HEART ASSOCIATION COMMENTS TO THE FDA ON DIETARY SUPPLEMENTS CONTAINING EPHEDRINE ALKALOIDS      April 3, 2003    RE: (Docket No. 95N-0304)   21 CFR Part 111    The American Heart Association is the nations largest voluntary health organization dedicated to the reduction of disability and death from heart disease and stroke, the nations number one and number three leading killers.  Our 30,000 Scientific Council members and our four million volunteers are committed to ensuring that Americans lead heart healthy lifestyles through proper nutrition and physical activity, and they include the nations thought leaders in heart disease and stroke.  These leaders are also specifically knowledgeable about heart rhythm abnormalities and high blood pressure, and the effects of exogenous agents on these conditions.  Therefore, the American Heart Association is grateful to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for publishing this proposal to place stringent limits on the manufacturing and marketing of ephedrine-based dietary supplements and for its stepped up enforcement actions against firms marketing for recreational purposes.    These actions represent the recognition by the FDA of the growing concern about the health hazards of ephedrine, a sympathomimetic agent and potent stimulant found in many products, and often combined with caffeine.  Ephedrine does have legitimate medical uses, notably in the treatment of the rare disorder of orthostatic hypotension due to autonomic failure, and has been included as a component of a number of prescription cough and cold preparations, used for bronchodilation.  Our comments do not apply to the prescription use of ephedrine, but rather to the availability without prescription of compounds containing ephedrine, notably ephedra or ma huang, the herbal product from which ephedrine was originally isolated.      The Association is aware that the FDAs current proposal would ban the marketing of any capsules containing more than 8 mg of ephedrine and would limit the maximum intake to 24 mg/day.  The intended effect is to protect the public from the health hazards of ephedra, which many manufacturers promote as a dietary supplement to be used for weight loss or muscle building.  Ephedra has been documented to increase the metabolic rate, possibly via the sympathomimetic effects of its component ephedrine on specific forms of adipose tissue.  There are, however, no long-term studies of its safety or efficacy in humans.  While these studies are not required for the manufacturing and marketing of dietary supplements, their lack for such a potent agent represents a gap in the safety net needed for the public.      In evidence of this problem, the use of ephedra has been associated with a remarkable risk profile.  The recent death of a young baseball player using ephedra has been highly publicized, but is only an anecdote.  More impressive is the growing literature on the adverse events associated with ephedra use.  This includes multiple reports of adverse events, including ischemic stroke in an ephedra user (1), the sudden appearance of hypertension in a body-builder (2) a case-control study suggesting, though not definitively proving, an increased risk of hemorrhagic stroke at higher doses of ephedra (3), a further review of FDA data on adverse events related to ma huang use, suggesting a temporal relation of use and stroke, myocardial infarction and death, with events occurring even in individuals without underlying cardiovascular disease (4), myocardial infarction after ephedra in a young man with normal coronary arteries but slow flow suggesting an abnormality in microcirculatory function (5), and general reviews of adverse events including deaths, cerebrovascular accidents and myocardial infarctions associated with the use of ephedra alkaloids (6,7,8,9), including a review of those reported in Denmark and Canada, leading to the market recall of several ephedrine-containing products in Canada after a large number of adverse events, including stroke, myocardial infarction, cardiac arrhythmias, seizures and psychiatric disorders (8).  A review of he FDAs data on 140 events reported between June 1997 and March 1999 included hypertension as the most frequent side effect, but also included 10 deaths, 13 cases of permanent impairment, with other reports of tachycardia, myocardial infarction, stroke, and seizure (10), and this surely represents the tip of the iceberg.    A recent report from RAND investigators included these data and other reports, and included from FDA records more than 1,500 adverse event reports related to products containing herbal ephedra and 125 adverse events related to products containing synthetic ephedrine, as well as 70 adverse events from the medical literature and 18,000 adverse event reports recorded by Metabolife, a manufacturer of ephedra products (11).  There was a 2.2-3.6-fold increased likelihood of headache, tachycardia, palpitations, GI, psychiatric or autonomic side effects.  In the case of case reports, while the investigators were unable to definitively demonstrate that ephedrine was causal in the majority of these serious adverse events, they identified 10 sentinel events i.e., adverse events in the presence of ephedra or ephedrine without an identifiable alternative cause, including 2 deaths, 2 myocardial infarctions, 2 cerebrovascular accidents, 1 seizure and 3 psychiatric cases.  They also identified an additional 50 possible sentinel events.  Approximately half of the sentinel events occurred in individuals under the age of 30.  The likelihood of adverse events occurring at a rate of less than 1 per thousand could not be evaluated.  It has recently bee suggested that the likelihood of an adverse reaction to ephedra-containing products is 200 times that seen with other supplements (7).      The RAND investigators also reviewed 52 clinical trials that evaluated the use of either herbal ephedra or the synthetic ephedrine in man for either weight loss or athletic performance, and concluded that there was no long-term proof of safety or efficacy.  While there have indeed been short-term studies in small numbers of patients suggesting that some ephedra compounds are safe when used in a carefully regulated setting, and may increase weight loss more than placebo (12, 13), these studies cannot be used to predict safety and/or efficacy for the population at large.  They do not take into account the increased sensitivity of some individuals within the population to a potential pro-arrhythmic effect of these agents, nor the tendency of the public to disregard warning signs about the safe amount of a product to be taken.  Even in these studies, use was associated with a significant increase in systolic blood pressure and heart rate. And of course, without regulation the consumer cannot safely assume the amount of ephedrine in a given product or even batch of a product.  In a recent study of 20 products, using HPLC, the total alkaloid content varied from 0.0 -18.5 mg/dosage unit, with ranges for ephedrine and pseudoephedrine varying from 1.1-15.3 mg and 0.2-9.5 mg, respectively.  Norpseudoephedrine, which is a Schedule IV controlled substance, was also commonly present.  In addition, there was remarkable lot-to-lot variation in content, ranging from 180-1000%, and the label was often of little use in determining what one was ingesting (14).  This poses an obvious risk to the consumer who takes doses from a lot with little drug at first and finds little effect, and then increases to a greater dose of a lot with greatly increased drug.    Given the national preoccupation with slimness, particularly but not exclusively by college age individuals, and the common use of body-building products, the concern of the American Heart Association is that a warning to limit the daily intake of these products and to avoid caffeine use with them will go unheeded.  The potential health hazards associated with ephedrine are too serious to permit them to be sold on the open market, without the supervision of a physician and without regulation of content and purity.    The American Heart Association urges the FDA to strongly consider removing dietary supplements that contain ephedrine from the open market.  We recognize that the increasing interest in dietary supplements will be accompanied by a demand and need for more scientific information to substantiate potential claims for approval or disapproval of the specific supplement.  We agree with the RAND investigators that further study of ephedrine for weight loss should be accomplished before its use for this purpose is allowed.  We see no evidence that it has a beneficial effect on athletic performance.  The American Heart Association would be pleased to discuss this further and to assist the FDA in any way possible.

GX260-24-6606996	"Structured Abstract Objectives. To assess the efficacy of herbal ephedra-containing dietary supplements and ephedrine on weight loss and athletic performance, through comprehensive literature review and synthesis of evidence. We also assessed safety of these products through review of adverse events reported in clinical trials, published case reports of adverse events, reports on file with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and a file of reports kept by a manufacturer of ephedra products, Metabolife. Search Strategy. We searched for studies of herbal ephedra and ephedrine using the following electronic databases: Medline, EmBase, BIOSIS, Allied & Complementary Medicine Database (AMED), MANTIS, the Cochrane Controlled Clinical Trials Register Database, International Pharmaceutical Abstracts, Pascal, and SciSearch. We were able to obtain unpublished studies by posting notices in relevant journals and through contacts on our Technical Expert Panel. The FDA provided us with copies of over 1,000 adverse event reports (AERs) related to herbal ephedra and 125 adverse event reports related to ephedrine. The Metabolife files contained 18,502 cases. Selection Criteria. Only studies of weight loss that were controlled trials of human subjects with treatment of at least eight weeks duration were accepted to assess efficacy. For assessment of athletic performance, only controlled trials of human subjects were accepted, but no minimum follow-up was specified. Reports of adverse events from controlled trials were included regardless of treatment duration. We reviewed all available reports of death, myocardial infarction (heart attack), cerebral vascular accident (stroke), seizure, and serious psychiatric illness reported to the FDA prior to September 30, 2001 and contained in their ephedra or ephedrine files, and all case reports identified in our literature search . Data Collection and Analysis. We found 59 articles that corresponded to 52 controlled clinical trials of ephedrine or herbal ephedra for weight loss or athletic performance. Forty-four were controlled trials assessing ephedra or ephedrine for weight loss. Of these, 18 were excluded from pooled analysis because they had treatment durations of less than eight weeks. Thirteen articles corresponding to six trials were excluded for a variety of reasons. For the outcome of weight loss the effects of ephedra/ephedrine were examined in six different types of comparisons: (1) ephedrine versus placebo; (2) ephedrine plus caffeine versus placebo; (3) ephedrine plus caffeine versus ephedrine; (4) ephedrine versus other active treatment; (5) ephedra versus placebo; and (6) ephedra plus herbs containing caffeine versus placebo. Only four placebocontrolled trials assessed the combination of ephedra plus herbs containing caffeine, and only one trial assessed ephedra without herbs containing caffeine. Because of their small number and heterogeneity, eight athletic performance trials were compared and contrasted using only a narrative review and were not synthesized statistically. We also conducted a pooled metaanalysis on those adverse event symptoms that occurred frequently in the controlled trials. In reviewing the individual adverse event reports, we searched for documentation that an adverse event had occurred, documentation that the subject had consumed ephedra within 24 hours prior to the adverse event, or a toxicological examination revealing ephedrine or one of its associated products in the blood or urine. We also sought evidence that an adequate investigation v   had assessed and excluded other potential causes. Cases that met all these criteria were labeled ""sentinel events."" Cases that met the first two criteria but had other possible causes of the event were labeled ""possible sentinel events."" Classification as a sentinel event does not imply a proven cause and effect relationship. We used clinical judgment of expert clinicians to assess whether other causes had been adequately evaluated and excluded. Main Results. Weight Loss. Short-term use of ephedrine, ephedrine plus caffeine, or dietary supplements containing ephedra with or without herbs containing caffeine is associated with a statistically significant increase in short-term weight loss (compared to placebo). The addition of caffeine to ephedrine is associated with a statistically significant modest increase in short-term weight loss. The observed effects on weight loss of ephedrine plus caffeine and ephedracontaining dietary supplements with or without herbs containing caffeine are approximately equivalent: a weight loss approximately two pounds per month greater than that with placebo, for up to four to six months. No studies have assessed the long-term effects of ephedrine or ephedracontaining dietary supplements on weight loss; the longest published treatment duration was six months. Athletic Performance. The effect of herbal ephedracontaining dietary supplements on athletic performance has not been assessed. The few studies that assess the effect of ephedrine on athletic performance have included only small samples of fit individuals (young male military recruits) and have assessed its effect only on very short-term immediate performance. These data support a modest effect of ephedrine plus caffeine on very short-term athletic performance. One study reported the addition of caffeine to ephedrine is necessary to produce an effect on athletic performance. No studies have assessed the sustained use of ephedrine on performance over time. Safety Issues. There is sufficient evidence from controlled trials to conclude that the use of ephedrine and/ or the use of ephedra-containing herbal supplements or ephedrine plus caffeine is associated with two to three times the risk of nausea, vomiting, psychiatric symptoms such as anxiety and change in mood, autonomic hyperactivity, and palpitations. The controlled trials studied relatively few people and in aggregate were insufficient to evaluate events with a risk of less than 1.0 per one thousand. The majority of case reports are insufficiently documented to make an informed judgment about a relationship between the use of ephedrine or ephedra-containing dietary supplements and the adverse event in question. Prior ephedra consumption was associated with two deaths, three myocardial infarctions, nine cerebrovascular accidents, three seizures, and five psychiatric cases as sentinel events. Prior consumption of ephedrine was associated with three deaths, two myocardial infarctions, two cerebrovascular accidents, one seizure, and three psychiatric cases as sentinel events. We identified 43 additional cases as possible sentinel events with prior ephedra consumption and seven additional cases as possible sentinel events with prior ephedrine consumption. About half the sentinel events occurred in persons aged 30 years or younger. Conclusions. Ephedrine, ephedrine plus caffeine, and ephedra-containing dietary supplements with or without herbs containing caffeine all promote modest amounts of weight loss over the short term. There are no data regarding long-term effects on weight loss. Single-dose ephedrine plus caffeine has a modest effect on athletic performance. The available trials do not provide any evidence about ephedrine or ephedra-containing dietary supplements, as they are used by the general population, to enhance athletic performance. Use of ephedra or ephedrine plus caffeine is vi   associated with an increased risk of gastrointestinal, psychiatric, and autonomic symptoms. The adverse event reports contain a sufficient number of cases of death, myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular accident, seizure, or serious psychiatric illness in young adults to warrant a hypothesis-testing study, such as a case-control study, to support or refute the hypothesis that consumption of ephedra or ephedrine may be causally related to these serious adverse events.  vii"
GX001-22-15366587	"April 4, 2001      STATEMENT     BY    STEPHEN SUNDLOF, D.V.M., Ph.D.,     DIRECTOR, CENTER FOR VETERINARY MEDICINE   FOOD AND DRUG ADMINSTRATION   BEFORE   THE COMMITTEE ON COMMERCE, SCIENCE,   AND TRANSPORTATION   SUBCOMMITTEE ON CONSUMER AFFAIRS,   FOREIGN COMMERCE, AND TOURISM   UNITED STATES SENATE   APRIL 4, 2001        Introduction    Mr. Chairman, Members of the Committee, thank you for the opportunity to participate in today's hearing on measures by the Federal government to prevent bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) or ""Mad Cow Disease,"" from occurring in the Unites States (U.S.).  I am Dr. Stephen Sundlof, Director, Center for Veterinary Medicine, Food and Drug Administration (FDA or the Agency).    Let me state at the outset that currently we have no evidence of  BSE in the U.S. and FDA and other Federal agencies are working diligently to keep it out of the U.S.  FDA has been actively involved nationally and internationally in efforts to understand and prevent the spread of BSE.  FDA collaborates extensively with its sister Public Health Service agencies, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the National Institutes of Health (NIH), relevant agencies within the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), the Customs Service, and many other Federal and State agencies, as well as with affected industries and consumer groups.    Background on BSE and variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD)     BSE belongs to the family of transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs) diseases.  TSEs are a group of transmissible, slowly progressive, degenerative diseases of the central nervous systems of humans and several species of animals. Animal TSEs include, for example, bovine BSE in cattle, ""scrapie"" in sheep and goats, ""chronic wasting disease"" (CWD) in deer and elk, feline spongiform encephalopathy in cats, and mink spongiform encephalopathy in mink.  Scrapie and CWD are found in the U.S. to a small extent in certain herds of these animals.     Human TSEs include kuru, a disease of the South Pacific Fore people and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD or ""classical"" CJD), which occurs throughout the world, including the U.S. (where it occurs at a stable rate of about one per million population per year) and new variant CJD (vCJD), which was first reported in the United Kingdom (U.K.) in 1996.  It is believed that vCJD may be acquired from eating food products containing the BSE agent, and there is strong epidemiological and laboratory evidence for a causal association between vCJD and BSE.  The onset of illness in the first case of vCJD, occurred in early 1994.  As of April 2, 2001, 97 probable or confirmed human cases of vCJD were reported in the U.K., three in France and one in Ireland.  The absence of confirmed cases of vCJD in geographic areas free of BSE supports a causal association.  There is no evidence to date of vCJD in the U.S.  There is no known treatment for any TSE, and they are all fatal.    BSE has a prolonged incubation period in cattle, ranging from three to eight years; for vCJD in humans, the incubation period is unknown, but is at least five years and could extend up to 20 years or longer.  BSE was first discovered in the U.K. in November 1986.  Epidemiological evidence established that the wide-spread amplification of BSE throughout many of the British cattle herds was related to the production and use over many years of BSE-contaminated meat-and-bone meal that was fed primarily to young calves.  The original source of the BSE outbreak is uncertain.     The vast majority of BSE cases have been reported in the U.K. About 180,000 cases of BSE have been confirmed there in more than 33,000 herds of cattle.  The U.K. epidemic peaked in January 1993 at nearly 1,000 new cases per week.  Surveillance in Europe has also led to the identification of cases of BSE in Belgium, Denmark, France, Ireland, Liechtenstein, the Netherlands, Portugal, Switzerland and most recently, in Germany, Spain and Italy.  European countries have instituted a variety of public health control measures, such as BSE surveillance, the culling (removal from the herd) of sick animals, the banning of specified risk materials, the banning of animal proteins in animal feed, or a combination of these, to prevent potentially BSE-infected tissues from entering the human food chain.    FDA Protections    Many FDA regulated products contain bovine products, including food, animal feed, drugs, vaccines, tissues, dietary supplements, cosmetics, medical devices, and there also are theoretical concerns about transmitting CJD and vCJD through the human blood supply from a donor infected with CJD or vCJD.  At this time there is no documented transmission of CJD or vCJD through blood/blood products.  FDA has a long-standing commitment to consumer protection involving BSE and vCJD.    The focus for FDA and its Federal and State partners in other agencies has been prevention.  Using the best science known at this time, the U.S. has an aggressive, multi-faceted program in place to try to prevent the establishment and spread of BSE within the U.S.  FDA's restrictions on certain cattle feed ingredients and its import restrictions on various items and products are critical parts of this program.     Cattle Feed Restrictions, Inspections and Education    As I have stated, rendered feed ingredients contaminated with the BSE agent are believed to be the means by which BSE is amplified in cattle herds.  The amplification is most closely associated with feed for cattle, particularly young calves that include ingredients processed from remnants of slaughtered animals, such as meat-and-bone meal, which may harbor the agent that causes BSE.  Although the material is cooked, the BSE agent can survive.     In order to prevent the spread of BSE through feed, in August 1997, FDA published a regulation that prohibits the use of most mammalian protein in the manufacture of animal feeds for ruminants (Title 21,  Code of Federal Regulations  (CFR) Part 589).  Even though there is no evidence of BSE in the U.S., FDA prohibited this feeding practice so that we established in our country feeding practices consistent with the best epidemiological knowledge available to prevent the spread of this disease throughout the U.S. cattle herd should it get into the U.S.  With the strong support of renderers, cattle owners, feed manufacturers, and feed lot owners, FDA launched a compliance and education program, including a rigorous inspection program.  The goal of these efforts is to achieve as close to 100 percent compliance with the labeling, record keeping, and contamination avoidance provisions of this new regulation as soon as possible.  FDA recognizes that there were some early problems with compliances, as cited in the General Accounting Office's (GAO) report, ""Controls Can Be Strengthened to Reduce the Risk of Disease Linked to Unsafe Animal Feed"" (GAO/RCED-00255).    FDA and State regulators have conducted over 10,000 inspections of renderers, feed mills, ruminant feeders, dairy farms, protein blenders, feed haulers, and distributors since January 1998.  On first inspection, about three-quarters of these establishments were found to be in compliance.  Most of the establishments that had problems during the first inspection were found in compliance upon re-inspection.    FDA is continuing its compliance efforts by conducting additional inspections and re-inspecting non-compliant facilities.  In January 2001, FDA field offices were issued an assignment to re-inspect 834 firms that were not in full compliance with the rule.  Of 184  re-inspections conducted by April 2, 2001, only one firm continued to be out of compliance.     Education is also an extremely important part of the compliance program.  FDA has sponsored workshops attended by State veterinarians and feed control officials from all 50 States, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and Canada.  In addition, FDA has held briefing sessions with trade associations and consumer groups, and has developed additional guidances for complying with the regulation.      Import Controls     FDA and the USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) work in close cooperation with the Customs Service on items related to imports.     APHIS establishes and enforces import restrictions covering animals and animal products offered for import into the U.S. to prevent the importation of foreign exotic diseases.  Beginning in 1989, APHIS has taken several actions to ban animals or products under their jurisdiction because of concerns about BSE.    FDA issues Import Alerts and Import Bulletins regarding problems or potential problems with imported products under FDA's jurisdiction.  FDA coordinates its Import Alerts and Bulletins closely with APHIS.  The Agency has issued the following:          On September 1, 1992, FDA issued Import Bulletin 99-B03, alerting field units to imports, from BSE countries, of animal by-products and regulated products containing animal by-product ingredients.    On October 19, 1994, FDA issued Import Alert 17-04 (replacing the 1992 Import Bulletin) calling for the detention, without examination, of bulk shipments of high-risk bovine tissues and tissue-derived ingredients from BSE countries (at that time this included the U.K., France, Ireland, Oman, Switzerland, and Portugal).  FDA updated this alert whenever APHIS revised the list of BSE countries it included at 9 CFR  94.18.    On January 24, 2000, FDA updated the existing Import Alert 17-04, which called for detention of bulk shipments of high-risk bovine tissue from BSE countries to include countries in most of Europe, following APHIS's extension of import restrictions to those countries.    On December 20, 2000, FDA issued Import Bulletin 71B-02, alerting FDA field personnel of the APHIS restrictions on animal feed ingredients from 31 countries, and instructing them to coordinate entry review with their local APHIS office.  This Import Bulletin was cancelled on January 23, 2001, after the issuance of Import Alert  99-25.    On January 20, 2001, FDA issued Import Alert 99-25, which instructed FDA field personnel to detain animal feed, animal feed ingredients, and other products for animal use consisting of, or containing, ingredients of animal origin from the 31 countries where BSE is known to exist and/or have less restrictive import requirements then those that would be acceptable in the U.S.    On March 1, 2001, FDA issued Import Bulletin 99B-14, alerting FDA field personnel that APHIS further prohibited the importation into the U.S. of certain edible ruminant products from Europe, Oman, and BSE at-risk countries.  The Bulletin advises that FDA entry review should include assessment of product ingredients to determine whether they contain or may contain ruminant material subject to the APHIS prohibition.      Protecting FDA-Regulated Medical Products and Dietary Supplements    FDA also has taken steps to protect medical products (such as drugs, blood, vaccines, and medical devices) for human use.  Since 1993, FDA also has sent a number of letters to manufacturers of FDA-regulated products providing guidance on the use of bovine materials from countries affected by BSE and taken other actions.     In 1993 and again in 1996, FDA requested that manufacturers of FDA-regulated products intended for humans not use bovine-derived materials from BSE countries.     In September 1997, FDA released a Guidance for Industry, ""The Sourcing and Processing of Gelatin to Reduce the Potential Risk Posed by Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE) in FDA-Regulated Products for Human Use.""  FDA recommends that gelatin-containing products such as candy or capsules imported from the 31 countries identified as having BSE or at risk for having BSE be manufactured under specific guidance.  Gelatin is to be made from non-BSE herds and use only specific parts of BSE-free animals.      In April 2000, FDA's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) issued a letter to manufacturers of biological products reminding them of the Agency's strong recommendations not to use materials derived from ruminant animals from countries where BSE is known to exist.  This action was taken as a result of learning that its recommendations regarding the sourcing of bovine materials for the manufacture of vaccines had not been followed in at least one instance.     In May 2000, CBER requested that all vaccine manufacturers review the source for all bovine-derived materials used in the manufacture of their products, including bovine derived material used to prepare working cell and seed banks.      In July 2000, assessments of risk and recommendations regarding additional vaccines manufactured with bovine derived materials that had been obtained from European countries on the USDA list were discussed in a meeting held in July 2000 between CBER's Vaccines and Related Biological Advisory Committee and FDA's TSE Advisory Committee.  The joint committees concluded that for licensed products, the risk to recipients, if any, was theoretical and remote and outweighed by the benefits of the vaccines.  The joint committees, nonetheless, recommended that if bovine materials were found to be used in vaccine production that manufacturers change sources.  They also agreed with CBER that if the working cell and seed banks were derived (after January 1, 1980) using bovine materials from countries on the USDA list, manufacturers re-derive those cell and seed banks using bovine materials from countries not on the USDA list.  Manufacturers have agreed to, and have begun implementing, all of these changes.     In November 2000, FDA sent a letter to manufacturers and importers of dietary supplements.  The letter states the Agency's strong recommendation that firms manufacturing or importing dietary supplements that contain specific bovine tissues take whatever steps are necessary to assure themselves and the public that such ingredients do not come from cattle born, raised, or slaughtered in countries where BSE is known to exist.  Since 1992, FDA has issued four letters to the dietary supplement industry to make sure the industry was aware of the problem and that they should be taking appropriate action.    FDA inspects manufacturers of FDA-regulated products to determine if manufacturers are following the Agency's current recommendations as part of current good manufacturing practices.  In addition, as applications for new products or changes to products are submitted, FDA ensures that the recommendations are being followed, if those products are required to have FDA clearance prior to marketing in the U.S.    Protecting the Blood Supply      In November 1999, FDA issued guidance to blood centers to reduce the theoretical risk of transmission of vCJD to recipients of blood products.  This precautionary measure recommended procedures for deferring potential donors who may have been significantly exposed to BSE due to travel or residence in the U.K.  FDA's present guidance recommends that blood centers exclude potential donors who have spent six or more cumulative months in the U.K. between January 1, 1980, and December 31, 1996, from donating blood.  Further revision to this guidance may be forthcoming as new information becomes available regarding other countries' BSE experiences.     TSE Advisory Committee    FDA has constituted a TSE Advisory Committee, which is composed of non-government experts in TSE matters and meets publicly on at least a semi-annual basis.  This committee was chartered originally in 1995.  The purpose of the TSE Advisory Committee, as with all of our advisory committees, is to consider policy and scientific issues and then provide FDA with insight and recommendations.  One standing agenda item of this committee is review of current regulations and guidance to prevent exposure of the U.S. population to the agent(s) of BSE/TSE through blood, tissues, and other regulated products.  FDA's TSE Advisory Committee recently offered advice on revising the guidelines to include potential donors who have lived an aggregate of ten years in France, Ireland and Portugal.  FDA is developing revisions to its current industry guidance and will consider the advice of the committee.    Interagency Coordination of TSEs Issues    Protecting the U.S. from BSE and all TSEs are top priorities of the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS or Department).  Secretary Thompson has made BSE one of his priorities, and has  initiated a process to strengthen coordination of BSE/TSE activities across the Department.     In January 2001, FDA established an Interdepartmental Steering Committee for BSE/TSE Affairs.  This committee is chaired by the Acting Commissioner of FDA and includes representatives  of:  CDC, FDA, NIH, USDA (FSIS, APHIS, FAS), the U.S. Trade Representative, the Office of Management and Budget, the Customs Service, the Department of State, the Department of Defense, the State Association of Feed Control Officials, the National Association of State Departments of Agriculture, and the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy.     The committee assures:      Ongoing coordination between agencies.    Integrated contingency planning for the possibility that a case of BSE or of vCJD might be found in the United States.    Identification and action on high priority cross-departmental issues in the U.S. regarding BSE and vCJD.   Coordination of risk communication plans by the various agencies.       DHHS BSE/TSE activities can be divided into four major  components:  Surveillance, Protection, Research and Oversight.  Surveillance for human disease is primarily the responsibility of the CDC.  Protection and Surveillance of animals, feeds, and foods are responsibilities of FDA, which it shares with USDA.  Research is primarily the responsibility of NIH, although FDA also conducts important research.  Oversight is primarily the responsibility of the DHHS Office of the Secretary.    Within the Department, there also is a Public Health Service Blood Safety Committee (BSC) that is chaired by the Assistant Secretary for Health, who serves as the Blood Safety Director for the Department.  The BSC includes among its members the directors of CDC, FDA, NIH, and the DHHS Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation.  The purpose of this committee is to enable threats to the safety or availability of the blood supply to be brought immediately to the highest levels of DHHS.  The BSC has been convened on an urgent basis to review proposed recommendations to defer blood donors at risk of transmitting BSE by virtue of prior residence in the U.K.  The BSC also met to consider issues relating to the development of CJD at an unusually young age in a hunter who had been a long time plasma donor.  In addition, members of this group met to review issues related to the discovery of a poorly characterized TSE that recently appeared in flocks of East Freisian sheep, which had been imported to Vermont from Europe.  The group stands ready to be convened for similar matters in the future.    The Department intends to ensure timely, accurate, thorough, and clear communication to the public about the nature and extent of the threats posed by BSE/TSE and about the actions that each agency of government is taking to protect the public from these threats.  FDA has announced that it will hold a public meeting for consumers on BSE on April 16, 2001, in Washington, D.C.  The purpose of this meeting will be to inform the public about FDA's BSE-related activities and to hear from various consumer groups about their concerns with and suggestions for addressing the challenge of BSE.     Conclusion    Let me close by again stating that currently there is no evidence that BSE or vCJD exists in the U.S.  Working together with many counterpart agencies in the U.S., around the world and with various industry and consumer groups, FDA will continue to work to protect the health of the American people and of our animal population by acting to minimize the risk of BSE introduction or spread into the U.S. Thank you again for the opportunity to testify.        Recent Testimonies          FDA Home Page     |  Search  |  A-Z Index     |  Site Map  |  Contact FDA   FDA/Office of Legislation    Web page created by ue 2001-APR-04."

Kandra       .     The      Center for Veterinary Medicine (CVM) is pleased to announce that FDA Commissioner      Jane E. Henney, M.D. has approved the appointment of Dr. Andrew J. Beaulieu      as Deputy Director, succeeding Dr. Michael J. Blackwell, who left CVM on February      1, 1999.     A native of Washington, D.C., Dr. Beaulieu holds both a B.S. and B.A. degree      from the University of Miami, and received his D.V.M. degree cum laude from      The Ohio State University. Dr. Beaulieu credits a ""back-fence"" neighbor,      who was an FDA chemist, with planting the FDA seed ""way back"" when      he was in Junior High School, and some very effective cultivation by Dr. Homer      Smith, former Regional Veterinary Medical Officer in the Cincinnati District      Office with influencing him to apply to the Food and Drug Administration during      his senior year at Ohio State. Both gentlemen spoke very convincingly of FDA's      underlying ""moral purpose"", resulting in Dr. Beaulieu's ultimate      decision to dedicate his entire career to CVM, beginning as a veterinary reviewer      in the Office of New Animal Drug Evaluation (ONADE) in June, 1972. In 1974,      Dr. Beaulieu transferred to the Office of Surveillance and Compliance (OSC),      where he moved up to Division Director in the Division of Surveillance until      1991, when he became Director of the Division of Therapeutic Drugs for Food      Animals in ONADE. In November, 1992, he was appointed a Deputy Director of      ONADE. In addition, Dr. Beaulieu also served in the Office of Research for      a brief time.     It is Dr. Beaulieu's belief that a regulatory organization's decision-making      is greatly influenced by regulatory and judicial precedents, and that institutional      knowledge has an impact on virtually everything that is done in such an organization.      CVM Director, Dr. Stephen Sundlof says, ""There are few if any who command      Dr. Beaulieu's historical knowledge of and broad experience within CVM. His      recent efforts to re-engineer the new animal drug approval process and his      experience with the implementation of the Animal Drug Availability Act (ADAA)      will bring valuable perspective to his new job.""     During his 27-year CVM tenure, Dr. Beaulieu has provided outstanding leadership      in the direction and oversight of many of the Center's activities. He was      directly involved in promoting and implementing the ""phased-review""      process, which provides for mapping out the drug development process between      the sponsor and CVM personnel, and permits different parts of the process      to proceed simultaneously on different time tracks, shortening the overall      drug development and review process. Over the last few years, he has also      been responsible for managing to near completion the process of DESI-finalization,      an effort that has been ongoing within CVM for more than 20 years. In the      past, Dr. Beaulieu served as one of five Project Management System (PMS) managers      in CVM, overseeing the planning, allocation, and utilization of resources      throughout the Center. More recently, he played a very active role in negotiating      the changes represented by the ADAA, and has helped draft interpretive policy      and regulations to implement the statutory changes.     In a time of shrinking resources, many challenges are presented for CVM's      management team. Dr. Beaulieu hopes to continue working on the New Animal      Drug procedural regulations, a long-term project to improve the animal drug      approval process, as well as to continue to work toward developing innovative      ways to provide for the legal marketing of drugs for minor species. In addition,      he has a long-standing commitment to participatory management and team decision-making,      which CVM is fostering through its ongoing High Performance Organization (HPO)      initiative.     Dr. Beaulieu has been honored with two Awards of Merit, four Commendable      Service Awards, a Commissioner's Special Citation, a Deputy Commissioner's      Special Recognition Award, and numerous Group Recognition Awards during his      distinguished FDA career.     Dr. Beaulieu has effectively represented the Center's interests at the national      and international level. His thorough working knowledge of the animal product-related      provisions, limitations and practical applications of the Food, Drug, and      Cosmetic Act makes Dr. Beaulieu uniquely qualified and a valuable addition      to CVM's leadership team.     An avid golfer, Dr. Beaulieu resides in Silver Spring, Maryland with his      wife, Julie, and daughters, Elyse and Kathryn, both college students. We wish      him the best of luck as he assumes this very deserved role in CVM.     FDA PUBLISHES SUBSTANTIAL EVIDENCE FINAL RULE          .     FDA's final rule amending the new animal drug regulations to further define      the term ""substantial evidence'' published in the July 28, 1999, Federal      Register. The purpose of this final rule is to encourage the submission of      new animal drug applications (NADAs) and supplemental NADAs for single ingredient      and combination new animal drugs. The final rule also encourages dose range      labeling. This final rule implements, in part, the Animal Drug Availability      Act of 1996 (ADAA), which amended the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.      The purpose of the ADAA is to facilitate the approval and marketing of NADAs      and medicated feeds.     Before FDA can approve a new animal drug, FDA must find, among other things,      that there is substantial evidence that the new animal drug is effective for      its intended uses under the conditions of use prescribed, recommended, or      suggested in the proposed labeling. The changes made to the definition of      ""substantial evidence'' by the ADAA and by the further definition of      that term in this final rule give FDA greater flexibility to make case-specific      scientific determinations regarding the number and types of adequate and well-controlled      studies that will provide, in an efficient manner, substantial evidence that      a new animal drug is effective.     A copy of this final rule may be obtained from  CVM's      Federal Register Notices Page  or by calling or writing the FDA Veterinarian.     Further information about this final rule may be obtained from the July 28,      1999, Federal Register and from Dr. Herman M. Schoenemann, Center for Veterinary      Medicine (HFV-126), Food and Drug Administration, 7500 Standish Place, Rockville,      MD 20855, 301-827-0220.     FDA AND USDA-ARS PARTICIPATE IN PLANNING SURVEILLANCE      PROGRAM FOR FOODBORNE PATHOGENS IN MEXICO     by Katherine Hollinger, D.V.M., M.P.H.       .     Dr. Linda Tollefson and Dr. Katherine Hollinger of the FDA's Center for Veterinary      Medicine (CVM), and Dr. Paula Fedorka-Cray of USDA's Agricultural Research      Service (ARS), represented the National Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring      System-Enteric Bacteria (NARMS-EB) at a meeting of ResistVet collaborators      in Morelia, Mexico to develop a plan to monitor for antimicrobial drug resistance      in foodborne pathogens. This meeting was held in conjunction with the joint      annual meetings of the Mexican Society of Infectious Diseases and the National      Congress of Antimicrobials and Chemotherapy, held from June 30 to July 3,      1999, and oral presentations and poster sessions were conducted on nosocomial      infections, antimicrobial resistance and many other topics.     The NARMS representatives met with ResistVet organizer Dr. Mussaret Zaidi      of the Research Department in the O’Horan General Hospital, Yucatan and      collaborator Dr. Alejandro Macia of the Department of Microbiology at the      School of Medicine and Leon General Hospital to discuss plans to initiate      the antimicrobial resistance monitoring program in 5 states in Mexico (Durango,      Michoacan, Guanajuanto, Mexico City and Yucatan) and Guatamala. These five      states and the site in Guatamala are located in areas with significant animal      agriculture in close proximity to the monitoring centers. Much of the food      consumed in these areas is locally produced, unlike food distribution in the      United States that is distributed nationally and internationally. The monitoring      program will target the foodborne pathogens, salmonella and campylobacter.      Planning of the surveillance program focused on the numbers and potential      sources of isolates, technical and laboratory methodology and resources available      to implement the system. Isolates will be obtained from clinical human sources      from hospital and daycare settings, from retail food, and from live, healthy      animals in collaboration with producers and veterinarians. Testing will be      conducted at the hospital laboratories and results will be pooled into a database.     In the joint meeting of the WHO-Resistnet and ResistVet participants the      NARMS-EB representatives presented information describing the NARMS-EB program      and gave a review of some of the data collected from the program in 1998.      Dr. Tollefson gave an overview of NARMS-EB, the objectives, achievements and      limitations of the monitoring program. The program collects isolates of foodborne      pathogens: E. coli, salmonella and campylobacter isolates, from clinically      affected humans, food animals at slaughter and diagnostic laboratory isolates.      The resistance patterns of the salmonella isolates are determined by microbroth      dilution to seventeen antimicrobial drugs and by E-test to eight antimicrobials      for campylobacter isolates. The laboratory methods used to test the isolates      are identical for the human and animal portions of the program. The human      isolates are submitted from fifteen sites nationally and tested at the Centers      for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta. The animal isolates are collected      from slaughter plants, processing plants and the National Veterinary Services      Laboratory and tested at USDA's Agricultural Research Service in Athens, Georgia.      The objectives of the program are to provide timely information to veterinarians      and physicians, prolong the lifespan of approved drugs, provide descriptive      data on the trends in antimicrobial susceptibility of salmonella from human      and animal populations and identify areas for more detailed investigation.     Dr. Hollinger presented a talk on ""Multi-drug resistance in Salmonella      isolates from poultry at slaughter"" and Dr. Fedorka-Cray presented ""An      overview of antimicrobial resistance in Campylobacter and related research.""      Other presentations described antimicrobial drug resistance patterns in salmonella      and campylobacter, water contamination and antimicrobial resistance patterns      on poultry and swine farms in Yucatan.     Data was presented from the 15 hospital-based centers distributed throughout      Mexico, Costa Rica and Guatamala, in the Resistnet surveillance program begun      in 1996. The surveillance program has tested susceptibility of over 5,000      clinical human isolates of E. coli, Staph. aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa,      Salmonella and Shigella to commonly used antimicrobials. E. coli was the most      commonly isolated organism tested in the program and represented 22 percent      of all isolates. A 1996 Mexico City study of 70 children with symptoms of      enteric disease indicated 46 percent requiring antibiotic treatment. A second      study conducted in 1997 of 19 children observed for 20 weeks indicated that      up to 70 percent of ill children received antibiotics for treatment of severe      diarrheas. Molecular microbiological techniques were described for epidemiologic      surveys of the isolates to identify clusters and potential outbreaks. Bayer      representative, Dr. Raul Vazquez, described the company’s strategy for      the responsible use of antibacterials in Latin America and provided background      information on food animal drug use in Mexico.     The meeting concluded with discussion of the protocol for the proposed monitoring      program. The program will be implemented in August with the testing of 50      to 100 samples per site for isolation of Salmonella for four consecutive weeks.      The first samples will be collected from daycare centers and collection of      approximately 50 salmonella isolates is expected. The Epidemiology Department      at the School of Veterinary Medicine in Yucatan will be participating in the      program, providing animal isolates for the program. Other areas planned for      inclusion in the program are testing of seafood for Salmonella, Vibrio cholera      and Shigella.     Proposed next steps include plans to exchange advanced training in isolation      and susceptibility testing of foodborne pathogens, training in laboratory      methodology and technology transfer. Surveillance will be implemented in a      stepwise manner to begin with sampling for Salmonella from children in daycare      settings and will expand to include retail poultry isolates. Incorporation      of other sources of human and animal samples and addition of Campylobacter      are planned for next year.     This collaboration between NARMS and the Mexican ResistVet group is the initiation      of the first international monitoring system for foodborne pathogen surveillance      and antimicrobial drug susceptibility monitoring in the Americas. Long-term      goals include development of an international database to make information      available to prevent outbreaks of foodborne disease and identify emerging      pathogens.       FDA PROPOSES TO RECLASSIFY SHEEP AS A MINOR      SPECIES       .     In the July 26, 1999, Federal Register, FDA's Center for Veterinary Medicine      (CVM) published a proposed rule to reclassify sheep as a minor species for      all data collection purposes. This proposal allows sponsors of supplemental      new animal drug applications to extrapolate human food safety data from a      major species such as cattle to sheep. In particular, this will allow the      extrapolation of the tolerances for residues of new animal drugs in cattle      to sheep.     A copy of this proposed rule may be obtained from  CVM's      Federal Register Notices Page  or by calling or writing the FDA Veterinarian.     Since 1983, FDA has permitted some flexibility in the means to meet data      requirements to support the approval of new animal drugs intended for ""minor      species.'' Specifically, these classifications permit data extrapolation from      a major species to support the safety and effectiveness of a new animal drug      for a minor species.     ""Minor species"" are defined by exclusion as any species other than      horses, cattle, swine, dogs, cats, chickens, and turkeys. Sheep   have      been classified as a minor species for the purposes of target animal safety      and effectiveness studies. However, they have been considered a major species      for the purpose of determining the human food safety of edible products.     In a January 1983 final rule on minor species drugs, FDA said that sheep      were classified as a major species for human food safety purposes because      some consumers in the United States eat a large proportion of lamb and mutton      in their diets. However, the Agency stated that it would be willing to reevaluate      this conclusion if new data became available.     New data have become available since publication of the 1983 final rule.      These data allow FDA to conclude that sheep   should be a minor species      with respect to all data requirements. The new data concern the similarity      of drug metabolism between sheep and cattle rather than consumption levels.      FDA now believes that the body of evidence concerning drug metabolism is more      significant in determining the major/minor status of species than consumption      data because it demonstrates the reliability of data extrapolated from a major      species.     Interested persons should submit written comments on the proposed rule by      October 25, 1999, to the Dockets Management Branch (HFA-305), Food and Drug      Administration, 5630 Fishers Lane, Room 1061, Rockville, MD 20852. Comments      should be identified with Docket number 99N-2151.     Further information about this proposed rule may be obtained from Dr. Meg      Oeller, Center For Veterinary Medicine (HFV-130), Food and Drug Administration,      7500 Standish Place, Rockville, MD 20855, 301-827-7581, e-mail:  moeller@cvm.fda.gov .     CVM SPONSORED RESEARCH AND ADVANCES IN TECHNOLOGY          .     The primary goal of scientific research in FDA's Center for Veterinary Medicine      (CVM) is to provide knowledge and procedures that ensure the safety of animal      derived food and animal health products. To achieve this goal, CVM conducts      both intramural and extramural research programs relevant to regulatory and      public health needs.     CVM’s extramural research program brings to CVM the ideas and views      of academic scientists and as such, is critical to maintaining access to cross-cutting      and state-of-the-art science. Occasionally, projects funded through the extramural      program may result in new, exceptionally innovative and practical ideas and      procedures that represent an immediate advance in technology useful to food      safety and drug regulation.     One of the developments that resulted from CVM funding for research into      new methods for the analysis of drugs and pollutants in food animal tissues      in the late 1980's and early 1990's was a process called matrix solid phase      dispersion, or MSPD. The process involves blending tissues with a solid-phase      bonded silica, such as the material used in solid phase extraction (SPE) columns,      to simultaneously perform sample homogenization, sample matrix disruption      and the formation of a column material from which individual drugs, drug classes      or multiple drug classes can be eluted from a single sample. This process,      first reported in 1989 by Steven A. Barker and Austin R. Long at Louisiana      State University, was subsequently patented (U.S. patent # 5,272,094, issued      Dec. 21, 1993) and has since been developed for commercial applications by      at least two international companies. The primary interest has been in the      use of MSPD for the isolation of pesticides in tissues from food animals and      of herbicides and pesticides from fruits and vegetables.     The methods developed have been shown to be equivalent to or better than      existing ""official"" methods. MSPD not only can increase the cost      effectiveness of analytical methods but also contributes to the minimization      of environmental and scientist solvent exposure hazards. Since the first publication      of the process in 1989, approximately 50 new methods for drugs, pollutants      and natural products using MSPD have been published, ranging from the isolation      of tocopherols in human blood samples to the determination of herbicides in      corn. These MSPD applications and the materials to perform them have primarily      been promoted by Varian's Sample Preparation Products division in the U.S      (which licensed the patent in 1995) and by International Sorbent Technology      in the United Kingdom.       FDA HOSTS A FOLLOW-UP WORKSHOP ON BSE FEED      REGULATION       by Paul M. Raynes      Deputy Director, Division of Federal-State Relations      FDA Office of Regional Operations       .     The Fairmont Hotel in Dallas, Texas was the setting for a recent Food and      Drug Administration (FDA) sponsored workshop for State veterinarians and feed      control officials from all fifty States, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands      and Canada, to provide a briefing on the latest developments with the Bovine      Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE) feed regulation. More than 170 State and Federal      regulators took part in the two-day workshop that featured speakers from FDA’s      Center for Veterinary Medicine (CVM) and Office of Regulatory Affairs (ORA),      USDA’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) and Canada’s      Food Inspection Agency.     The BSE regulation, now in effect for two years, restricts the use of mammalian      protein in feeds for cattle and other ruminants. The regulation requires protein      renderers, protein blenders, feed manufacturers and distributors to label      feeds that contain prohibited material with the following warning statement:       ""Do not feed to cattle or other ruminants"" . It was developed      to prevent the establishment and amplification through feed of BSE.     This workshop was a follow-up to a 1997 meeting in Kansas City where the      regulation was first discussed with an audience of more than 100 Federal and      State regulators. As he had done in Kansas City, Dr. John Honstead, a veterinary      medical officer with CVM’s Division of Animal Feeds, briefed the Dallas      audience on the science related to BSE. He explained that BSE is one type      of spongiform encephalopathy while others can be found in sheep, minks, cats      and humans. Dr. Honstead reported that, although the BSE epidemic in the United      Kingdom continues to abate, there are growing concerns that the incidence      of a similar disease in humans called ""new variant"" Creutzfeldt-Jakob      disease (CJD) is increasing. And, unlike its counterpart, sporadic CJD, the      ""new variant"" does not discriminate regarding age. The latest cases      have involved victims under the age of 30.     Gloria Dunnavan, Director of CVM’s Division of Compliance, wore several      hats during the workshop. She reviewed the Inspection Reporting Checklist,      giving the audience the rationale as to why certain questions were being asked.      She also led the audience in a question and answer session to gain feedback      useful in making needed changes to the checklist. She also shared the program      with Ricky Rodriguez from FDA’s Dallas District Office, discussing enforcement      issues and reviewing guidance documents.     The States also played an important role in the presentation of this workshop.      Two States, Virginia and California, provided detailed accounts of their perspectives      and experience with inspections for compliance with the regulation. Similar      presentations were then given by FDA personnel from the Denver and Detroit      District Offices providing a Federal perspective. The session concluded with      a fascinating look at similar efforts ""north of the border"" from      our regulatory counterpart, Mr. Sergio Tolussa, with the Canadian Food Inspection      Agency.     Other topics included import activities, future initiatives and the use of      a problem solving breakout session to deal with several scenarios involving      the use of prohibited materials. Finally, Dr. Linda Detwiler from USDA/APHIS,      discussed a memorandum of understanding with USDA and provided some insight      as to her agency’s role in the prevention of BSE in this country.     This workshop generated a great deal of interaction among the participants      including many questions, solutions to problems, ideas for inspectional techniques,      educational initiatives and enforcement approaches. Thanks to the development      of this regulation, we can continue to say that there has not been a single      case of BSE reported in the United States. Educational efforts such as this      with our regulatory partners will help assure that we can continue to make      that claim.       AQUACULTURE UPDATE       .     Aquaculture      is becoming an increasingly important source of fish available for human consumption.      As the number of aquaculture facilities grows, so does the need to develop      safe and effective drugs for treating fish diseases. It is also important      to understand the effect these treatments have on non-target organisms and      on the aquatic environment. As a result, the FDA's Center for Veterinary Medicine      (CVM) Office of Research (OR) has greatly expanded its commitment to aquaculture      research. In January 1999, Renate Reimschuessel V.M.D., Ph.D., accepted a      position at CVM to begin to develop a research program in aquaculture.     Dr. Reimschuessel, former Director of the Aquatic Pathobiology Center at      the University of Maryland School of Medicine, has over fifteen years experience      conducting research on aquatic animals. She has a multidisciplinary background      and has published work in the areas of fish husbandry, aquatic toxicology,      microbiology, pharmacokinetics, developmental biology and pathology .     One of Dr. Reimschuessel’s first tasks is to enhance the capacity of      the current aquaculture facility. Additional water delivery lines are being      installed to increase water flow to the fish systems and improve water quality.      Work is also in progress to construct closed, recirculating water systems      to simulate more intensive aquacultural techniques.     ""This is an incredible facility that will allow us to conduct state-of-the-art      aquaculture research"" stated Dr. Reimschuessel as she toured the building.      There are four main research rooms of approximately 4600 sq. ft., one radioisotope      fish lab of 600 sq. ft., a storage room, two mechanical/filtration rooms and      two support rooms which house computers, desks and a small library. Incoming      water from either the well or municipal supply goes into the primary filtration      system comprised of separate calcite and carbon contactors. Temperature is      controlled by separate heat exchangers and chillers, which provide hot and      cold running water to mixing valves at the fish tanks. A centralized computer      system monitors the flow-through water system temperature and pH.     Outside the building is a 25,000-gallon water storage tank with venturi systems      to remove carbon dioxide from the well water. Wastewater is sent to either      two 20,000-gallon ""clean"" water holding tanks or two 10,000-gallon      radioactive wastewater holding tanks. Dr. Reimschuessel is in the process      of obtaining three 1500-gallon tanks to hold saltwater.     Research at the facility will focus on both regulatory priorities and the      needs of the aquaculture community. Species that will be studied during the      first year include tilapia ( Oreochromis sp .), rainbow trout ( Oncorhynchus      mykiss ), Atlantic salmon ( Salmo salar),  channel catfish (Ictalurus       punctatus ) large mouth bass ( Micropterus salmoides ), toadfish ( Opsanus      tau ), and goldfish ( Carassius auratus ). All of these species, except      goldfish, are currently raised or maintained for food purposes. Goldfish will      serve as a model for ornamental fish and as a disease model. Goldfish are      an established model of infection by atypical Mycobacteria spp.(fish pathogens      as well as increasingly important pathogens for immune-compromised humans).     Dr. Reimschuessel has designed her research objectives, in general, to provide      data to assist the Food and Drug Administration in assuring that fish derived      from the aquaculture production environment are safe for human consumption.      Her priorities include studying the biodistribution, residue persistence,      metabolism, efficacy, and environmental effects of drugs and other chemicals      used in aquaculture. There will be a large effort to develop a rationale for      crop grouping (grouping species for drug approvals based on similarities in      anatomy, physiology and drug metabolism). Other studies are designed to investigate      the impact of drugs on the environment, non-target species and the pathogens      associated with aquatic species. Of increasing importance are studies designed      to understand the development and transmission of antimicrobial resistance      in both pathogens and environmental microbes. Understanding those mechanisms      will help in the development of treatment strategies that minimize the development      of resistant pathogens.     Dr.      Reimschuessel is currently preparing research protocols designed to address      a number of these priorities. She is actively collaborating with scientists      conducting aquaculture-related research at the University of Maryland, Johns      Hopkins University, Fort Detrick, and the Maryland Department of Natural Resources.      She also teaches veterinary students and veterinarians in the AquaVetâ      program each May at the Marine Biological Laboratory, Woods Hole, Massachusetts.      She will be developing a research internship program at CVM for fourth-year      veterinary students interested in aquaculture. She says ""I hope to continue      getting veterinarians involved in fish medicine and research. It is a specialty      in its infancy. Programs that educate veterinarians about aquatic species      will help increase correct diagnosis and treatment of diseases, thereby reducing      arbitrary or inappropriate use of therapeutic agents in farm-raised fish.      With CVM’s increasing research efforts and support for the minor species      drug program, we should be able to provide veterinarians with a greater choice      of safe and effective treatments.""       VETERINARY FEED DIRECTIVE       by Ron Scherzberg       .     A new category of drugs, veterinary feed directive (VFD) drugs, has been      created to allow drugs to be administered in animal feed, but only under the      order of a licensed veterinarian. Proposed regulations covering the ordering      of use and the distribution of VFD feeds (medicated feeds containing VFD drugs)      were published in the Federal Register of July 2, 1999. The Animal Drug Availability      Act of 1996 (ADAA) amended the FD&C Act to establish the VFD drug category.      Thus far, one VFD drug, tilmicosin, has been approved for use in treating      swine respiratory disease.     In the past, drugs used in animal feeds were approved as OTC drugs. While      the FD&C Act did not prohibit approval of prescription drugs for use in      animal feeds, such approvals were impractical because some states' pharmacy      laws required a licensed pharmacist on the premises to dispense the drugs,      while other states prohibited feed manufacturers from possessing and dispensing      prescription drugs. The VFD solves this problem by eliminating the pharmacist      involvement and allowing the veterinarian to order the use of VFD drugs in      feed. This participation by the veterinarian satisfies FDA’s concerns      that the drugs be used only in appropriate circumstances and under greater      control than OTC drugs.     The VFD process is straightforward in practice. A veterinarian, operating      within the confines of a veterinarian-client-patient relationship, examines      and diagnoses animal conditions and determines whether a condition warrants      use of a VFD drug. If it does, the veterinarian will issue a signed VFD containing      information specified by the drug’s approval regulation. The veterinarian      keeps a copy of the form and provides the completed and signed original and      a copy to the client. The client keeps the copy and gives the original to      the feed manufacturer which authorizes the VFD feed to be shipped to his animal      feeding operation. While not specifically required, we believe the drug manufacturer      will provide preprinted ""fill in the blank"" triplicate VFD forms      to the veterinary profession for the sake of efficiency and accuracy. This      has been done with tilmicosin, the one approved VFD drug.     The ADAA has a statutory requirement that anyone intending to distribute      VFD feeds notify CVM prior to beginning. A distributor means the VFD feed      manufacturer or anyone in the distribution chain who ultimately supplies VFD      feed to the animal producer. This could include the veterinarian if he is      the source of VFD feed. A VFD feed may not be distributed to a client without      a signed VFD. However, VFD feed may be sent down the distribution chain if      the consignee provides the distributor with a signed ""acknowledgment      letter affirming that it will only ship the VFD feed to a VFD holder or to      another distributor who supplies a similar acknowledgment letter. Feed manufacturers      or any distributor may stockpile VFD feeds in anticipation of orders.     We recognize that there are instances when direct contact among the veterinarian,      client and feed distributor is not practical. To counter this problem and      facilitate rapid movement of VFD feeds, we are proposing to allow facsimile      transmission of the VFD. While not proposed, we are also noting that telephone      and     e-mail are other avenues to consider for transmission of the VFD. We have      concerns about the clarity, completeness and security of these latter two      forms of VFD distribution. For this reason, we are inviting comments on the      use of e-mail and phone transmission to our final rule, and on how to ensure      such orders will be clear, complete and secure.     Another area of concern is the length of time a VFD may be valid (expiration      date) and the number of refills or reorders that may be allowed. For example,      if a hog operation historically has a disease outbreak in the post-weaning      stage, does the veterinarian need to write a VFD each time a group of pigs      is weaned? We think not, however, CVM would not allow an open-ended VFD. Limits      must be placed on length of time a VFD is valid and/or amount of animals that      can be treated. Again, the proposed rule invites comments on this issue by      September 30, 1999, to assist CVM in developing the final rule.     Extra-label use of VFD drugs or VFD feeds is prohibited, that is, the VFD      drug may be used only as specified in the drug’s published regulation.       FDA SPONSORS WORKSHOP ON MICROBIOLOGICAL SAFETY      OF DRUG RESIDUES IN FOOD       .     FDA's Center for Veterinary Medicine (CVM) will sponsor a workshop entitled      ""Microbiological Safety of Drug Residues in Food"" to be held on      September 20-21, 1999. The Workshop will be held at the Doubletree Hotel,      1750 Rockville Pike, Rockville, Maryland 20852, from 8:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m.      on Monday, September 20, and from 8:00 a.m. to 2:00 p.m. on Tuesday, September      21. It will discuss the use of model systems to establish Acceptable Daily      Intakes (ADIs) for antimicrobial drug residues in food.     The Workshop will focus on human consumption of new animal drug residues      in food and direct effects on human intestinal microflora. The document entitled      ""A Proposed Framework for Evaluating and Assuring the Human Safety of      the Microbial Effects of Antimicrobial New Animal Drugs Intended for Use in      Food-Producing Animals"" (CVM's Framework document) will not be discussed      at the September 20-21 Workshop. Information about workshops on the Framework      document will be announced in a future CVM UPDATE(s) and from  CVM's      Antimicrobial Resistance Page .     In January 1996, CVM published the availability of a guidance document entitled      ""Microbiological Testing of Antimicrobial Drug Residues in Food.""      This guidance document defines when antimicrobial drugs would be exempt from      additional microbiological testing and when additional testing would be required.      The document also establishes 1.5 mg/person/day as the ADI of microbiologically      active residues that would be allowed in food without additional microbiological      testing. The Center also expressed the intention of validating model systems      that could be used to evaluate the effect of low levels of antimicrobial drugs      on the human intestinal microflora. The guidance document,  Micribiological      Testing of Antimicrobial Drug Residues in Food , is available on the Home      Page or by calling or writing the FDA Veterinarian.     In 1995 and 1996, CVM funded research to validate an  in vitro  and      an  in vivo  model system that could be used to set ADIs for antimicrobial      drug residues in food based on perturbations of the human intestinal microflora.      The results of this research will be presented at the September workshop.      In addition, other methods for determining ADIs for antimicrobial residues      used internationally and in Europe will also be presented and discussed. Based      on the information presented and discussed at the workshop, CVM intends to      reevaluate its guidance document for testing microbiological effects of antimicrobial      residues on the human intestinal microflora.     Registration for the workshop is free. However, registration is required.      For additional information and registration form, please contact Ms. Lynda      Cowatch, CVM, FDA, HFV-150, 7500 Standish Place, Rockville, MD, 20855, telephone:      (301) 827-5281 or FAX (301) 594-2298. A copy of the  registration      form  is also available on the Home Page.     A limited number of rooms at a special rate have been set aside at the Doubletree      Hotel for workshop participants.

The Animal Health Institute (AHI)) is sponsoring a workshop entitled ""Validation,      Format and Transfer of Medicated Feed Methods Workshop."" It will be held      on October 12, 1999, from 7:30 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. at the Holiday Inn Old Town      Select, 480 King Street, Alexandria, Virginia.     The purpose of this workshop is to present three Animal Health Institute      Guidance Documents entitled ""Guidance on the Validation of Analytical      Procedures for Medicated Feeds,"" ADS M23-001.01, ""Guidance on Analytical      Methods Documents for Medicated Feeds,"" ADS M23-002.01, and ""Guidance      on Protocols for Conduct of Method Transfer Trials for Medicated Feed Assays,""      ADS M23-003.01. These guidance documents were developed with Center for Veterinary      Medicine (CVM) participation. CVM will present the current CVM procedures/requirements      for conducting a Sponsor-Monitored Method Trial for Medicated Feeds. Information      concerning the guidance documents will be presented which will clarify and      streamline the development and evaluation of analytical procedures for medicated      feeds. The goal is to improve the process and shorten the regulatory review      time for food animal products.     A few of the topics that will be presented include Overview of the Current      Process, Importance of Medicated Feed Method Trials from the Surveillance      and Compliance Perspective, Presentation of Animal Health Institute Guidance      Documents, Validation of Analytical Procedures for Medicated Feeds, Contract      Research Organization Perspective, and State Laboratory Perspective.     The registration fee for the workshop is $165, and covers the cost of the      registration, continental breakfast, luncheon, and refreshment breaks. The      deadline for registration is September 24, 1999. For further information,      please contact Carol Bowley at AHI at 202-637-2440, or Mary Leadbetter at      CVM at 301-827-6964.

The Food and Drug Administration has issued final guidance concerning consumer-directed      (direct-to-consumer or DTC) broadcast advertisements for prescription animal      and human drugs and human biologicals. The final guidance describes an approach      that could fulfill the requirements under regulations to provide consumers      general risk information through media such as television, radio, or telephone.     The final guidance will continue a multifaceted approach to disseminating      product labeling in connection with broadcast advertisements -- ordinarily      containing these four sources: (1) a toll-free telephone number; (2) referral      to a print advertisement in a concurrently running print publication, or provision      of enough product brochures in various convenient outlets; (3) referral to      a healthcare provider (physician, pharmacist, veterinarian or other healthcare      provider); (4) an Internet web page address.     As required in the prescription drug advertising regulations, advertisements      broadcast over radio, TV or through telephone communications systems must      include a thorough ""major statement"" prominently disclosing all      of the major risks associated with the drug. In addition, sponsors of broadcast      advertisement are also required to present a brief summary or alternately      may make ""adequate provisions.""     This guidance encourages sponsors to consider the benefits of providing consumers      with nonpromotional, consumer friendly product information in addition to      the required product labeling. FDA is currently evaluating its regulations      as they relate to DTC print promotion and will address this issue in greater      detail at a later date.     Minor revisions in the final guidance include:                    deleting the option to offer to fax product labeling to consumers under          the toll-free telephone component of adequate provision.                                  emphasizing the importance of broad dissemination of the print advertisement          component of the adequate provision approach.                                  acknowledging that the print brochures alternative component of the adequate          provision approach was likely to be feasible only when broadcasting was          fairly limited in scope.                                  acknowledging explicitly that healthcare providers other than physicians          and pharmacists can be sources of additional human drug product information.          In the case of animal drugs, only veterinarians can provide information.                                  clarifying the differences in approach for telephone, television, and          radio advertisements.

COMPARATIVE PHARMACOKINETICS IN DIFFERENT PRODUCTION      CLASSES OF CATTLE       by Ian F. De Veau, Ph.D.       .     Increasing attention has been directed to the influences of gender and physiological      states, such as pregnancy and lactation, on the pharmacokinetics of human      drugs. Prior to 1993, FDA guidelines for the clinical evaluation of human      drugs recommended that women of childbearing age be excluded from phase 1      and early phase 2 clinical studies until reproductive toxicity studies were      conducted and some evidence of effectiveness had become available. Though      the guideline did not exclude using women as test subjects in later clinical      studies, its effect was to do just that. This policy raised ethical, legal,      and scientific questions about its suitability. One of the concerns was that      the physiological, metabolic, and hormonal differences between women and men      were such that it would be difficult to conclude how well the pharmacokinetic      behavior of a drug in women could be predicted by its pharmacokinetic behavior      in men. Not knowing about a drug's pharmacokinetic profile in women means      not knowing its efficacy, since the effectiveness of most drug treatments      is correlated to blood levels. It has been shown that significant differences      between women and men in drug elimination are common (Wilson, 1984 and Loebstein       et al ., 1997). In 1993, FDA reversed its position concerning the use      of women in early clinical trials to address potential gender differences      in drug elimination. This change is part of an overall trend in FDA policy      to broaden the human population base used routinely in clinical trials. FDA's      goal is to address the potential impact of gender, age, and ethnic background      on the pharmacokinetics and the pharmacodynamics of human drugs.     Gender and physiological state also influence the pharmacokinetic parameters      of veterinary drugs. Witkamp  et al . (1992) reported that the half-life      of sulfamethazine was about 75 percent and 40 percent lower in female goats      and cattle, respectively, than in males of the same species. The half-life      of thiamphenicol is shorter in 4-6 month old beef and dairy calves compared      to mature lactating dairy cows (Abdennebi  et al. , 1994). Furthermore,      Bengtsson  et al.  (1997) found statistical differences between pregnant      and lactating sheep in the clearance, volume of distribution, and elimination      half-life of penicillin-G.     This potential influence of gender and physiology on drug elimination could      impact the regulation of drug use in cattle. As a hypothetical example, a      drug sponsor submits a new parasiticide to CVM for approval. The application      states that the drug is intended only for use in beef cattle. The sponsor      needs to provide pharmacokinetic data for only beef animals. This would include      either steers (castrated males) or non-lactating beef cows. The sponsor need      not perform any pharmacokinetic studies on lactating dairy cows. Let's further      say that, upon review of the submitted data, CVM determines that the drug      is safe and effective for treatment of parasites in beef cattle and does not      represent a human food or environmental safety risk. The drug is approved.      What if, at a later date, the drug sponsor seeks approval for use of this      drug to treat the same condition in lactating dairy cows? Do the pharmacokinetic      data obtained from beef cattle adequately predict drug elimination in lactating      dairy animals, or should CVM require the drug sponsor to generate additional      drug elimination data to demonstrate safety and efficacy for this new production      class? CVM's Office of Research is investigating the existence of pharmacokinetic      differences between beef and dairy cattle.     Phenylbutazone was the first drug studied by the Office of Research to investigate      pharmacokinetic differences between bovine production classes. Phenylbutazone      is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory and anti-pyretic drug approved for use      in horses. However, phenylbutazone can have severe side effects in humans,      and it is not approved for use in any food-producing animal because of food      safety issues. In spite of this, there is evidence of its extra-label use      in cattle. Phenylbutazone is used to treat mastitis in lactating dairy cows      (Dascanio  et al. , 1995 and Shpigel  et al. , 1998); bacterial      infections in neonatal calves (Semrad  et al. , 1993); and musculoskeletal      disorders in steers and bulls (Williams  et al. , 1990). It is a lipophilic      drug that is highly plasma protein bound (> 98 percent, Boudinot  et      al. , 1990) and undergoes minimal biotransformation in cattle (Lees  et      al. , 1988). There is evidence that phenylbutazone elimination half-life      is different among different age groups of cattle. For example, the elimination      half-lives for neonatal calves, dry dairy cows, and mature bulls are 207 (Semrad       et al. , 1993), 40 (Lee  et al. , 1988), and 62 hours (Williams       et al. , 1990), respectively. To the best of our knowledge, no one has      compared two different production classes with respect to phenylbutazone pharmacokinetics.     Phenylbutazone was administered to a group of lactating dairy cows at a dosage      of 6 mg/kg body weight. Plasma and milk samples were taken periodically and      analyzed for phenylbutazone. The clearance, volume of distribution at steady      state, and elimination half-life were 3 mL/hr/kg body weight, 147 mL/kg body      weight, and 40 ± 6 hr, respectively (De Veau  et al. , 1998).      These values were similar to that determined for dry dairy cows (Lee  et      al. , 1988). Phenylbutazone was excreted into the milk at levels several      times greater than could be predicted by simple diffusion. One possible explanation      for the higher than predicted levels of phenylbutazone in milk would be significant      phenylbutazone binding to milk proteins. Phenylbutazone elimination half-life      was determined from milk data and was calculated to be 47 ± 4 hr. Mammary      clearance of phenylbutazone was 0.009 mL/hr/kg body weight, or about 0.34      percent of total body clearance.     A pharmacokinetic study on a group of beef steers, using the same dosage      of phenylbutazone, was also completed. Plasma samples were taken periodically      and analyzed for phenylbutazone. Pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated.      The results are being reviewed by Office of Research management and should      be available for publication shortly.     Additional pharmacokinetic studies are currently being conducted at Office      of Research using several model drugs of differing lipophilicity, plasma protein      binding, and mode and degree of biotransformation. This should give CVM a      more complete understanding on predicting when a drug is likely to be eliminated      differently by the two production classes of cattle.

BSE FEED REGULATION TEAM RECEIVES VICE PRESIDENTIAL      AWARD       .     On May 14, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)/Association of American      Feed Control Officials (AAFCO) Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy Feed Regulation      Team was honored with Vice President Al Gore's Hammer Award. The BSE Feed      Regulation Team is comprised of employees from FDA's Center for Veterinary      Medicine (CVM) and Office of Regulatory Affairs (ORA), and AAFCO, an organization      that includes officials from all States and the Federal government who are      responsible for enforcing the laws regulating the production, labeling, distribution,      and/or sale of animal feeds.     The Award was presented by Yetta Lyle who represented the Vice President's      National Partnership for Reinventing Government at CVM's 1999 Honor Awards      Ceremony. The award citation reads, ""For making a significant contribution      to reducing the possibility of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE, or 'mad      cow disease') becoming established and spread in the U.S."" The Team used      an innovative education-oriented partnership program to enforce a FDA regulation      designed to control BSE. Compliance rates for the first inspections of all      but one industry segment equaled or exceeded 75 percent. Compliance rates      at follow-up inspections should approach the goal of 100 percent compliance,      based on the enforcement strategy developed and updated jointly by the partners.      Independent research has shown that major industry adjustments have been made      to facilitate compliance with the regulations. FDA and State inspectors have      conducted an unprecedented number of education-oriented inspections; a reinvented      approach to doing inspections that has resulted in 70 percent savings in the      cost of inspections, amounting to $1.3 million in Fiscal Year 1999.     The Hammer Award is the down-to-earth symbol of the National Partnership      for Reinventing Government, a five-year old, major initiative to make the      government work better for less. The program honors Federal employees and      their partners who have joined forces to streamline procedures, put consumers      first, and help build a better and more cost-effective government.     In addition to a plain carpenter's hammer, the award includes a ribbon and      the Vice President's note of appreciation, all set in an aluminum frame. Also,      every Team member will receive a personal certificate of appreciation with      Al Gore's signature and a lapel hammer pin.     PLAIN LANGUAGE: THE CVM VFD REGULATION       by Joanne M. Kla       .     The Center for Veterinary Medicine is the first Center within the Food and      Drug Administration to publish a regulation using the ""Plain Language""      question and answer format in the codified section. Our proposed rule implementing      the Veterinary Feed Directive (VFD) portion of the Animal Drug Availability      Act of 1996 published in the Federal Register on July 2, 1999.     What got CVM started with Plain Language?                    The President’s Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments          and Agencies on ""Plain Language in Government Writing"" issued          on June 1, 1998. This memo required that any proposed and final rulemakings          published in the Federal Register after January 1, 1999 be in Plain Language          (unless the original proposal had published before January 1, 1999). We          expected the proposed rule on VFDs to publish after January 1, 1999, so          we knew we needed to write it in Plain Language.                                  We observed that it was mainly scientists and lawyers who read and interpret          our regulations for others in the regulated industries. This resulted          in documents that were very technical in nature and not necessarily understandable.                                  An increasing number of CVM’s regulations are not intended for regulatory          specialists, but rather for veterinarians, the feed industry, and animal          producers.                                  The Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996 requires          federal agencies to publish a simplified interpretation of all major regulations.                                  These factors suggested an obvious need for the use of simplified language          so the average citizen could read, understand, and follow our regulations.                 How did we get started?     The Center’s Policy and Regulations Team discussed the need for clearer      writing in CVM documents. We raised the idea of drafting a regulation in Plain      Language and asked for volunteers. Ron Scherzberg was eager to try with his      in-process draft VFD regulation. Surfing the Internet, he found a wealth of      guidance including  plainlanguage.gov , a site sponsored by Vice President      Gore’s National Partnership for Reinventing Government (NPR). In addition,      all CVM Policy and Regulations Team members attended Plain Language training.     How did we write this regulation in Plain Language?                    We began by defining our audience and deciding on the most useful plain          language tools and techniques. We did not write the proposed rule for          other government employees or lawyers. We wrote it for those we regulate:                                                                                                           - veterinarians            - members of the animal feed industry            - animal producers, and            - members of the pharmaceutical industry                                                          We used a question and answer format to explain the requirements, i.e.,        § 558.6 (c) ""What are the VFD recordkeeping requirements?""                          We used personal pronouns in the regulation (such as ""we"" and        ""you"").                          We used the more mandatory ""must"" rather than ""shall""        for the requirements, i.e., § 558.6 (d)(1) ""The distributor         must  notify the FDA only once, by letter, that it intends to distribute        animal feed containing a VFD drug.""                          We used simpler, more straightforward language.                          We tried to streamline the regulation by removing unnecessary language,        and using short sentences and the active voice.      How did CVM deal with roadblocks and challenges?   We initially met with some resistance, because the regulation in plain language    did not look like what people were accustomed to seeing. Once we explained what    we were doing and the strong Presidential mandate for the use of plain language,    we gained support from those who had previously been skeptical.   What are CVM’s next steps?   We plan to use plain language in future regulations, when it is appropriate.   FDA APPROVES FIRST TOPICAL DRUG FOR HEARTWORM PREVENTION    IN DOGS AND CATS       FDA has approved the first topical drug -- RevolutionTM, Selamectin, for the    prevention of heartworm disease in dogs and cats six weeks of age and older.    RevolutionTM is also the first drug to combine heartworm prevention as well    as the prevention and control of adult fleas and their eggs. Although heartworms    and fleas are the most significant parasites that RevolutionTM has activity    against, the drug is also effective against ear mites in cats and dogs, sarcoptic    mange (also known as scabies) in dogs, and intestinal roundworm and hookworm    infections in cats.   The drug is applied topically once a month. The duration of treatment depends    on the type of parasitic infection. In clinical trials, RevolutionTM was shown    to be safe and effective, with minimal side effects, and was well tolerated    by healthy dogs and cats. Caution must be used when treating sick, debilitated    or underweight animals. RevolutionTM will be sold by Pfizer Inc. of New York,    N.Y. beginning this fall. It will be available only on the order of a licensed    veterinarian.   CONSENT DECREE ENTERED IN ANIMAL DRUG CGMP CASE        On April 13, 1999, the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Wisconsin    accepted and entered a Consent Decree of Permanent Injunction between the United    States, and Radix Laboratories, Inc. and its President, Premchand Girdhari.    Radix is a manufacturer of injectable animal drugs, as well as other dosage    forms, located in Eau Claire, Wisconsin.   The government’s Complaint for Preliminary and Permanent Injunction alleged    that, among other things, Radix manufactured veterinary drug products with significant    deviations from Current Good Manufacturing Practice (CGMP) regulations for Finished    Pharmaceuticals, Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations, Parts 210 and 211. Under    the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, a drug manufactured in violation of    CGMP regulations is deemed adulterated.   Negotiations between the government and Radix resulted in a settlement in which    the firm neither admitted nor denied the allegations of the complaint. In the    Consent Decree of Permanent Injunction, the firm agreed to be restrained and    enjoined from manufacturing, processing, packaging, labeling, holding and distributing    drugs unless and until it is in compliance with the CGMP regulations. Radix    has also agreed to hire an independent expert who will inspect the firm and    certify in writing to the FDA that the firm is in compliance with the CGMP regulations.    Further, the firm agreed to revise and correct any inaccuracies on the label    of a product known as Multi-B Super. Violation of this consent decree may carry    civil or criminal penalties.   FDA's Minneapolis District Office conducted all investigative work for this    case. CVM’s Division of Compliance, FDA's Office of the Chief Counsel and    the U.S. Department of Justice's Office of Consumer Litigation were in charge    of the case processing, litigation and negotiation.

Warning letters were sent to the following firms/individuals for violations    from Good Manufacturing Practices (GMPs):              John D. Moyer, Moyer & Son, Inc., Souderton, PA             Dean Beyer, Western Consolidated Cooperative, Holloway, MN             Robert C. McKernan, Hess & Clark, Inc., Ashland, OH      A warning letter was sent to Scott A. Sanders, SAS Dairy, Modesto, CA, for    consigning a dairy heifer to be slaughtered for human food with illegal residues    of sulfamethazine and for having a history of offering animals for sale for    human food use which were adulterated with drug residues.   Lois M. Lochary, Riverbend Rabbitry, Oilton, OK, received a warning letter    for offering rabbits for sale with violative residues of streptomycin, for failing    to use amprolium in conformance with its approved labeling, and for using sulfaquinoxaline    to treat rabbits even though this product is not approved for this use. Also,    the warning letter noted that the firm had a supply of furazolidone on the premises.    The use of nitrofuran drugs such as furazolidone or nitrofurazone has been banned    in food-producing animals.   A warning letter was sent to Dr. Marc A. Puleo, Petmed Express, Fort Lauderdale,    FL, for dispensing prescription veterinary drugs without obtaining a lawful    order from a licensed veterinarian within the course of the veterinarian's professional    practice.   Dr. William R. Lance, Wildlife Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Fort Collins, CO, received    a warning letter because the firm has been commercially marketing veterinary    drugs without approval of supplemental new animal drug applications for a change    in manufacturing facilities and for revisions in manufacturing procedures as    required by Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations, Part 514.8.

GX006-05-7531589	"DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES        Public Health Service                       Food and Drug Administration    Rockville, MD 20857        September 5, 2001      The Honorable Edward M. Kennedy    United States Senate    Washington, D.C. 20515-2101   Dear Senator Kennedy:   During the past few weeks, concerns have been raised about human embryonic    pluripotent stem cells (HEPSC) and their eventual use in human clinical trials    for a variety of therapies. The Food and Drug Administration would like to take    this opportunity to clarify these issues. A similar letter is being sent to    Senator Judd A. Gregg.   While many questions are being raised, the science has not advanced far enough    to answer them yet. HEPSCs were first isolated in 1998, and the scientific research    about them is in its infancy. The FDA stands ready to work with the scientific    community as they near the stage of human clinical trials. We encourage investigators    to work closely with us to ensure that testing occurs in the most expedient    and safest manner.    Most of the concerns raised to date are not unique to human embryonic stem    cells. The use of irradiated mouse feeder layers in deriving HEPSC raises concerns    that also occur for other xenotransplantation products. FDA regulations do not    prohibit using mouse feeder layers to make HEPSC products for human clinical    trials. Of course, appropriate testing and precautions are necessary. FDA has    a number of active Investigations for New Drugs (INDs) for xenotransplantation    products currently in clinical trials.    Xenotransplantation products raise issues that several Public Health Service    agencies address, including the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Centers    for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), National Institutes of Health (NIH)    and Health Resource Services Administration (HRSA). In order to provide guidance    to maximize the safe conduct of xenotransplantation trials, these agencies together    with staff from the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation    (OASPE) developed the PHS Guideline on Infectious Disease Issues in Xenotransplantation    (1/18/01). The PHS Guideline on Infectious Disease Issues in Xenotransplantation    and several FDA Guidance Documents (see below*) have defined xenotransplantation    as ""any procedure that involves the transplantation, implantation, or infusion    into a human recipient of either (a) live cells, tissues, or organs from a nonhuman    animal source, or (b) human body fluids, cells, tissues or organs that have    had ex vivo contact with nonhuman animal cells, tissues or organs.""   FDA regulates xenotransplantation products using the regulatory framework established    for other biologics. Xenotransplantation products are, by their nature, also    cellular therapies, and some are also gene therapies, and as biologics are subject    to the provisions of the Food, Drug and Cosmetics Act and the Public Health    Service Act and the appropriate regulations in 21 CFR. A number of clinical    trials of FDA-regulated xenotransplantation protocols, including several in    which the contact with the animal cells is ex vivo, are currently enrolling    patients, after adequately addressing FDA's concerns. Addressing FDA's concerns    have included use of precautions such as: (1) testing the xenotransplantation    product for infectious agents by appropriate methods including co-culture assays    to detect potentially unknown viruses, (2) educating patients regarding the    potential infectious disease risks and monitoring and testing them for xenogeneic    infections following treatment, (3) educating xenotransplantation product recipients    to not donate blood or tissues for use in humans, (4) educating patient contacts,    and in some cases monitoring them, (5) maintaining appropriate records of treatment    with xenotransplantation products, (6) maintaining archived biologic samples    from the patient, animal source, and product in the event that a public health    investigation is needed, and (7) maintaining animal sources of xenotransplantation    products in a manner appropriate to reducing the infectious disease risks of    the product when used in humans. This latter precaution might not be necessary    if a long-term established, well-characterized cell line with adequate documentation    is used in xenotransplantation.   Thus, as intended and practiced, the FDA regulation of xenotransplantation    products, while aimed first and foremost at safeguarding the public health,    should not impose a substantial impediment to xenotransplantation product development,    including HEPSC that are produced by culture in vitro with mouse cells. HEPSC,    as with any other product, will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis to evaluate    safety when an application for investigational use is submitted to FDA. In the    meantime, sponsors planning the clinical use of HEPSC that have been developed    by exposure to animal cells should visit the FDA Xenotransplantation Action    Plan website (< http://www.fda.gov/cber/xap/xap.htm >)    where links to all the published material and transcripts can be found. They    are also encouraged to phone the agency (301 827-2000) with questions and concerns.    Potential sponsors of any xenotransplantation products are often counseled directly    by FDA personnel on how best to comply with FDA requirements on xenotransplantation.     __________________________________________________   *Guidance documents defining xenotransplantation:   · PHS Guideline on Infectious Disease Issues in Xenotransplantation,    January 2001    · Draft Guidance for Industry: Source Animal, Product, Preclinical, and    Clinical Issues Concerning Use of Xenotransplantation Products in Humans, February    2001    · Draft Guidance for Industry: Precautionary Measures to Reduce the    Possible Risk of Transmission of Zoonoses by Xenotransplantation Product Recipients    and Their Close Contacts, Through Whole Blood, Blood Components, Source Plasma,    and Source Leukocytes, December 1999     · Guidance for Industry: Public Health Issues Posed by the Use of Nonhuman    Primate Xenografts in Humans, April 6, 1999 (The actual wording of the definition    of xenotransplantation in this document ""the use of live cells, tissues,    or organs from a nonhuman animal source transplanted or implanted into a human,    or used for ex vivo contact with human body fluids, cells, tissues or organs    that are subsequently given to a human recipient."")

GX061-56-1960075	"U.S. Food and Drug Administration    FDA Consumer magazine    March-April 2003     Table of Contents    Updates   Topics in This Issue:       Home Glycated Hemoglobin Test for People With Diabetes      Combination Vaccine for Children     Prozac for Pediatric Use     Consumer Alert on Foreign Drugs     Strattera Approved to Treat ADHD     Forteo Approved for Osteoporosis Treatment     Gleevec Approved for First-Line Treatment of CML     Clozaril Approved for Reducing Risk of Suicide     Recombinant DNA Product for Rheumatoid Arthritis     Temporary Halt on Some Gene Therapy Trials     Warning Recommended for Products Containing AHAs     Raw Meat Diets for Pets and Zoo Animals      Home Glycated Hemoglobin Test for    People With Diabetes    The FDA has cleared the first over-the-counter test that measures glycated hemoglobin in people with diabetes to help monitor how well they are managing their disease.    The test, called Metrika A1cNow, had been available previously only by prescription and most often performed by lab technicians. Over-the-counter status means that consumers now can buy the test without a prescription and use it at home with results available immediately. The test is manufactured by Metrika Inc. of Sunnyvale, Calif.    People with diabetes should check their glycated hemoglobin level two to four times a year to monitor long-term control over blood glucose (sugar) levels. The level of glycated hemoglobin provides information on the average level of glucose in the body over a 90- to 120-day period.    This test provides information to complement that obtained from daily finger-stick blood glucose tests, which measure glucose at a single point in time.    Diabetes is a chronic disease in which blood glucose levels are too high. Abnormally high levels of glucose can damage the small and large blood vessels, possibly leading to blindness, kidney disease, amputation of limbs, stroke, and heart disease. About 17 million Americans have diabetes. Many of them may find the new home glycated hemoglobin test helpful.    Consumers can get more information about Metrika A1cNow on the Web at www.metrika.com    or by sending an e-mail to  dsmica@cdrh.fda.gov.    Combination Vaccine for Children    In December 2002 the FDA announced approval of Pediarix, a combination vaccine that protects infants against diphtheria, tetanus, whooping cough (pertussis), polio, and disease due to the hepatitis B virus. Pediarix is the only vaccine marketed in the United States that contains DTaP (diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and acellular pertussis), hepatitis B vaccine (recombinant), and inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV) for administration as one injection.    Pediarix is recommended for administration as a 3-dose primary series to infants    at approximately 2, 4, and 6 months of age. Pediarix should not be given to    infants before the age of 6 weeks, and is not indicated for infants born to    mothers who are infected with hepatitis B or whose hepatitis B status is not    known. Such infants should receive hepatitis B vaccine shortly after birth and    complete their immunizations according to a recommended schedule.     The 2003 Childhood Immunization Schedule  is available from the Centers for Disease    Control and Prevention.    In a trial with the administration of the vaccine at 2, 4, and 6 months of age, immune responses induced by Pediarix were generally similar to those induced by vaccines administered separately. The most frequently reported adverse reactions to Pediarix were pain, swelling, and redness at the site of the injection, fever, and fussiness. In clinical studies, fever occurred more frequently after administration of Pediarix than when the vaccines were administered separately.    DTaP vaccine, hepatitis B vaccine and IPV are all currently available in the United States as separate vaccines.    Pediarix is marketed by SmithKline Beecham Pharmaceuticals of Philadelphia.    Prozac for Pediatric Use    The antidepressant Prozac (fluoxetine) has been approved by the FDA to treat children and adolescents ages 7 to 17 for depression and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). The agency's action in January marked the first approval of one of the newer types of antidepressants (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors or SSRIs) for treating depression in this population.    Depression affects up to 2.5 percent of children and about 8 percent of adolescents in the United States, according to the National Institute of Mental Health. Symptoms of depression include depressed mood, loss of interest in usual activities, significant change in weight and/or appetite, insomnia or hypersomnia (abnormally excessive sleep), increased fatigue, feelings of guilt or worthlessness, slowed thinking or impaired concentration, and a suicide attempt or thoughts of suicide.    OCD is characterized by recurrent and persistent ideas, thoughts, impulses, or images (obsessions) that are repetitive and purposeful, and intentional behaviors (compulsions) that are recognized as excessive or unreasonable. The condition affects about 2 percent of the population and typically begins during adolescence or early childhood.    Common side effects associated with use of Prozac in children and adolescents were similar to those experienced by adults, and include nausea, tiredness, nervousness, dizziness, and difficulty concentrating. After 19 weeks of treatment with Prozac in one clinical trial, children and adolescents gained on average about half an inch less in height and about two pounds less in weight compared to those treated with a placebo. The clinical significance of this observation on long-term growth is not known. Further research will evaluate any potential impact of Prozac on long-term growth in children.    Prozac is marketed by Eli Lilly and Company of Indianapolis. The drug is also approved for major depressive disorder in adults, bulimia, and panic disorder.    Consumer Alert on Foreign Drugs    The FDA advises that consumers should not buy the following prescription drugs over the Internet:        Accutane (isotretinoin)     Actiq (fentanyl citrate)     Clozaril (clozapine)     Lotronex (alosetron hydrochloride)     Mifeprex (mifepristone, or RU-486)     Thalomid (thalidomide)     Tikosyn (dofetilide)     Tracleer (bosentan)     Trovan (trovafloxacin mesylate or alatrofloxacin mesylate injection)     Xyrem (sodium oxybate)     Although these drugs have important benefits for many people, they have serious known risks and so are available in the United States only under specially created safety controls. These safety controls are bypassed when the drugs are purchased over the Internet or imported from foreign sources. Drugs purchased from foreign Internet sources are not the FDA-approved versions of the drugs, and are not subject to FDA-regulated manufacturing controls or FDA inspection of manufacturing facilities.    In December 2002, the FDA added these drugs to an existing import alert, which advises FDA field personnel of the possible importation of these drugs, provides guidance for their detention and refusal of admission into the United States, and also advises U.S. Customs Service personnel to refer any attempted importation to the local FDA field office.    For additional information, see:       The consumer alert          The revised import alert     To learn more about how to buy prescription drugs safely, see the FDA's guide,  ""Buying Prescription Medicines    Online: A Consumer Safety Guide.""    Strattera Approved to Treat ADHD    Strattera (atomoxetine) has been approved by the FDA as the first new drug in 30 years to treat symptoms of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Between 3 percent and 7 percent of children and about 4 percent of adults have ADHD, according to the American Psychiatric Association. Symptoms include inattention, hyperactivity and impulsiveness. People with ADHD may make careless mistakes, fidget, interrupt others, talk excessively, and have problems paying attention.    Strattera has a different mechanism of action from the existing stimulant-like drugs that have been used to treat ADHD. Because Strattera does not appear to have a potential for abuse, it will not be classified as a controlled substance. The drug was studied in children, adolescents, and adults. Studies indicate that Strattera significantly improves ADHD symptoms when compared to a placebo. Side effects of Strattera include decreased appetite; upset stomach, nausea or vomiting; and tiredness. Some of the most common adverse effects in adults were problems with sleeping, dry mouth, dizziness, and sexual side effects.    Strattera will be marketed by Eli Lilly and Company of Indianapolis.    Forteo Approved for Osteoporosis Treatment     Postmenopausal women who are at high risk for having a bone fracture now have    a new treatment option for osteoporosis.    Forteo (teriparatide) is the first approved agent for treating osteoporosis that stimulates new bone formation. The drug is administered by injection once daily in the thigh or abdomen. Daily injections stimulate new bone formation, leading to increased bone mineral density.    An estimated 10 million Americans--80 percent of them women--suffer from osteoporosis, a progressive thinning of bones that may lead to an increased risk of spine, wrist and hip fractures. Forteo contains a portion of human parathyroid hormone, which is the primary regulator of calcium and phosphate metabolism in bones.    Among other benefits, studies of Forteo showed it reduced risk of vertebral and non-vertebral fractures in postmenopausal women. The effects of Forteo on fracture risks for men have not been studied.    Side effects reported with Forteo, which is made by Eli Lilly and Company of Indianapolis, included nausea, dizziness, and leg cramps.    Gleevec Approved for First-Line Treatment    of CML    Gleevec (imatinib mesylate) has been approved by the FDA as a first-line treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), an uncommon, life-threatening form of cancer.    Gleevec was first approved by the agency in May 2001 for the advanced stages of CML. At that time, the drug was also indicated for use as a second-line treatment for the chronic phase of CML after failure of interferon-alpha therapy.    CML occurs when two different chromosomes break off and reattach on the opposite chromosome, forming the so-called ""Philadelphia chromosome."" This leads to a blood cell enzyme being ""turned on"" all the time, and as a result, potentially life-threatening levels of mature and immature white blood cells occur in the bone marrow and blood. Gleevec works by blocking the rapid growth of white blood cells.    Gleevec is now approved for the treatment of all three stages of CML--CML myeloid blast crisis, CML accelerated phase, and CML in chronic phase--either before or after use of other therapy. The only known cure for CML is still by a bone marrow transplant.    The most common side effects reported with use of Gleevec include nausea, vomiting, fluid retention, muscle cramps, fatigue, skin rash, and headache. Gleevec, which is also approved to treat gastrointestinal stromal cancer, is manufactured by Novartis Pharma AG for Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corp. of East Hanover, N.J.    Clozaril Approved for Reducing Risk    of Suicide    Clozaril (clozapine), a drug used to treat schizophrenia for more than a decade, has been approved by the FDA for a new use: reducing the risk of recurrent suicidal behavior.    The drug was first approved in 1989 for treating schizophrenia in patients who do not respond to other therapies. The agency says the drug also may be useful for people with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder (exhibiting features of both schizophrenia and mania or depression) who have a history of attempted suicide, hospitalization, or suicidal thoughts and who are judged to be at chronic risk for re-experiencing suicidal behavior.    Schizophrenia is a brain disorder that affects about 1 out of 100 people and usually begins in young adults. About 20 percent to 40 percent of people with schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder attempt suicide. The annual number of suicides associated with schizophrenia in the United States is estimated at 3,600.    Because people who take Clozaril are at risk for a life-threatening blood disorder called agranulocytosis, they must have frequent blood tests. These tests are necessary to detect the blood disorder early enough so the person can stop the drug immediately. Seizures are another common serious side effect of the drug, which is manufactured by Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corp. of East Hanover, N.J.    Recombinant DNA Product for Rheumatoid    Arthritis    HUMIRA (adalimumab), a new product produced by recombinant DNA technology, has been approved by the FDA to treat rheumatoid arthritis.     HUMIRA is a human-derived antibody that binds to human tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha). TNF is naturally produced by the body and is involved with normal inflammatory and immune responses.    People with rheumatoid arthritis, a disease that affects more than 2 million Americans, have high levels of TNF in the lubricating fluid in joints (synovial fluid). The extra TNF plays an important role in both the pathologic inflammation and the joint destruction that are hallmarks of rheumatoid arthritis. By working against the inflammatory process, HUMIRA, like other TNF blockers, has proved to be effective in controlling symptoms of the disease.    HUMIRA is indicated for reducing signs and symptoms and inhibiting the progression of structural damage in adult patients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis who have had an inadequate response to one or more disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs.    HUMIRA, marketed by Abbott Laboratories of Abbott Park, Ill., is administered as a single injection every other week. The package carries a bolded warning stating that serious, sometimes fatal, infections have been reported with the use of TNF-blocking agents, including HUMIRA. Patients with rheumatoid arthritis should discuss therapy options with their physicians.    Temporary Halt on Gene Therapy Trials    In a precautionary measure, the FDA has placed a temporary ""clinical hold"" on all active gene therapy trials using retroviral vectors to insert genes into blood stem cells. A clinical hold is the mechanism used by the agency when it does not believe, or cannot confirm, that a study can be conducted without unreasonable risk to the patients.    The FDA took the action in January after it learned that a second child treated in a French gene therapy trial developed a leukemia-like condition. Both this child and another, who had developed a similar condition in August 2002, had been successfully treated by gene therapy for X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency disease (X-SCID), also known as ""bubble baby syndrome.""    Infants with X-SCID have a gene defect that leads to a complete lack of white blood cells that can fight infection. Without treatment, they die from complications of infectious diseases during the first year of life. The only treatment for this condition has been a bone marrow transplant.    In early results of the French study, in which a normal gene is inserted into blood stem cells of patients with X-SCID, nine of the 11 children had promising results and were able to leave the hospital and lead relatively normal lives.     When notified of the first adverse event in August 2002, the FDA initially issued a temporary halt after identifying three U.S. gene therapy studies that closely resemble the French trial. The agency's action stopped enrollment of human subjects in those trials.    By late January, the FDA's continuing review of adverse event reports from all U.S. studies involving retroviral vectors had found no evidence of leukemia caused by the gene therapy. However, as a precaution, with notification of the second event, the FDA issued a clinical hold on all gene therapy trials using retroviral vectors in blood stem cells. A retroviral vector, or a modified retrovirus, is a type of virus that inserts its genetic code directly into a cell's chromosome, substituting corrective genes for a cell's defective ones.    The temporary hold reflects the FDA's appreciation that it may be appropriate to continue some of these trials after they are updated to reflect this new risk information. The agency will consider and evaluate specific requests for clinical indications for fatal or life-threatening disorders for which there are no viable alternative treatments.    The FDA continues to review the data from the adverse events in France, as well as the risks and potential benefits of all ongoing gene therapy trials, and will continue to work closely with the National Institutes of Health's Office of Biotechnology Activities to oversee gene therapy studies in the United States.    Warning Recommended for Products Containing    AHAs    The FDA is considering a recommendation that cosmetics manufacturers add a ""sunburn alert"" to the labels of products containing alpha hydroxy acids (AHAs). The statement would warn consumers of the increased risk of skin sensitivity to ultraviolet (UV) radiation that may occur, and would give steps to take to minimize that risk.    The proposed guidance, published in the Dec. 2, 2002,  Federal Register,     was prompted by studies on the safety of topically applied AHAs in cosmetic    products performed by the Cosmetic, Toiletry, and Fragrance Association and    the FDA. Studies showed that topically applied AHAs increase skin sensitivity    to UV radiation during application, and that the sensitivity diminishes one    week after discontinuing application.    The period for public comment ended Jan. 31, 2003, and the FDA will address the comments before publishing a final guidance.    Raw Meat Diets for Pets and Zoo Animals    Pet owners increasingly are feeding their animals manufactured foods that contain raw meat. But giving animals these minimally processed foods creates a risk to public health and the animals, according to the FDA's Center for Veterinary Medicine (CVM).    To address this risk, CVM has provided a proposed guideline to manufacturers of foods that contain raw meat, or other raw animal tissues, for pets and zoo animals. The guideline, called a draft guidance, provides important safety and nutritional information and was made available in December 2002 for comment from the public, industry and others.    In addition to bacterial contamination, the draft guidance warns manufacturers about the dangers of dental or gastrointestinal trauma when bone is included in other than ground form. It also recommends the use of irradiation and proper transport and storage of raw meat products by manufacturers, distributors, and retailers to minimize contamination and disease transmission. The draft guidance also recommends participation in the U.S. Department of Agriculture's voluntary inspection program and the development and implementation of a Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point (HACCP) program.    To view the draft guidance,  go to the CVM Web site,     select guidance documents, and then find guidance number 122. A public comment    period on the draft closed on March 3, 2003. CVM will use the comments in preparing    the final guidance for industry.

GX037-03-3094495	"HHS  NEWS   U.S. Department of Health and Human Services     P97-1                           Food and Drug Administration FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE           Lawrence Bachorik: (301) 827-6242 January 2, 1997                 Broadcast Media:   (301) 827-3434                                 Consumer Hotline:  (800) 532-4440   FDA PROPOSES PRECAUTIONARY BAN AGAINST RUMINANT-TO-RUMINANT FEEDING        The Food and Drug Administration today proposed to prohibit using tissues from ruminants -- animals such as cows, sheep and goats -- in the manufacture of ruminant feeds.  Mink tissue would also be prohibited from such feeds.      The proposed regulation is the latest in a series of preventive measures -- including a voluntary industry moratorium -- that FDA, other federal agencies and industry have already taken to protect animals from transmissible degenerative neurological diseases, and to minimize any potential risk that such diseases could be transmitted from animals to humans.      These animal diseases are known as transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs).  Bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) is among the more commonly known of these diseases.  TSEs are characterized by a long incubation period, a relatively short clinical course of neurological signs, and 100 percent mortality. Because of concerns that BSE could in the future be identified scientifically as the cause of a new TSE in humans, FDA and USDA officials said the protection of public health depends on the development of a strategy to control possible routes of TSE expansion in food animals.      FDA's proposed regulation would prohibit the use of nearly all potential sources of ruminant and mink protein in feed intended for ruminants.  The only exceptions would be bovine blood, ruminant-derived milk and gelatin, since FDA has no information suggesting that milk proteins, gelatin or bovine blood proteins are potentially infective for TSEs.      ""This is a precautionary measure -- there have been no reported cases of BSE in this county,"" said Donna E. Shalala, Secretary of Health and Human Services.  ""It will add another level of safeguards to protect the U.S. against the potential risk from these diseases.""      ""If for some reason a case of BSE were to occur in the U.S. -- and it is important to emphasize that not even one case of BSE has ever been found here -- the steps we are taking today would confine it to the individual animal and greatly decrease the potential risk to humans,"" said FDA Commissioner David A. Kessler, M.D.  ""In essence, this proposal would build a protective barrier against the spread of BSE.""      In addition to prohibiting tissues with the potential to spread TSEs, the proposed rule also requires process and control systems to ensure that ruminant feed does not contain the prohibited tissues.      The first case of BSE was reported in the United Kingdom in 1986.  Epidemiological evidence gathered in the U.K. suggests an association between the outbreak of BSE there and the feeding to cattle of protein derived from sheep infected with scrapie, another TSE.      Recently, scientists have postulated an association between BSE and a variant form of Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (v-CJD) reported in the U.K.  Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease is a degenerative neurological disorder that affects humans.      The British government on March 20 announced a possible link between BSE and 10 cases of v-CJD.  Nine days later, U.S. national livestock organizations and professional health groups announced a voluntary moratorium on the use of ruminant protein in feeds of ruminants.  At the same time, FDA committed to expediting regulations addressing issues related to feeding ruminant protein, and on May 14 the FDA published an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking to solicit scientific and economic information and other public comments.      Today's proposed regulation is the product of FDA's evaluation of this information to date.  FDA will continue to evaluate additional data and comments related to this proposal.                             ####    ATTENTION TV BROADCASTERS: Please use open caption for the hearing impaired.

For the past several months, the FDA,    the Environmental Protection Agency, and the Food Safety Inspection Service    of the U.S. Department of Agriculture have been tracing the source of elevated    levels of dioxins first found in chickens grown in the southern U.S. The source    of the dioxin contamination was traced to a mined clay product called ""ball    clay,"" which is occasionally used as an anti-caking agent in soybean meal,    in other feed components, and in complete animal feeds. FDA based its request    to cease using ball clay in all feeds on these dioxin findings.   Ball clay, which is a term that originated from an early English mining practice    of rolling the highly plastic clay into balls weighing 30 to 50 pounds, is not    specifically listed as a Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS) substance or as    an approved food additive, but it has a history of use in animal feeds. It is    listed in the Association of American Feed Control Officials, Inc. Official    Publication as an acceptable anti-caking agent and pelleting aid not to exceed    2.5 percent in finished feeds.   Dioxins are found throughout the environment in very low levels, often originating    as a waste by-product of chlorinated chemical manufacture, bleaching, and combustion.    Due to the chemical properties and environmental persistence of dioxins, humans    and animals accumulate dioxins over time. Continued exposure to elevated dioxin    levels in animal feed increases the risk of adverse health effects in animals    and to humans consuming animal-derived food products.    Since the dioxin levels in the ball clay were significantly elevated, FDA is    recommending that the use of ball clay in animal feeds be discontinued. FDA    intends to initiate the process to determine that ball clay for use in animal    feeds is not GRAS, and that, in the absence of a food additive regulation, its    use in animal feeds is prohibited.   Although the investigating agencies have no data showing that other mined clay    products have similarly elevated levels of dioxins, this possibility cannot    be dismissed. Until more is known about the source and pattern of distribution    of these dioxins, mined clay products of all types should be used with caution    in the production of animal feeds.   The food, feed, and mining industries have cooperated with the Federal agencies    in this investigation. The Federal agencies appreciate their assistance during    the investigation and look forward to their continued cooperation.   A copy of the letter sent to the producers and users of clay products in animal    feeds is available on the FDA/CVM Internet Home Page ( http://www.fda.gov/cvm )    or from the  FDA Veterinarian .        CVM'S DEPUTY DIRECTOR PROMOTED TO REAR ADMIRAL   FDA's Lead Deputy Commissioner, Dr. Michael A. Friedman announced on October    1, 1997, the promotion of Dr. Michael J. Blackwell to the Commissioned Corps    rank of Rear Admiral. This is an impressive honor, not only for Dr. Blackwell,    but for CVM as well, since the rank is currently held by only two other Commissioned    Corps Officers in FDA, including Dr. Friedman, and Dr. Marlene E. Haffner, Director,    Office of Orphan Products Development in the Office of the Commissioner.   Born and raised in Oklahoma, Dr. Blackwell was inspired at an early age by    his father, also a veterinarian. He received his D.V.M. degree from Tuskegee    University, and a Master of Public Health from Loma Linda University, specializing    in epidemiology.   Dr. Blackwell has served over 20 years in the U.S. Public Health Service (PHS),    where he currently serves as the Chief Veterinarian advising the Surgeon General    on issues concerning all veterinarians in the PHS.    Dr. Blackwell has held several positions in FDA, both in the Center for Devices    and Radiological Health and the Center for Veterinary Medicine. He was appointed    Deputy Director of CVM in 1994.   All of us at the Center for Veterinary Medicine salute Rear Admiral Blackwell    on his well-deserved promotion.        1996 ADVERSE DRUG EXPERIENCE SUMMARY   This issue of the  FDA Veterinarian  contains a  pull-out    section of the second half of the 1996 Veterinary Adverse Drug Experience Summary .    The first portion was included in the September/October issue.    This summary includes all domestic adverse drug experience reports submitted    to the Center for Veterinary Medicine (CVM) for calendar year 1996 which the    Center has determined to be at least possibly drug related. It is organized    alphabetically by  generic  drug, and within each drug by species, and    within each species by the general route of administration. The percentages    represent the number of reports containing a sign divided by the total number    of reports. Also, reported signs are truncated at twenty-two characters   The Center's adverse drug reaction review process takes into consideration    confounding factors such as dosage, concomitant drug use, the medical and physical    condition of the animals at the time of treatment, environmental and management    information, product defects, etc. These complex factors, however, cannot be    fully addressed in this summary.  This summary is intended only as a general    reference to the type of reactions that veterinarians, animal owners, and others    have voluntarily reported to FDA or the manufacturer after drug use; therefore,    it is not by itself a basis for:           Determining drug association for a particular sign         Determining the safety and efficacy of a given drug         Determining the frequency of occurrence of an adverse reaction         Comparing one drug with another drug.      Nevertheless, the information in the summary can alert readers to suspected    drug effects being reported by their colleagues and sensitize them to potential    problems. The report may also serve to stimulate readers to share their own    experiences for the benefit of their colleagues and ultimately the improvement    of veterinary products.   Please note that this summary does not include drug ineffectiveness reports.    In addition, it does not include reports of drug product defect reports unless    the report also contains adverse reaction information. Also, the report does    not include adverse experience reports for biologics and topically applied,    externally acting parasiticides. These reports are forwarded to the government    agency that regulates the product in question. Finally, the human reports involve    human exposure to an animal drug.   An abbreviation table and additional information about the summary may be found    on  page I-1 of the September/October issue  of the  FDA Veterinarian .        FDA HOLDS TRAINING CONFERENCE ON BSE AND RUMINANT FEED RULES      by Jon Scheid, Director, Communications Staff, FDA/CVM   More than 100 State and FDA regulators met in Kansas City September 29 and    30, 1997, to review the new rules banning the use of prohibited mammalian proteins    in feeds for cattle and other ruminants. The training conference was arranged    by FDA's Kansas City District Office, and featured speakers from the FDA's Center    for Veterinary Medicine and Kansas City District Office, the Association of    American Feed Control Officials (AAFCO), the USDA's Animal and Plant Health    Inspection Service (USDA/APHIS), and the Canadian Food Inspection Agency.   The rule (published in the June 5, 1997,  Federal Register ) restricts    the use of mammalian protein in feeds for cattle and other ruminant animals.    Processed by-product meat and bone meal is an example of the prohibited material    covered by this new regulation. There are exceptions to the ban. For instance,    pure pork or equine protein feed products are exempt. Also, the ban does not    apply to blood or blood products, inspected meat products that have been prepared    for human consumption, gelatin, and milk or milk products.   The rule requires protein renderers, protein blenders, feed manufacturers and    distributors to label feeds that contain prohibited material with the warning,    ""Do not feed to cattle or other ruminants.""   FDA developed the rule to prevent the establishment and amplification through    feed of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE). The disease, which is always    fatal to cattle, has been found in Europe, but has never been diagnosed in the    U.S. Scientists have determined the disease spread in the United Kingdom (U.K.)    to other cattle through protein feed ingredients manufactured from the carcasses    of infected cattle.   Copies of the final rule on ruminant protein and the ""Guidance for Industry    -- Animal Proteins Prohibited From Animal Feed: Small Entity Compliance Guide""    are available for review or downloading on CVM's Internet Website at  http://www.fda.gov/cvm  and from the  FDA Veterinarian .   At the meeting in Kansas City, Dr. John Honstead, a veterinary medical officer    with CVM's Division of Animal Feeds, explained that BSE is one type of spongiform    encephalopathy disease found among animals. Similar diseases are found among    people, sheep, mink, and even cats.    The BSE epidemic in the U.K. seems to be abating. At its peak in 1992, the    disease was diagnosed in an average of 1,000 animals each week. Now the incidence    has declined to 100 per week, Dr. Honstead said. The decline followed the U.K.'s    ban on feeding protein from ruminants back to ruminants.   Dr. Honstead also pointed out that a similar disease is found in humans, called    Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD). One form of CJD, known as sporadic CJD, has    been found in people for years and has no connection to BSE. However, what now    concerns public health officials is that a different form of CJD, called ""new    variant"" CJD, is being reported, and it is linked to BSE, Dr. Honstead    said. So far, there have been 21 cases of the new variant CJD reported.   Richard Geyer, deputy director of CVM's Office of Surveillance and Compliance,    told the officials gathered in Kansas City that enforcing the BSE rule is one    of CVM's highest priorities.    To help affected industries comply, the new rule places as few requirements    on the feed and the feeding industry as possible.   Gloria Dunnavan, Director of CVM's Office of Compliance, explained that the    main thrust of the rule is that it was designed to keep any feed that contains    -- or may contain -- prohibited material out of feed for ruminants. Ruminants    are four-stomached animals, including cattle and sheep. Unless a renderer or    feed manufacturer is absolutely sure that a feed does not contain any prohibited    material, and can prove that fact to FDA inspectors, the company must attach    the warning statement.   In some cases, the renderer can be sure the feed is free of prohibited material.    For example, if a renderer is connected to a swine slaughter facility and never    takes material from any other source, it is exempt from labeling the meat and    bone meal produced at that plant. The renderer can be sure it is a pure porcine    material. Also, a renderer who has separate facilities for processing prohibited    and non-prohibited material does not have to put a warning label on the ingredients    made from non-prohibited material.   However, if the renderer only occasionally processes prohibited material through    the facility, but takes no steps to clean the processing equipment, the renderer    must label all the feed with the warning, according to Dr. Dan McChesney, Leader    of CVM's Feed Safety Team.   Feed manufacturers also must place the warning on their feed unless they are    sure it does not contain prohibited material. Further, renderers and feed manufacturers    must keep records for a year that show where the ingredients came from and to    whom they were sold. Inspectors will use these records to determine whether    material sent to ruminant producers was not prohibited. Livestock feeders must    not use prohibited material in feeds for ruminants. The feeders also must keep    records for at least a year about the source of the feeds, Ms. Dunnavan said.   Dr. Kevin Varner, USDA/APHIS veterinarian in charge of Kansas, reviewed USDA's    BSE programs in three areas: research, restriction of cattle and cattle product    imports from BSE countries, and surveillance for BSE in US cattle.    AAFCO representatives Herschel Pendell and Roger Hoestenbach addressed the    State perspective on enforcing the regulation. They reviewed an AAFCO letter    to State feed officials about enforcement and a list of affected feed ingredient    definitions from the AAFCO Official Publication. They pointed out that State    inspection data should be shared with FDA unless this is prohibited by State    confidentiality restrictions. Regulatory officials from Washington, Idaho, South    Dakota and Texas briefly reviewed their plans for enforcement of the rules.   Linda Morrison, Associate Director for the Feed Section of the Canadian Food    Inspection Agency reviewed their feed regulation which is very similar to the    U.S. regulation. She pointed out the main differences in the Canadian regulation    are that plate waste is not exempted from the prohibition, that the label reads    ""Do not feed to cattle, sheep, deer or other ruminants,"" and that    records must be kept for 2 years. The Canadian Food Inspection Agency plans    to inspect all renderers and feed mills by March 31, 1998. U.S. exports to Canada    will probably have to be relabeled to comply with the Canadian requirements.   According to W. Michael Rogers, KAN-DO District Director and chairman of the    FDA CVM Field Committee, the BSE Regulatory Training Conference held in Kansas    City ""represents an important first step toward developing a national strategy    to address the potential threat to the public health posed by BSE.""         NRSP-7 HOLDS SEMI-ANNUAL COMMITTEE MEETING      by Meg Oeller, D.V.M.   The Minor Use Animal Drug Program, National Research Support Project #7 (NRSP-7)    committee held its semi-annual meeting on September 12 and 13, 1997, in Rockville,    MD. The spring meeting is hosted each year by one of the four regions, but the    fall meeting is always held in Rockville to provide an opportunity for input    from members of FDA's Center for Veterinary Medicine (CVM).   The NRSP-7 committee is made up of the National Coordinator, 4 Regional Coordinators,    4 regional Administrative Advisors, a liaison from USDA and one from FDA. The    National Coordinator is Dr. Robert Ringer of Michigan State University. The    Regional Coordinators are Dr. Arthur Craigmill (University of California, Davis),    Dr. Alistair Webb (University of Florida), Dr. Robert Holland (Michigan State    University), and Dr. Paul Bowser (Cornell University). The Administrative Advisors    are Dr. William Saylor (University of Delaware), Dr. John Neilson (University    of Florida), Dr. Garth Sasser (University of Idaho), and Dr. Gerald Buening    (University of Missouri, Columbia). The USDA representative is Dr. Larry Miller    (Washington, DC) and the FDA liaison is Dr. Meg Oeller (Rockville, MD).   The purpose of the NRSP-7 Minor Use Animal Drug Program is to address the shortage    of minor use animal drugs by funding and overseeing the efficacy, animal safety,    and human food safety research and environmental assessment required for drug    approval. The scope of the program includes minor species of agricultural importance,    and generally excludes companion animals.   The NRSP-7 program is rewritten and renewed every five years. It is scheduled    to be renewed next year. In preparation for this, the program is being examined    by an independent review team. The three members of this team attended the meeting    to observe and ask questions prior to drafting their report. The review team    is made up of Dr. Harold Hafs (Rutgers University), Dr. Mark Papich (North Carolina    University) and Dr. Marshall Beleau (Abbott Laboratories).   The meeting was also attended by reviewers and managers from FDA/CVM. Dr. Michael    Blackwell, Deputy Director of CVM, provided an update on several major issues    facing CVM in his opening remarks. He discussed the fluoroquinolone situation,    the recent contamination of animal feeds with dioxin, CVM support for the Food    Animal Residue Avoidance Databank (FARAD), and the progress of CVM's effort    to comply with the Animal Drug Availability Act (ADAA) in the area of proposing    solutions to the lack of approved products available for minor species and minor    uses.   The Regional Coordinators reported on the progress of the active projects in    their respective regions. NRSP-7 currently has 28 active projects funded. These    are summarized in the Table below. ADR stands for Animal Drug Request. This    is the numbering system used by NRSP-7 to track projects.                TABLE -- ACTIVE NRSP-7    PROJECTS                 ADR        Drug        Route of Administration               Species               Indication                        18        Chloramine-T        topical        salmonids               bacterial        gill disease                 33/176        Amoxicillin trihydrate               injection        dairy goats        bacterial pneumonia                        43        Oxytetracycline        injection        dairy goats (non lactating)               bacterial pneumonia                        83        Oxytetracycline        injection        sheep        bacterial pneumonia                        87        Amoxicillin trihydrate               injection        sheep        bacterial pneumonia                        107        Ivermectin        injection        rabbits        ear mites                 161        Oxytetracycline        oral (feed)        striped bass        bacterial infections                        171        Ceftiofur        injection        goats        bacterial pneumonia                        178        Spectinomycin        inj/oral soluble powder               ducks        colibacillosis, salmonella                        210        Fenbendazole        oral (feed)        red deer        GI parasites                 216        Fenbendazole        oral (feed)        fallow deer        GI parasites                 222        Ivermectin        pour-on        American bison        GI parasites                 231        Copper sulfate        topical        channel catfish        external protozoa                 235        Lasalocid        oral (feed)        pheasant        coccidiosis                 236        Clopidol        oral (feed)        pheasant        coccidiosis                 252        Tilmicosin phosphate               injection        veal calf        respiratory infections                        257        Oxytetracycline        topical        lobster        gaffkemia                 259        Hydrogen peroxide        topical        various fish        bacterial gill disease                        260        Hydrogen peroxide        topical        Atlantic salmon        sea lice                 270        Amoxicillin        oral (feed)        hybrid striped bass               strep infections                 271        Carp Pituitary        injection        various fish        spawning aid                 273        Nitarsone        oral (feed)        partridge        blackhead                 274        Zoamix        oral (feed)        pheasants        coccidiosis                 276        Fenbendazole        oral (feed)        ostrich        nematodes                 277        Potassium permanganate               topical        catfish        external I. multifilis                        280        Fenbendazole        oral (feed)        pheasants, partridges        & quail        gapeworm, capillaria                        283        Oxytetracycline HCl               topical        walleye        columnaris                 284        MGA/GnRH        feed/injectable        sheep        estrus synchronization                 The regional reports were followed by general discussion of several issues,    including the ""request for comments on minor species"" published in    the  Federal Register . This request was to gather input from industry,    academia, government, private citizens, producer groups, etc. to be used in    the drafting of a CVM report outlining ways to facilitate approvals for products    for minor species. This report was requested by Congress in the ADAA.   There was an announcement of the imminent publication of the draft guidance    document, ""FDA Approval of Animal Drugs for Minor Uses and for Minor Species.""    This document will be made final after the close of a 90-day public comment    period. In fact, the notice of availability was published in the  Federal    Register  on September 29, 1997. A copy is available on CVM's website ( http://www.fda.gov/cvm )    or by contacting the  FDA Veterinarian  at 301-594-1755.   The status of a ""crop grouping"" concept for aquaculture species was    also reported. Dr. Bill Gingerich (LaCrosse, WI), Roz Schnick (National Aquaculture    INAD Coordinator), and researchers at Ohio State University are working on a    project funded by the International Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies    (IAWFA).   Dr. Holland discussed a visit to the USDA/ARS Animal Drug Metabolism Lab at    Fargo, ND. This Federal laboratory has extensive capabilities to perform assays    for drug residues. The potential exists for a mutually-beneficial relationship    to be developed between this lab and the Minor Use Program.   The CVM participants attended only the morning session of the first day's meeting.    The committee continued the meeting on Friday afternoon and met again on Saturday.    Those portions of the meeting were taken up with administrative issues and working    on the draft NRSP-7 Project rewrite to cover the period from October of 1998    to September 2003.   The current draft rewrite includes plans to expand the scope of the project    to include previously excluded ""production uses"". The committee would    like to be able to fund research into the use of products for reproduction,    such as spawning aids. Currently, two such projects are included on the list    of active projects, but those are receiving administrative assistance only.   The committee discussed the importance of publicizing and expanding the program.    Members were encouraged to make presentations to producer groups and at professional    meetings to stress the importance of the program. The need to support approvals    for minor species drug uses extends beyond economic/animal needs to public health    concerns, such as the development of antimicrobial resistance and prevention    of drug residues in human food. The ADAA tasks CVM to find ways to facilitate    approvals for minor species and minor uses. NRSP-7 is well-positioned to assist    with that effort.

Mr. Egbert is a livestock dealer and hauler who owns and operates a family    business known as Big E Livestock in Botkins, Ohio. The U.S. Department of Agriculture's    Food Safety and Inspection Service reported their sample analysis found more    than 50 instances of animals offered for slaughter for human food by Big E Livestock    containing illegal levels of antibiotics and other drugs. Reported residues    included gentamicin as high as 148.0 ppm, neomycin as high as 407.0 ppm, oxytetracycline    as high as 29.59 ppm, streptomycin as high as 17.40 ppm, tetracycline as high    as 146.0 ppm, and sulfamethazine as high as 11.0 ppm.    Part of the plea agreement included Big E Livestock entering into a Consent    Decree of Injunction which includes establishing systems to prevent offering    animals for slaughter containing illegal drug residues in the future. Those    provisions include maintaining information on the source of the animal purchased    by Big E Livestock, determining medication status, and obtaining certification    from suppliers of animals that they are ready for slaughter because any medication    given to the animals has been withdrawn properly or the animals were never medicated.    The Consent Decree was signed by defendants Ronald and Donna Egbert, signed    by the Judge Walter Rice, and filed on August 14, 1997.   This case was a cooperative effort between FDA's Office of Criminal Investigations,    the Cincinnati District Office, the Office of Chief Counsel, and CVM. The maximum    penalty for the felony violation is imprisonment for five years, a fine of $250,000,    and a three-year period of supervised release. The maximum penalty for the misdemeanor    violation is imprisonment for one year, a fine of $100,000, and a one-year period    of supervised release. A sentencing date has not been set.        REGULATORY ACTIVITIES   The following firms/individuals received warning letters for offering animals    for slaughter that contained illegal drug residues:              Hughey Weyandt, Clayburg, PA                Hollandia Farms, Inc., San Marcos, CA                Antonio Martins, Stevinson, CA                Albert Azeveldo Dairy, Turlock, CA                AJB Ranch, Bakersfield, CA                Margaret Lourenco, John Lourenco Dairy, Livingston, CA                Carol Johnson, Westminster, MD                Wilderness Farms, Dry Run, PA                Gary Truckenmiller, Watsontown, PA                Mario Simoes, Sr., Tipton, CA          These violations involved illegal residues of gentamicin, streptomycin, penicillin,    and neomycin in calves; oxytetracycline in a cull dairy cow; sulfadimethoxine    in a cull dairy cow; gentamicin in a cull dairy cow; sulfamethazine in a steer;    streptomycin in a cow; neomycin in a cow, and penicillin in a cow.   Warning letters were sent to the following firms/individuals for violations    from GMPs:              Robert Bosclair, Sr., Vice President, Merck Manufacturing Division, Merck        & Co., Inc., Whitehouse Station, NJ                Zip Feed Mills, Sioux Falls, SD                Hudson Foods, Inc., Rogers, AR          Rocha Dairy, Tracy, CA, received a warning letter for offering a cow for slaughter    that contained illegal residues of neomycin. The dairy has a history of offering    cull dairy cows and/or calves which have been adulterated.

Baker, D.V.M. and William T. Flynn, D.V.M.    On January 22, 1998, the Center for Veterinary Medicine (CVM), announced in    the  Federal Register , the availability for public comment of a draft    Guidance for Industry on ""Professional Flexible Labeling of Antimicrobial    Drugs."" This document is intended to provide specific guidance on the development    of Professional Flexible Labeling (PFL) for therapeutic veterinary prescription    and veterinary feed directive (VFD) antimicrobial drugs.   In the past, CVM has approved veterinary prescription product labels with single    fixed dosages that carry indications against a narrow range of specific diseases    and organisms. As a result of using this approach, the label did not reflect    many current uses for therapeutic agents in veterinary medicine. Specifically,    for antimicrobial products, narrowly approved uses fail to address the fact    that, while some specific bacteria do produce repeatable, recognized disease,    many organisms are either opportunistic or are known to produce a variety of    clinical manifestations.   Such restricted labeling has led to veterinary prescription products that have    limited practical usefulness if administered strictly according to their approved    conditions of use and has served as an impetus to development of the PFL concept.    Workshops on PFL, cosponsored by the Food and Drug Administration/Center for    Veterinary Medicine, the American Academy of Veterinary Pharmacology and Therapeutics,    the Animal Health Institute, and the American Veterinary Medical Association    were held in Rockville, MD in April and December, 1995. A summary of the discussions    and opinions expressed in the April, 1995 workshop were published in the Journal    of the American Veterinary Medical Association (JAVMA), October 1, 1995. Following    the December, 1995 workshop, a task force was assembled to prepare a report    on PFL concepts. The task force report, which included a model drug label, was    published in the JAVMA, July 1, 1996.   The basic concept of PFL is to provide prescription veterinary products that    carry useful prescribing information for the range of clinical situations included    within their approved conditions of use. Implementation of PFL is based on the    recognition that veterinarians, as a function of their medical training, possess    the knowledge, skills, and abilities to interpret diagnostic and prescribing    medical information and to develop these data into appropriate therapeutic regimens.    The document should prove valuable in the process of developing and labeling    prescription veterinary antimicrobial drugs and should render a greater service    to practitioners and their clients by providing for current, accurate information    in product labeling. Ultimately, products labeled as described in the PFL guidance    will be consistent with and better reflect how veterinarians utilize animal    drugs in the course of their professional practice.   Though this document represents FDA's current thinking on the development and    labeling of therapeutic veterinary prescription antimicrobial drugs, it does    not bind the agency or the public. As with any Center guidance, pharmaceutical    companies may decide to follow alternate procedures or practices. In that event,    CVM suggests that they discuss the matter with the agency a priori to prevent    an expenditure of money and effort on activities that may later be determined    to be unacceptable to the FDA. CVM also recognizes that the general concepts    of PFL expressed in the guidance on antimicrobial drugs may not be equally applicable    to other classes of therapeutic prescription products (e.g., antiparasitics,    physiologics). Therefore, it is CVM's intention to develop PFL guidances that    are specific to various classes of drugs.   Copies of the guidance document may be obtained from CVM's Internet Home Page    ( http://www.fda.gov/cvm ) or by contacting    the  FDA Veterinarian . Individuals are encouraged to submit written comments    on the draft guidance to the Dockets Management Branch (HFA-305), Food and Drug    Administration, Room 1-23, 12420 Parklawn Dr., Rockville, MD 20857. Comments    should be identified with the full title of the draft guidance and docket number    98D-0016 and be submitted by April 22, 1998. Comments received on the draft    guidance may be seen at the Dockets Management Branch between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m.,    Monday through Friday. After review of these comments, FDA will finalize the    guidance document with any appropriate changes.           NEW METHOD AVAILABLE FOR DETECTION OF BOVINE MATERIAL IN FEED     by Michael J. Myers, Ph.D.    Bovine spongiform encephalopathy is a member of the transmissible spongiform    encephalopathy (TSE) disease family. Other TSE diseases include Kuru, Creutzfeldt-Jakob    Disease (CJD) which are human diseases, chronic wasting syndrome (elk) and scrapie,    a disease found in sheep. These conditions cause a progressive degeneration    of the central nervous system, which is always fatal.    Bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) was first detected in the United Kingdom    in 1986. As a consequence of epidemiological surveys, an association developed    between the outbreak of BSE and the use of cattle feed containing protein derived    from sheep infected with scrapie. In addition, the practice of feeding cattle    protein derived in part from other cattle infected with BSE served to amplify    this disease and permit further dissemination.   On June 5, 1997, the Food and Drug Administration published the final regulation    prohibiting the use of mammalian protein in the manufacture of animal feeds    destined to be given to ruminant animals, including cattle, sheep, and goats    ( Ref.1). Products believed to pose minimal risk, including blood, blood products,    gelatin, milk and milk products, protein derived solely from swine or equine    sources, and inspected meat products offered for human consumption were exempted    from the ban.   In the course of preparing the final regulation, several existing methods for    detecting the presence of bovine derived proteins were examined, including the    feed microscopic method (Ref. 2) and the ELISA method developed by the British    government (Ref. 3). However, the microscopic method was determined to be very    technically demanding and lacking in sensitivity. Likewise, the ELISA method,    despite being used by the British government for regulatory purposes, was also    determined to be inadequate, principally because of a propensity for false positive    responses. In addition, this method was also found to require a high degree    of technical competence which might not readily transfer to field situations.   Recently, the Center for Veterinary Medicine (CVM) became aware of another    method developed by Dr. Marco Tartaglia at the Instituto Superiore di Sanita    in Rome, Italy. This method is a polymerase chain reaction-based (PCR) method    (Ref. 4) capable of detecting bovine DNA isolated from complete feed. The method    relies on the capacity of the PCR reaction to enzymatically amplify a short    segment of DNA, resulting in a method that allows the detection and amplification    of a bovine-specific mitochondrial sequence from complete feedstuffs.   This method permits the detection of bovine mitochondrial DNA in feed containing    as little as 0.125 percent bovine meat and bone meal. Using the bovine specific    PCR primers, this method will only detect material of bovine origin. It will    not detect materials of either ovine, swine, equine, avian (turkey and chicken),    or lapine origin. The specificity of the PCR reaction is determined by the oligonucleotide    sequence of the two PCR primers used for the polymerase chain reaction. These    two regions show species specificities for all animals examined to date. No    cross reactivity between PCR primers has been observed (Ref. 4). That is, a    set of primers specific for swine will only detect material of swine origin,    bovine-specific primers only detect material of bovine origin, etc. In addition,    the method is relatively rapid, with completion in approximately 24 hours.   Species specificity/identity can also be confirmed using the oligonucleotide    product generated by the PCR reaction. Within the PCR product generated from    DNA of bovine origin are DNA endonuclease restriction sites for two enzymes,    called SspI and DpnII. DNA endonucleases are enzymes that will cleave, or ""cut""    DNA at internal sites. Each endonuclease recognizes a unique set, or arrangement,    of DNA base pairs.    The PCR product generated from bovine DNA is 271 base pairs in length. Endonuclease    cleavage of this product by DpnII produces two fragments 57 and 217 base pairs    in length. SspI produces three fragments 69, 84 and 118 base pairs in length.    This cleavage pattern is unique to the PCR product derived from bovine DNA.    DNA derived from ovine, swine, equine, avian, or lapine origin will not produce    this cleavage pattern.   The procedure solubilizes 0.5 grams of feed in 4.5 mls of extraction buffer    (5M guanidine thiocyanate; 0.05M Tris-Cl, pH 6.4; 0.02M EDTA, pH 8.0, 1.3 percent    Triton X-100) with an overnight incubation at 60 C (about 15-16 hours). The    following morning, the mixture is admixed, incubated for an additional 30 minutes,    then centrifuged at 3000 x g for 10 min. to precipitate the gelatin. The supernatant    is removed; 0.5 ml is used for DNA extraction, the remainder is stored at -20°C.    The solubilized feed is mixed with an equal portion of extraction buffer (0.5    ml) and 0.040 ml of a silica suspension. This mixture is mixed, then allowed    to incubate for 10 minutes at room temperature. During the incubation, the mixture    is frequently admixed to keep the silica in suspension. At the end of the incubation    period, the silica is removed from suspension by centrifugation. The supernatant    is then discarded. The silica is washed two times with wash buffer (extraction    buffer without EDTA or Triton X-100), followed by two washes with 70 percent    ethanol and one final wash with acetone. The washing serves to remove any protein    that precipitated with the silica. The silica pellet is allowed to dry. The    DNA is extracted from the silica using 0.050 ml TE buffer (10 mM Tris-CL, pH    8.0; 0.1 M EDTA, pH 8.0).   The PCR reactions performed using 0.005 ml of the extracted DNA sample. The    reaction conditions use 12.5 pmole of each primer, 50 µM of each dNTP, 1.5 mM    MgCl2, 2.5 units of Taq, and Perkin-Elmer reaction buffer, all in a final volume    of 50 µl. The mixture is subjected to 30 cycles at 94°C for 60 sec, 58°C for    60 sec, and 72°C for 60 sec. Upon completion of the PCR process, 20 µl of the    PCR reaction is subjected to agarose gel electrophoresis using a 2 percent agarose    gel. The results are visualized using ethidium bromide.   This method is currently being evaluated at CVM's Office of Research. Laboratories    at FDA's National Center for Toxicological Research and Office of Regulatory    Affairs are also participating in this effort. Part of this effort will include    a method validation trial to determine the performance characteristics of this    method for feedstuffs typically used in this country. In addition, the laboratories    at the Office of Research and the National Center for Toxicological Research    will be participating in an international method validation trial that is being    coordinated by the Joint Research Institute, Environment Institute, Food and    Drug Analysis at Ispra, Italy. This effort is tentatively planned to begin in    the fall of 1998.   References   1. Substances Prohibited From Use in Animal Food or Feed; Animal Proteins Prohibited    in Ruminant Feed.

These draft documents have been    adapted for veterinary use by the International Cooperation on Harmonisation    of Technical Requirements for Registration of Veterinary Medicinal Products    (VICH). These are the first documents developed under the VICH process. They    are intended to provide guidance on characteristics that should be considered    during the validation of analytical procedures included as part of registration    applications for veterinary medicinal products submitted for approval to the    European Union, Japan, and the United States.   Copies of these documents may be obtained from CVM's Internet Home Page ( http://www.fda.gov/cvm ) or by contacting the     FDA Veterinarian .   In recent years, many important initiatives have been undertaken to promote    the international harmonization of regulatory requirements. FDA has participated    in VICH efforts to enhance harmonization and has expressed its commitment to    seeking scientifically based harmonized technical procedures for the development    of pharmaceutical products. One of the goals of harmonization is to identify    and reduce the differences in technical requirements for drug development among    regulatory agencies. At a meeting held on August 20 and 21, 1997, the VICH Steering    Committee agreed that these draft GFI documents should be made available for    public comment.    The draft ""Validation of Analytical Procedures: Definition and Terminology,""    discusses the characteristics that should be considered during the validation    of analytical procedures. This ""Definition and Terminology"" document    is not intended to cover testing requirements or procedures, rather it is to    serve as a collection of terms and definitions. These common definitions such    as ""analytical procedures,"" ""specificity,"" ""precision,""    ""accuracy,"" etc., are meant to bridge the differences that often exist    among various compendia and requirements of the European Union, Japan, and the    United States.   The draft ""Validation of Analytical Procedures: Methodology,"" discusses    common analytical procedures and provides guidance and recommendations on how    to consider various validation characteristics for each analytical procedure.    It also indicates the data that should be included in an application for registration.   Interested parties are encouraged to submit written comments on the draft guidances    to the Dockets Management Branch (HFA-305), Food and Drug Administration, room    1-23, 12420 Parklawn Dr., Rockville, MD 20857. Comments should be identified    with the full title of the draft guidance and docket number 98D-0017. Comments    should be submitted by March 30, 1998.   Comments received on the draft guidances may be seen at the Dockets Management    Branch between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday. After review of these    comments, FDA will finalize the guidance document with any appropriate changes.

A nucleus    from a diploid, mammalian cell culture derived from an organ other than the    gonads has been substituted for the nucleus of a mammalian egg, the egg implanted    into a surrogate mother and a viable offspring produced. This article will examine    cloning in the context of how it might relate to products regulated by CVM.   News media attention to cloning reached new heights in February 1997 with the    announcement from the Roslin Institute in Scotland that they had successfully    created Dolly, a clone from a somatic cell derived from cultured mammary gland    cells of an adult sheep. Instead of evaluating the impact of this advance upon    animal biotechnology, the media and the public leaped ahead to consider the    bioethical and social implications of cloned humans. The President's National    Bioethics Advisory Commission last June proposed a 5-year moratorium on cloning    directed at creating a human child, but not the cloning of human or other DNA    in cell lines or the cloning of animals.    In an interview with  The Washington Post  published January 20, 1998,    the Acting Commissioner of FDA, Dr. Michael Friedman, stated ""Through the    Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act we do have the authority to regulate human cloning,    and we are prepared to assert that authority."" He added that human cloning    is a form of cellular or genetic therapy that requires prior FDA approval. The    same article goes on to further cite Dr. Friedman as saying that anyone wanting    to attempt human cloning legally must file a formal application with FDA which    would undertake a lengthy review. The FDA would initiate legal action against    anyone failing to file that application.   Cloning of humans has long been recognized as an ethical and social challenge.    Westerners have been conditioned by books like  Brave New World  and movies    like  Boys from Brazil  to reject human cloning. Our society will probably    still be debating the permissibility of cloning humans long after cloning becomes    technically and economically feasible.   On the other hand, clones of plants have long been prominent members of agriculture    and horticulture. Genetic uniformity is an important agricultural plant trait    that, among other things, facilitates efficient machine harvesting of crops    and helps standardize product quality. For example, each apple tree of a single    variety is genetically identical to every other individual of the same variety    apples and many other fruits are cloned through vegetative propagation, i.e.,    stem cuttings, because they do not ""breed true"". In other words, the    reshuffling of genes that occurs during sexual reproduction of apples results    in apple offspring that are too dissimilar from the parents to be reliable for    propagation of apples for commercial production. However, there is no movement    afoot to ban the cloning of apples or to consider the bioethical dilemmas posed    by cloned apples on the fabric of human society. Cloned plants are accepted    as a normal part of human society.   Aside from Dolly the sheep, clones of domesticated animals are rare compared    to clones of plants in our everyday environment. One might well argue that this    is only because clones of animals are more difficult to establish than plants.    The goals of many selective breeding programs, many of which feature repetitive    back-crossing and inbreeding, include establishing a population of animals,    e.g., dogs, horses, cattle, fish, etc., that possesses desirable traits that    ""breed true."" Selective breeding reduces genetic diversity in ""breeds    of domesticated animals. The extreme case of this selective breeding can be    found in the many strains of laboratory rats and mice used for product testing.    These strains are so genetically homogeneous that there is no tissue rejection    when tissue from one mouse is transplanted to another of the same strain. They    are practically genetically identical. This uniformity is important for animal    testing because statistically powerful testing may be conducted with small numbers    of test individuals. There is less statistical ""noise"" caused by individual    variation. Since the results are similar, cloning of animals could be looked    upon as an alternative to selective breeding, especially useful where selective    breeding is not practical.   So, is Dolly the logical extension of sheep selective breeding, possessing    all the desirable traits sought by sheep breeders of the past? Well, no. Dolly    is proof that the process of cloning apparently can work in sheep. Why were    sheep selected to clone? Economics. Sheep have shorter generation times than    cattle and they still produce milk in reasonable quantities. Why the interest    in milk? The mammary gland is a marvelous protein synthesis and secreting organ    whose products cannot always be duplicated by bacterial fermentation or chemical    synthesis. Domesticated strains of transgenic sheep or cattle might be used    to secrete bioactive proteins in milk that can be used as drugs, biologics and    animal drugs.   Transgenic animals are genetically modified to contain a grouping of inserted    genes (transgenes) from practically any species or combination of species. One    application of transgenic animals is for the expression of proteins or enzymes    that are not normally present or for the expression of higher concentrations    of proteins that are normally present. Expression may be throughout the animal    or directed to a specific organ, for example, the mammary gland. Transgenic    animals have already been created through various genetic modification techniques    that secrete proteins of great value in their milk, e.g., drugs that can be    extracted and purified. The only trouble has been that, like the apple, most    transgenic animals do not breed true. A major application for the technique    of cloning will be in reproducing, in one generation, copies of transgenic animals    that yield a high value product.    January 20, 1998, also brought a report from the University of Massachusetts    that transgenic Holstein calves had been cloned and born in Texas as part of    a project sponsored by Advanced Cell Technology, Inc., and Genzyme Transgenics    Corporation. The stated goal of the project is producing recombinant human albumin    in cows milk. (This can be purified for use as a human blood product.) Like    Dolly, these calves are clones and test models, rather than production animals.    Unlike Dolly, the calves are genetically modified. They contain only a marker    gene, however, instead of a human albumin gene. Then, too, they are a male clone.    Dairy cattle are also capable of more efficient milk production than sheep,    so the experiment is an advance toward commercial production in this respect,    too.   Cloning of somatic cells in animals is more a tool to reproduce valuable animals,    like transgenic animals that produce drugs or biologics, or endangered species,    or the best results of selective breeding programs, like the dairy herd improvement    plan. The societal benefit to cost ratio for cloning of animals is decidedly    different from the ratio for cloning humans, and the use of cloning in animals    deserves to be considered separately.   Will the successful somatic cell cloning of mammals open the product floodgates    from animal biotechnology companies? Like almost everything in the field of    biotechnology, this is hard to predict. For the time being, the answer is ""probably    not."" Cloning will probably always be an expensive way to reproduce mammals    compared to sexual reproduction and so will be limited to extremely valuable    animals producing high value products.    Does CVM plan to regulate cloning of animals under the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic    Act? The answer is probably yes and no. CVM regulates products. Cloning is a    process. In the sense that cloning is a means to ""manufacture"" more    transgenic animals and if those transgenic animals are producing an animal drug,    then CVM could be involved in examining cloning carried out as part of the production    process for the animal drug. CVM also regulates the drugs used on animals as    part of the cloning process, for example, drugs for super-ovulation and estrus    regulation. Other FDA Centers could similarly be indirectly regulating the cloning    process as it is applied to transgenic animals producing a human drug or biologic.   Still under consideration is whether CVM should play a role in determining    the safety of food derived from cloned animals that are not genetically modified,    for example, clones of a high-producing dairy cow. Does the process of cloning    have the potential to introduce changes in the quality of milk or meat derived    from clones of normal dairy cows? While clones of food-producing animals are    now starting to be developed, there are not yet enough of them to answer this    question with hard data. Strictly on a theoretical basis, clones of normal animals    should be indistinguishable from their parent in nearly all respects and, therefore,    present no food safety concern.   John Matheson works in the Office of Surveillance and Compliance where,    among other duties, he follows biotechnology developments for CVM.   BSE -- PREVENTION IS EVERYONE'S RESPONSIBILITY   Preventing Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE) should be a high priority    for anyone who has a role to play in food safety or animal health, whether it    is the renderer of slaughtered animals, livestock producer, feed manufacturer,    or any person in between. One way to help ensure that BSE does not occur in    the U.S. is to make everyone acutely aware of their individual responsibility    in protecting the public health. It is an educational initiative which must    involve all levels of FDA's internal and external customers.   BSE has had a devastating effect on the cattle and rendering industries in    the United Kingdom where it was first diagnosed in 1986. BSE poses a serious    risk to human health, as well as animal health, since recent evidence has shown    a strong link between BSE and the occurrence of new variant Creutzfeldt-Jacob    Disease. On August 4, 1997, the regulation published under 21 CFR 589.2000 became    effective. This regulation is designed to prevent the establishment and amplification    of undetected BSE, often referred to as ""Mad Cow Disease,"" through    animal feed by prohibiting the use of certain proteins derived from mammalian    tissue in feeding ruminant animals.   FDA is expecting 100 percent compliance with this new regulation, which affects    renderers, protein blenders, feed manufacturers including FDA-licensed manufacturers,    all other commercial feed manufacturers, distributors including retailers, on-farm    feed mixers, and ruminant feeders. On January 29, 1998, CVM issued a nationwide    assignment to all FDA field offices to implement our enforcement approach of    education, a strong inspectional presence, and taking selected enforcement actions    for repeated and/or egregious violations. State governments will cooperate in    this effort, and in many cases, have already undertaken educational initiatives    related to this regulation.   The assignment includes: 1) inspecting firms in each affected segment of the    industry, and 2) tracing shipments forward and backward in the chain from renderer    to producer, to verify that prohibited material is properly labeled and used.    FDA expects that as close to 100 percent of the affected parties as possible    will be inspected in the next two years. These inspections will provide an opportunity    to educate the affected industries, measure the extent of compliance, and identify    areas that may need additional educational focus.          FOX FACTS     by Tania Woerner, V.M.D.    Foxes are one of the most widespread species, covering six of the seven continents    and many different countries and climate zones. Foxes did live in North America    before the European Discovery in 1491; however, it was the importation by the    British of foxes (mainly for hunting and fur trapping) that established the    population of foxes in North America and Australia. The fox prefers gently rolling    farmland with sparsely wooded areas and running streams, but the fox is remarkably    adaptable and manages to survive and prosper in urban and suburban areas, living    in culverts, basements and garden sheds and eating human refuse.    The beautiful russet-coated red fox is a full member of the dog (Canidae) family;    however, because of the way it stalks and pounces on its prey, many people think    of foxes as more cat-like. Foxes will bury their food much like a dog and return    for it later when food supplies are limited. Like humans, foxes are omnivorous    and feed on fruit, berries, birds, mice, voles, insects and other invertebrates,    especially earthworms! A study conducted on urban foxes living around London    found that foxes had even consumed the discarded remains of various ethnic human    foods!   The average life span of a fox is about 3 years with a maximum known lifespan    of 12 years. Predators of foxes are coyotes, cougars, wolves and wild dogs;    however, the most vicious predator is man. In the past foxes were considered    vermin and killed for sport and fur. Now humans threaten foxes in a more indirect    fashion by over-development. Man's destruction of the foxes' natural habitat    has forced foxes to move into more urban areas, where the threat of traffic    is greater, and residents often call upon the animal control authorities to    eliminate them.   Courtship for foxes begins in mid to late December. When courtship begins,    foxes will often be seen traveling in pairs or sometimes groups of three. Mating    usually takes place in January or February; however, it can extend into April    if the food supply is adequate. Since the gestation period is 52 days, fox kits    are typically born in March through April. A typical red fox family consists    of the dog fox and a vixen, plus up to four ""helper"" females which    may or may not breed and are subordinate to the breeding vixen. Often these    younger foxes are the vixen's daughters. Each family of foxes needs several    safe den sites in which to raise their cubs in addition to safe resting spots    outside the den. The family domain is established by the dog fox by marking    his territory. The scent of the dog fox alerts other foxes to stay clear of    this territory. It is common for a family to have several dens within their    territory. Prior to parturition, the mated pair selects a den, called the natal    den, in which to bear the kits. This den is usually larger than the other available    dens and always has several exits.   Fox litters can be as small as one kit, or as large as thirteen, but the average    is five. If a mother and an older daughter produce a litter at the same time,    the daughter will often surrender her kits to her mother, and all the kits are    raised together as a litter, with the older daughter assisting in rearing the    kits.   Kits are born blind, with short grey fur. Within ten days, their eyes are open,    and by three weeks they are playing outside the den. It is not uncommon for    urban and rural foxes to move their kits to alternate den sites several times    while the kits are maturing. Fox kits are playful and affectionate, and by five    weeks of age they begin to explore outside of the den. By two months of age    the fox kits are less dependent on their parents and begin to hunt on their    own. Typically, October is the month when they begin to leave the den to find    a domain of their own. Interestingly, not all fox kits leave in their first    year; females are more likely to ""stick around,"" sometimes until they    are about two years old. Population density and food supply determine the timing    of the dispersal of fox kits. When the population is dense and the food supply    is scarce, they will strike out on their own at an earlier age and travel greater    distances.   Once the kits have dispersed, the adults and remaining kits hunt on the same    territory, but hunt and travel alone. The male and female foxes do not associate    regularly until courtship begins again in December.        FDA PUBLISHES GUIDANCE ON INDUSTRY-SUPPORTED ACTIVITIES   In the December 3, 1997,  Federal Register , FDA announced the publication    of ""Final Guidance on Industry-Supported Scientific and Educational Activities.""    This guidance document was prepared by FDA's Intra-Agency Working Group on Advertising    and Promotion.   FDA is providing this guidance to describe the Agency's enforcement policy    with regard to scientific and educational activities supported by industry.    The guidance seeks to clarify the distinction the Agency draws between scientific    and educational activities that FDA considers nonpromotional and those that    the Agency considers promotional, and to provide guidance on how industry may    support such activities without being subject to the labeling and advertising    provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act). This jurisdictional    line is important because the constraints on advertising and labeling, when    applied to scientific and educational activities, can restrict the freedom of    participants to discuss their data or express their views in promoting the use    of a drug. In particular, promotional discussions of unapproved uses, which    can be an important component of scientific and educational activities, are    not permissible in programs that are or can be subject to substantive influence    by companies that market products related to the discussion. The Agency recognizes    that industry-supported activities can be both nonpromotional and educational.   FDA does not intend to regulate, under the labeling and advertising provisions    of the Act, industry-supported scientific and educational activities that are    independent of the influence of the supporting company. Companies and providers    who wish to ensure that their activities will not be subject to regulation should    design and carry out their activities free from the supporting company's influence    and bias, based on factors FDA considers in evaluating activities and determining    independence. These factors are listed in the guidance document.    Copies of ""Final Guidance on Industry-Supported Scientific and Educational    Activities"" (CVM number 65) may be obtained from the on-line library at    CVM's Internet Home Page ( http://www.fda.gov/cvm )    or by calling the  FDA Veterinarian  at 301-594-1755.   Comments on this document may be submitted at any time to the Dockets Management    Branch (HFA-305), Food and Drug Administration, 12420 Parklawn Drive, Room 1-23,    Rockville, MD 20857. Questions regarding this guidance in regard to prescription    animal drugs may be directed to Dr. Edward L. Spenser, FDA/Center for Veterinary    Medicine, HFV-216, 7500 Standish Place, Rockville, MD 20855, 301-594-1722.        PERSONNEL CHANGE IN CVM'S ONADE   In January 1998, the Center for Veterinary Medicine announced that Dr. Robert    Livingston, who has been Director of the Office of New Animal Drug Evaluation    (ONADE), changed positions within the Center to focus his efforts on preparing    for upcoming Codex Alimentarius Commission (Codex) meetings, and to work with    Dr. Sharon Thompson, CVM Special Assistant for International Affairs, on international    drug harmonization issues.   Dr. Andrew Beaulieu, ONADE Deputy Director for Therapeutic and Production Drug    Review, was named acting ONADE Director for 90 days starting on January 4, 1998.    Following that period, Dr. Margaret Miller, ONADE Deputy Director for Human    Food Safety and Consultative Services, will be acting Director for 90 days.    CVM has begun nationwide recruitment to permanently fill the vacancy.   According to CVM Director Dr. Stephen Sundlof, ""There is a considerable    amount of work to be done in the area of international veterinary drug harmonization,    and I am pleased that Dr. Livingston has accepted the assignment."" Dr.    Livingston is ideally suited both professionally and through his experience    to contribute to CVM's international effort, Dr. Sundlof added.   In a July 7, 1997  Federal Register  notice, the Food and Drug Administration    said it is studying the possibility of amending its regulations so the U.S.    could consider standards established by the Codex for food safety and veterinary    drug residues. Codex is an international body that establishes food safety standards    under the joint auspices of the United Nations' World Health Organization and    Food and Agriculture Organization.   Dr. Livingston's expertise also will help in supporting the U.S. science-based    system of food safety rules at a Codex meeting in May. The Codex Committee on    General Principles will meet in Paris to define the ""other legitimate factors""    that could be used as a basis for establishing Codex standards. Codex currently    uses scientific data in setting standards pertaining to public health. The U.S.    is concerned that, if non-science factors are introduced into the standard-setting    process, it would have an undermining effect on the Codex system and could lead    to an increase in non-tariff trade barriers. Dr. Livingston will serve a critical    role in helping to prepare the U.S. Codex delegation for the General Principles    meeting.   Also, under the Animal Drug Availability Act, passed in 1996, Congress ordered    FDA to consider data from foreign governments or international bodies in establishing    tolerance levels for veterinary drugs in imported food. The Act directs FDA    to consider, in establishing such tolerances, data submitted to the appropriate    regulatory authority of any country where the new animal drug is lawfully used    or data available from a relevant international organization.   As ONADE director, Dr. Livingston developed a reputation for leading a highly    productive and professional organization. As evidence of this, in 1997 ONADE    approved a record large number of animal drug applications.   ""Dr. Livingston is perhaps the most ardent supporter of my belief that    the animal drug approval process is the most powerful regulatory tool we have    for assuring the safety of the food supply. Under his leadership, ONADE has    become a focused, efficient, entrepreneurial, service-oriented organization,    which has earned the respect of FDA, the animal health industry, and the Congress,""    Dr. Sundlof said.        CVM TO COSPONSOR FOOD SAFETY SYMPOSIUM AT AVMA CONVENTION   The Center for Veterinary Medicine will cosponsor a one-day Food Safety Symposium    entitled ""Post-Harvest: Foodborne Disease Issues."" The Symposium will    be presented in conjunction with the annual meeting of the American Veterinary    Medical Association (AVMA) to be held July 25-29, 1998, in Baltimore, Maryland.    This symposium will offer a comprehensive review and analysis of emerging foodborne    issues, i.e., residues, resistance, and foodborne pathogens. Leaders from Public    Health organizations, regulatory agencies, and medical practitioners will speak,    and moderators will direct panel discussions focusing on criteria for prevention    and resolution of these foodborne issues. Other sponsors include AVMA, American    Association of Food Hygiene Veterinarians, and the American College of Veterinary    Preventive Medicine. The symposium will be held on July 25, and a full agenda    will appear in the next issue of the  FDA Veterinarian .        CELEBRATING NATIONAL PET WEEK   National Pet Week, which will be celebrated May 3-9, 1998, is cosponsored by    the Auxiliary to the American Veterinary Medical Association (AVMA), the AVMA,    the American Animal Health Association, and the North American Veterinary Technician    Association. This year's theme is ""People and Animals Need Each Other,""    which emphasizes the human-animal bond, as well as the importance of veterinary    health care professionals. This is the ideal time to stress the contribution    that pets make in our lives.   Promotional materials are available from the Auxiliary to the AVMA. For more    information concerning materials and resources, you may access the AVMA's Internet    Web site at  www.avma.org . The AAHA Web site    is  www.healthypet.com .    The  FDA Veterinarian  is proud to support the National Pet Week campaign    and its goals. The Center for Veterinary Medicine is committed to working together    with our customers, i.e., consumers, veterinarians, the animal health industry,    and other Government agencies, to protect the health of humans and animals.          TRANSITIONAL MEDICATED FEED MILL LICENSES WILL EXPIRE SOON   CVM officials have sent out more than 400 letters to feed manufacturers reminding    them that after April 9, 1998, they can no longer manufacture and distribute    any feed that contains drugs requiring an approved Medicated Feed Mill License    unless they have obtained an approved permanent medicated feed mill license.     The Animal Drug Availability Act (ADAA) of 1996 eliminated the need for feed    manufacturers to have multiple Medicated Feed Applications (MFAs) by allowing    them instead to obtain a single license for their facility. The intent of this    change was to reduce the paperwork imposed on manufacturers of medicated feed    and FDA, while maintaining sufficient safeguards for the manufacture of medicated    feed. When ADAA was enacted (October 9, 1996), holders of MFAs were granted    transitional licenses. These transitional licenses will expire on  April 9,    1998.     Transitional license holders who wish to continue as licensed firms must submit    and obtain approval of a permanent Medicated Feed License Application (Form    FDA 3448) no later than April 9, 1998. More than one-fourth of the firms that    previously held MFAs have not yet requested a permanent license.   Firms may obtain a copy of Form FDA 3448 from CVM's Home Page on the Internet    ( http://www.fda.gov/cvm ) or by calling or writing    CVM's Division of Animal Feeds, Medicated Feeds Team, 7500 Standish Place, Rockville,    MD 20855, 301-594-1731. Please note: Annual Drug Establishment/Registration    (FDA Form 2656/2656e) is still required.        ANNUAL MID-ATLANTIC CONFERENCE FOR BOVINE PRACTITIONERS   The Maryland Veterinary Medical Association (MVMA) announces the following    continuing education course for veterinarians: Annual Mid-Atlantic Conference    for Bovine Practitioners, March 26-27, 1998, at the Holiday Inn, Frederick,    Maryland. The two-day seminar will include lectures from nationally recognized    experts, interactive case studies, practice tips, a good and welfare session    and opportunities for fellowship. Meals are included in the registration. Topics    include Laminitis and Nutrition, Investigating Herd Lameness in a Dairy Herd,    Pasture Management and Lameness, Calf Diarrheas: Causes and Treatments,  Neospora    Caninum -Like Species Infection in Dairy Cattle, Johnes Disease, Practical    Procedures for Control, Etiology of Foot Disease, Treatment, Control and Surgical    Procedures, Epidemiology of Foot Problems and Lameness, and Management of Upper    Leg Lameness. Pre-Registration deadline is March 20, 1998, however, registration    will be accepted at the door for one or both days. Cost (including meals) is    $140 for both days, or $80 for one day. Veterinary students or technicians may    attend at half price. Spouses are admitted free, but must pay for meals. The    course is cosponsored by the Maryland Veterinary Medical Association, the Maryland    Department of Agriculture, the American Association of Bovine Practitioners,    District II, the Western Maryland Veterinary Medical Association, the Pennsylvania    State University, and the Virginia-Maryland Regional College of Veterinary Medicine.

Copies of this analysis    may be obtained from CVM's Internet Home Page ( http://www.fda.gov/cvm )    or by contacting the  FDA Veterinarian .   In the May 22, 1997  Federal Register , FDA published a prohibition against    the extralabel use in food-producing animals of fluoroquinolone and glycopeptide    antibiotics. Enrofloxacin and vancomycin are examples of antibiotics in each    of these classes. The prohibition is based on a finding by the FDA that the    extralabel use of these antibiotics in food-producing animals presents a risk    to the public health. These extralabel uses are capable of increasing the antibiotic    resistance of the bacteria that can cause human illness and that are present    in treated animals at the time of slaughter.   The Animal Medicinal Drug Use Clarification Act (AMDUCA) authorizes the issuance    of an order of prohibition. The AMDUCA of 1994 amended the Federal Food, Drug,    and Cosmetic Act to allow licensed veterinarians to prescribe extralabel uses    of approved animal drugs and human drugs in animals. The implementing regulations    for AMDUCA were published in the  Federal Register  on November 7, 1996,    and codified in the  Code of Federal Regulations  (CFR) in Title 21, Part    530. The AMDUCA regulations provide an opportunity for public comment, and that    the order of prohibition becomes effective 90 days after the date of publication,    unless FDA revokes or modifies the order, or extends the period of public comment.     FDA did not revoke or modify the order, or extend the period for public comment.    Accordingly, the prohibition on the extralabel use in food-producing animals    of fluoroquinolone and glycopeptide antibiotics became effective on August 20,    1997.   FDA received 15 comments relating to this action. These comments and the analysis    are available for review in the Public Reading Room of the Dockets Management    Branch (HFA-305), Room 1-23, 12420 Parklawn Drive, Rockville, MD 20857, between    9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday. Questions about the order of prohibition    and the analysis of comments may be directed to Richard L. Arkin, Center for    Veterinary Medicine (HFV-6), Food and Drug Administration, 7500 Standish Place,    Rockville, MD 20855, 301-827-0141.        VETERINARY FEED DIRECTIVE DRUGS   The category of Veterinary Feed Directive (VFD) drugs was authorized under    the Animal Drug Availability Act of 1996. VFD drugs offer an alternative to    prescription status, allowing veterinarian supervision of these types of drugs    while enabling the feed industry to maintain current channels of commercial    feed distribution. The determination of whether a product for use in feed will    be approved as a VFD drug or as an over-the-counter (OTC) drug is made by the    FDA's Center for Veterinary Medicine (CVM). CVM policy is that all new antimicrobials    for therapeutic use in feed will be approved only as VFD drugs.    Before a VFD drug may be used, the veterinarian, working in conformance with    the veterinarian-client-patient relationship, examines and diagnoses disease    conditions and determines whether the condition warrants administration of a    VFD drug. If so, the veterinarian issues a signed Veterinary Feed Directive.    These are available on a preprinted multi-part form. The veterinarian then provides    the form to the producer who orders the VFD feed from a feed supplier. A lawful    VFD form is required to distribute VFD feeds to a producer. The veterinarian    who issues a VFD, the producer, and the person or company supplying the VFD    feed must retain copies of the signed VFD form.    Feed manufacturers and distributors that ship a VFD feed to a retailer or distributor    for inventory must receive and retain a copy of a written acknowledgment, stating    that the VFD feed will be further distributed only in accordance with FDA requirements.    In addition,VFD drugs and any article or feed manufactured from them must include    the following cautionary statements:  ""Caution: Federal law limits this    drug to use under the professional supervision of a licensed veterinarian. Animal    feed bearing or containing this veterinary feed directive drug shall be fed    to animals only by or upon a lawful veterinary feed directive issued by a licensed    veterinarian in the course of the veterinarian=s professional practice.""       It is important to keep in mind that VFDs are only for  approved  animal    drugs. In addition, the Animal Medicinal Drug Use Clarification Act of 1994    (AMDUCA),  prohibits the extralabel use of approved animal drugs in feed .    This prohibition applies to VFD drugs as well as OTC drugs.        WE WANT YOU -- TO REPORT ADVERSE DRUG REACTIONS   The following is a list of questions and answers related to the importance    of reporting adverse drug reactions to the Center for Veterinary Medicine.   What is an ADE?   In common terms, an adverse drug experience (ADE) is either an undesired side    effect, or the lack of a desired effect. The Center for Veterinary Medicine    (CVM) defines an ADE as ""any side effect, injury, toxicity, or sensitivity    reaction (or failure to perform as expected) associated with use of an animal    drug,  whether or not determined to be attributable to the drug .""   What are the FDA Center for Veterinary Medicine's specific areas of interest?   The primary purpose of our ADE monitoring system is to detect problems, or    ""side effects"" associated with the use of FDA approved animal drugs.    During the research studies that lead to drug approval, only a limited number    of animals are treated. Because of this, effects or problems that only occur    rarely may not be discovered until after the drug has been more widely marketed    and used in a clinical setting.   Lack of effectiveness is an adverse experience. The majority of reports of    this nature involve anesthetics, tranquilizers, and anthelmintics. These reports    can be difficult to evaluate, but a group of similar reports will prompt further    investigation.   CVM gives careful consideration to any reports of adverse experiences occurring    in humans as a direct result of using or administering an animal drug or in    other situations involving accidental human exposure.   Does CVM review reports that involve extra-label use of animal drugs?   The reporting of ADEs associated with extra-label use is important to the veterinary    profession. Under the Animal Medicinal Drug Use Clarification Act of 1994 (AMDUCA),    veterinarians can administer drugs more freely in an extra-label manner. About    one-third of the reports on file involve extra-label use. We are also interested    in ADEs involving human drugs used in veterinary practice, and in ADEs involving    animal drugs marketed without FDA approval.   Who monitors reports of ADEs for products used to treat animals?   The FDA Center for Veterinary Medicine monitors reports of ADEs for animal    drug products, medicated feeds, and animal devices under the Federal Food, Drug,    and Cosmetic Act.   Animal vaccines and most biologics (e.g., rabies vaccines) are regulated by    the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) under the Federal Virus,    Serum and Toxin Act.   Most of the products used topically for the control of ectoparasites and insects    on animals are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) under    the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act.   The United States Pharmacopeia (USP) operates an independent, non-government    reporting program called the Veterinary Practitioner's Reporting Program. USP    will forward reports of ADEs to the appropriate regulatory agency and the drug    company, at the discretion of the person reporting. This program has the support    and endorsement of the American Veterinary Medical Association. The USP program    is not affiliated with FDA.   Are there any laws that require reporting of ADEs?   Reporting by veterinary medical professionals is entirely voluntary. However,    Federal regulations require that drug companies send FDA all information concerning    adverse drug experiences reported to, or coming to the attention of, the company.    Products regulated by USDA and EPA do not have the same reporting requirements    as animal drugs.   Who submits these reports?   Roughly ninety-five percent of the reports are submitted by drug companies    after learning of the adverse experience from a veterinarian or animal owner.    The other five percent of reports are submitted directly to CVM by veterinarians    and animal owners.   How many reports does CVM receive each year?   Veterinarians at CVM evaluate about two thousand reports annually. This estimate    includes reports of product defects.   If I decide to report an ADE, who should I contact?   You should first call the drug company. Inform them that you wish to report    an ADE, and ask to speak to a technical services veterinarian. The technical    services veterinarian should ask a series of questions about the experience,    complete a form called the FDA 1932, and forward the report to CVM. We suggest    the drug company as your first point of contact because many companies will    also offer clinical advice or diagnostic assistance. CVM does not provide these    services. Drug company phone numbers can be obtained from the publications  Compendium    of Veterinary Products  (North American Compendiums Inc.) and  Veterinary    Pharmaceuticals and Biologics  (Veterinary Medicine Publishing Company).   If you wish to confirm that your report was forwarded, or prefer not to call    the drug company, you can contact CVM directly at (301) 827-6643 or toll-free    at (888) FDA-VETS. Please ask to speak to one of the veterinarians responsible    for the ADE monitoring program. We can also provide a supply of prepaid mailers    (Form FDA 1932a). These mailers are available by writing or telephoning CVM    and are also distributed at veterinary medicine meetings and seminars.   If the ADE involves a product other than a drug, the following numbers may    be useful. The phone number to reach USDA regarding biologics is (800) 752-6255.    The phone number to reach EPA regarding topical insecticides is (800) 858-7378.    A third option for reporting is the Veterinary Practitioners' Reporting Network    (USP PRN) sponsored by the United States Pharmacopeia. The USP PRN program is    an independent, non-government reporting program. The phone number to reach    USP regarding any veterinary product is (800) 4-USPPRN.   What happens after I report an ADE?   Each ADE report is evaluated by a veterinarian and entered in a computer database.    The reviewer assigns codes to items that describe the drug(s) and animal(s)    involved. These items become separate fields of information. The reviewer also    enters a brief clinical description of the ADE, and makes an assessment of whether    the event is judged to be drug-related using an algorithm scoring system.   CVM publishes an annual summary of ADE reports. The summary provides the number    of reports and the clinical signs associated with each drug in the database.    The information is limited to those reports that were assessed as at least ""possibly    drug-related."" The publication is available from the FDA Center for Veterinary    Medicine.   Other information and reports from the database can be requested on an individual    basis by filing a written Freedom of Information (FOI) request. For more information    about filing a request, contact the CVM Communications Staff at (301) 594-1755.   What actions result from reports of ADEs?   A group of similar reports submitted in a short period of time may alert CVM    and the drug company to a problem with a particular lot of drug. This may result    in a product recall of the affected lot.   Another outcome would be for a label change to include new information gleaned    from reported ADEs. The changes may include new warnings, contraindications    or human safety information. In very rare instances, a drug may be removed from    the market due to problems discovered by ADE reporting.      At times, CVM may require the involved drug company to issue a ""Dear Doctor""    letter to veterinarians informing them of the type of actions that had resulted    from ADE reports.   Why should veterinarians in practice care about reporting an ADE?   Veterinarians in practice depend on the information available in drug labeling    to make informed choices about the risk and benefits associated with the use    of a drug. The purpose of ADE monitoring is to ensure that animal drug labeling    is adequate and accurate.   In spite of the highest standards for safety and effectiveness that exist for    FDA approval, not everything is known about a drug when it is first marketed.    Due to the limited size and controlled nature of premarketing clinical trials,    only the most common adverse events will be observed and included in product    labeling at the time of FDA approval. An accurate safety profile emerges only    after a product is marketed and the number and spectrum of animals receiving    the drug increases.   As a practicing veterinarian, you are in a unique position to observe adverse    clinical outcomes associated with the use of drug products. Some of these problems    may only be associated with extra-label drug use. You can assist in the development    of a complete safety profile by reporting adverse experiences. Such reports    are often the first signal that a problem exists. By participating in the reporting    program and contributing to our knowledge of animal drugs, you provide a valuable    service to animals, the public, and your colleagues in the veterinary profession.   Where can I obtain information for a specific drug concerning potential    adverse reactions?   The drug manufacturer is usually the best source for this type of information.    Other sources include the FDA Center for Veterinary Medicine, the FDA/CVM Internet    World Wide Web server (http://www.cvm.fda.gov/), the National Animal Poison    Control Center and veterinary computer networks, such as VIN (America Online)    and NOAH (Compuserve).        HONEY BEES -- MORE THAN JUST HONEY   This information was presented in a seminar at CVM's Animal Research    Center by Ann Harman, a certified Master Bee Keeper. Mrs. Harman is retired    from the National Bureau of Standards, and currently participates as a volunteer    in the Overseas Cooperative Assistance Program to access the possibility of    expanding apiculture in foreign countries as a viable agricultural market.   Honey is a natural, pure food product that is produced by bees in the United    States as well as other countries around the world. Honey bees are extremely    intelligent and productive little insects which thrive in colonies of 20,000    to 60,000 bees. The chemistry of the honey bee colony uniquely controls the    number and activities of the individuals. Beekeepers maintain colonies in wooden    hives which can be transported to field sites for the pollination of food crops    and the collection of honey. The primary use of the honey bee is actually for    pollination of crops rather than the production of honey. One-third of our food    supply is dependent, either directly or indirectly, on the honey bee. Almost    no wild bees are left at this time, and growers are having difficulty finding    enough beekeeper-managed colonies for pollination.   The products of the hive fall into two groups: plant products, which are substances    produced by plants and simply collected by the bees with little or no change    in composition, and products of the bee. The plant products are honey, pollen,    and propolis. The products of the bee are beeswax, royal jelly and venom. Honey    is the bees' carbohydrate food; pollen provides protein, vitamins and minerals    in the bees' diet; propolis is plant resins gathered by the bee for caulking    and waterproofing. Beeswax is turned into honeycomb for the storage of food    and cells for raising bees; royal jelly is the food for the developing larvae    and for the queen; venom makes an effective defense of the colony for its food    and young. The number of chemical compounds contained in these products is very    large and quite varied.   To produce honey, the bees visit flowers to obtain nectar, a dilute sugar (sucrose)    solution. During transport to the hive the bees add an enzyme, invertase, to    convert the sugar to the simple sugars of glucose and fructose. The bees then    simply evaporate water from the nectar and when the concentration reaches about    18.6 percent water it can be considered honey. At this point the honey is capped    with beeswax. The plants used by the bee are responsible for the characteristic    colors and flavors of honey.   Contamination of honey can occur in several ways:   a. Spraying field crops with pesticides    b. Microencapsulated pesticides used on field crops    c. Medicines used by the beekeeper   Pesticides are usually lethal to the bees thus preventing them from contaminating    the honey.   Unfortunately, two parasites are causing the death of bee colonies. These are    tracheal and varroa mites. The mites can be kept in check through the use of    medicines. Although these may be thought of as a source of contamination, good    beekeeping practice should prevent that. For tracheal mites, menthol is used    once a year, but menthol is present in many honeys, principally those from the    very common mint family blossoms. Grease patties, made from granulated sugar    and Crisco are used year-round but these are considered trash by the bees and    removed from the hive, never stored as honey is stored. For Varroa mites, a    twice-a-year treatment with fluvalinate-impregnated plastic is used. This is    a contact miticide that is most effective in late autumn after nectar gathering    has ceased. A second treatment can occur in early spring before surplus honey    is being stored.   The only other medication used for bees is oxytetracycline. The commercial    formulation is ""Terramycin"" which is normally used for treating domestic    animals. For bee colonies affected by American foulbrood, Terramycin is a useful    method of control, but does not provide a cure for this devastating disease    of honey bees. The bee hive should not be medicated during the summer months    when honey is being produced and stored in the honeycomb.        CORRECTION   In the January/February 1998  FDA VETERINARIAN , the article titled ""REGULATORY    ISSUES IN AGRICULTURAL BIOTECHNOLOGY"" by G.A. Mitchell, D.V.M., C. Haley,    Ph.D., M. Miller, Ph.D., J. Matheson, and W.D. Price, Ph.D. contained the following    two incorrect Internet citations: http://vm.cfsan.fda.gov/-lrd/consulpr.html,    and http://vm.cfsan.fda.gov/-lrd/biocon.html. The correct citations are:     http://vm.cfsan.fda.gov/~lrd/consulpr.html     and  http://vm.cfsan.fda.gov/~lrd/biocon.html .    We apologize for this error.        WARNING ON CONTAMINATED VETERINARY DRUGS   The Food and Drug Administration issued a national warning against the use    of all large volume parenteral drugs distributed by Veterinary Pharmaceuticals,    Inc., (VPI) of Hanford, California, and manufactured by its subsidiary, Sierra    Pharmaceuticals, Inc., of Mexicali, Mexico. The company has recalled these drugs,    commonly used to treat dairy cows, because they are contaminated with bacillus    cereus bacteria -- bacteria that can cause severe injury and death in cows.   The Agency urges anyone who has these products on hand to immediately stop    using them. The Agency has also issued an Import Alert to prevent the importation    of these products. FDA analyses show that samples of the following drugs manufactured    by this company are contaminated with bacillus cereus bacteria or related bacteria    species:        Hypertonic Saline Solution      Lactated Ringer's Solution      Calcium Gluconate 23% Solution      Dextrose Solution 50%      Electrolyte Solution w/ Dextrose      Caldex CMPK      Sterile Water for Injection      Vitamin B Complex      Vitamin B Complex Fortified     Since Sierra Pharmaceuticals used common equipment, manufacturing practices,    and controls for the above drugs and all other large volume parenteral products    it manufactured, all large volume parenteral veterinary drugs manufactured by    Sierra Pharmaceuticals, Inc., and distributed by Veterinary Pharmaceuticals    Inc., are covered by this warning.   Those who may have existing stocks of these drugs should contact the distributorship    from where they were purchased for instructions on what to do with these products.    Purchasers may also want to consult their veterinarians if they have treated    any cows with these products.        APPROVAL WITHDRAWN   In the December 30, 1997  Federal Register , FDA published a notice stating    that the Agency is withdrawing approval of a new animal drug application (NADA    100-903) which provided for use for chlortetracycline Type A medicated articles    to make Type B or Type C medicated feeds. This NADA was held by Hoffman-La Roche,    Inc. The sponsor requested the withdrawal of approval because the product is    no longer being manufactured or marketed.        REGULATORY ACTIVITIES   The following firms/individuals received warning letters for offering animals    for slaughter that contained illegal drug residues:              Alfred C.

In some, but not all TSEs, deposits      of prions, sometimes detectable pre-clinically, occur in other tissues as      well. The function, biology, and pathology of prions are still largely unknown.      It appears they are not associated with disease in their ""native""      state, but only when they become abnormally folded. What causes the abnormal      folding to occur, why hosts cannot dispose of or develop immunity to these      proteins, and what factors might cause or transmit TSEs are poorly understood.           Prions can be transmitted from      one host to another; however, they do not exhibit many other features of traditional      infective agents, such as bacteria, viruses, mycobacteria, protozoa, or fungi.      As such, prions are not considered ""germs"" in the classic sense,      but rather, are referred to as ""agents"" of disease. In recent years,      research has developed epidemiological evidence of transmissibility of certain      of these agents, not only between members of a single species, but also, more      ominously, from one species to another.      TSEs occur in several different      animal species. Scrapie in sheep and goats has been described for several      hundred years. Chronic wasting disease (CWD) in elk and deer has been reported      in Colorado, Wyoming, and Canada for several decades. Other TSEs have also      been reported in mink and cats.     In the mid-1980’s a new TSE, bovine      spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), was first described in cattle in the United      Kingdom. The government of the United Kingdom initiated major efforts to determine      the origin of the disease and to control the epidemic of BSE (or ""mad      cow disease"") that followed the initial reports. Strong evidence implicates      certain feeding practices as the major route of initiation of the disease      in cows and of further amplification of the disease throughout the British      cattle herd. These feeding practices include certain rendering procedures      and the recycling of ruminant animal tissues and byproducts into the cattle      food chain through certain livestock feed supplements.      The precautionary slaughter of      large numbers of British cows and ever more stringent prohibitions on certain      animal feeding and slaughter practices appear to have stemmed, though not      eradicated, the BSE epidemic in the United Kingdom. Unfortunately, these measures      were not sufficient or enforced stringently enough or instituted soon enough      to prevent the spread of the disease to continental European countries. At      present, the U. S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) officially recognizes      thirty European countries and Oman as either having documented BSE cases or      being at high risk for BSE.      Humans are also susceptible to      TSEs. Two of the better-documented human TSEs are kuru and classical Creutzfeldt-Jakob      disease (CJD). Both of these diseases have been described for decades. Kuru      is a disease of the South Pacific Fore people and has been epidemiologically      associated with the consumption of human brains. Classical CJD, conversely,      occurs worldwide at a stable rate of approximately 1 case per million people.      The epidemiology of this disease is not fully understood, although, in certain      cases, a specific genetic component appears to increase susceptibility. Transmission      of classical CJD between humans via transplants of dura mater and corneas      and by handling tissues or injecting pituitary extract from patients with      CJD has been documented.     In 1996 a new variant of CJD (vCJD)      was described in patients in the United Kingdom. Epidemiological data implicate      the consumption of beef products contaminated with the agent of BSE as the      probable cause of vCJD in humans. Due to the long incubation time of the agent      in humans before vCJD is clinically recognizable, the number of people who      harbor the agent of vCJD is unknown. Presently, approximately 100 people in      Europe (primarily in the United Kingdom) are known to have died from vCJD.           Unfortunately, the lack of any      sensitive, specific pre-mortem diagnostic test TSEs in either humans or animals      limits surveillance and other research efforts. Diagnosis is usually only      confirmed by special post-mortem examinations of brain tissue.      Presently, animal and human TSEs      have no treatments or preventative vaccines. All are invariably fatal.     Routine materials and processes      that destroy traditional human and animal pathogens do not appear to destroy      prions. Presently, no established methods can reliably decontaminate or sterilize      articles contaminated with prions.     There is no evidence of either      BSE or vCJD in the United States. However, it is clear that the Atlantic Ocean      itself is not a barrier to the spread of this disease. Several issues raise      concerns on this side of the Atlantic about potential spread of domestic TSEs,      as well as the introduction of BSE and vCJD into the United States. These      concerns include: (1) the presence of animal TSEs in North America; (2) certain      historic American animal feeding and animal import practices; (3) the continental      European experience with BSE and vCJD in the summer of 2000; (4) the international      commerce in animals, animal feed, and other products of bovine origin; and      (5) the heavy intercontinental travel by Americans.      Based on the European experience      with BSE, it is clear that the discovery of BSE in American cattle would be      devastating to the U.S. cattle industry. The ultimate magnitude of the public      health impact of BSE and vCJD remains to be determined. Nonetheless, due to      the invariably fatal nature of the disease, the lack of routine methods to      destroy the agent, the ubiquitous presence of bovine products in most people’s      daily lives, and the nascent level of scientific knowledge about prion disease,      BSE and vCJD cause understandable concerns in the public, the government,      and the private sector.     Back to Table of Contents                FDA      TSE MISSION          The Department of Health and Human      Services has developed a departmental framework document (see Reference 1)      that outlines the responsibilities of FDA, CDC, NIH, and the Office of the      Secretary regarding TSEs. In that document, the Secretary designates ""protection""      as the primary responsibility of FDA.      FDA understands its TSE mission      is to enhance, sustain, and communicate regulatory safeguards against the      agents of TSEs, and, thereby, protect the public health of the U.S.     Back to Table of Contents                FDA      TSE PRINCIPLES          To fulfill its TSE-related mission,      FDA’s TSE program will adhere to the following five principles:                            Strong science-based knowledge          is fundamental to addressing this challenge to public health. FDA’s public          health policies will be grounded in that science.                          The science of these diseases          will continue to evolve. FDA’s actions will foster this evolution, and          FDA’s policies will respond to and reflect this new knowledge.                          These diseases uniformly have          lethal outcomes, and the level of scientific knowledge about them is quite          nascent. Because of these factors, FDA’s public health policies should          employ a very cautious approach and should take into account the level          of known risk (both real and theoretical).                           As much as possible, FDA will          utilize public advisory committees and other public fora, along with departmental          and outside experts, domestic and foreign, to advise concerning the agency’s          development of scientific, regulatory, and communication policies.                          FDA will communicate with          all our stakeholders as openly and frankly as possible regarding TSE issues.          Science-driven facts and transparent discourse are our best tools to build          public trust and understanding.                           Back to Table of Contents       FDA      TSE GOALS          To fulfill its TSE-related mission,      FDA’s program will work to achieve the following six goals:                            Working with other federal,          state, and private sector entities, FDA will protect the U.S. public health          by preventing, to the extent possible, the entry of the agent of BSE into          U.S. cattle.                          If the agent of BSE were to          enter U.S. cattle, FDA, in coordination with other federal, state, and          private sector entities, will have systems in place to identify, isolate,          and destroy the affected cattle and to prevent amplification of the disease          further in the U.S. herd.                          FDA will protect the U.S.          public health by minimizing exposure of Americans to TSE agents through:          (a) potentially contaminated food products, (b) other FDA-regulated products          that use potentially infected materials in their manufacture, and (c)          other FDA-regulated products or materials which may contain TSE agents.                          FDA will protect the U.S.          public health by facilitating the development of reliable pre-mortem diagnostic          tests for and options for the prevention and treatment of TSEs of humans          and animals.                          FDA will protect the U.S.          public health by developing and sustaining a strong regulatory infrastructure          to assure compliance with TSE regulations and policies.                          FDA will protect the U.S.          public health by developing and sustaining, in coordination with other          federal, state, and private sector entities, an effective communications          program with our stakeholders on TSE issues.                       Back to Table of Contents                FDA      TSE MAJOR FOCUS AREAS      To attain the goals of its TSE-related      mission, FDA is undertaking various activities in the five FDA major focus      areas identified in the DHHS BSE/TSE framework document. These include:                  Prevent exposure of Americans        to TSE agents through human and animal food products,                    Prevent exposure of Americans        to TSE agents through blood transfusions or tissue transplantation,                    Prevent exposure of Americans        to TSE agents through other FDA-regulated products,                    Establish a coordinated education        and outreach program to inform consumers, practitioners, patients, and industries        of the risk of TSEs and their potential transmission through FDA-regulated        products, and                    Continue and expand FDA’s TSE-related        regulatory research program.               Back to Table of Contents                                                  FDA      TSE ACTION ITEMS     (GROUPED BY FDA MAJOR      FOCUS AREA)                     General Comments          FDA has identified, and will continue      to identify, specific action items that it will undertake in each of these      five major focus areas. These action items, as of the date of this document,      are listed below. The short description of each action item also includes      the designated lead organizational component(s) within FDA. Other organizations,      with which the lead will primarily consult, are shown within parentheses.     Ultimate responsibility for oversight      of these action items resides with the Commissioner of Food and Drugs, the      person designated by the Commissioner as the lead for TSE-activities in the      Office of the Commissioner, and the directors of the organizational components      identified in this document as being the lead for a specific action item.     It should be noted that FDA might      not complete some action items, because FDA, at present, is simply in a fact-finding      mode for those items. As further information is gathered regarding certain      items, it may be decided that the action item should not be pursued or that      the action does not fall within the jurisdiction of FDA. Additional action      items may also be identified.     In prioritizing FDA resources to      accomplish these specific action items, FDA has allocated the resources it      has for TSE purposes  first  to those activities believed to have the      most significant impact on FDA TSE goals.      Many of FDA’s activities to date      have focused primarily on (1) preventing the entry of BSE into U.S. cattle      and (2) ensuring that if BSE entered the U.S. herd, tissue from the infected      animal(s) would not end up in cattle feed and potentially infect other animals      (i.e., be amplified through the herd). Cattle that eat feed that does not      contain certain animal protein, which might contain BSE's infectious agent,      will be free of BSE. Products for human use made from these cattle will be      free from the potential risk of causing the human version of BSE (vCJD). Continuous      improvement in these activities, based on new science and experience, are      now a primary focus of FDA’s efforts in this regard.     More vexing has been the effort      to determine the correct policies for protecting Americans from possible exposure      to the agent of BSE from FDA-regulated products (drugs, vaccines, medical      devices, blood products, foods, cosmetics, dietary supplements) that may be      manufactured using BSE-positive or BSE-high risk bovine materials. In addition,      FDA and outside experts have spent considerable effort deciding the best policies      regarding the potential exposure to the agent of BSE from blood or tissue      transplantation from individuals who may be harboring the BSE agent because      of past potential exposure to the agent .

Highlights   Many Americans benefited from last year's timely reviews of new prescription medicines, over-the-counter medicines and their generic equivalents.   We met or exceeded all the performance goals we agreed to under legislation authorizing us to collect user fees for drug reviews.   We approved 24 new medicines that have never been marketed before in this country and 234 generic versions of existing drugs. We authorized seven medicines to be sold over the counter without a prescription.   We conducted 463 foreign and domestic inspections that help protect volunteers for clinical trials from research risks and validate the quality and integrity of data submitted to us.   Highlights of new medication options for American consumers include:      Two new drugs to treat cancer.    Four drugs to treat heart disease and circulatory disorders.    The first in a new class of drugs approved to treat HIV infection.    One new drug for Alzheimer's disease.    One new drug for schizophrenia.    Two new prescription drugs for migraine headaches.    One new COX-2 selective anti-inflammatory drug for arthritis and menstrual cramping.    The first in a new class of antifungals.    A synthetic drug to prevent blood clots that is the first in a new class.    Two new drugs to treat glaucoma, a leading cause of blindness.    Three new or expanded uses to treat breast cancer.    New shorter dosing regimens of an over-the-counter treatment for vaginal yeast infections.    A new over-the-counter use for aspirin to treat migraine.    Three new drugs and three new or expanded uses of existing drugs for ""orphan"" patient populations of 200,000 or fewer.    Back to Index   New Drug Review   Review and approval times.  Review time represents the time that we spend examining the application. Approval time represents our review time plus industry's response time to our requests for additional information. Our charts show these times as ""medians."" The value for the median time is the number that falls in the middle of the group after the numbers are ranked in order. It provides a truer picture of our performance than average time, which can be unduly influenced by a few very long or short times.   Actions and filings.  An application is ""filed"" when we determine it is complete and accept it for review. We make a filing decision within 60 days of receiving an application. Approval is one of the actions that we can take once an application is filed. Other actions include seeking more information from the sponsor. There is no direct connection between applications filed in one year and actions in the same year. Filings provide an idea of what the workload in subsequent years will be.   New drug statistics on Internet.  Other statistics are available on our Web site at  http://www.fda.gov/cder/rdmt/default.htm .   Standard new drugs.  We took 143 actions on standard new drug applications, of which 56 were approvals. These drugs have therapeutic qualities similar to those of already marketed products. We have a goal of reviewing 90 percent of these applications within 10 months.

Three of the approvals were for ""orphan"" uses in patient populations of 200,000 or fewer. Sponsors of such products receive inducements that include seven-year marketing exclusivity, tax credit for the product-associated clinical research, research design assistance by FDA and grants of up to $200,000 per year.   Orphan drugs   We approved three ""orphan"" products to treat disorders with patient populations of 200,000 or fewer:      Bosentan (Tracleer)  treats pulmonary arterial hypertension.    Imatinib mesylate (Gleevec)  treats chronic myeloid leukemia.    Zoledronic acid (Zometa)  treats excess calcium in the blood caused by tumors.    Notable 2001 new drug approvals   Last year's approvals benefited people with cancer, HIV infection, heart disease and other disorders.   People with cancer   One of our most important approvals last year was for  imatinib mesylate (Gleevec),  a new oral treatment for patients with chronic myeloid leukemia, a rare life-threatening form of cancer. We reviewed the application for the drug in two and one-half months and approved it under a special procedure that permits the marketing of important therapies on the basis of their effect on surrogate markers. The sponsor is committed to carry out additional studies demonstrating the drug's long-term safety and effectiveness. The drug was developed for use in a U.S. patient population of fewer than 200,000 and was, therefore, designated an orphan drug.   Zoledronic acid (Zometa)  is an intravenous bisphonsphonate for the treatment of hypercalcemia of malignancy, the most common life-threatening metabolic complication associated with cancer. This complication, which is characterized by elevated serum calcium levels, affects more than 10 percent of all cancer patients and generally occurs late in the course of the disease.   People with heart and circulatory disease   One new approval last year for cardiac patients is  nesiritide (Natrecor)  for the treatment of acute decompensated congestive heart failure. The drug, which was developed with the use of recombinant DNA technology, is a synthetic version of a human hormone that dilates veins and arteries.   Perflutren lipid microsphere (Definity)  is an ultrasound contrast agent for use with suboptimal echocardiograms. It increases the power of heart ultrasounds and may provide earlier and more definitive diagnoses for millions of difficult-to-image patients at risk for heart disease. The drug is the first and only ultrasound contrast agent in the United States that is non-blood derived, eliminating the risks and concerns associated with the use of blood-based products.   Fondaparinux sodium (Arixtra)  is for the prophylaxis of deep-vein thrombosis, which may lead to pulmonary embolism after orthopedic surgery for hip fracture, hip replacement and knee replacement. The drug is a synthetic compound and the first in a new class of antithrombotic agents that selectively inhibit Factor Xa.   Bosentan (Tracleer)  is to improve exercise ability and decrease the rate of clinical worsening in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension with significant limitation of physical activity. The drug is the first to be approved in a new class of drugs called endothelin receptor antagonists. The disease is a chronic, life-threatening disorder that can severely compromise the function of the lungs and heart.   People with HIV and AIDS   The first in a new class of drugs to combat HIV was approved, a once-daily medication that blocks an enzyme involved in the replication of the disease.  Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (Viread)  is for the treatment of HIV infection when taken in combination with other antiretroviral agents. The drug is the first nucleotide analogue reverse transcriptase inhibitor approved for the treatment of HIV. The drug works by blocking reverse transcriptase, an enzyme involved in the replication of HIV. As a nucleotide, the drug remains in cells longer than many other antiretroviral drugs, allowing for once-daily dosing.   Valganciclovir hydrochloride (Valcyte)  treats the eye infection cytomegalovirus retinitis in patients with AIDS.    People with arthritis   Valdecoxib (Bextra),  a COX-2 specific inhibitor, is for treating the signs and symptoms of osteoarthritis, adult rheumatoid arthritis and the pain associated with menstrual cramping.   People with glaucoma   We approved two ophthalmic solutions for reducing elevated intraocular pressure in patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension.    Bimatoprost (Lumigan)  and  travoprost (Travatan)  treat patients who are intolerant of, insufficiently responsive or inadequately controlled using other intraocular pressure-lowering medications. Glaucoma is a leading cause of preventable blindness.   People with mental and neurological disorders   Ziprasidone hydrochloride (Geodon)  is for the treatment of schizophrenia, a life-long illness that strikes men and women in their late adolescence or early 20s, often with multiple relapses and impaired daily functioning.   Galantamine hydrobromide (Reminyl)  is for the treatment of mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease.   We approved two drugs for the acute treatment of migraine with or without aura in adults:  almotriptan malate (Axert)  and  frovatriptan succinate (Frova).   Infectious diseases   Caspofungin acetate (Cancidas)  is for the treatment of invasive aspergillosis in patients who are refractory to or intolerant of other therapies. The drug is the first in a new class of antifungals and works by attacking the fungal cell wall. Aspergillosis is a life-threatening fungal infection in high-risk patients, especially cancer patients, organ and bone-marrow transplant recipients, and patients with HIV/AIDS.   Cefditoren pivoxil (Spectracef)  is a cephalosporin antibiotic for the treatment of acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis, pharyngitis/tonsillitis and uncomplicated skin and skin structure infections in adults and children 12 years and older.   Ertapenem sodium (Invanz)  is a long-acting injectable antibiotic for treatment of adults with moderate to severe bacterial infections, including complicated intra-abdominal infections, complicated skin and skin structure infections, community-acquired pneumonia, complicated urinary tract infections and acute pelvic infections.   People with respiratory diseases and allergies   Formoterol fumarate (Foradil)  is a fast-acting, long-lasting bronchodilator for the maintenance treatment of asthma and the prevention of bronchospasm in reversible obstructive airways disease. The drug provides both long-lasting symptom control and rapid bronchodilation from a single product.   Desloratadine (Clarinex)  treats nasal and non-nasal symptoms of seasonal allergic rhinitis in adults and children 12 years of age and older. The drug is a once-daily, nonsedating antihistamine.   People with skin disease   Pimecrolimus (Elidel)  is the first non-steroid cream for mild to moderate atopic dermatitis in patients 2 years and older. Commonly known as eczema, atopic dermatitis is an itchy skin condition that primarily affects children and may last until the late teen-age years or even for life.   People with gastrointestinal disorders   Mesalamine (Canasa)  is a suppository for the treatment of active ulcerative proctitis, an inflammation of the rectum.   Budesonide (Entocort EC)  treats mild to moderate active Crohn's disease, an inflammatory disease, involving the ileum and/or ascending colon.   Men   Dutasteride (Dutasteride)  treats benign prostatic hyperpl a sia, a non-cancerous enlargement of the prostate gland, which can lead to the manifestation of lower urinary tract symptoms. The pathological changes of this disorder are found in about 50 percent of men in their 50s and up to 90 percent of men in   their 90s.   Women   We approved three contraceptives, including two that deliver continuous doses of the hormones progestin and estrogen in new ways to prevent pregnancy:      Etonogestrel/ethinyl estradiol (NuvaRing),  the first monthly vaginal ring for birth control, delivers the hormones through a flexible, transparent polymer ring inserted in the vagina.    Norelgestromin/ethinyl estradiol (Ortho Evra),  the first skin patch approved for birth control, releases the hormones through the skin into the blood stream and has to be changed each week.    Both the ring and the patch have to be removed one week each month when the woman menstruates.   We also approved a new low-dose oral contraceptive,  drospirenone/ethinyl estradiol (Yasmin).   Back to Index   New or Expanded Use Review   Applications for a new or expanded use, often representing important new treatment options, are formally called ""efficacy supplements"" to the original new drug application. When studying approved drugs in children (page 15), sponsors often learn new information about the drug's safety and the doses that should be used. An efficacy supplement changes the labeling information to reflect the new discoveries, even if there is not a new or expanded use.   Last year we took action on 213 applications for new or expanded uses of already approved drugs. We approved 91, including six that were given priority reviews of six months or less. Three of the approvals were for orphan uses in patient populations of 200,000 or fewer.

Back to Index   Pediatric Exclusivity   The 2002 Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act renewed our authority to grant six months of marketing exclusivity to manufacturers who conduct and submit pediatric studies in response to our written requests. It also allows us to collect user fees for reviewing these pediatric supplements and requires they be reviewed as priority supplements. The law also authorizes the federal government to contract for pediatric studies for drugs that lack patent protection or other marketing exclusivity.   Pediatric exclusivity has helped us uncover important new dosing and safety information that will help pediatricians and other prescribers use drugs to treat children more confidently. As of March 2002, we had received 300 proposed pediatric study requests from manufacturers and had issued 241 written requests. These studies could potentially involve more than 32,000 children. Pediatric studies have already been conducted on more than 65 drugs. Reports from these studies have been submitted, exclusivity granted to 56 drugs, and new pediatric labeling in 31 as of March 2002.   Pediatric exclusivity cumulative statistics      300 proposed pediatric study requests received    241 written requests issued    31 labeling changes    Internet resource   Our pediatric medicine page is at  http://www.fda.gov/cder/pediatric/index.htm .   Pediatric conditions with approved labeling   Drugs with newly developed approved pediatric use information in their labeling are used to treat conditions such as:      Abnormal heart rhythms    Allergies    Anesthesia and sedation    Diabetes mellitus    Heartburn    High blood pressure    High cholesterol    High eye pressure    HIV infection    Inflammation    Juvenile rheumatoid arthritis    Low levels of calcium associated with severe kidney disease    Obsessive compulsive disorder    Pain    Seizures    Skin disorders    Approved information to treat children's illnesses   Of the 31 drugs with newly approved pediatric information in their labels, nine had significant changes for dosing, safety or use, and one drug available in several different products was not recommended for pediatric use. The nine with significant changes were:      Gabapentin (Neurontin),  a seizure drug, requires higher doses in children younger than 5 years in order to control seizures, and new adverse events such as hostility and aggression were identified in children younger than 12.    Propofol (Diprivan),  an anesthesia drug, showed higher death rates when used for sedation in pediatric intensive care units compared with standard sedative agents (9 percent vs. 4 percent); serious slowing of the heart rate can occur when the drug is coadministered with fentanyl, a pain drug.    Sevoflurane (Ultane),  used for anesthesia, had rare cases of seizures reported in children without a previous seizure history.    Ribavirin/Intron A (Rebetron),  a treatment for chronic hepatitis C, showed increased suicidal ideation or attempts among pediatric patients compared with adults (2.4 percent vs. 1 percent) and decreased the rate of linear growth and weight gain during therapy, with general reversal in the post-treatment period.    Pimecrolimus (Elidel)  is for short-term and intermittent long-term therapy in mild to moderate eczema in non-immunocompromised patients older than 2 years, but it is  not recommended  in patients younger than 2 for safety concerns including infections, fever and diarrhea.    Midazolam (Versed),  used for sedation and to reduce anxiety, showed higher risk of serious life-threatening situations in children with congenital heart disease and pulmonary hypertension. Studies identified the need to begin therapy at the lower end of the dosing range in these patients to prevent respiratory compromise.    Etodolac (Lodine),  when used in the management of the signs and symptoms of juvenile rheumatoid arthritis for children 6 to 16 years old, requires higher weight-adjusted doses in younger children that is about twice the lower dose recommended in adults for effective treatment.    Fluvoxamine (Luvox),  when used to treat obsessive compulsive disorder, requires higher doses in adolescents than previously recommended; however, girls ages 8 to 11 may require lower doses.    Studies of  buspirone (Buspar)  failed to establish safety and effectiveness in patients 6 to 17 years old for treatment of general anxiety disorder at doses recommended for adults.    Approved information recommends against pediatric use   Newly approved labeling shows that several products with a specific topical steroid are not recommended for pediatric use. They are:   Betamethasone (Diprolene AF, Diprosone Cream, Ointment, Lotion),  used to treat corticosteroid-responsive skin disorders, is not recommended in patients younger than 12 because it suppressed adrenal axis activity and caused local adverse reactions, including signs of skin atrophy.   Betamethasone/clotrimazole (Lotrisone),  a treatment for ringworm infections, is not recommended in patients younger than 17 because it suppressed adrenal axis activity.

Mink tissue would also be prohibited from such feeds.       The proposed regulation is the latest in a series of preventive measures -- including a voluntary industry moratorium -- that FDA, other federal agencies and industry have already taken to protect animals from transmissible degenerative neurological diseases, and to minimize any potential risk that such diseases could be transmitted from animals to humans.      These animal diseases are known as transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs).  Bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) is among the more commonly known of these diseases.  TSEs are characterized by a long incubation period, a relatively short clinical course of neurological signs, and 100 percent mortality.  Because of concerns that BSE could in the future be identified scientifically as the cause of a new TSE in humans, FDA and USDA officials said the protection of public health depends on the development of a strategy to control possible routes of TSE expansion in food animals.        FDA's proposed regulation would prohibit the use of nearly  all potential sources of ruminant and mink protein in feed intended for ruminants.  The only exceptions would be bovine blood, ruminant-derived milk and gelatin, since FDA has no information suggesting that milk proteins, gelatin or bovine blood proteins are potentially infective for TSEs.      ""This is a precautionary measure -- there have been no reported cases of BSE in this county,"" said Donna E. Shalala, Secretary of Health and Human Services.  ""It will add another  level of safeguards to protect the U.S. against the potential risk from these diseases.""      ""If for some reason a case of BSE were to occur in the U.S. -- and it is important to emphasize that not even one case of BSE has ever been found here -- the steps we are taking today would confine it to the individual animal and greatly decrease the potential risk to humans,"" said FDA Commissioner David A. Kessler, M.D.  ""In essence, this proposal would build a protective barrier against the spread of BSE.""        In addition to prohibiting tissues with the potential to spread TSEs, the proposed rule also requires process and control systems to ensure that ruminant feed does not contain the prohibited tissues.        The first case of BSE was reported in the United Kingdom in 1986.  Epidemiological evidence gathered in the U.K. suggests an association between the outbreak of BSE there and the feeding to cattle of protein derived from sheep infected with scrapie, another TSE.        Recently, scientists have postulated an association between BSE and a variant form of Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (v-CJD)  reported in the U.K.  Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease is a degenerative neurological disorder that affects humans.         The British government on March 20 announced a  possible link between BSE and 10 cases of v-CJD.  Nine days later, U.S. national livestock organizations and professional health groups announced a voluntary moratorium on the use of  ruminant protein in feeds of ruminants.  At the same time, FDA committed to expediting regulations addressing issues related to feeding ruminant protein, and on May 14 the FDA published an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking to solicit scientific and economic information and other public comments.      Today's proposed regulation is the product of FDA's evaluation of this information to date.  FDA will continue to evaluate additional data and comments related to this proposal.                               ####            ATTENTION TV BROADCASTERS: Please use open caption for the hearing impaired.                  "

It does not create or confer any rights for or on any person and does not operate to bind FDA or the public.  An alternative approach may be used if such approach satisfies the requirements of the applicable statute and regulations.                     INTRODUCTION      On November 11, 1999, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a final guidance document for implementation entitled, ""Revised Precautionary Measures to Reduce the Possible Risk of Transmission of Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (CJD) and New Variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (nvCJD) by Blood and Blood Products.""  We, FDA, have continued to monitor epidemiological findings and other scientific data regarding new variant CJD.  On August 29, 2001, we issued a draft guidance for comment, entitled ""Revised Preventive Measures to Reduce the Possible Risk of Transmission of Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (CJD) and Variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (vCJD) by Blood and Blood Products,"" which recommended new donor deferrals for risk of exposure to bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE).  This guidance finalizes the August 29, 2001, draft guidance, and supersedes the November 11, 1999, guidance.  In keeping with current usage, the nomenclature used in previous guidances for new variant CJD, ""nvCJD,"" has now been changed to variant CJD, or ""vCJD.""  We refer to all other forms of CJD as ""CJD.""  This final guidance provides comprehensive current recommendations, including new recommendations for deferral of donors with possible exposure to the agent of vCJD.  We based these recommendations upon current knowledge, and advice from the FDA’s Transmissible Spongiform Encephalopathies Advisory Committee (TSEAC).  Recommendations for all other forms of CJD (sporadic, familial, and iatrogenic) are unchanged.     Tests are being developed to detect CJD and vCJD infections in blood and plasma donors.  However, until suitable donor screening tests are available, FDA is recommending interim preventive measures that we deem to be prudent based on the available scientific data and the evolving state of knowledge regarding these diseases.  We also expect that additional epidemiological information will become available as the vCJD and Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE) epidemics evolve.  We may update this guidance in the future, in light of developments in testing technology, epidemiological information, and the impact of these recommendations on the supply of blood and blood-derived products.    FDA uses mandatory language, such as “shall,” “must,” and “require,” when referring to statutory or regulatory requirements.  The FDA uses non-mandatory language, such as “should,” “may,” “can,” and “recommend” when referring to recommendations.     Table of Contents             BACKGROUND      CJD is a rare but invariably fatal degenerative disease of the central nervous system, associated with a poorly understood transmissible agent (Refs. 1, 2).  Sporadic CJD cases occur at low frequency by an unknown mechanism.  CJD may also be acquired by exogenous (usually iatrogenic) exposure to infectious material; or may be familial, caused by a genetic mutation of the prion protein gene.  Clinical latency for iatrogenic CJD may exceed 30 years, based upon observations following point exposures to contaminated materials.    In 1996, a previously unrecognized variant of CJD, vCJD, was identified in the United Kingdom (U.K.) (Ref. 3).  vCJD is distinguished from CJD by differences in clinical presentation and neuropathologic changes, summarized below (Refs. 3-8).           Differences in clinical presentation   vCJD   CJD        Age of onset   Earlier   Later        Mean age at death   28 years   68 years        Psychiatric and sensory symptoms   Frequent in early course of illness   Appear later in course of illness        EEG changes   Absence of diagnostic EEG changes   Diagnostic EEG changes commonly seen        Duration of illness (Median) (Ref. 7)   13 months   4 months        Neuropathologic features   Florid prion protein plaques, surrounded by spongiform changes   Florid plaques uncommon        Immunohistochemistry (Ref. 8)    Abnormal prion protein detectable in lymphoid tissues   Abnormal prion protein not detected in lymphoid tissues            The concentration of abnormal prion protein seen in vCJD lymphoid tissues has led to concerns that transmission of vCJD by blood might be a greater risk than for CJD (Ref. 9).    Neuropathologic examination of brain tissue is required to confirm a diagnosis of vCJD.  A confirmed (or definite) case of vCJD is currently defined by the following neuropathologic findings:           numerous widespread kuru-type amyloid plaques, surrounded by vacuoles, in both the cerebellum and cerebrum (""florid plaques"");       spongiform change most evident in the basal ganglia and thalamus, with sparse distribution in the cerebral cortex; and       high density accumulation of abnormal prion protein, particularly in the cerebrum and cerebellum as shown by immunohistochemistry.       A clinical diagnosis of ""suspected"" vCJD can be made based upon certain clinical features, if adequate neuropathology specimens are unavailable.  Although recommended diagnostic evaluations and criteria for vCJD are evolving, at present the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) classifies cases in the U.S. with all of the following features as suspected vCJD:          Current age (if alive) or age at death <55.   Persistent painful sensory symptoms and/or psychiatric symptoms at clinical presentation.   Dementia, and delayed development ( > 4 months after illness onset) of ataxia, plus at least one of the following three neurologic signs: myoclonus, chorea, or dystonia.   A normal or abnormal EEG, but not the diagnostic EEG changes often seen in classic CJD.   Duration of illness of at least 6 months.   Routine investigations do not suggest an alternative, non-CJD diagnosis.   A history of possible exposure to BSE, e.g., having been a resident or traveler to a BSE-affected country from 1980 to the present.   No history of iatrogenic exposure to CJD, such as receipt of a dura mater graft, or human pituitary-derived hormones.   Absence of a prion protein gene mutation, or, if this has not been determined, no history of CJD in a first degree relative.       To date more than 100 patients, mostly in the United Kingdom (U.K.), as well as five patients in France, have been diagnosed with vCJD.  The size of the vCJD epidemic cannot yet be determined, but is believed to be increasing in the U.K. (Refs. 10-11).  No cases of vCJD have been identified in the U.S., except for one U.K. resident with vCJD who traveled to California in 2001 for medical care.  Laboratory and epidemiologic studies have linked vCJD to the epidemic of BSE in the U.K. (Refs. 12-13).  In the U.K., BSE probably first occurred in cattle in 1980, peaked in 1992, and fell to low levels by 1996, as a result of control measures.  BSE prevalence, while lower than in the U.K., appears to be increasing in some European countries, and the peak levels of those epidemics cannot yet be ascertained (Refs. 14-15).  In September 2001, the first case of BSE was reported in Asia (Ref. 16).  BSE has not been reported, to date, in U.S. cattle.    On December 11, 1996, we issued a memorandum to all registered blood and plasma establishments and all establishments engaged in manufacturing plasma derivatives entitled “Revised Precautionary Measures to Reduce the Possible Risk of Transmission of Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (CJD) by Blood and Blood Products.”  We recommended, as a preventive measure, that you, the manufacturer, should quarantine and destroy in-date Source Plasma and plasma derivatives, and in-date transfusion products prepared from donors who were at increased risk for developing CJD or who were subsequently diagnosed with CJD.  We also recommended permanent deferral of donors with CJD or CJD risks, unless, in cases of a family member with CJD, the donor underwent genetic testing which demonstrated absence of a familial-CJD associated abnormality of the prion protein gene. We did not make specific recommendations for vCJD in that document.  Changes to those recommendations were announced on September 8, 1998, and were incorporated into the August 1999 guidance, which was revised and updated in November 1999.  These changes were:           that you no longer withdraw plasma derivatives containing plasma from donors with CJD or CJD risk factors;     that you withdraw all material collected from donors diagnosed with vCJD or suspected vCJD; and    that you defer donors based on their potential exposure to BSE in the U.K., or injection of  insulin made from bovine sources in the U.K.          We changed the 1996 recommendation to withdraw plasma derivatives containing plasma from donors with CJD or CJD risk, because of recently published epidemiological and laboratory data which provided additional assurance that transmission of CJD by blood and blood products is unlikely.  This evidence included five case-control studies of over 600 CJD cases, two lookback studies of recipients of products from CJD patients, and two autopsy studies of patients with hemophilia (Refs. 17-23).  None of these studies linked CJD to receipt of blood or blood products.  In addition, mortality surveillance by the CDC of 3,642 CJD deaths over 16 years (later updated to 4,468 reports), showed that none of these cases were reported to have conditions associated with frequent receipt of blood and blood products (hemophilia, thalassemia, or sickle cell disease) (Ref. 24).  Finally, experimental studies in animal models for CJD suggested that manufacturing procedures used for plasma derivatives could lower the amount of infectious material present in plasma derivatives compared with whatever levels may be present in blood (Refs. 25-26).    In contrast to CJD, vCJD is an emerging disease with unique clinical and pathological characteristics.  Few experimental or epidemiological studies of vCJD transmissibility by blood components or plasma derivatives have been published, and it is uncertain whether human blood can transmit the vCJD agent.  Because the potential for transmission is unknown, as a preventive measure, we recommended, in August 1999, that you withdraw blood components and derivatives collected from donors diagnosed with vCJD.  As a further preventive measure, we also recommended that you defer donors who resided in the U.K. for a total of 6 months or more, between 1980 and 1996.  Approximately 87% of donor exposure-days to BSE in the U.K. were eliminated by this donor deferral.  The period from 1980 through 1996 reflects the peak years of the U.K. BSE epidemic, and recognizes the measures implemented in the U.K. since 1996, that are designed to keep BSE out of the human food chain (Ref. 27). As other countries institute similar food chain protections against BSE, we will reconsider the current donor deferrals.    Since we published the November 1999 guidance, the vCJD and BSE epidemics have continued to evolve.  More BSE cases have been reported in Europe, including new reports of BSE in Spain, Italy, Germany, the Czech Republic, Greece, Slovakia, Slovenia, Austria, and Finland.  BSE was recently identified in Japan (Ref. 16).  Furthermore, transmission of BSE appears to have been experimentally achieved by transfusion in a single sheep (Ref. 28), heightening concerns about possible transmissibility of the vCJD agent by human blood.  On June 6-7, 2000, the TSEAC met to discuss deferral of donors from countries affected by BSE.  The TSEAC voted not to recommend new donor deferrals for European exposures outside of the U.K. at that time.  This decision was based on observations that 1) the extent of the BSE epidemic in Europe was undetermined and 2) donor deferrals for U.K. residence had only recently been fully implemented, and the potential for adverse impact on the availability of blood and blood products had not been fully appreciated.  The TSEAC also recommended against changing the U.K. donor deferral period to one more stringent than 6 months.       At its meeting on January 18-19, 2001, the TSEAC reviewed more recent epidemiological information on exposure to BSE in European countries, and again considered donor deferrals for vCJD risk.  The TSEAC again voted that epidemiological and other currently available scientific information did not support changing the current deferral for donors who resided in the U.K.  The TSEAC did recommend that deferrals be considered for donors who were exposed to beef products exported from the U.K. to U.S. military bases in Europe, and to France; and for donors potentially exposed to BSE since 1980 in France, Portugal, or the Republic of Ireland.  In response to advice from the TSEAC that FDA should consider a donor deferral recommendation for residence or travel in Portugal and Republic of Ireland (i.e., countries where BSE exposure was not related to human consumption of British beef per se), we decided to reexamine the issue with the TSEAC.  Therefore, the TSEAC met again June 28-29, 2001, to consider the estimated potential human exposures to the BSE agent in the U.K. and other parts of Europe, as well as risk reduction and donor loss estimates that would be associated with tightened geographic donor deferrals.  At this meeting, the TSEAC considered three deferral options (including the option proposed by the TSEAC at its January 2001 meeting) and voted to recommend the deferral policies which form the basis of these recommendations (Ref. 29).     Rationale for New Geographic Donor Deferrals     This guidance document contains comprehensive revised recommendations based upon advisory committee discussions, public comments to the docket and at advisory committee meetings, and internal Public Health Service and FDA deliberations.  We have developed recommendations for donor deferral, product retrieval, and quarantine and disposition based upon consideration of risk in the donor and product, and the effect that withdrawals and deferrals might have on the supply of life- and health-sustaining blood, blood components and plasma derivatives.  In particular, donors with vCJD are distinguished from those with CJD or CJD risk factors, because of very limited historical and epidemiological experience with vCJD, known pathological differences between CJD and vCJD, and uncertainty about the potential for vCJD transmission by blood transfusion.    The new recommendations reflect an attempt to minimize the possible risk of vCJD transmission from blood and blood products consistent with maintaining their availability.  We estimated that the recommended new donor deferrals will result in a 90% reduction in total person-days of risk-weighted donor exposure to the agent of vCJD.  We calculated risk as the sum of relative risk-weighted person-days exposure in the United Kingdom (weight =1.0), France (weight = 0.05), other European countries (weight = 0.015), and members of the U.S. military and their dependents (weight = 0.35).     Donor loss under this policy is projected to be approximately 5%, based upon our recent analysis of data from the 1999 multi-center blood donor travel survey (Ref. 29), which was conducted using methodology described for Retrovirus Epidemiology Donor Studies (Ref. 30).  We recognize that these deferrals may adversely affect the available supply of blood and plasma derivatives and that supplies need to be monitored closely.  This impact will vary locally and regionally depending upon the dynamics of supply and demand and other characteristics such as demographics of the donor populations.  More specifically, travel prevalence to the U.K. and other parts of Europe may be as much as 50% higher in urban coastal cities with corresponding lower travel in central and rural areas of the U.S. (Ref. 14).    Since the publication of draft guidance in August 2001, BSE has been diagnosed in Japan.  The source of this outbreak is likely to have been meat-and-bone meal, imported from the U.K.  The news media has reported that other countries may also have received U.K. meat-and-bone meal (Ref. 31).  We may consider additional deferrals based upon possible exposure to BSE in Asia or elsewhere after the currently recommended deferrals have been implemented, their impact is assessed, and additional information about the potential level of BSE exposure and food chain controls is acquired    In anticipation of the new geographic deferral recommendation, we strongly encourage proactive planning to ensure blood supply adequacy before, during, and after implementation.  Steps to moderate supply impact may include assertively increasing collection volume before implementation, and careful monitoring of the blood supply and demand factors before, during, and after implementation.  To moderate the impact on the blood supply, we recommend that you implement donor deferrals in two separate phases (sections IV. D. 2., IV. D. 3., and VIII.).  Considering the importance of an adequate blood supply, we will reconsider our recommendations as appropriate based on the impact of the expanded donor deferrals on the availability of blood products.     Table of Contents             EXPLANATION OF CURRENT vCJD RECOMMENDATIONS         Exposure to British Beef in the U.K.     The vCJD epidemic in the U.K. continues to increase (Ref. 11, and CJD Statistics from the British Department of Health, at www.doh.gov.uk).  To increase protection of the U.S. blood supply, we now recommend that you defer blood and plasma donors who have traveled or resided in the U.K. for a cumulative period of 3 or more months between 1980 and the end of 1996.       Exposure to British Beef Products Distributed Outside of the U.K.     The TSEAC recognized two types of risk outside of the U.K.  These include: exposure to BSE from infected cows in the country of residence (“indigenous”), and exposure to BSE from bovine products exported from the U.K. during the BSE epidemic (prior to full implementation of food control measures in 1996).    Available data suggest that France imported a substantial amount of beef from the U.K. during the peak years of the BSE epidemic (Ref. 32).  Approximately 5% of beef consumed in France is estimated to have come from the U.K., and the number of French vCJD cases (three confirmed and two probable) is approximately 4.4% of those in the U.K (Ref. 33).  It is currently speculated that the French vCJD cases were infected by consumption of British beef in France, since none of the individuals had lived in the U.K., and the indigenous French BSE epidemic is relatively smaller and more recent than that in the U.K.  Substantial amounts of British beef also were exported to the Netherlands, but it appears that much of this meat was exported from the Netherlands to a variety of other countries (Ref. 32).    On January 18, 2001, the TSEAC voted to defer potential donors who resided in France for 10 years or more, from 1980 until the present.  The suggested 10 year (120 month) deferral period for France reflected an estimated 5% risk of exposure to BSE, compared to exposure of donors who resided in the U.K. for at least 6 months.  Based upon a revised deferral criterion of 3 months for exposure in the U.K., we now recommend deferral of blood and plasma donors with a history of 5 or more years of cumulative residence or travel in France since 1980.        Some U.S. military personnel, civilian military personnel, and their dependents in Europe also potentially were exposed to British beef procured for use on U.S. military bases between 1980 and 1996.  British beef was distributed to U.S. military bases North of the Alps (Germany, United Kingdom, Belgium, and the Netherlands) between 1980 and 1990, and South of the Alps (Greece, Turkey, Spain, Portugal, and Italy), between 1980 and 1996.  While exposure varied widely, it is estimated that in some areas, up to 35% of beef consumed on U.S. military bases in Europe came from the United Kingdom (Ref. 14).  The TSEAC recommended deferring such donors, but advised that more information was needed to assess the impact of deferral for various time periods in Europe on the supply of blood products.     Due to the potential exposure to U.K. beef on U.S. military bases in Europe, we recommend that you should indefinitely defer current and former U.S. military personnel, civilian military personnel, and their dependents who were stationed at European bases for 6 months or more during the time periods outlined above.  Based upon information provided by the Department of Defense, we estimate that approximately 1.8% of current U.S. blood donors may be deferred by this recommendation.      Indigenous BSE Exposure Outside the U.K.     BSE in Europe is likely to have originated from infected cattle and cattle feed that were exported from the U.K. to other parts of Europe.  The risk of human exposure to the BSE agent in any country is based upon several factors, including the prevalence of BSE and the presence of control measures to prevent the BSE agent from entering the human food chain.  Control measures include:          active surveillance through testing of slaughtered cattle more than 30 months old for BSE,    exclusion of high-risk material e.g., brain, other neural tissue, lymphoid tissues, intestines from human food,    a ban on human consumption of slaughtered cattle more than 30 months old,    prohibition of mechanically recovered meat,   a ban on mammalian-derived feed for ruminants,    use of certain rendering processes, and    additional herd control and surveillance (Ref. 15).        The timing and degree to which the European countries have implemented such controls has varied (Refs. 15, 32). The current prevalence of BSE in each country is uncertain because active surveillance of the epidemic has not been completely implemented. (Refs. 14, 15, 29, 32).  The Scientific Steering Committee on the Geographical Risk of BSE (SSC GBR) reported that in the United Kingdom and Portugal, the prevalence of BSE is greater than 100 cows/million in cattle over 24 months of age (Ref. 15).  These countries have been categorized as ""Level IV.""  Because of the comparatively high BSE prevalence in Portugal, the TSEAC recommended in January 2001 that donors who have resided in Portugal for 10 years or more between 1980 and the present should be deferred.  The BSE epidemic in Ireland was estimated to be nearly as large in absolute numbers as that in Portugal, although Ireland was classified as ""Level III"" by the SSC GBR.  After limited discussion, the TSEAC, by a narrow margin, recommended deferral of donors who resided in the Republic of Ireland for 10 years or more since 1980.        BSE has been detected in many, but not all, European countries, and the increase or decrease of BSE in many countries is not predictable (Refs. 14, 32).  In addition, food chain control measures (and their enforcement) also vary, and cannot be assured for all time periods in question.  Because of these uncertainties, and the evolving BSE epidemic, donor deferrals on a country-by-country basis are not practical at this time.  FDA therefore has developed a uniform recommendation for donor deferral based on exposure in Europe outside of the U.K.  The highest prevalence of BSE that has been observed in a European country with a strong surveillance program (Switzerland) is approximately 1.5% of the BSE prevalence that was observed for the United Kingdom between 1980 and 1996.  Also, residents in France consumed up to 5% British beef during the epidemic period, and other Europeans, less.  Therefore, the current estimated maximum risk of BSE exposure in Europe is approximately 1.5-5% of that in the United Kingdom.  Assuming a ""worst-case"" relative risk of 5% per day of exposure, a European donor deferral of 5 years (60 months) is equivalent to the new 3-month deferral for cumulative travel or residence in the United Kingdom.  This is the basis for our current recommendation to exclude from transfusion use, blood and blood components from donors with a history of 5 or more years of residence or travel in Europe outside of the U.K.    To date, transmission of vCJD by human blood or plasma has not been demonstrated, and no laboratory or epidemiological studies have demonstrated infectivity of blood from vCJD donors (Ref. 29).  Experimental assays of blood samples from small numbers of vCJD patients showed that abnormal vCJD-associated prion proteins and infectivity  could not be detected, but the tests used were not sensitive enough to detect very low levels of infectious material, if present (Refs. 34, 35).  However, blood from animals experimentally infected with transmissible spongiform encephalopathy (TSE) agents contains low levels of infectivity, and TSE infection, including BSE, has been transmitted by blood in some experiments (Refs. 25, 28, 32, 36-38).   For this reason, the transmission of vCJD by blood components and plasma derivatives is considered a theoretical possibility.  The risk of vCJD transmission by plasma derivatives is based upon the infectivity, if any, of plasma during vCJD infection, the prevalence of vCJD in the donor population, the size of the plasma pool for fractionation, and the removal of vCJD infectivity during the manufacturing process.  Model TSE agents are removed from plasma products by manufacturing steps such as precipitation, depth filtration, and column chromatography (Refs. 36, 39-41).  Additionally, unpublished data provided to FDA suggest that the vCJD agent is similarly reduced by some manufacturing steps.    The relative risks and benefits of excluding plasma donors who have lived or traveled in Europe for 5 years or more have not been established.  In particular, the effect of such a donor deferral upon the supply of life and health-sustaining plasma derivatives has not been determined, but could be significant (Ref. 29).    In contrast to blood, plasma derivatives are highly processed materials.  Considering the estimated low prevalence of vCJD infections in Europe compared to the U.K., the likely ability of plasma fractionation processes to reduce TSE infectivity, and the uncertain effect of a deferral upon the supply of plasma derivatives, we do not recommend that you defer Source Plasma donors who have lived or traveled in Europe for 5 or more years.  However, in consideration of the relatively greater risk of vCJD in persons with exposure to beef products from the U.K., you should not collect Source Plasma and recovered plasma from donors with a history of travel or residence in the U.K., U.S. military bases in Europe, and in France, as described in sections III.A. and III.B.    Consistent with this recommendation, recovered plasma collected prior to deferral, from donors with 5 years or more travel or residence in Europe, is still acceptable for manufacturing of plasma derivatives.  However, in order to prevent possible accidental use of blood and blood components for transfusion, you should not continue to collect recovered plasma from Whole Blood donors who have been deferred for history of European residence.  You may make an exception in the case of plasma or serum donors if they are participating in a CBER approved program that allows collection of plasma or serum solely for use in manufacturing of non-injectable products.  Blood donors who are deferred for history of European travel or residence remain eligible to donate Source Plasma because there is no possibility that such collections will generate blood components for transfusion. However, we believe that recovered plasma collected from these donors after deferral implementation becomes unsuitable, because of the risk that blood and blood components from such donors may inadvertently be transfused.  We will continue to evaluate this recommendation in light of evolving experimental and epidemiological information.     Given these considerations, we recommend that you defer donors of Whole Blood and blood components intended for transfusion, Source Leukocytes, and recovered plasma, but not donors of Source Plasma, who have resided in Europe for a cumulative period of 5 years or more, between 1980 and the present.     NOTE:  We will refer to donor deferrals both for risk of exposure to BSE due to residence in BSE countries, or consumption of British beef products, as ""geographic risk deferrals.""      Theoretical Exposure to vCJD by Transfusion     There are no known cases of vCJD transmission by blood transfusion to humans.  In the U.K., at least 20 people are known to have received blood or blood components from donors who later developed vCJD.  To date, none of these recipients has been diagnosed with vCJD (Ref. 14).  However, BSE has apparently been transmitted from one sheep to another by transfusion (Ref. 28).  Another study suggests that the BSE agent can adapt to primate hosts, thus potentially enhancing the possibility of transfusion transmission of vCJD from a vCJD-incubating donor (Ref. 42).  Therefore, as a preventive measure, you should defer donors who have received transfusions of blood or blood components in the U.K. from 1980 to the present.      Exposure to Bovine Insulin     No cases of transmission of vCJD have been reported in recipients of bovine insulin or other injectable products manufactured in BSE-affected countries.  However, as a safeguard, most material from cattle in BSE countries should not be used in the manufacture of FDA regulated products (59 FR 44591, August 29, 1994).  We are aware that some diabetic patients have imported bovine insulin for personal use.  Additionally, some insulin products legally distributed in the U.S. since 1980 were manufactured from cattle in the United Kingdom.  Therefore, as a preventive measure, you should indefinitely defer blood donors who have injected bovine insulin since 1980, unless you can confirm that the product was not manufactured after 1980 from cattle in the United Kingdom.     Filing Reports of Biological Product Deviations     The biological products deviations rule requires blood establishments to file a report of biological product deviation (BPDR) when the deviation meets the standard set out in 21 CFR 606.171.  If product was distributed, the regulation requires an establishment to report to FDA events that          Occurred while the product was in the establishment's control; and   EITHER represent a deviation from current good manufacturing practice, applicable regulations, applicable standards, or established specifications; OR represent an unexpected or unforeseeable event; and   may affect the safety, purity or potency of that product.      Some establishments have asked questions about BPDR reporting in the context of these donor deferral recommendations.      Example #1: On the first day after implementing new donor criteria, the establishment learns that one of its repeat donors lived for seven years in France between 1981 and 1988.  Should the establishment file a BPDR with respect to units previously collected from that donor, if those units were distributed?    The regulation does not require the establishment to file a BPDR.  At the time of donation, collection from that donor did not represent a deviation from current good manufacturing practice, applicable regulations, applicable standards, or established specifications.  Nor was the collection an unexpected or unforeseeable event.  The agency foresees that establishments will collect donations from such donors until establishments implement the new deferral recommendations.     Example #2:  One year after implementing new donor criteria, the establishment learns that one of its repeat donors lived in France between 1981 and 1988.  The donor donated Source Plasma eight weeks earlier, and whole blood five months earlier.  Despite the donor's unsuitability under the new donor criteria, the establishment accepted those donations.  Should the establishment file a BPDR with respect to those units, if those units were distributed?    The establishment should file a BPDR.  At the time of the donations, collection from that donor represented a deviation from current good manufacturing practice, applicable regulations, applicable standards, or established specifications.      Example #3: Before implementing new donor criteria, the establishment learns that one of its repeat donors has developed CJD or vCJD.  The donor donated whole blood three months earlier, and has a long history of donating.  Should the establishment file a BPDR with respect to units previously collected from that donor, if those units were distributed?     The establishment should file a BPDR.  Collection from that donor represented an unexpected or unforeseeable event that may affect the safety, purity, and potency of the product.  Neither blood establishments nor the agency expect and foresee that establishments will collect donations from individuals with CJD or vCJD.      Definitions     Audio CASI - computer assisted interactive donor questioning program that is accompanied by an audio component.  The donor reads the questions on the computer and hears the questions through a speaker or headphones.    Blood components intended for transfusion - Red Blood Cells, Platelets, Plasma, Cryoprecipitate, or Granulocytes derived from human blood collected by either manual whole blood collection or automated apheresis techniques and intended to be transfused to human recipients.

Source Plasma Donors        Frequent Source Plasma donor - donor who donates more frequently than once every 4 weeks.  These donors must undergo an annual physical examination (21 CFR 640.63(b)) and a Serum Protein Electrophoresis measurement at least every 4 months (21 CFR 640.65(b)(1)).   Infrequent Source Plasma donor - donor who donates less frequently than once every 4 weeks.  These donors meet the Whole Blood donor suitability criteria described in 21 CFR 640.3 and do not need to undergo an annual physical examination or a Serum Protein Electrophoresis measurement.          Table of Contents             RECOMMENDATIONS FOR DONOR DEFERRAL            Recommended Donor Deferral Criteria       Donor deferrals 1-7 are for all donors.  Donor deferral 8 (residence in Europe for 5 years or more between 1980 and the present), is for all donors  with the exception of  donors of Source Plasma.             You should permanently defer donors who have been diagnosed with vCJD or any other form of CJD.         You should permanently defer donors at increased risk for CJD (as identified by questions in section IV.B, Questions 2 and 3). Donors are considered to have an increased risk for CJD if they have received a dura mater transplant, or human pituitary-derived growth hormone.  Donors with one or more blood relatives diagnosed with CJD (as identified in section IV.B., Question 1) are also considered to be at increased risk of CJD, and should be indefinitely deferred  (see section IV.C. for donor reentry recommendations).         You should indefinitely defer donors who have spent three months or more cumulatively in the U.K. from the beginning of 1980 through the end of 1996.         You should indefinitely defer donors who have spent 5 years or more cumulatively in France from 1980 to the present.         You should indefinitely defer former or current U.S. military personnel, civilian military personnel, and their dependents as follows:               individuals who resided at U.S. military bases in Northern Europe (Germany, United Kingdom, Belgium, and the Netherlands) for 6 months or more, from 1980 through 1990 or,          individuals who resided at U.S. military bases elsewhere in Europe (Greece, Turkey, Spain, Portugal, and Italy) for 6 months or more,  from 1980 through 1996.              You should indefinitely defer donors who have received a transfusion of blood or blood components in the U.K. between 1980 and the present.           You should indefinitely defer donors who have injected bovine insulin since 1980, unless you can confirm that the product was not manufactured after 1980 from U.K. cattle.         You should indefinitely defer donors of Whole Blood, blood components for transfusion, and Source Leukocytes, who have lived cumulatively for 5 years or more in Europe from 1980 until the present.   (Note this criterion includes time spent in the U.K. from 1980 through 1996 and time spent in France from 1980 to the present.)  Unless otherwise unsuitable, these donors remain eligible for Source Plasma donation.          NOTE:  Donors who are otherwise deferred based upon the above recommendations 2-8, may continue to donate if they are participating in a CBER-approved program that allows collection of blood components solely for use in manufacturing of non-injectable products.  We recommend special labeling for products obtained from such donors  (see section VII.A.).        Recommended Questions to Identify Donors at an Increased Risk for CJD       You should question frequent Source Plasma donors at the first donation following implementation of the recommendations in this guidance, and annually thereafter.  You should question donors of Whole Blood and blood components, infrequent Source Plasma donors and Source Leukocyte donors at each donation. Question 2 may be asked only once, since pituitary-derived growth hormone is no longer being manufactured or administered. If the donor is not familiar with the term ""Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease,"" you may take that as a negative response.  These questions are similar to those in the November 11, 1999, guidance.  We consider donors who answer “Yes” to any of the questions below to have an increased risk for developing CJD.                     Question 1)     Have any of your blood relatives had Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease?                                   Question 2)     Have you ever received growth hormone made from human pituitary glands?    NOTE: If the donor is uncertain about his or her treatment, the following question describing human pituitary-derived growth hormone injections may be asked:  ""Was the hormone treatment given repeatedly by injection?""  This question only needs to be asked once, since human pituitary growth hormone is no longer available.                                   Question 3)     Have you received a dura mater (or brain covering) graft?    This question may be preceded by the more general, ""Have you ever had brain surgery?""  You need to ask the specific question only if the donor responds ""yes,"" to the general question.                    Recommendations for Donor Reentry After Donor Deferral for Risk of Familial CJD       If you defer a donor because of family history of CJD, you  may reenter that donor if:             The diagnosis of CJD in the family member(s) is confidently excluded, or CJD in the family member(s) is iatrogenic, or the family member(s) is(are) not a blood relative(s); or          Laboratory testing (gene sequencing) shows that the donor does not have a mutation associated with familial CJD.            Recommended Questions for Identifying Donors at Risk for Exposure to BSE              Method of Donor Questioning        Due to the added complexity of screening donors for cumulative periods of potential exposure to BSE, a trained staff member should administer the revised geographic donor deferral criteria by face-to-face interview to each new donor (as defined in your SOP). Instead of face-to-face interviews, you may use a computerized interactive donor interview program that includes an audio component (audio-CASI) (Refs. 43, 44).  You should submit your changes to your donor interview procedure according to 21 CFR 601.12.   For repeat donors, you may use alternative methods for introducing and emphasizing the new questions.  Your alternative method should provide the repeat donor with a detailed description of the changes to the donor questionnaire, to highlight any new questions and modifications.        Timing of Implementation        In order to attenuate the impact of deferrals on the blood supply, you may implement deferrals in two separate phases.  Phase I comprises deferral for cumulative time spent in the U.K. and France, deferral for military employees, and their dependents, and for recipients of transfusion in the U.K.  Phase II comprises deferral of donors of Whole Blood and blood components for transfusion, Source Leukocytes, and other cellular blood components for manufacture into injectable products  (but not Source Plasma) who have traveled to, or lived in, Europe for 5 years or more, between 1980 and the present.  We recommend that you implement Phase I by May 31, 2002, and Phase II by October 31, 2002.         Donor Questions        You should indefinitely defer donors who answer “Yes” to the following questions:                Phase I:  To identify donors with geographic risk of BSE exposure                  Since 1980, have you ever lived in, or traveled to Europe?                     If the donor answers no, you need not take any further action.                             If the donor answers yes, ask the following questions:                         Between 1980 through 1996 did you spend time that adds up to 3 months or more in the U.K. (England, Northern Ireland, Scotland, Wales, the Isle of Man, the Channel Islands, Gibraltar, or the Falkland Islands)?                Since 1980 have you received a transfusion of blood, platelets, plasma, cryoprecipitate, or granulocytes in the U.K. (England, Northern Ireland, Scotland, Wales, the Isle of Man, the Channel Islands, Gibraltar, or the Falkland Islands)?                Since 1980 have you spent time that adds up to 5 years or more in France?                Between 1980 through 1996, were you a member of U.S. military, a civilian military employee or a dependent of a member of the U.S. military?               If the donor answers no, you need not take any further action.               If the donor answers yes, ask the following question:               Did you spend a total time of 6 months or more associated with a military base in any of the following countries:                           From 1980 through 1990 in Belgium, the Netherlands, or Germany.         From 1980 through 1996 in Spain, Portugal, Turkey, Italy, or Greece.                        NOTE:  For Questions 1) and 4), you only need to question donors once, because these questions encompass a discrete time frame. You should administer Questions 2) and 3) to frequent Source Plasma donors at intervals of no greater than 4 months, and to all other donors, at each donation.                                Phase II:  To identify donors who have additional geographic risk of BSE exposure.          For donors of Whole Blood, components intended for transfusion, and Source Leukocytes, you should  substitute  the following for question 3) in Phase I (section IV.D.3.):                                Question )       Since 1980 have you spent time that adds up to 5 years or more in Europe (including time spent in the U.K. from 1980 through 1996)?                              Donors deferred based on this question remain eligible to donate Source Plasma, unless they are otherwise unsuitable.           For Donors of Source Plasma, however, you should  continue to ask  Question 3) from Phase I (section IV.D.3.):                                Question 3)       Since 1980 have you spent time that adds up to 5 years or more in France?                             European countries with BSE risk that FDA has identified as a basis for donor deferral are listed in the Appendix to this document.  We will periodically issue new guidance to update the list of countries with BSE risk, to be used as a basis for donor deferral.                     To identify donors who have been injected with bovine insulin since 1980, you should ask donors with diabetes the following question:                               Question 5)      Since 1980, have you ever injected bovine (beef) insulin?                            Since the above question applies to a subset of potential donors, you may ask it as a secondary question to a general medication question if a donor responds that they have taken insulin.  If the donor answers “yes” or “I don’t know” to the question, you should indefinitely defer that donor, unless it can be documented that the product was not manufactured from cattle in the United Kingdom after 1980.        NOTE: Donors of Whole Blood, blood components, Source Leukocytes, and Source Plasma who otherwise should be indefinitely deferred based on their response to the questions specified in sections IV.D.3., and IV.D.4. may continue to donate if they are participating in a CBER-approved program that allows collection of blood components solely for use in manufacturing of non-injectable products.  We recommend special labeling for products obtained from such donors.  (See section VII.A.)           Table of Contents             POST-DONATION INFORMATION:  RECOMMENDATIONS FOR PRODUCT RETRIEVAL and QUARANTINE, CONSIGNEE NOTIFICATION, AND BIOLOGICAL PRODUCT DEVIATION REPORTING          Whole Blood and Blood Components Intended For Transfusion, Cellular Blood Components Intended For Further Manufacture Into Injectable Products, and Source Plasma From Donors With CJD Or CJD Risk Factors           Product Disposition      If you receive post-donation information about a donor with CJD or CJD risk factors, you should immediately retrieve and quarantine for subsequent destruction all in-date blood components (including Whole Blood, blood components intended for transfusion, Source Leukocytes, and Source Plasma), all in and out-of-date cellular blood components intended for manufacturing into injectable products, and all recovered plasma that are under your control.  You should, within one week of receiving post-donation information, notify all consignees to immediately retrieve and quarantine implicated components for subsequent destruction.      NOTE:  If you have sent Source Plasma or recovered plasma to a consignee and receive post donation information about a donor with CJD or CJD risk factors, at a time when you know the plasma units have been pooled, you should not conduct product retrieval or consignee notification for those units.      Biological Product Deviation Reports      You should file a BPDR (21 CFR 606.171) if the product was distributed.          Whole Blood and Blood Components Intended For Transfusion, Source Leukocytes and Other Cellular Blood Components Intended For Further Manufacture Into Injectable Products, From Donors With Geographic Risk Deferrals and/or Exposure to Bovine Insulin Made in the U.K. Since 1980            Phase I deferrals             Product Disposition        If you receive post donation information about a donor with Phase I geographic risk factors, you should immediately retrieve and quarantine for subsequent destruction all in-date blood components (including Whole Blood, blood components intended for transfusion, and Source Leukocytes), and all in and out-of-date cellular blood components intended for manufacturing into injectable products, that are under your control.  You should, within one week of receiving post-donation information, notify all consignees to immediately retrieve and quarantine implicated components for subsequent destruction.        Biological Product Deviation Reports                Components collected before implementation of donor deferral:         A BPDR is not required.          Components collected after implementation of donor deferral:          You should file a BPDR (21 CFR 606.171) if the product has been distributed.                Phase II deferrals             Product Disposition                Products collected before implementation of donor deferral:          If you receive post donation information about a donor with Phase II geographic risk factors, we do not recommend that you conduct quarantine, retrieval, or consignee notification for products collected before implementation of Phase II donor deferrals.  We make this recommendation based on the low amount of BSE exposure in non-U.K. Europe as a whole, and to mitigate the expected impact upon supply of donor deferrals for 5 years or more residence in Europe.      Products collected after implementation of donor deferral:          If you receive post-donation information about a donor with Phase II geographic deferrals, you should immediately retrieve and quarantine for subsequent destruction all in-date blood components (including Whole Blood, blood components intended for transfusion, and Source Leukocytes), and all in and out-of-date cellular blood components intended for manufacturing into injectable products, that are under your control.  You should, within one week of receiving post-donation information, notify all consignees to immediately retrieve and quarantine implicated components for subsequent destruction.

Donors with exposure to bovine insulin made in the U.K. since 1980             Product Disposition       If you receive post-donation information about a donor exposure to bovine insulin made in the U.K. since 1980, you should immediately retrieve and quarantine for subsequent destruction all in-date blood components (including Whole Blood, blood components intended for transfusion, Source Leukocytes), and all in and out-of-date cellular blood components intended for manufacturing into injectable products, that are under your control.  You should, within one week of receiving post-donation information, notify all consignees to immediately retrieve and quarantine implicated components for subsequent destruction.         Biological Product Deviation Reports       You should file a BPDR (21 CFR 606.171) if the product has been distributed.           Source Plasma and Recovered Plasma from Donors with Geographic Risk Deferrals and/or Exposure to Bovine Insulin Made in the U.K. Since 1980           Product Disposition             Products collected prior to implementation of donor deferral:       We do not recommend quarantine, retrieval, or consignee notification if components were collected before donor deferral implementation.        Products collected after implementation of donor deferral:       If you receive post-donation information about a donor with geographic risk factors, or exposure to bovine insulin made in the U.K. since 1980, you should immediately retrieve and quarantine for subsequent destruction all in-date Source Plasma and all recovered plasma under your control.  You should, within one week of receiving post-donation information, notify all consignees to immediately retrieve and quarantine implicated components for subsequent destruction.       NOTE: If you have sent Source Plasma or recovered plasma to a consignee and receive post donation information about a donor with geographic risk factors, or exposure to bovine insulin from the U.K. at a time when you know the plasma units have been pooled, you should not conduct product retrieval or consignee notification for those units.           Biological Product Deviation Reports             Components collected prior to implementation of donor deferral:       A BPDR is not required.        Components collected after implementation of donor deferral       You should file a BPDR (21 CFR 606.171) if the product has been distributed.            Whole Blood and Blood Components Intended For Transfusion, Recovered Plasma, Source Leukocytes, Other Cellular Blood Components Intended For Manufacturing Into Injectable Products, and Source Plasma From Donors With vCJD, Suspected vCJD, or CJD Diagnosis and Age <55 Years           Product Disposition     If you receive post-donation information about a donor with vCJD, suspected vCJD, or CJD diagnosis and age <55 years, you should immediately retrieve and quarantine for subsequent destruction, all in-date blood components (including Whole Blood, blood components intended for transfusion, Source Leukocytes, and Source Plasma), all recovered plasma, and all in and out-of-date cellular blood components intended for manufacturing into injectable products, that are under your control.  You should, within one week of receiving post-donation information, notify all consignees to immediately retrieve and quarantine implicated components, for subsequent destruction.     You may save the collected material for use in research on vCJD by qualified laboratories (see section VII.A. for labeling recommendations).        Biological Product Deviation Reports     The regulations require you to file a BPDR as soon as possible and in no event later than 45 calendar days after you discover the event (21 CFR 606.171(c)).  We request that you notify the FDA as soon as possible, and do not wait 45 days, about events involving the collection of donations from donors later diagnosed with vCJD or suspected vCJD.  FDA will respond to telephone inquiries (301) 827-6190, in order to facilitate speedy notifications.  We intend to consult with the CJD Surveillance Unit of the Division of Viral and Rickettsial Diseases of the CDC, (404) 639-3091, in the event that we receive a report of a donor with vCJD or suspected vCJD.        Plasma Derivatives           Plasma derivatives from donors with CJD or CJD risk factors, or geographic risk deferrals (as defined in section IV.D.):     We are not recommending that you withdraw pooled plasma, intermediates, and plasma derivatives manufactured from these donors.       Plasma derivatives from donors diagnosed with vCJD, or suspected vCJD             Product Disposition       If you receive post-donation information about a donor with vCJD or suspected vCJD, you should immediately retrieve and quarantine for subsequent destruction any pooled plasma, intermediates, derivatives, and any other material containing plasma from such a donor.  Alternatively, you may save the material for use in research on vCJD by qualified laboratories (see section VII.A. for labeling recommendations).  You should not use such material for non-injectable products.        You should, within a week of receiving a post-donation report of vCJD or suspected vCJD diagnosis, notify all consignees to immediately retrieve and quarantine for subsequent destruction pooled plasma, intermediates, and derivatives, and any other materials containing plasma from the vCJD donor.           Biological Product Deviation Reports       The regulations require you to file a BPDR as soon as possible and in no event later than 45 calendar days after you discover the event (21 CFR 606.171(c)).  We request that you notify the FDA as soon as possible, and do not wait 45 days, about events involving the collection of donations from donors later diagnosed with vCJD or suspected vCJD.  FDA will respond to telephone inquiries (301) 827-6190, in order to facilitate speedy notifications.   We intend to consult with the CJD Surveillance Unit of the Division of Viral and Rickettsial Diseases of the CDC, (404) 639-3091, in the event that we receive a report of a donor with vCJD or suspected vCJD.           Plasma derivatives from donors with a physician’s clinical or pathological diagnosis of CJD and age less than 55 years:             Product Disposition       We will make recommendations to quarantine and withdraw plasma derivatives from such donors on a case-by-case basis, depending upon results of the investigation.  We may recommend quarantine and withdrawal of products if available information is ambiguous, and does not clearly eliminate the possibility of vCJD.  You should treat quarantined and withdrawn material from such donors in the same manner as for vCJD (see section V.D.).         Biological Product Deviation Reports       The regulations require you to file a BPDR as soon as possible and in no event later than 45 calendar days after you discover the event (21 CFR 606.171(c)).  We request that you notify the FDA as soon as possible, and do not wait 45 days, about events involving the use of material from donors with CJD diagnosis and age <55.  FDA will respond to telephone inquiries (301) 827-6190, in order to facilitate speedy notifications.  We intend to consult with the CJD Surveillance Unit of the Division of Viral and Rickettsial Diseases of the CDC, (404) 639-3091, in the event that we receive a report of a donor with CJD diagnosis and age <55.              Disposal of Retrieved and Quarantined Products     TSE agents are quite resistant to most disinfecting regimens.  There is no current consensus on specific details of decontamination requirements for blood products.  However, methods of destruction of TSE-implicated material include steam autoclaving at 132°C for 1-4 hours, incineration, or treatment with 1 N NaOH or concentrated sodium hypochlorite for at least 1 hour.  These treatments are known to diminish (but may not completely eliminate) infectivity (Refs. 45-49).      You may save blood components and plasma derivatives from donors with vCJD, or which have been withdrawn because the donor might have vCJD, to use in research on vCJD by qualified laboratories (see section VII.A. for labeling recommendations).       Table of Contents                RECOMMENDATIONS FOR RECIPIENT TRACING AND NOTIFICATION     It may be appropriate to identify blood components for transfusion prepared from prior collections from any donor found to have CJD, vCJD, suspected vCJD, risk factors for CJD, or if withdrawal is recommended in cases under investigation for vCJD (CJD diagnosis and age <55).  In those situations, consignee notification could enable the consignee to inform the physician, or other qualified personnel responsible for the care of the recipients, so that recipient tracing and medically appropriate notification and counseling may be performed at the discretion of health care providers.     For transfusible components from a donor with one family member diagnosed with CJD, or with risk factors for vCJD (due to geographic risk deferral, transfusion in the U.K. between 1980 and the present, or due to injection of bovine insulin), we believe it is not appropriate to conduct tracing and notification of recipients of prior donations.     It may be appropriate to identify plasma derivatives prepared from prior collections from any donor found to have vCJD, suspected vCJD, or if withdrawal is recommended in cases under investigation for vCJD (CJD diagnosis and age <55).  In those situations, consignee notification could enable the consignee to inform the physician, or other qualified personnel responsible for the care of the recipients, so that recipient tracing and medically appropriate notification and counseling may be performed at the discretion of health care providers.     Table of Contents             LABELING RECOMMENDATIONS           Labeling of Blood and Blood Components from Deferred Donors for Research, or Intended for Further Manufacture into Non-Injectable Products       You should label blood and blood components from donors with CJD, who are at increased risk for CJD, or who have potential exposure to the agent of vCJD with the following statements:             ""Biohazard"";        ""Collected from a donor determined to be at risk for CJD""; or ""Collected from a donor diagnosed with CJD""; or ""Collected from a donor with potential risk of exposure to variant CJD""; and        ""Caution: For laboratory research use only""; or ""Caution: For use in manufacturing non-injectable products only.""          You should not use blood or blood components from donors diagnosed with vCJD for further manufacture into non-injectable products.  However blood components and plasma derivatives from donors with vCJD, suspected vCJD, or which have been withdrawn on a case-by-case basis for suspicion of vCJD, may be used in laboratory research on vCJD by qualified laboratories.  You should label these products with the following statements:              ""Biohazard"";        ""Collected from a donor with variant CJD""; and        ""Caution: Only for laboratory research on variant CJD"".           Labeling of Non-Implicated Products       No transmission of CJD or vCJD by human blood, blood components or plasma derivatives has been documented to date.  However, as a prudent notice, we recommend that all blood, blood components and plasma-derived products include labeling to address the theoretical risk.  Because albumin has never been known to transmit viral diseases, and because laboratory experiments suggest that albumin is less likely to contain CJD-like agents than other plasma fractions, the package insert for albumin, and products containing albumin, may contain a more specific statement.             For Whole Blood and blood components intended for transfusion, the Circular of Information should be revised to include under ""Side Effects and Hazards,"" the following statement:             ""Because this product is made from human blood, it may carry a risk of transmitting infectious agents, e.g., viruses, and theoretically, the Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) agent.""              Until the circular is revised, you may insert or attach this statement to the current circular.         For plasma-derived products other than albumin, you should revise the package insert warning section to include the following statement:            ""Because this product is made from human blood, it may carry a risk of transmitting infectious agents, e.g., viruses, and theoretically, the Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) agent.""             For plasma-derived albumin, you should revise the package insert warning section to include the following statement:             ""Albumin is a derivative of human blood.  Based on effective donor screening and product manufacturing processes, it carries an extremely remote risk for transmission of viral diseases.  A theoretical risk for transmission of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) also is considered extremely remote.  No cases of transmission of viral diseases or CJD have ever been identified for albumin.""             For products containing plasma-derived albumin, you should revise the package insert warning section to include the following statement:             ""This product contains albumin, a derivative of human blood. Based on effective donor screening and product manufacturing processes, it carries an extremely remote risk for transmission of viral diseases.  A theoretical risk for transmission of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) also is considered extremely remote.  No cases of transmission of viral diseases or CJD have ever been identified for albumin.""                Table of Contents             IMPLEMENTATION OF RECOMMENDATIONS     We recommend that you implement, by May 31, 2002, all recommendations contained in this guidance including labeling, with the exception of the Phase II deferral, described in section IV.D.3. (deferral of donors who have lived in Europe for five years or more, 1980 - present).     We recommend that you implement, by October 31, 2002, the Phase II deferral (section IV.D.3.).     You may implement these changes without prior approval from the agency.  Licensed blood establishments should report the changes to FDA in the following manner:          Report changes in your donor questionnaire in your annual report (21 CFR 601.12(d)).      Submit labeling changes as a Changes Being Effected supplement (21 CFR 601.12(f)(2)).          Table of Contents             PILOT PROGRAMS TO ASSESS THE IMPACT OF GEOGRAPHIC DONOR DEFERRALS THAT ARE MORE STRINGENT THAN THOSE RECOMMENDED BY THIS GUIDANCE      A more stringent geographic donor deferral policy (deferral for a cumulative period of 6 months or more in Europe since 1980 or a cumulative period of 3 months or more in the United Kingdom since 1980) was proposed as an initiative in early 2001 by a member of the blood industry.  Based upon the BSE geographic relative risk model proposed by the FDA and CDC and reviewed by the TSEAC (Ref. 30), both the industry-proposed and FDA-proposed deferrals result in an estimated one-log reduction of theoretical risk (Ref. 30).  Importantly, the donor loss for the industry proposal, if implemented on a national basis, is estimated by FDA to be at least 8-9% (3-4% higher then the FDA-recommended policy).       In response to this industry initiative, some blood establishments may wish to implement geographic donor deferrals that are more stringent than the FDA-recommended policy.  We are concerned that blood availability may be more severely affected by more stringent periods of deferral than those outlined by this draft guidance.  If you wish to implement donor deferrals other than those recommended in this guidance, you should undertake such pilot programs only as a part of a carefully structured plan that includes the following elements:          Prior to implementation:             Demonstrate an augmented donor recruitment program sufficient to offset projected donor losses,     Define an endpoint (or stopping rules) for the pilot program at which time deferral policy will be determined or an additional pilot period will be implemented,    Define a contingency plan for maintaining blood supplies in the event that local recruitment efforts are insufficient to meet patient demand, and         During the pilot period:            Monitor the loss of donors, the nature and effectiveness of donor recruitment efforts, and fluctuations in hospital demand for blood products.

................................................................................................... 9-17  Page 4   ICH eCTD Specification V 2.0 February 12, 2002  ICH eCTD Specification Introduction The ICH M4 Expert Working Group (EWG) has defined the Common Technical Document (CTD). The ICH M2 EWG has defined, in the current document, the specification for the Electronic Common Technical Document (eCTD). The eCTD is defined as an interface for industry to Agency transfer of regulatory information while at the same time taking into consideration the facilitation of the creation, review, lifecycle management and archival of the electronic submission. The eCTD specification lists the criteria that will make an electronic submission technically valid. The focus of the specification is to provide the ability to transfer the registration application electronically from industry to a regulatory authority. Industry to industry and Agency to Agency transfer is not addressed. The specification is divided into a series of main sections followed by a number of appendices in which detailed technical specifications are given. It will provide a mechanism whereby parts of the specification will be updated or adjusted to agreed new technologies or standards on an independent basis without the necessity of updating it all. This aspect will be covered in the chapter Change Control.  Background The specification for the eCTD is based upon content defined within the CTD issued by the ICH M4 EWG. The CTD describes the organization of modules, sections and documents. The structure and level of detail specified in the CTD has been used as the basis for defining the eCTD structure and content but where appropriate, additional details have been developed within the eCTD specification. The philosophy of the eCTD is to utilize open standards. Open standards, including proprietary standards, which through their widespread usage can be considered de facto standards, are deemed to be appropriate in general.  Scope The CTD as defined by the M4 EWG does not cover the full submission that is to be made in a region. It describes only modules 2 to 5, which are common across all regions. It does not describe the content of module 1 the Regional Administrative Information and Prescribing Information nor does it describe documents that can be submitted as amendments or variations to the initial application. The value of production of a specification for the creation of an electronic submission based only upon the modules described in the CTD would be limited. Therefore, the M2 EWG has produced a specification for the eCTD that is applicable to all modules of initial registration applications and for other submissions of information throughout the lifecycle of the product, such as variations and amendments. This document describes the parts of the registration application that are common to all regions and some of the lifecycle requirements for products. The parts of the registration Page 5   ICH eCTD Specification V 2.0 February 12, 2002 application that are specific to a region will be covered by regional guidance. However, the backbone has been developed to handle both the regional and common parts of submissions.  Requirements The specification is designed to support high-level functional requirements such as the following:       Copy and paste Viewing and printing of documents Annotation of documentation Facilitate the exporting of information to databases Searching within and across applications Navigation throughout the eCTD and its subsequent amendments/variations  Change Control Introduction The specification for the eCTD is likely to change with time. Factors that could affect the content of the specification include, but are not limited to:  Change in the content of the CTD, either through the amendment of information, at the same level of detail, or by provision of more detailed definition of content and structure  Change to the regional requirements for applications that are outside the scope of the CTD  Updating of standards that are already in use within the eCTD  Identification of new standards that provide additional value for the creation and/or usage of the eCTD  Identification of new functional requirements  Experience of use of the eCTD by all parties The first specification for an eCTD is an ICH M2 Step 4 document. The Specification includes an appendix for the modules of the CTD. Each appendix consists of (or includes) detailed information for the structure and format to be used in preparing a CTD module. It is understood that technology will continue to evolve at a rapid pace. There could also be changes to the CTD. Information technology capabilities and requirements will also evolve in the pharmaceutical industry and in the regulatory authorities. The change control process described in this section allows the eCTD Specification to be updated to meet new requirements and to take advantage of technology improvements. Each appendix should be updated as needed, independent of the remainder of the document.  Page 6   ICH eCTD Specification V 2.0 February 12, 2002 Process The eCTD Specification Change Control Board (CCB) is authorized by the ICH Steering Committee to make changes to the eCTD Specification to keep pace with advancing technology. Since the issuance of guidelines is the responsibility of the regulatory authorities, in line with the standards ICH process, the regulatory authorities are the voting members of the CCB. Industry representatives from each of the three regions, and Health Canada as observer, are non-voting members of the CCB. The position of chair of the CCB rotates on an annual basis among the regulatory authority members. The three regulatory authorities represented in the ICH M2 Expert Working Group are responsible for initiating changes to the eCTD Specification, based on industry or regulatory input. A change can be proposed by any of the regulatory authorities. A group or individual, not a member of an ICH regulatory authority, can propose a change to the specification, including recommendation for experts to be invited, by submitting the proposal to one of the regional regulatory authorities. The CCB meets on a regular schedule to discuss, evaluate and agree on proposed changes to the specification. During these meetings the members of the CCB and other invited parties evaluate the proposed changes. The decision to accept a change to the eCTD Specification is made by a unanimous vote of the regulatory authority representatives. The agreed changes to the specification will be published for public comment in each region. Comments are collected and considered by the CCB and will be adopted in modified or unmodified form or rejected. The updated part of the eCTD Specification will be agreed upon and signed by the three regional regulatory authorities, and will be published as required in each region. The planned implementation date and transition period for each change in each region is included in the published description of the change. Adopted changes will normally be published on an annual basis except for emergency changes, e.g. an error in critical meta-data, as defined by the CCB which will be published immediately upon adoption. The CCB will provide guidance that will indicate how existing submissions and those currently undergoing late stage-compilation should be updated. Regulatory authorities will support submissions described by at least two consecutive versions of the eCTD Specification. The regulatory authority intends to keep all versions of the specification as long as needed to process eCTD submissions that are on file with a regulatory authority. The CCB will establish its meeting schedule at the first meeting of the CCB. The first meeting will be at the same time as the ICH Steering Committee. Procedure Change requests should be submitted to a regulatory authority. Change requests received at least 30 days before a scheduled CCB meeting will be placed on the agenda for that  Page 7   ICH eCTD Specification V 2.0 February 12, 2002 meeting. Change requests received less than 30 days before a CCB meeting will be placed on the agenda for the following meeting. Change requests should contain as much of the following information as possible:     A description of the problem that the change is intended to solve. The proposed solution(s)  this consists of a description of the solution(s) and the text of the changes to affected documents. A detailed description of any testing or research that was done to support the solution(s) being proposed. Advice on backward compatibility issues, if any.  The CCB will maintain a public list of requests and the status of each request. New change requests will be posted to the list within 30 days of their receipt.  Approach to Documentation and Use of the eCTD Specification The approach to the management of the specification for the eCTD is to divide the documentation into a series of independent but related appendices. This will facilitate the maintenance of the specification, as it will not require that all documentation be updated even for a small change to one part of the specification. Each appendix can be updated independently as and when required, thus being able to more readily support the currency of the specification as a whole.  Page 8   Appendix 1 Overall Architecture Guiding Design Principles This appendix defines the basic principles that drove the design and architecture of the eCTD. Detailed specifications are defined in appendices 2 and 6.  Business Model The business process to be supported can be described as follow: Industry <-----> Message <------> Agency The business process defines specific requirements for the message. The primary focus of the eCTD is to provide a data interchange message between the industry and agencies. The industry initiates the process by creating the initial submission in terms of an electronic CTD. Throughout the lifecycle of this process, additional information will be submitted to update or modify the information contained in the initial submission e.g. supplement, amendment, variation etc. The agency can submit acknowledgements, queries and requests to the industry. These are considered simple messages utilizing electronic mail or other transport formats. The overall architecture of the eCTD is designed to provide a commonly agreed upon submission and submission structure that imposes minimal restriction to the industry and agencies.  Modular Structure of the eCTD The structure of the electronic submission in terms of organization and navigation should be consistent with the modular structure of the Common Technical Document. The goal of this design principle is to standardize the electronic format of the common parts of the eCTD.  XML Based eCTD The XML eCTD DTD (Document Type Definition) defines the overall structure of the submission. The purpose of the XML backbone is two-fold: (1) to manage meta-data for the entire submission and each document within the submission and (2) to constitute a comprehensive table of contents and provide corresponding navigation aids. Meta-data on submission level includes information about submitting and receiving organization, manufacturer, publisher, ID and kind of the submission, and related data items. Examples for meta-data on document level are versioning information, language, descriptive information such as document names, checksums, etc. Details are defined in appendix 6. The XML instance of any submission should be created and validated according to the XML eCTD DTD as defined in appendix 8. The XML eCTD DTD describes the hierarchical structure according to the CTD as defined by the ICH M4 expert working group. It includes multiple hierarchical levels depending on the specific module as defined in the CTD. The actual submission can Page 1-1   include more hierarchical levels below those defined in the CTD. The XML eCTD instance covers the entire submission including all hierarchical levels and includes references to each individual file. The submission should include a style sheet that supports presentation of the XML instance, navigation according to the table of contents and provides access to all documents within the submission. A standard style sheet is defined and provided by the ICH M2 EWG. Presentation and navigation via other style sheets on the receiving side should be possible. The XML eCTD DTD includes a reference for each document to the physical file within the folder structure. The XML eCTD DTD includes attributes for descriptive names of folders and documents.  Multiple Region Support The scope of each submission is global according to the Common Technical Document, meaning that modules 2 through 5 of a submission are intended for all regions with the exception of selected documents (e.g. in the quality module), which have a regional scope. Module 1 of a submission is regional in nature. The DTD as defined by the ICH M2 expert working group specifies the structure of the common parts of the eCTD primarily focusing in module 2 through 5. It allows linking to regional DTDs for module 1 which will be defined by the authorities in each region.  Lifecycle Management The applicant creates a submission that is stored in a local repository. The applicant submits the initial submission to the agency, which imports the submission into another local repository. The nature and kind of the local repositories is not within the scope of the eCTD. The initial submission should be self-contained meaning that it includes all documents and no references to other submissions. Regional guidance should be consulted if references to other submissions are needed. Following the initial submission, the applicant can submit incremental updates such as amendments and variations. Updates can refer to documents in the previous submissions. Updates should be designed in a way that they can be loaded into the repository by fully preserving the initial or previous submission via version control. The XML backbone should include meta-data identifying the update and providing navigation aids to filter for different submission types. It is preferred that when a Common Technical Document is submitted electronically, the entire submission should be in electronic form with the exception of certain regional forms that currently require written signatures. See appendix 5 for regional requirements. See appendix 6 for a description of how to submit a CTD containing both paper and electronic components.  Page 1-2   Appendix 2 The eCTD Submission Introduction This appendix specifies the Information Technology aspect of the eCTD Submission. Informally, the eCTD Submission is a directory structure with files including the XML eCTD instance, reports, data and other submission information. The eCTD Submission supports multilingual and multi-region aspects.  The eCTD Submission An eCTD Submission is a collection of data objects that follows the eCTD Specification. The main function of the eCTD Submission is data exchange. Information systems would have to be created to process the eCTD Submission. The biggest benefits are expected when the eCTD Submission is loaded into an information system that supports the review process. However, one can view an eCTD Submission with a web browser as it is web ready. In the web environment, the eCTD Submission should be usable without processing in at least in the following ways:  Standalone: Viewable with a web browser.  Network: Loadable into a web server. The eCTD Submission is composed of the following:  Directory Structure  XML eCTD instance  Content files Directory Structure The directory structure is a structure of directories and files. There should be a reasonable maximum number of entries (directories and files) per directory. The directory structure should follow the rules below. The files could be in several formats as specified of below. The name of the files and directories are identifiers. They should be short. The file names are not intended to convey meta-data, though some meaning in the names helps; i.e., no random names. Names for directories and files are recommended in Appendix 4. Any directory names and file names that are added to the eCTD submission by the applicant should be descriptive and logical. XML eCTD Instance The instance is in the submission sequence number directory (see appendix 6). The submission sequence number directory should contain at least two files and one or more directories. One of the files in the submission sequence directory is the instance and the other is the MD5 checksum of the instance. The instance is the starting file for the processing by an XML processor. Page 2-1   The intention is to have links from the instance to leaf files in the eCTD submission as opposed to creating a single XML document that contains the entire eCTD submission. The instance should contain mostly linking facilities to the leaf files. The instance also contains meta-data at the leaf level.  eCTD Template The ICH web site includes an eCTD Template that is an empty directory structure with a recommended style sheet. It is an illustration of an eCTD Submission and it is ready to be populated with the applicant data. Appendix 4 defines the directories used to create this template.  Logical Documents and Files A logical document is comprised of one or more CTD table of contents sections that together contain the minimum amount of information to be exchanged. In general, the XML eCTD DTD maps explicitly to the CTD table of contents, but there are exceptions where the XML eCTD DTD maps to the level of use designated by the appropriate ICH CTD Implementation Working Group (IWG) instead. Ideally, a logical document consists of a single physical file. In the event the physical file exceeds the recommended maximum file size due to graphics, data content, scanned images, or other large format content, additional files may make up the logical document. Furthermore, if the logical document consists of multiple file formats, then more than one physical file would be needed. An example of such a case would be PDF and XML data that together represent the logical document.  Formats Formats should be readable at least for as long as it is needed for the This process could be very long; e.g. 50 years. This points to neutral standard, industrial standard, vendor independent, text-like, etc. The adapted to the type of data. Appendix 7 describes the way in which constructed. regulatory process. formats: formal format should be these files should be  The list of agreed formats will be updated as technology evolves and new requirements arise. XML will be the preferred format for all types of data.  Common Formats The common formats that can be included in an eCTD Submission are:  Narrative: Portable Document Format (PDF)  Structured: Extensible Markup Language (XML)  Graphic: Whenever possible, use PDF. When appropriate or when PDF is not possible, use Joint Photographic Experts Group (JPEG), Portable Network Graphics (PNG), Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) and Graphics Interchange Format (GIF). Special formats for very high resolutions may be appropriate on a case-by-case basis.  Regional Use of Other Formats Regulatory authorities and applicants could agree to use other formats regionally; i.e., Page 2-2   non-common formats or uses of the common formats in a different way from above. The use of other formats is discouraged and the intention is to use as much as possible the common formats. The intention of the use of other formats is for transition. There are two classes of transitions:  Legacy Transition: from the past to the present; i.e., old formats to present formats.  Future Transition: from the present to the future; i.e., from present formats to new formats. The new formats would normally be candidates for common formats.  Links Links among objects in the eCTD Submission should be relative. The intention is to make the eCTD submission self-contained. All literature references introduced by the applicant should be included in the submission, for secondary references (references to a reference), absolute links to external objects can be used. One can always point to a file. The capacity to point to a specific location within a file depends on the linking technology. Different formats allow for the use of different linking technology. See Appendix 7.  Presentation Presentation is closely associated with formats. To associate a style sheet with a file usually one has to use a linking technology. The linking between style sheet (that could be in a separate file) and a data file should be relative. In addition, there is the dimension of media. One file could have several style sheets; the one used depends on the media. For example, there could be one presentation for the screen and another for paper.  Checksums The eCTD Submission should contain checksums for each individual file including a checksum file for the eCTD XML instance. Initially, the MD5 Message-Digest Algorithm (MD5) should be used for this purpose. Including a checksum for each individual file provides a number of benefits including:  The integrity of each file can be verified by comparing the checksum submitted with the file and the computed checksum.  The checksum can be used to verify that the file has not been altered in the historical archive of the regulatory authority. This is especially useful as the files are migrated from one storage medium to another, as in the case of backup to magnetic tape storage.  Element to file directory mapping Follow    these rules: The rules below for the file and directories take precedence. Add the corresponding extension to the file. If needed, use a reasonable abbreviation.  Page 2-3   File extension All files should have one and only one file extension. The file extension should be used to indicate the format of the file. For example: hello.pdf hello.rtf PDF RTF  The mapping between formats and extensions are: IANA nomenclature text/css text/html text/xml application/pdf application/rtf application/vnd.ms-excel image/jpeg image/png image/gif Non IANA nomenclature DTD XPT (SAS) XSL css html or htm xml pdf rtf xls jpg png gif dtd xpt xsl  The eCTD Submission could use formats not registered with the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA). The presence of a format in this list does not imply that it would be considered an acceptable format. For formats absent from this list, widely used mapping between the formats and the extensions should be used. Future direction: if a mechanism (e.g., standard) becomes available that associate the formats with file extension, it should be considered for this specification.  Name Name is a token composed of the following characters:  Letters ""a"" to ""z [U+0061 to U+007A].  Digits ""0"" to ""9"" [U+0030 to U+0039].  ""-"" [HYPHEN-MINUS, U+002D]. The notation ""U+"" refers to the Unicode [UNICODE] notation. Correct Names (only the name without the extension): part-b myfile Page 2-4   hello Incorrect names (only the name without the extension): part a (' ' ; SPACE is not allowed) myfile.xml ('.' ; FULL STOP is not allowed) hello:pdf (':' ; COLON is not allowed) part_a (`_', LOW LINE is not allowed) Directory name is a name. File name is one name followed by one name separated by a '.' (FULL STOP, U+002E). Correct file names (with the extension): myfile.pdf hello.cml Incorrect file names (with the extension):: a part.pdf (' ' ; SPACE is not allowed) hello (missing extension) hello:xml (':' ; COLON is not allowed) The maximum length of a directory name or a file name is 64 characters. Only lower case letters should be used in all file and directory names. The maximum length of a path is 256 characters. For example, ""data/module_1/introduction.html"" is the path; ""introduction.html"" is a File Name. Document Name is the first Name in the File Name. For example, ""docname"" in the file name ""docname.ext"".  Character encoding The character encoding (charset) in order of preference is:  Unicode UTF-8, Unicode 16 bits [ISO-10646].  ISO-8859-1 (Latin-1) or appropriate ISO-8859-x; e.g., ISO-8859-7 for Greek.  The appropriate SHIFT_JIS.  Other character encoding agreed upon regionally by the regulatory authority and applicant.

There should also be consistency in the way navigation aids are provided. Within each document, bookmarks and hypertext links from the table of contents should be provided to all tables, figures, publications, and appendices. Hypertext links should be provided throughout the body of these documents to aid efficient navigation to annotations, related sections, publications, appendices, tables, and figures that are not located on the same page. If a list of references is included at the end of a document, there should be hypertext links to the appropriate publication. Documents should be generated from electronic source documents and not from scanned material, except where access to the source electronic file is not available or where a signature is required.  Folder and File Naming Conventions A folder and file organization is presented in this specification. This could be used in most cases, however applicants may modify this specification where appropriate.1 For example, to include an additional folder for information where an appropriate folder name is not available in the eCTD specification. It is recommended that applicants maintain folder names listed in this specification. This should not be interpreted to mean that the actual eCTD XML DTD should be changed or altered in any way. The maximum length of a folder or file name is 64 characters including the extension. Folder or file names should be written in lower case only. All files should have one and only one file extension. The file extension should be used to indicate the format of the file. More details on the naming conventions are given in appendix 2, and examples in appendix 4. Typically, the file name would be the applicant's internal numbering or naming convention for the studies. The following table gives an example how files could be named.  Regulatory authorities should be notified of additions and changes to the folder structure according to regional guidance.  1  Page 3-1   Table 3-1 Description Study Report 1 Study Report 2 ... Study Report n File Name study-report-1.pdf study-report-2.pdf ... study-report-n.pdf  Data listings can be included as part of a study report document or as a separate appendix. An example of such file names follows. Table 3-2 Description Study Report 1 Study Report 1 Data Study Report 2 Study Report 2 Data ... Study Report n Study Report n Data File Name study-report-1.pdf study-report-1-data.pdf study-report-2.pdf study-report-2-data.pdf ... study-report-n.pdf study-report-n-data.pdf  Regional requirements can provide for the submission of the data listings as a data file. Reference should be made to regional guidances.  Screenshots and folder hierarchy Screenshots are provided in the following chapters for all modules down to the level of hierarchy as described in this appendix. The representations are in alphabetical order due to the nature of the computer operating system and are therefore not entirely consistent with the sequence of the CTD. In a web browser the content will appear in the order of the CTD table of contents. Detailed options on the folders and files are provided in appendix 4 in case the applicant chooses to submit more granular documents. It is not mandatory to use the full folder hierarchy. Empty directories can be omitted.  Page 3-2   Module 1 Administrative Information and Prescribing Information The name of the folder for module 1 should be module-1. This module contains administrative information that is unique for each region. Regional guidance will provide the specific instructions on how to provide the administrative forms and detailed prescribing information. Please refer to appendix 5 when preparing module 1.

Region specific information: Module 1 This module contains administrative information that is unique for each region. There will be local requirements for both the content and electronic component of module 1. The eCTD backbone was developed to allow the transfer of this regional information to be included in a regulatory dossier. Regional guidance will provide the specific instructions on how to provide the administrative forms and detailed prescribing information. Please refer to this information and appendix 6 when preparing module 1. Module 1 includes all administrative documents (e.g., forms and certifications) and labeling, including the documents described in regional guidance. Not all regionally specific documents are included in module 1. Technical reports required for a specific region should be placed in modules 2 to 5. These reports should be included in the module most appropriate for the content of the information provided. Each region provides specific guidance on the format and content of the regional requirements of each module. The Table 5-1 provides contact information for each region.

Information needed to send physical media to each regulatory authority is found at the reference location in Table 5-2. Table 5-2 Regulatory Authority EMEA, European Union Or national agencies Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare, Japan Food and Drug Administration, United States of America Health Canada, Health Protection Branch, Canada Reference location http://www.eudra.org/ http://heads.medagencies.org http://www.mhlw.go.jp http://www.nihs.go.jp http://www.fda.gov/ http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/hpb-dgps/therapeut  Media Regulatory authorities are prepared to accept electronic submissions provided on the media listed in Table 5-3. To optimize processing efficiency, we recommend choosing media with a capacity most appropriate to the size of the submission. Whenever possible, applicants should choose media capable of holding the submission on the fewest number of units. For example for a submission that has a size of 50 Megabytes, use 1 CD-ROM instead of 50 floppy disks. Table 5-3 Example Size of Submission Less than 1.4 MB Less than 10 MB Less than 650 MB Less than 7 GB Recommendations for Media Media and format 3.5 inch DOS Formatted Floppy Disks 3.5 inch DOS Formatted Floppy Disks CD-ROM ISO 9660  Joliet CD-ROM ISO 9660 - Joliet Regulatory Authority EU USA EU, Japan Japan, USA, Canada USA EU, Canada  Greater than 7 GB Digital Tape  Compaq DLT 20/40 and 10/20 GB format using NT server 4.0 with NT backup or BackupExec More than 650 MB DVD  Cover letter Applicants should provide a cover letter as a PDF file (cover.pdf). A paper cover letter should also be included with non-electronic portions of the submission (such as forms with signatures or seals, and certifications). The cover letter should include:  Page 5-2          A description of the submission including appropriate regulatory information. A listing of the sections of the submission filed as paper, electronic, or both paper and electronic. A description of the electronic submission including type and number of electronic media, approximate size of the submission, and, if appropriate, format used for DLT tapes. A statement that the submission is virus free with a description of the software used to check the files for viruses. The printed contents of the index-md5.txt file as an appendix. The regulatory and information technology points of contact for the submission.  Preparing the media CD-ROMs should be packaged carefully to ensure that they arrive in a usable condition. Particularly vulnerable are diskettes and CD-ROM jewel cases shipped in envelopes without bubble-type protective material or stiff backing. The use of a jiffy-type bag by itself to ship media will not provide adequate protection for shipping electronic media.  Transport Secure data exchange over the Internet is the recommended means for transporting submissions. However, until the regulatory authorities can develop secure electronic gateways, submissions should continue to be physically transported by courier or registered mail.  Security An MD5 checksum should be included for each physical file in the eCTD. The checksum allows the recipient to verify integrity of the physical files in the submission. The XML eCTD DTD provides the location of the files and a tag name contains the checksums. A checksum of the XML eCTD instance should be included. Applicants should name this checksum file index-md5.txt and include it as a file in the same directory as the XML eCTD instance. Applicants should print the contents of the index-md5.txt file and include the paper copy with the paper cover letter for the submission. An applicant can provide the eCTD as an encrypted file in accordance with the ICH M2 Recommendation 4.1, if the regulatory body has implemented it. This solution allows the eCTD to be encrypted and transferred over the Internet (if Internet receipt is implemented regionally) or to be encrypted on one of the approved physical media standards. The purpose of encryption is to protect the privacy of the confidential information and to insure it is only available to the authorized receiver. Encryption is always appropriate when the eCTD is sent via the Internet. Encryption is not considered necessary if the information is sent using a physical media, although encryption is an option. The applicant should assume all liability for the media until it is delivered to the regulatory authority.  Page 5-3   Applicants should not include any file level security settings or password protection for individual files in the eCTD. Applicants should allow printing, changes to the document, selecting text and graphics, and adding or changing notes and form fields. Internal security and access control processes in the regulatory authority should maintain the integrity of the submitted files.  Receipt Upon arrival at the regulatory authority, the submission is archived according to local regulations. A read-only copy of the submission is then made available to the review community in the regulatory authority. This is typically done by placing the copy on a network server.  Acknowledgment Each regulatory authority should acknowledge the receipt of the eCTD submission according to the policy and procedure of the individual regulatory authority. Applicants should use the address in Table 5-1 to find guidance regarding acknowledgments  Page 5-4   Appendix 6 The eCTD XML Submission Background There are many factors that have influenced the design of the eCTD. Some that have had a more significant impact on the design are:  The submissions should accommodate full regulatory dossiers, supplements, amendments and variations.  The submissions should be able to accommodate regional requirements that are represented in regional guidance documents, regulations, and statutes.  The technology should be extensible so that as technology changes, the new electronic solutions can be accommodated. The eCTD is designed around the concept of a backbone. The backbone is similar to a container that holds the files that are part of the submission. The backbone is based on an XML Document Type Definition (DTD). There is a close relationship between the logical documents defined in the CTD and entities in the backbone. The backbone will provide the navigation links to the various files and information that make up the submission. The file that is produced based on the XML eCTD DTD is the eCTD XML instance or XML backbone. The XML backbone allows more than one entry or link to point to the same physical file. This should be done with caution since it can be more difficult for the regulatory authority to manage the life cycle of that file if there is more than one pointer to the file.  File Names and Directory Structure Recipients of the eCTD should be able to directly navigate through the submission at the folder and file level, i.e. without benefit of a customized end user application. The structure of the eCTD and instructions for how to create folder names facilitate this type of navigation. In order to preserve the navigational linkages that can be present in the documents contained in the eCTD, the directory structure should be preserved by the agencies. The navigational links should be relative links within a module. Specific folder and file names have been defined in appendix 4. The top-level for the directory structure will vary by region. The identification of the top-level folder uniquely identifies the submission in a region. The submission identification should be used as the folder name in the top-level directory. For example, if the submission number were CTD 123456, the root directory would be named ""ctd-123456"". The original submission and subsequent amendments and variations should use the same top-level folder name. Submissions should be differentiated by a subfolder named according to the sequence number of the submission in that region. Table 6-1 and Figure 6-1 illustrate this naming convention.  Page 6-1   Table 6-1 Submission number ctd-123456 ctd-123456 ctd-123456 ... ctd-123456 Sequence number 0000 0001 0002 nnnn Type of submission Original Submission First amendment, supplement or variation Second amendment, supplement or variation Nth amendment, supplement or variation  Figure 6-1  You should submit the xml backbone as a single file named index.xml which should be placed in the submission sequence number folder for that submission. In the example shown in Figure 6-1, there should be an index.xml file in folder ""0000"", folder ""0001"" and folder ""0002"". The MD5 checksum file, index-md5.txt, should be in each folder with the corresponding index.xml file. The DTD for index.xml should be in the ""util"" folder for each submission. The regional administrative xml backbone file, if supplied, should be in the region specific module-1 folder for each submission. The DTD for the regional xml backbone file should be in the util folder for each submission. Table 6-2 presents the file locations for the example in Figure 6-1. Submission Folder ctd-123456/0000 ctd-123456/0000/module-1/us ctd-123456/0000/util Table 6-2 Files index.xml index-md5.txt us-regional.xml ich-ectd-1-0.dtd us-regional-1-0.dtd  Page 6-2   Submission Folder ctd-123456/0001 ctd-123456/0001/module-1/us ctd-12345/0001/util ctd-123456/0002 ctd-123456/0002/module-1/us ctd-123456/0002/util  Files index.xml index-md5.txt us-regional.xml ich-ectd-1-0.dtd us-regional-1-0.dtd index.xml index-md5.txt us-regional.xml ich-ectd-1-0.dtd us-regional-1-0.dtd  Lifecycle Management It is important for the recipients of eCTD to be able to establish the location of the submission in the lifecycle of a product. The eCTD is capable of containing initial submissions, supplements, amendments and variations. There are no uniform definitions for these terms in the three regions, but amendments and supplements are terms used in the United States. Variations apply in Europe. The variations, supplements and amendments are used to provide additional information to an original regulatory dossier. For example, if a new manufacturer for the drug substance were being proposed, this would result in submission of an amendment or supplement to the FDA and a variation to Europe. When regulatory authorities request additional information, the information is also provided as a variation, supplement or amendment to the original submission. Therefore, the regulatory agencies should have a way to manage the lifecycle for the submission. This function should be provided by each regulatory authority in the form of guidance that can include regional DTDs and specifications. Each regional DTD should be referenced in the eCTD DTD by the submitter. The eCTD DTD provides some facilities for lifecycle management at the file level. When revisions are sent to a regulatory authority, the new file should be submitted as a leaf element associated with the same tag name as the file being amended or deleted. The ""modified-file"" attribute of the leaf element should contain the name and relative directory path of the file being amended, replaced or deleted. This will allow the regulatory authority to accurately locate the original file and update the original file's status.  Operation Attribute The operation attribute is a key to managing each individual file in a submission. The applicant uses the operation attribute to tell the regulatory authority how the applicant intends the files in the submission to be used. The operation attribute describes the relation between files in subsequent submissions during the life cycle of a medicinal product. In the very first submission all the files will be new. In the second, third, fourth, etc. submission, all the newly submitted files can have different operation  Page 6-3   attributes due to having or not having a relation with previously submitted files. Table 62 describes the meaning of each allowed value of the operation attribute. Table 6-3 Understanding the Operation Attribute Operation attribute value Meaning New Append The file has no relationship with files submitted previously. The file itself is new, but due to the relation this file has with a previously submitted file, the attribute is ""append"". The append status is linked to a previously submitted file on which this operation has to be executed. The previously submitted file is indicated by the ""modified file"" attribute of the leaf element. The file itself is new, but due to the relation this file has with a previously submitted file, the attribute is ""replace"". The ""replace"" status is linked to a previously submitted file on which this operation is executed. The previously submitted file is indicated by the ""modified file"" attribute of the leaf element. There is no new file submitted in this case. Instead, the leaf has the operation of ""delete"" and the ""modified-file"" attribute identifies the file in a previous submission that is to be considered no longer relevant to the review. What the reviewer might see when using the Agency review software This file Previous file Current Current Current Appended  Replace  Current Replaced  Delete  No longer relevant to the review  The following cases show examples of the use of each of the operation attribute values. These examples are not a complete list of all possible situations. Consult the appropriate regulatory authority if you have specific questions about the use of the operation attribute. Case 1  The first submission of a dossier. Table 6-4 Submission sequence # File name Operation Modified file Sample logical display in a review tool  0000  0000\..\structure.pdf  New  structure.pdf (current)  Case 2  Two submissions. Submission 0000 is the first submission of a dossier. Submission 0001 is a subsequent amendment or variation in which the applicant intends Page 6-4   to completely replace the structure.pdf file in submission 0000. The intent is to keep the original structure.pdf for historical purposes but to consider only the contents of the 0001\structure.pdf as relevant to the review. These two submissions could be described as follows: - Submission 0000 is the first submission of the file structure.pdf and this file is the current version of this file. - Submission 0001, which is submitted at a later time, is the submission of the file structure.pdf, which is now current and replaces the file structure.pdf in submission 0000.

Submission 0000 is the first submission of a dossier. Submission 0001 is an amendment or variation where the applicant intends to add new information to the original structure.pdf file, which was submitted in submission 0000. The intent is to have the reviewer consider the contents of both files relevant to the submission. These two submissions could be described as follows: - Submission 0000 is the first submission of the file structure.pdf and this file is the current version of this file. - Submission 0001, which is submitted at a later time, is the submission of the file structure.pdf, which is the current file but contains information that should be appended to file structure.pdf in submission 0000. Both files should be considered relevant to the review of the dossier.

Submission 0000 is the first submission of a dossier. Submission 0001 is an amendment or variation where the applicant intends to delete a file in the previous submission. The intent is to have the reviewer disregard the contents of the original file, possibly because it should not have been submitted with the original dossier. These two submissions could be described as follows: - Submission 0000 is the first submission of the file structure.pdf and this file is the current version of this file. - Submission 0001, which is submitted at a later time, requests that the file structure.pdf in submission 0000 be deleted and no longer considered relevant to the review of the dossier.

The graphic representation of a portion of the content model is shown below. The content model is hierarchical starting at the ""ectd"" and going down to a specific item to be included in the submission. This example shows how the section of the CTD containing summaries is structured.  Page 6-6   Once the appropriate tag has been selected, use the   element and attributes to specify a file in the submission. See ""Instructions for preparing the eCTD"" in this appendix for details.  Page 6-7   Page 6-8   eCTD Element/Attribute Instructions The eCTD consists of 5 primary sub modules:      m1-administrative-information-and-prescribing-information m2-common-technical-document-summaries m3-quality m4-nonclinical-study-reports m5-clinical-study-reports  Each of the first 5 sub modules is further decomposed into sub-elements, each with a distinct   that represents a CTD table of contents location. The steps should be completed as shown in the following example, where all files are submitted for modules 1 through 5: 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. You should select a tag element that best corresponds to the CTD table of contents location for a document or file being submitted. For example, select the tag   to submit the nonclinical overview document. You should create a child   element underneath the   tag. You should provide the relative location and file name of the actual file containing the nonclinical overview in the ""xlink:href"" attribute for the   element. You should provide a descriptive title for the file that contains the nonclinical overview in the   element of the <leaf>. You should provide information for the appropriate attributes of the <leaf> element as described in Table 6-3.  The following table describes each of these elements and attributes in further detail. Table 6-8 Description/Instructions Example A table of contents tag represents a grouping of one or more files related to a specific section of the Common Technical Document. One or more child <leaf> elements can be declared for a parent table of contents tag. It is possible to extend a table of contents tag by providing a <nodeextension> element. This can be done at the lowest level of the  Element Attribute Any table of contents tag such as <m2-4nonclinicaloverview>  Page 6-9   Element  Attribute  <leaf>  Description/Instructions defined table of contents tags but should be done only when absolutely necessary.

ID A unique identifier for this location in the XML instance. xml:lang The primary language used by the files in this entire section of the submission. Use ISO-639 standard language abbreviations A leaf corresponds to a file. One or more child leaf elements can be submitted for a parent table of contents tag. application- The version of the software version application that was used to create this file. Font-library The commercial name of the font or font library needed to properly view the submitted file. ID Unique identifier for this location in the XML instance. checksum The checksum value for the file being submitted. checksum- The checksum algorithm used. type modified-file The name of the file to be modified as indicated in the ""operation"" attribute. This file name should include the relative path to the file. If no file is being modified, then you should not supply the ""modified-file"" attribute. operation Indicates the operation to be performed on the ""modified-file"". You should select one of the following valid values: new replace append delete See the section Operation Attribute in this appendix for details on the meaning of these values.

Using node extensions is discouraged and should only be done when there is no other feasible means to submit information. The child element   should be used for each new table of contents node created. The   element value is inherited from the parent element. You should follow the following principles when using <node-extension>: 1. You should only extend the lowest level of defined elements. For example you can extend the <m2-3-r-regional-information> element but not the <m2-3-qualityPage 6-14   overall-summary> element since the latter is not the lowest element defined in the table of contents. 2. Do not extend the element more than one level. For example, you should not extend <node-extension> <title>special-fda-summary    with another  . The following is an example of a section of the eCTD instance in which an applicant extends the   to provide specific regional information as requested by a regulatory authority. The title element associated with the   describes the extension. Alternatively, the regional information in this example could have been provided as a   element under the   element without the use of a ""node extension"".          special-fda-summary      FDA extra quality summary   < / l e a f>          To update a file that has been submitted as an extended node, you should submit the replacement file using exactly the same element and ""node extension"" information, including the   element for the <node-extension>. This makes it possible for the regulatory authority to locate the original file and update its status.  Instructions for Submitting Sections as Paper During the transition to fully electronic submissions of the CTD, some sections can be submitted as paper only. These sections should be identified in the XML eCTD instance by including a PDF file in the instance that describes the content and location of the paper section. For example, the PDF file might consist of only one page with the name of the CTD document and the physical volume number and tab identifier. The <title> element in the XML eCTD instance could indicate that this is a paper submission. This is an example of the instance showing the submission of a paper efficacy overview document. <m2-5-clinical-overview> <m2-5-4-overview-of-efficacy xml:lang = ""en""> <leaf operation = ""new"" xlink:type = ""simple"" checksum = ""e854d3002c02a61fe5cbe926fd97b001"" xlink:href = ""module-2/clinical-summary/efficacy-overview.pdf"" application-version = ""Acrobat 5""> <title>Paper Submission   < / l e a f>  Page 6-15      Page 6-16   Appendix 7 Specification for Submission Formats Introduction This appendix describes the way in which files should be constructed for inclusion in the eCTD. The file formats included in this section are those formats that are commonly used in electronic submissions. Other formats can be used according to guidance published in each region.  PDF Adobe Portable Document Format (PDF) is a published format created by Adobe Systems Incorporated (http://www.adobe.com). It is not necessary to use a product from Adobe or from any specific company to produce PDF documents. PDF is accepted as a standard for documents defined in this specification. The following recommendations support the creation of PDF files that Agencies can review effectively. For any specification of the Japanese version of Adobe Acrobat, or where Japanese characters will be in the file, please refer to the regional guidance. To ensure that PDF files can be accessed efficiently, PDF files should be no larger than 50 Megabytes. The files should be saved ""optimized"" as shown in figure 7-1. Figure 7-1  Version Agencies should be able to read all PDF files with version 4.0 or higher of the Acrobat Reader. Agencies should not need any additional software to read and navigate the PDF files. However, review can be facilitated through use of Adobe Acrobat since significantly more functionality is available in this product than with Acrobat Reader. Fonts PDF viewing software automatically substitutes a font to display text if the font used to create the text is unavailable on the reviewer's computer. Font substitution can affect a document's appearance and structure, and in some cases, it can affect the information conveyed by a document. Agencies cannot guarantee the availability of any fonts except Times New Roman, Arial and Courier and fonts supported in the Acrobat product set itself. Therefore, all additional fonts used in the PDF files should be embedded to ensure that those fonts would always be available to the reviewer. When embedding fonts, all  Page 7-1   characters for the font should be embedded, not just a subset of the fonts being used in the document. One problem associated with embedding fonts is that embedding requires additional computer storage space. Three techniques to help limit the storage space taken by embedding fonts include:  Limiting the number of fonts used in each document   Using only True Type or Adobe Type 1 fonts Avoiding customized fonts  Resizing a document because the contents are too small to read is inefficient. Times New Roman, 12-point font, the font used for this document is adequate in size for reading narrative text and should be used whenever possible. It is sometimes tempting to use fonts which are smaller than 12 point in tables and charts but this should be avoided whenever possible. When choosing a point size for tables, a balance should be made between providing sufficient information on a single page that may facilitate data comparisons for the reviewer while still achieving a point size that remains legible. The corollary of this is that in making point size larger, more tables might be necessary, which can complicate data comparisons for a reviewer since data might now be included in separate tables. Generally, point sizes 9-10 are considered acceptable in tables but smaller point sizes should be avoided. Use of Color fonts The use of a black font color is recommended. Blue font can be used for hypertext links. If a font color other than black is used, light colors that do not print well on grayscale printers should be avoided. Color reproduction can be tested prior to submission by printing sample pages from the document using a gray scale printer. The use of background shadowing should be avoided. Page Orientation Pages should be properly oriented so that all portrait pages are presented in portrait and all landscape pages are presented in landscape. To achieve this, the page orientation of landscape pages should be set to landscape prior to saving the PDF document in final form. Page Size and Margins The print area for pages should fit on a sheet of A4 or Letter paper. A sufficient margin (at least 2.5cm) on the left side of each page should be provided in order to avoid obscuring information if the reviewer subsequently prints and binds the pages for temporary use. For pages in landscape orientation (typically tables and publications) smaller margins are allowable (at least 2.0cm at the top and 0.8cm left and right) so as to allow more information, displayed legibly, on the page (see Section 3, Fonts). It is acceptable that header and footer information appears within these margins but not so close to the page edge that it may risk being lost upon printing. Page 7-2   Source of Electronic Document PDF documents produced by scanning paper documents are usually inferior to those produced from an electronic source document. Scanned documents are more difficult to read and do not allow reviewers to search or copy and paste text for editing. They should be avoided where possible. Methods for Creating PDF Documents and Images The method used for creating PDF documents should produce the best replication of a paper document. To ensure that the paper and PDF version of the document are the same, the document should be printed from the PDF version. Documents that are available only in paper should be scanned at resolutions that will ensure the pages are legible both on the computer screen and when printed. At the same time, the file size should be limited. It is recommended that scanning be undertaken at a resolution of 300 dots per inch (dpi) to balance legibility and file size. The use of grayscale or color is discouraged because of file size. After scanning, resampling to a lower resolution should be avoided. When creating PDF files containing images, the images should not be downsampled. Downsampling does not preserve all of the pixels in the original. For PDF images, one of the following lossless compression techniques should be used:   For lossless compression of color and grayscale images, use Zip/Flate (one technique with two names). This is specified in Internet RFC 1950 and RFC 1951 (http://info.internet.isi.edu/in-notes/rfc/files/rfc1950.txt). For lossless compression of black and white images, use the CCITT Group 4 Fax compression technique. It is specified as CCITT recommendations T.6 (1988) Facsimile coding schemes and coding control functions for Group 4 facsimile apparatus.  Paper documents containing hand-written notes should be scanned at 300 dpi. Handwritten notes should be done in black ink for clarity. For photographs, the image should be obtained with a resolution of 600 dpi. If black and white photos are submitted, 8-bit grayscale images should be considered. If color photos are submitted, 24-bit RGB images should be considered. A captured image should not be subjected to non-uniform scaling (i.e., sizing). Gels and karyotypes should be scanned directly, rather than from photographs. Scanning should be at 600 dpi and 8-bit grayscale depth. Plotter output graphics should be scanned or captured digitally at 300 dpi. High-pressure liquid chromatography or similar images should be scanned at 300 dpi. Applicants should validate the quality of the renditions.  Page 7-3   Hypertext Linking and Bookmarks Hypertext links and bookmarks are techniques used to improve navigation through PDF documents. Hypertext links can be designated by rectangles using thin lines or by blue text. In general, for documents with a table of contents, bookmarks for each item listed in the table of contents should be provided including all tables, figures, publications, other references, and appendices. These bookmarks are essential for the efficient navigation through documents. In general, including a bookmark to the main table of contents for a submission or module is helpful. The bookmark hierarchy should be made identical to the table of contents with no additional bookmark levels beyond those present in the table of contents. Each additional level increases the need for space to read the bookmarks. The use of no more than 4 levels in the hierarchy is recommended. Hypertext links throughout the body of the document to supporting annotations, related sections, references, appendices, tables, or figures that are not located on the same page are helpful and improve navigation efficiency. Relative paths should be used when creating hypertext links to minimize the loss of hyperlink functionality when folders are moved between disk drives. Absolute links that reference specific drives and root directories will no longer work once the submission is loaded onto the Agency's network servers. When creating bookmarks and hyperlinks, the magnification setting Inherit Zoom should be used so that the destination page displays at the same magnification level that the reviewer is using for the rest of the document. Page Numbering If a submission includes more than one document, no additional volume or page numbering is necessary. Only page numbers for individual documents are needed. It is easier to navigate through an electronic document if the page numbers for the document and the PDF file are the same. To accomplish this, the initial page of the document should be numbered page 1, with no use of Roman numerals or unnumbered pages in the document. If this is not done, Acrobat Reader would include such numbering within its page count and thus put the Acrobat numbering out of synchrony with the internal document page numbers. Two exceptions to this rule can occur, details of which can be found in the guidance for the modules of the CTD.  Firstly, where a document is split because of its size (e.g. >50MB), under which circumstances the second or subsequent file should be numbered consecutively to that of the first or preceding file.  Secondly, where several small documents with their own internal page numbering have been brought together into a single file, under which circumstances it is not  Page 7-4   considered necessary to provide additional page numbering, but the start of each sub-document should be book marked. Document Information Fields Document information fields should not be used for the common portions of the eCTD, but they may be appropriate for some of the regional documents. Recommendations for the document information fields will be provided in the regional guidance for the specific submission type. Open Dialog Box The open dialog box sets the document view when the file is opened. The initial view of the PDF files should be set as Bookmarks and Page. If there are no bookmarks, the initial view as Page only should be set. The Magnification and Page Layout should be set as default. Security No security settings or password protection for PDF files should be included. Security fields should be set to allow printing, changes to the document, selecting text and graphics, and adding or changing notes and form fields. Indexing PDF Documents Full text indices can be used to help find specific documents and/or search for text within documents. When a document or group of documents is indexed, all words and numbers in the file and all information stored in the Document Information fields are stored in special index files that are functionally accessible using the search tools available in Acrobat. Portions of a document that are imaged are not indexed. Even if the document only contains images, the text in the Document Information fields of the file will be indexed. These full text indices should not be confused with a table of contents. Adobe Acrobat Catalog is one example of a tool that can be used to index PDF documents. Indices should not require extensions or additions to off-the-shelf Acrobat programs. Further recommendations for full text indices will be provided in regional guidance. Use of Acrobat Plug-Ins It is considered acceptable to use plug-ins to assist in the creation of a submission. However, the review of the submission should not require the use of any plug ins, in addition to those provided with Adobe Acrobat because Agencies should not be required to archive additional plug-in functionality.  Page 7-5   XML Files A working group at the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) developed XML. It is a nonproprietary language developed to improve on previous mark up languages including standard generalized markup language (SGML) and hypertext markup language (HTML). Information in an XML file is divided into specific pieces. These pieces are called objects or element types. The element type identifies the piece of information. For example, the name of the company submitting a registration application in eCTD format for review is identified with the element type  . All element type names are bracketed using the special characters <>. Inside the XML document, the element type name is placed just prior to the piece of information and after the information. This is called tagging. So, in the XML file, the applicant could be tagged as follows  Worldwide Pharmaceuticals Inc. . The / prior to the element type denotes that this is the end of the information about the applicant. By using a hierarchical structure, XML allows you to relate two or more elements. This is accomplished by nesting one element within another. Additional information about the element type is provided by attributes. Attributes are placed within the element types and are surrounded by "" "". For example, if you wanted to show that the applicant name is presented in the English language, you could add this piece of information as an attribute. This could be represented in the XML file as   Worldwide Pharmaceuticals Inc. . XML files are read by a parser found in internet browsers. Style sheets provide the browser with the information to create tables, fonts, and colors for display. The specific names of the element types and attributes as well as the valid syntax, structure and format for defining the XML elements are included in a file called document type declaration (DTD). If the XML document does not follow the DTD, then the file will not be able to be used properly. The top three lines of the XML file should include the XML version, the style sheet type and address, and the DTD name and address. Additional information about the XML standard can be found at the W3C web site at http://www.w3c.org.  SVG Files SVG is a language for describing two-dimensional graphics in XML. SVG allows for three types of graphic objects: vector graphic shapes (e.g., paths consisting of straight lines and curves), images and text. Graphical objects can be grouped, styled, transformed and composited into previously rendered objects. Text can be in any XML namespace suitable to the appplication, which enhances searchability and accessibility of the SVG graphics. The feature set includes nested transformations, clipping paths, alpha masks, filter effects, template objects and extensibility.  Page 7-6   SVG drawings can be dynamic and interactive. The Document Object Model (DOM) for SVG, which includes the full XML DOM, allows for straightforward and efficient vector graphics animation via scripting. A rich set of event handlers such as onmouseover and onclick can be assigned to any SVG graphical object. Because of its compatibility and leveraging of other Web standards, features like scripting can be done on SVG elements and other XML elements from different namespaces simultaneously within the same Web page. 8 The specific use of SVG in a submission should be discussed with the regulatory authority.  8  This description of SVG is from w3c web page http://www.w3c.org/graphics/svg  Page 7-7   Appendix 8 XML eCTD DTD     Oct 20, 2001 --> Changes according to testing feedback --> See separate sheet -->                                  Page 8-1                                                                                                                                  Page 8-4                                       -2-s-1-general-information?, -2-s-2-manufacture?, -2-s-3-characterisation?, -2-s-4-control-of-drug-substance?, -2-s-5-reference-standards-or-materials?, -2-s-6-container-closure-system?, -2-s-7-stability?) > substance CDATA -2-s-drug-substance*, -2-p-drug-product*, -2-a-appendices?, -2-r-regional-information?) >  Page 8-5                                                                  Page 8-6                                           CDATA -2-p-1-description-and-composition-of-the-drug-product?, -2-p-2-pharmaceutical-development?, -2-p-3-manufacture?, -2-p-4-control-of-excipients*, -2-p-5-control-of-drug-product?, -2-p-6-reference-standards-or-materials?, -2-p-7-container-closure-system?, -2-p-8-stability?) >  Page 8-7                                                        Page 8-8                     -2-p-5-1-specifications?, -2-p-5-2-analytical-procedures?, -2-p-5-3-validation-of-analytical-procedures?, -2-p-5-4-batch-analyses?, -2-p-5-5-characterisation-of-impurities?, -2-p-5-6-justification-of-specifications?) >                                                                                              -2-1-1-primary-pharmacodynamics?, -2-1-2-secondary-pharmacodynamics?, -2-1-3-safety-pharmacology?, -2-1-4-pharmacodynamic-drug-interactions?) > -2-1-pharmacology?, -2-2-pharmacokinetics?, -2-3-toxicology?, -2-4-local-tolerance?, -2-5-other-toxicity-studies?) >  Page 8-10                                                        Page 8-11                                                      Page 8-12                                                          Page 8-13                                                        Page 8-14                                                Page 8-15   Appendix 9 Glossary The intended content of this section is the definition of terms used in the set of documentation associated with the eCTD.

GX044-84-0649603	"Joint Meeting   of the   Blood Products Advisory Committee (BPAC)   and the   Transmissible Spongiform Encephalopathies Advisory Committee (TSEAC)   January 17, 2002     Topic 1.     Effectiveness of measures taken to protect humans from food-borne exposure to the agent of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE): Implications for risk of variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD)   and blood safety         Issue    FDA seeks to be advised on whether food chain controls for preventing human exposure to BSE as implemented in the UK since 1996 provide a sufficient basis to obviate the need to defer blood and plasma donors based on subsequent travel or residence in a BSE risk country.      Overview     In August 1999 we, the FDA, recommended that, as a preventive measure, manufacturers of FDA-regulated blood and blood products should defer some donors based on their potential exposure to the BSE agent in the UK between 1980 and the end of 1996.  That time period encompasses the peak years of the BSE epidemic in the UK and related human exposures, prior to implementation of several control measures designed to prevent contamination of food with the BSE agent.  By deciding not to consider donors who were in the UK only after 1996 as being at risk for vCJD, we recognized that measures taken in the UK to reduce opportunities for food-borne exposures of humans to the BSE agent have probably been effective.  In our recently published document  Guidance for Industry:  Revised Preventive Measures to Reduce the Possible Risk of Transmission of Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (CJD) and Variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (vCJD) by Blood and Blood Products  (1-3), we recommended instituting new precautionary deferrals of donors potentially exposed to the BSE agent  outside  the UK and reducing the time that suitable donors may have spent in the UK during the 17 years of concern from six months to three months.  We continue to accept that measures implemented in the UK by the end of 1996 (4) have sufficiently mitigated the risk of contracting vCJD to renew our earlier recommendation that time spent there after 1996 need not be considered when determining the suitability of blood donors.  This position was taken despite the fact that the reported incidence of BSE in the UK remains higher than in any other country (at least 688 cases recognized in 2001 [5]).    Since other European BSE countries (countries identified by the USDA as having BSE or being at substantial risk of having BSE in native cattle) instituted measures to protect human food much later than did the UK, we concluded that time spent in those countries must be considered to pose an unknown but significant risk that was  not  mitigated after 1996 and that time spent there from 1980 until the present should be considered in determining the suitability of blood donors.  We intend to reconsider frequently our recommendations for deferral of donors who spent time in various BSE countries as more information becomes available about the estimated numbers of people who might have been infected with the BSE agent and about the potential of their blood to transmit infection (which remains a theoretical possibility).  We also expect to consider the effectiveness of measures taken by various countries to keep the BSE agent out of their food supplies in deciding when risk of human exposure has been sufficiently mitigated to warrant a change in blood donor deferral policy.    Our current policy acknowledges that, by the end of 1996, efforts of the UK were sufficient to reduce the risk of further human exposures to a negligible level—presumably less than the risk in other BSE countries that, while recognizing smaller numbers of cattle with BSE, have not yet successfully or consistently implemented similar effective measures to protect the food supply.  That FDA policy has not been universally endorsed.  Some blood programs recently elected to defer donors who spent three months or more in the UK from 1980 through the present time.  We continue to believe that current UK measures to protect human food from contamination with the BSE agent have markedly reduced opportunities for human exposure and that the small additional reduction in theoretical risk afforded by deferring donors who spent time in the UK after 1996 does not justify the probable substantial loss of otherwise suitable donors.  However, we appreciate ongoing concern about the effectiveness of UK measures to protect human food and believe it to be in the public interest for BPAC and TSEAC to review those measures.    A variety of measures are generally accepted as reducing the risk of human food-borne exposure to the BSE agent.  We believe that, by adopting and implementing a system simultaneously incorporating those protective measures, the UK has greatly increased the assurance that—in spite of inevitable failure to achieve perfect implementation of every measure at all times—humans have been protected from food-borne exposures to the BSE agent.  In acknowledging the probable effectiveness of measures implemented in the UK to protect the human food chain, we hope to encourage authorities in other BSE countries to adopt similar measures as quickly as possible.    The following measures, taken together, are believed to offer substantial protection of the human food chain against contamination with the BSE agent:    l   Effective BSE control in cattle and small ruminants (sheep and goats) including OIE-compliant national surveillance programs (with extensive testing of brain tissues from animals at increased risk of BSE), prohibitions on the feeding of most mammalian proteins to ruminants (""feed bans""), immediate condemnation and prompt destruction of animals showing signs of BSE, and preventive culling of animals at increased risk    l   Age-based slaughter schemes (reducing risk by prohibiting consumption of meat products from ruminants slaughtered after an age when substantial amounts of BSE agent are likely to be present in tissues, generally taken to be 30 months for cattle)    l   Removal of ""specified risk materials (SRM)"" (CNS, lymphoid, intestinal tissues, ? other) from ruminant carcasses at the time of slaughter and effective segregation of SRM from edible materials    l   Prohibition of sale for human consumption of meat products recovered by methods likely to contaminate the products with high-risk materials (""advanced"" or mechanical meat recovery systems)    l   Application of measures to protect the human food chain as consistently to imported food as to domestically produced food    Charge     We ask the committees to evaluate the probable effectiveness of those measures taken by the UK to protect humans from food-borne exposure to the BSE agent and their value in mitigating risk otherwise addressed through donor deferral.    Questions     1. Do members of the committee agree that the combination of measures implemented in the UK by the end of 1996 to protect the human food chain from BSE contamination are sufficient to obviate the need for donor deferrals based on subsequent travel or residence in the UK?    2. If the answer to Question 1 is ""yes,"" which measures should the FDA consider to be of greatest importance when it considers future revisions in recommendations for determining the suitability of donors who spent time in other BSE countries?   3. If the answer to Question 1 is ""no,"" what other measures, if any, would committee members consider sufficient to obviate the need for donor deferrals based on subsequent travel or residence in a BSE-endemic country?         References     1.

GX115-78-1693260	Quick Summary    TRANSMISSIBLE SPONGIFORM ENCEPHALOPATHIES ADVISORY COMMITTEE    July 17 & 18, 2003              Topic 1:  Safety of bovine bone gelatin in oral and topic drugs, food and cosmetics         The TSEAC has discussed the safety of gelatin twice before at previous meetings.    During those meetings, representatives of the Gelatine Manufacturers of Europe (GME) presented reports of validation studies on the capability of gelatin manufacturing processes to remove and/or inactivate TSE agents.    The Committee concluded those studies were not complete and requested that additional studies be performed.    Results of the new studies were presented and discussed.    The Committee was then asked the following questions:         1. Do the results of these new studies demonstrate a reduction in infectivity that is sufficient to protect human health?         The Committee voted: 7 yes, 1 no, and 1 abstained.         2a. Do the scientific data and information available support the following current FDA    recommendation on bone gelatin?         “At this time, there does not appear to be a basis for objection to the use of gelatin in FDA-regulated products for oral consumption and cosmetic use by humans when the gelatin is produced from bones obtained from cattle residing in, or originating from, BSE countries, if the cattle come from BSE-free herds and if the slaughterhouse removes the heads, spines, and spinal cords directly after slaughter.    Nor does there appear to be a basis for objection to gelatin for oral consumption and cosmetic use which is produced from bones from countries which have not reported BSE but which fail to meet OIE standards, if the slaughterhouse removes the heads, spine, and spinal cords after slaughter.    Gelatin processors should ensure that slaughterhouses that supply bovine bones for gelatin production remove heads, spines, and spinal cords as the first procedure following slaughter.”         The Committee asked that FDA better clarify parts of the above recommendation.    FDA should define the meaning of “BSE-free herd” and removal of spine and spinal cords “directly after slaughter.”    FDA should also clarify if it recommends removal of spinal cord and spine together or separately.    Removal of the spinal column from bones for gelatin processing was considered necessary, however, the location where the column was removed from the carcass during the slaughtering process and the timing of its removal    was not deemed to be a major issue.    The Committee requested that the processor give assurance that their sources have been protected from exposure to the BSE agent.    Vertebral bones were of greatest concern because of adjacent spinal cord and because dorsal root ganglia cannot be separated from vertebrae.    The Committee stated that PrPres (PrP Sc ) testing of slaughter cattle from which bones came was not a critical determinant in risk reduction.    The USDA representative noted that cattle in a BSE-free herd should never have been fed meat-and-bone meal and that such a herd should have in place a BSE surveillance program equal to or exceeding that recommended by the OIE.    Individual Committee members wondered why, considering that so much bovine bone gelatin is used to manufacture photographic film, U.S. bovine bones could not be used preferentially to fill the U.S. need for oral and cosmetic gelatin.         The Committee then voted: 6 yes , 2 no and 1 abstained.         2b. If the answer is NO, what specific changes does the Committee recommend?       In view of the vote for question 2a. this question was not applicable.         Topic 2:  Potential Exposure of Blood Donors in North America to BSE agent                                                  *            FDA is undertaking an assessment of the BSE exposure risk to blood donors in the US and Canada in light of the single BSE case that has been reported in Canada.    *              Although it is premature for the FDA to present any results of this ongoing assessment, we believe that the likelihood of exposure to the BSE agent for both Canada and the US is and has been very small.    *            The exact magnitude of BSE risk for Canada and the U.S. will be difficult to quantify because of methodological limitations.    However, preliminary considerations suggest that    1.           The risk of exposure of blood donors in North America to the BSE agent has been extremely low and is even lower now than it was several years ago.    2.           In particular, implementation of the feed ban of 1997 has significantly reduced the likelihood of human exposures to the BSE agent for both Canada and the U.S.A.    *            FDA does not believe that there are sufficient data at this time to warrant changing our blood donor deferral guidance.    *            We will continue to study this issue and take further action as appropriate.         Topic 3:  Reprocessing of Medical Devices, Contaminated or Potentially Contaminated with TSE Agents         The Committee listened to presentations from several national and international experts as well as CBER, CDRH, NIH, and Veterans Administration staff.    The Committee then discussed what published data could be used to establish methods for decontaminating medical devices after potential exposure to TSE agents, the limitations that exist in applying these data to procedures that decontaminate medical devices, methods for validating the sterility of medical devices, and approaches for designing and interpreting inactivation studies for TSE agents.    The Committee then discussed the following questions.    The questions were not addressed independently or in order.         1.        What information in the published literature should be viewed as supportive data to establish methods and procedures for reprocessing medical devices potentially contaminated with TSE?    The Committee consensus was that, due to the wide spectrum of medical devices and equipment of different design and composition, the questions should be discussed on a product-by-product basis.    Available published data may not be generalizable and, thus, not transferable .     Each situation must be evaluated individually.    2.        Data in the published scientific literature or developed from in-house studies with a specific medical device may not be applicable to other medical devices.    For example, differences in  device fabrication material, device design, methods for cleaning, or changes in device intended use may alter the effectiveness of a TSE inactivation procedure.    While a myriad of data shows that the infective TSE agent can be inactivated by different procedures, very little of that information is directly applicable to hospital settings.    Additional studies are needed to determine the inactivation of infectivity contaminating those materials under conditions resembling real clinical settings.    Studies to determine the scope of current hospital practices would also be helpful .    3.        Please discuss which aspects of a medical device and its use should be considered when determining whether a new TSE inactivation study might be needed for a specific device?  The surface of a device, the presence of “nooks and crannies” or areas of the device which are difficult to clean, and the device’s ability to withstand harsh decontamination procedures, and the tissue with which it comes in contact are all factors to analyze on a product-by-product basis .    a.         Please  provide guidance on how these aspects of a medical device should be included in the TSE inactivation study design.    4.        What criteria should be considered when analyzing the results of TSE inactivation studies?    For example, is log reduction of TSE infectivity, (expressed as), an appropriate endpoint for such studies?    a.         If so, what magnitude of reduction in log LD50 would be considered safe?       b.        Are there other endpoints, such as the presence of PrPres that would be acceptable surrogate markers for infectivity?         The appropriate decontamination methods depend on the type of surgery and the equipment involved.    This situation must be approached with caution.    The overall risk of transmitting CJD by contaminated surgical instruments is low (due to the low incidence of CJD), and some decontamination processes might themselves introduce a significant new risk of adverse event.         Wet sterilization is clearly more effective than dry heat in inactivating TSE agents.    Studies should evaluate inactivation with bases or other agents   less toxic than NaOH.    Enzymatic decontamination procedures have never been adequately investigated and might offer a benefit in some situations.         Most of the WHO-recommended decontamination procedures for TSE agents are very stringent.    FDA should explore the possible use of less severe methods, if and when reliable information shows that such methods are equally effective and have been validated.    The Committee proposed that FDA convene an open international meeting of experts from academia, industry and government to seek a consensus on decontamination procedures appropriate to a variety of devices and their use in specific situations.    Such a conference might evaluate such issues as the necessity of using animal models to validate claims of decontamination, novel cell culture methods, and other approaches.    Procedures to be discussed should include cleaning of devices, autoclaving, and other methods of decontamination and terminal sterilization.    The appropriate use of identified and validated surrogate markers would be another useful topic for discussion.    This proposed forum might discuss development of validation assays, based on estimates of risk and effects of procedures suitable for use in actual clinical and other settings, i.e., industry settings of device reprocessing.    Although the Committee discussed the amounts of residual infectivity that might be considered tolerable and recognized that risk cannot be zero, one member strongly asserted—without challenge—that there is no threshold value below which exposure to a TSE agent should be considered safe.         Acceptable decontamination procedures should inactivate or remove infectious TSE agents while maintaining integrity of the device.    Validation studies can provide scientific data about decontamination procedures under specified conditions.    Results can provide assurance that risk of contamination has been minimized to achieve some margin of safety.    However, in many cases, decontamination procedures cannot guarantee absolutely “safe” products.    Use of existing methods cannot assure complete removal of TSE agent from all materials under all circumstances.    5.        The extent of TSE inactivation required for any reprocessing procedure depends on the amount  of infectious agent present in/on the device.       a.         Considering the scientific literature describing the level of infectious material present in different human tissues, please discuss what amounts of infectious material may be present on contaminated medical devices.        b.        Please provide guidance on how the level of infectious material on a medical device should be considered when designing and interpreting a TSE inactivation study.         The extent of inactivation required to decontaminate a device depends on the amount of TSE infectivity present, which in turn depends on the type of tissue in contact with the device.    At two extremes are high-risk tissues, such as dura mater, and low-risk tissues, such as blood.    Procedures to remove contamination must be evaluated on a risk/ benefit basis.    Obviously, the risk of contamination is far greater when instruments have been used for CJD patients or suspect CJD patients.    Since the complexity of medical devices is quite diverse, specific decontamination procedures must be tailored to each device.    The greatest concern is for decontamination of neurosurgical instruments used on CJD or CJD high-risk patients.         The highest tissue risk for CJD infectivity is inside the cranium, followed by the spinal cord and the dorsal root ganglia. For vCJD the lymphoreticular system and gastrointestinal tract are also at risk, but at a lower level.    The log reduction criteria are appropriate, but will depend on the tissue.    Additional data may result in the need to modify procedures as they become available.    The validation procedures should also check the rinse solutions from the procedure to minimize risk of spreading the contaminant.          See the previous discussion.              Topic 4 Part 1 : Methods to Decontaminate Facilities and Equipment Used to Prepare Human Cells, Tissue and Cellular and Tissue-Based Products (HCT/Ps), and Human Blood Products, Including Plasma Derivatives, to Reduce the Theoretical Risk of Transmitting TSE Agents         FDA asked the TSEAC to consider whether specific methods for decontamination of facility work surfaces and surgical instruments should be introduced at this time, to prevent contamination and cross-contamination by TSE agents during recovery and processing of ocular tissue, in cases where post-donation information reveals that a donor had or may have had a TSE.    FDA asked for advice on whether these methods should be used routinely by eye banks, or only as additional procedures in cases where post-donation information reveals definite or suspected TSE in a donor, and whether the methods should be used in recovery and processing of other tissues with low risk of containing TSE infectivity, either for cases of known or suspected TSE or routinely.              QUESTIONS         Considering (a) current practices using conventional methods of decontaminating facility work surfaces and equipment/instruments used in the recovery and processing of human tissues for transplantation, (b) other precautions currently in place (e.g., aseptic techniques, donor screening for TSE), and (c) concerns about availability of tissues,         1.        With regard to the recovery and processing of  ocular tissue  from donors later discovered to have  TSE or possible TSE:         A.       Does the committee believe that surgical instruments used in recovery and processing should be destroyed by incineration, if practical?    The Committee voted: 12 yes, 0 no, and 0 abstained.    B.       If destruction of instruments is not practical, does the committee believe that, at this time, there exist established, effective methods that are adequate for decontaminating instruments and surfaces?       The Committee recommended accepting the WHO Guidelines, when possible in the order of priority listed by WHO consultants.    T he most effective feasible method of decontamination is to be preferred.         C.       If so, please comment on the specific methods listed in the WHO Guidelines (see Appendix).    In particular, does the committee consider that only those WHO methods using sodium hydroxide or sodium hypochlorite are adequate?         D.       If so, should such methods be employed by eye banks in the circumstance noted above?         E.        Does the committee believe that the number of decontamination cycles performed with the instruments after the index donor tissue was   recovered and processed   should determine whether or not these additional specified decontamination procedures are needed?    A decontamination cycle involves two stages: physical cleaning, typically using a mechanical washer/drier, followed by inactivation of any remaining infectious material, e.g., by autoclaving (2).         2.        With regard to the recovery and processing of ocular tissue, should additional decontamination procedures discussed in question #1 be used routinely, i.e. even when TSE has not been suspected?    The Committee voted: 0 yes , 12 no, and 0 abstained.          3.        Should similar decontamination procedures be used for instruments and surfaces used to recover and process other tissues with a low risk of TSE infectivity from cases of known or suspected TSE?         The Committee revised this question   to read as follows:           3.    a) Should instruments used to recover and process other tissues with a low risk of TSE infectivity from cases of known or suspected TSE be destroyed by incineration, if practical?         It was noted that vertebrae are high-risk tissues and would not be included in considering this question .         The Committee voted: 9 yes, 2 no, and 1 abstained.         3. b) No question was asked and no vote taken on the following question:    If destruction of instruments is not practical, should TSE decontamination procedures, such as those recommended by WHO, be used?    The Chair concluded that, based upon the votes on question 3a, this question need not be addressed.         4. With regard to the recovery and processing of  other tissues with a low risk of   TSE infectivity , should additional decontamination procedures be used  routinely , i.e. even when TSE has not been suspected?         The Committee voted: 0 yes, 12 no, and 0 abstained.              Topic 4, Part 2 :    Methods used in Plasma Derivative Manufacturing         The Committee was presented with updates of methods and models to address the scientific question of how best to prevent TSE cross-contamination of batches during manufacturing of products derived from human plasma, a low-risk tissue.    The Plasma Protein Therapeutics Organization (PPTA) presented a summary of common and routinely used cleaning methods for equipment between batches (campaigns) of plasma derivatives, which included use of NaOH and NaOCl solutions.         The Committee discussed the following points regarding facilities and equipment used in plasma fractionation:         ·          The risk that the starting material (plasma) might be contaminated with the agent of vCJD    ·          The likelihood that existing, conventional cleaning methods, especially those that include exposure to solutions of sodium hydroxide and/or sodium hypochlorite as cleaning agents for stainless steel equipment—methods that are validated by assessment of remaining total protein and/or total organic carbon—may clear contaminating TSE agents    ·          The removal of TSE infectivity by precipitations, filtrations, chromatography and discarding of resins during plasma processing    ·          Experimental observations that TSE infectivity may be retained by chromatographic columns    ·          The current state of knowledge about effective cleaning methods for TSE agents         They then answered the following  Questions :         Considering current facility cleaning practices, the low risk of vCJD infectivity in human plasma, and the ability of plasma fractionation methods to clear TSE agents,         1.        Does the committee feel that current facility cleaning methods, e.g., the use of solutions of sodium hydroxide or sodium hypochlorite followed by extensive rinsing cycles, are adequate to minimize the possibility that an infectious dose of the vCJD agent may be carried over from one manufactured lot into the next?         The Committee voted :    12 yes, 0 no, 0 abstained.         2.        Are the available scientific data sufficient for FDA to recommend specific methods for cleaning of equipment used in the manufacture of plasma derivatives with respect to TSE agent clearance or inactivation?            a.        If so, please identify which methods can be recommended.    b.        If not, please describe what additional studies would assist in development of such recommendations.         The Committee did not vote on this question but discussed the issue.    They acknowledged that blood was a low-risk tissue and that the current processing of plasma was likely to greatly reduce the risk of infectivity in most derivative products.    There was consensus that the processes for cleaning of equipment that many manufactures are currently performing is adequate, but cleaning procedures should be standardized and effective methods adopted by all manufacturers.    When new scientific information relevant to plasma processing equipment becomes available it should be reviewed, and current cleaning techniques should be reevaluated.         THIS QUICK SUMMARY WAS WRITTEN PRIOR TO RECEIPT OF THE TRANSCRIPTS.    PLEASE REFER TO THE MEETING TRANSCRIPTS FOR A DETAILED ACCOUNT OF THE COMMITTEE DISCUSSIONS.

GX015-54-13089550	"News   UK Updates Advice for Using Taxol in Ovarian Cancer    By Stephen Pincock    23 January 2003    LONDON (Reuters Health) Jan 23 - Women with ovarian cancer should be  offered either paclitaxel (Taxol) in combination with platinum therapy, or platinum therapy alone, as a first line treatment, Britain's National  Institute for Clinical Excellence said on Wednesday.    The guidance supplants a recommendation from nearly 3 years ago that the Bristol-Myers Squibb drug, in combination with either cisplatin or  carboplatin, should be the standard initial therapy for patients with  ovarian cancer following surgery.    ""When all the evidence was considered by the independent Appraisals  Committee, it suggested that there is no clear advantage of the combination of paclitaxel and a platinum-based drug over a platinum-based drug on its own for first-line treatment of ovarian cancer,"" NICE said in a briefing document.    The ICON3 study published in The Lancet last August showed that  single-agent carboplatin was acceptable as first-line chemotherapy.    ""NICE now recommends that both treatments should be offered as options and that the choice of treatment should be made after the woman has discussed the potential risks and benefits with her doctor,"" the agency said on Thursday.    The revised guidance also clarifies the distinction between rechallenge and second line therapy. NICE said that when relapse occurs after first-line chemotherapy, rechallenge therapy with the same regimen should be  considered if the previous response had been adequate ""in extent and duration.""    Once the tumour fails to respond adequately to the first-line regimen,  second-line treatment should be considered.                                          Go to:   GCIG Home   GCIG Statutes   News   Events   Roster   Downloads   Links   Active Trials   Bibliography                                  Home     |     Contact    |      Privacy Notice     |     Accessibility"
