GX002-33-11824170	"Comparison            of Landsat 7 Level-0R and Level-1G Data                                    The two images below (subsections            of a full Landsat scene) illustrate the difference between Level 0R            and Level 1G. All Landsat 7 data will be archived as Level 0R and will            be available to users in that format or as Level 1G             Level 0R data is corrected            for scan line direction and band alignment only. No radiometric or geometric            correction is applied. In the example below, the pixel values have been            stretched to make the image more ""viewable"", but the geometric distortions            are as they will appear.             The Level 1G image is typical            of the products currently available from the Landsat system; geometric            corrections were applied.             Both images were generated            at EDC from data acquired November 6, 1984 over central Florida by the            Thematic Mapper (TM) instrument on Landsat 5. The Level 0R image was            processed from a station tape (HDDT) using the TMACs system developed            by Hughes STX. The Level 1G image was processed through EDC's EL1PS            (EDC Level 1 Prototype System). The same three bands were used in each            image.                                       Landsat 0R image (320 kbytes)                               Landsat 1G image (352 kbytes)                               (Images courtesy of C.

Standards for space conditioning equipment Equipment Standards Efficiency standards for space conditioning equipment were enacted in 1987 under the National Appliance Energy Conservation Act (NAECA).  The date of initial implementation depends upon the type of equipment.  The standards for heating equipment are given in Table 3.22, while those for cooling are given in Table 3.23.  All standards are based on an efficiency (or energy factor) derived from a test procedure.  Table 3.22.

Standards for water heaters Efficiency standards for water heaters were enacted in 1987 under the National Appliance Energy Conservation Act (NAECA) and were implemented in 1990.  The standard specifies a minimum energy factor for storage water heaters based on water heater size.  The energy factor is based on the U.S. DOE test procedure mentioned above.  The standard and estimated UECs associated with the standard are shown in Table 4.4.  Table 4.4.

Volume is rated storage volume in gallons. 3) Average volume is for typical size unit. 4) UEC based on usage of 45.3 gal/day and at 77F temperature rise. 5.5. Standards for Residential Refrigerators National efficiency standards for refrigerators were enacted under the National Appliance Energy Conservation Act (NAECA) and first implemented in 1990.  The standard specifies a maximum energy use for refrigerators based on the type of refrigerator and the size.  The energy usage is based on the U.S. DOE test procedure.  More stringent standards were implemented in 1993; a third round of national standards will become effective July 1, 2001.  The standard levels are summarized in Table 5.2. Note that the 2001 standards will result in a near-doubling of the average energy factor under the 1990 standard levels, and a near-tripling of the average energy factor in 1980 (Figure 5.2).  In other words, the average energy consumption of new units will have been reduced by nearly two-thirds over a twenty-year period.   Table 5.2.

Standards for Residential Freezers Efficiency standards for freezers were enacted under the National Appliance Energy Conservation Act (NAECA) and first implemented in 1990.  The standard specifies a maximum energy use for freezers based on type and size.  The energy usage is based on the U.S. DOE test procedure mentioned above.  More stringent standards were implemented at the start of 1993; a third round of national standards will become effective July 1, 2001.  The standard levels are summarized in Table 6.2.  Table 6.2.
