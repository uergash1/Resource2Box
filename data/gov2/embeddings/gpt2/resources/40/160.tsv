GX257-61-14565289	LIDE3 30 TANOAK-DOUGLAS-FIR/SALAL-PACIFIC RHODODENDRON Lithocarpus densiflorus-Pseudotsuga menziesii/Gaultheria shallon-Rhododendron macrophyllum  LIDE3-PSME/GASH-RHMA3 (N=80; NRCS=46, BLM=34)  Distribution. This common Association occurs on both sides of the coastal crest. It is common throughout the western Siskiyou National Forest and the Myrtlewood Resource Area of the Coos Bay District, Bureau of Land Management. It is also commonly found east of the coastal crest, north of Township 36 South. It only rarely occurs in the Illinois Valley area. Distinguishing Characteristics. Sites occur on both sides of the coastal crest, mostly on lower slope or bottom topographic positions. Most sites occur on sandstone. North aspects are favored, particularly on inland sites. Like other associations that straddle the crest, relative cover of species can be used to distinguish among the associations. Soils. Sandstone is the most common parent material. However, sites can also be   LIDE3 31 ultramafic or gabbro. Based on 34 samples, average soil depth is greater than 39 inches. Textures are mostly sandy loam, less often silt loam and silty clay loam. Average rock fragment content is 48 percent, mostly gravel (averaging 41 percent) in size. Environment. Elevation averages about 2500 feet. Average annual temperature is about 50 degrees F. Average annual precipitation is about 123 inches, the second highest rate for the Series. Slopes average 34 percent, but can be steeper, particularly on inland sites. Pacific rhododendron and evergreen huckleberry are subordinate to salal, since elevation is near the high end of the Series range. Evergreen huckleberry cover is highest at approximately 1000 feet in elevation. Vegetation Composition and Structure. Species richness, low for the Series, is 26. Occurrence of this Association is localized, therefore, environmental variation is low. Shrub and herb richness are below the Series average. The overstory is the usual complement of species including golden chinquapin, sugar pine, Pacific madrone, and tanoak. Rarely, white fir and western white pine may be found, particularly at the higher elevations. Typically, tanoak dominates the regeneration layer; Douglasfir is a common competitor. Golden chinquapin, common in this Association, often indicates rockier soils. Rarely, wet site indicators such as western hemlock, western redcedar, Pacific yew, and red alder may be present at low cover. Salal and Pacific rhododendron totally dominate the shrub layer. Rarely, on the driest sites, poison oak or hair honeysuckle may be present. Common beargrass is more abundant on the drier sites, while western sword-fern characterizes the wettest sites. Braken rarely occurs, but when present, it is often abundant.

GX050-62-5468344	The     Common Conifers of Southeast Alaska                                 T he temperate rain forest of the panhandle of Alaska     is widely known for its lush vegetation. Conifers, cone-bearing     trees such as hemlock, and spruce, seem to be everywhere. In     reality, they cover a bit over half of southeast Alaska. Western     hemlock (70 percent) and Sitka spruce (20 percent) are the most     abundant. Western red cedar, yellow-cedar, mountain hemlock,     and shore pine make up most of the rest.

The needles are small, pointed,     smoth, and flattened tot eh branch. Though commonly called cedars,     they are members of the cypress family. Yellow-cedar, also known     as Alaska cedar, is named for its bright yellow heartwood, and     western redcedar, for its deep reddish brown heartwood. Both     are aromatic and highly resistant to rot.  Here's how to tell     them apart:                                       Yellow-cedar -  Chamaecyparis     nootkatensis                                              Leaves                      Dark green, 1/16 to 1/8 inch long                                         Cones                      Patchy green and black, nearly round,       1/2 inch in diameter         Scattered among the needles         Sharp central point on each cone scale                                         Bark                      Shreddy, generally ash gray                                         Size at maturity and lifespan                      40 to 80 feet in height and 1 to 2 feet       in diameter         Slow-growing trees, 15 to 20 inches in       diameter at 200 to 300 years         Up to 1,000 years                                         Distribution                      Muskegs, alpine meadows, and nearby forests       of Southeast Alaska as far north as Prince William Sound         Sea level to timberline in Southeast Alaska,       though mainly at elevation of 500 to 1,200 feet         Common in northern Southeast Alaska scattered       in southern Southeast.

Common mountain juniper ,  Juniperus communis , is a low-spreading     evergreen shrub that grows in muskegs, and on dry slopes and     rock outcrops in alpine or subalpine areas.                                  Two fir species,  Pacific silver fir ,      abies amabilis  and  subalpine fir ,  abies lasiocarpa,      are found in this region.The Pacific silver fir is mainly found     east and south of Ketchikan on well-drained sites from sea level     to 1,000 feet in elevation. The subalpine fir is most common     in Misty Fjords National Monument, the head of Lynn Canal, and     in areas of recent glaciation, such as valley bottoms, or on     moist subalpine slopes near timberline.                                  Pacific Yew ,      Taxus brevifolia , is rare in Southeast Alaska and found     only in the most southern part of the panhandle.

GX258-03-2514327	LIDE3 32 TANOAK-DOUGLAS-FIR/SALAL-DWARF OREGONGRAPE Lithocarpus densiflorus-Pseudotsuga menziesii/Gaultheria shallon-Berberis nervosa LIDE3-PSME/GASH-BENE2 (N=71; BLM=45, NRCS=26)  Distribution. Except for several sites just west of the coastal crest, this Association occurs mostly on the east side. Medford Bureau of Land Management District sites straddle the Grants Pass and Glendale Resource Areas. Only a few sites were found south of Township 36 South in the Grants Pass Resource Area. Most Forest Service sites are on the Gold Beach Ranger District, Siskiyou National Forest. although the Association may be found further south. Distinguishing Characteristics. Most sites occur east of the coastal crest on lower slope or bottom positions. Soils are usually sandstone. Climate is slightly cooler and drier than the average tanoak site, thus its difficult to key in the field. Dwarf Oregongrape's consistent presence, at cover greater than 5 percent, contrasted with the relative lack of evergreen huckleberry and Pacific rhododendron, separate this association from others in the Series.   LIDE3 33 Soils. Sandstone is the most common parent material. Less often sites are diorite or ultramafic. Based on 45 samples, average soil depth is greater than 38 inches. Textures are mostly sandy loam and silt loam, less often sandy clay loam. Average rock fragment content is 44 percent, mostly gravel size. Environment. Elevation averages about 2800 feet; coastal sites are slightly lower. Average annual temperature is about 48 degrees F. Average annual precipitation is about 87 inches. This combination seems to favor dwarf Oregongrape over salal, evergreen huckleberry, and Pacific rhododendron, the three most common shrubs associated with tanoak. Dwarf Oregongrape, however, has a greater elevational range than any of the three. It is more common on higher sites. Slopes average 39 percent, but can be greater than 60 percent. See the graph on page LIDE3 3. Vegetation Composition and Structure. Total species richness, high for the Series, is 26. Tree layers are richer than most other associations. As usual, the overstory is dominated by Douglas-fir. Golden chinquapin is found in both tree layers, while western hemlock is rarely present. In addition to the species listed in the table below, the wetter site indicators, Pacific yew, red alder, and big-leaf maple may also be present. Salal dominates most sites and baldhip rose is usually present (it is of limited use, however as it only indicates that you are in the woods). Evergreen huckleberry is present on the wettest sites and occasionally poison oak or hairy honeysuckle may be present (consistent indicators of the driest sites). Common beargrass and whipplevine are the more abundant herbs, but some of the more ephemeral species, such as western starflower and vanillaleaf, may also be present.

GX259-05-3020990	TSHE 48 WESTERN HEMLOCK/VINE MAPLE-PACIFIC RHODODENDRON Tsuga heterophylla/Acer circinatum-Rhododendron macrophyllum TSHE/ACCI-RHMA3 (N=28; FS=28)  Distribution. This Association occurs on all Ranger Districts of the Umpqua National Forest and on the Prospect Ranger District, Rogue River National Forest. Distinguishing Characteristics. This Association is present at high elevations which are cool into the spring months. Salal is rarely present, but Pacific rhododendron is almost always present; abundance varies. The cool site indicators white fir and thinleaved huckleberry are frequently encountered. Soils. Parent material is most commonly andesite, but may also be basalt, tephra, breccia, highly weathered sandstone, granite, gabbro, or rhyolite. Based on four plots sampled, soils are moderately deep and well drained. Surface textures are loams and silt loams with 10 to 20 percent rock fragments and 10 to 20 percent clay. The subsurface textures are silt loams with 20 to 50 percent rock fragments. The soil moisture regime is probably udic, and the soil temperature regime may be   TSHE 49 either mesic or frigid. Soils classify into the following subgroups: Typic Dystrochrepts and Typic Haplumbrepts. Environment. This Association averages 4040 feet and occurs on most aspects, although rarely on south aspects. Slope averages 36 percent and ranges from 0 to 75 percent. This Association occurs frequently on upper slope positions. Vegetation Composition and Structure. Total species richness is very high for the Series, averaging 37 species. The overstory tree layer is dominated by Douglas-fir, with lesser amounts of western hemlock and white fir.

GX261-27-9576264	"Sand Point/Magnuson Park Design Guidelines Manual  4.1 Site Guidelines  4  4.1.5 Planting Existing Conditions  Only a remnant vestige remains of the historic landscape of Sand Point, on Promontory Hill in the southeast portion of the site. The second growth conifers in this area give a hint of the rolling, forested character of the landscape that existed prior to pioneer settlement. The second growth canopy is composed of a combination of evergreen trees (Douglas fir, cedar, hemlock, and madrona) and deciduous trees (willow, cottonwood, and vine maple). The Mud Lake and Pontiac Bay areas previously had wetland shorelines, with small volume streams flowing to Lake Washington. As the Naval Station was developed, the forest, wetlands and knolls gave way to open, level expanses of airplane runways and Navy facilities. Within the Naval Station the original street trees were planted in the 1930s and many trees from that era remain, including large trees along Sand Point Way, deodar cedars along 62nd Avenue NE, ornamental trees throughout the residential open space, and other scattered trees throughout the remaining site (Photo 4.1.5.1). In addition to trees, significant historical plantings and garden areas exist within the Naval Station (Photo 4.1.5.2). South of Building 26 South, a remnant of a brick lined rose garden remains, and the gardens of the adjacent officer's quarters on the east side of 62nd Avenue NE still evoke the character of the original planting designs. In 1975, the Navy relinquished the airfields for use as a NOAA facility and a Seattle park. The character of the new Magnuson Park parcel was founded on a plan prepared by the firm of Jones and Jones in 1975. This plan aimed to restore a ""natural"" character to the site. Discrete areas of the site were designed to convey a particular landscape character (e.g., natural shorelines, grasslands, wetlands, and active recreation fields) in an effort to recall some of the original site features. In a 1988 plan, Worthy and Associates reinforced this concept and proposed boulevard plantings along site entry roads (not implemented). One of the major features of both of these plans, and the subsequent EDAW plan from 1993, was the re-establishment of Design Objectives  Photo 4.1.5.1 Deodar cedars in the Sand Point Historic District  Photo 4.1.5.2 Historic landscape at Building 9  Mud Lake and its connecting stream to Lake Washington. Currently the plantings within Magnuson Park are a mix of ornamental species, native plants, and invasive exotics. Irrigation within the park is limited to active recreation turf areas.  When looked at from a landscape perspective, there are three major environments at Sand Point/Magnuson Park, based on existing vegetation as well as planned future uses: the proposed Historic District, an active recreation zone, and a passive recreation zone (Figure 4.1.5.1). The major design objective for the Historic District is to preserve and enhance the existing landscape settings of the Naval Station to maintain the historic 1930s character, by ensuring that new projects and restorations adhere to the stylistic landscape character of this era. The major objective for the active recreation zone is to 4 - 43   4  4.1 Site Guidelines  Sand Point/Magnuson Park Design Guidelines Manual  4 - 44   Sand Point/Magnuson Park Design Guidelines Manual  4.1 Site Guidelines  4  create a landscape setting which provides a complementary transition from the historic district to the more naturalized Magnuson Park on the east (Photo 4.1.5.3), while providing planting and turf areas that can accommodate intense group recreation activities and present an efficient, orderly, and low maintenance park setting. T he principal objective of the passive r ecreation zone is to preserve the open character of the passive recreation areas within Magnuson Park and enhance wildlife habitat. Design Criteria   Simplify planting types and layout to ensure moderate maintenance.  Use planting to assist in organizing facilities to create a sense of setting within the active recreation area. Passive Recreation  Restore the landscape to a stable naturalized plant community which emphasizes native plants and balances human access and wildlife habitat needs.  Create informal and naturalistic planting designs which follow the subtleties of existing and proposed topography, drainage, aspect, and soil conditions.  Maintain the open savanna-like character of Magnuson Park (Photo 4.1.5.4). Technical Guidelines  Historic District  Preserve 1930s historical landscape character by using plants and design conventions from the era as well as the original design documents of the Naval Station.  Increase the overall quantity and quality of tree, shrub, and ground cover plantings throughout the proposed Historic District while keeping in mind the limited maintenance budget of the City agencies.  Allow flexibility in plant type decisions in new landscape designs. Incorporate a significant number of historic plants and utilize them in an historical planting design manner.  Preserve existing mature street trees and replant new large-scale trees to ensure the existing character of the street tree canopy. Active Recreation  Enhance and create active landscape areas that can accommodate intense group recreation use.  The following technical guidelines should be referred to in a variety of situations, from preparing conceptual design ideas to developing planting plans. They give input ranging from specific techniques to general design treatment. Historic District  Maintain remnant ornamental plantings such as the historic formal rose gardens, south of Building 26 South (Photo 4.1.5.5). Use these plantings as the foundation of future plantings design to the degree possible.  Maintain the tradition of foundation plantings adjacent to the building facades, particularly at entries and along primary walkways (Figure 4.1.5.2).  Photo 4.1.5.3 Looking east into the active recreation zone of Magnuson Park  Photo 4.1.5.4 Viewing east to Lake Washington from Sand Point Head 4 - 45   4  4.1 Site Guidelines  Sand Point/Magnuson Park Design Guidelines Manual  Figure 4.1.5.2 Formal entry landscape at former Navy buildings   Preserve and reinforce view corridors with new plantings and by pruning or removing selected existing plantings. Thin the existing tightly spaced tree planting to ensure future health of trees.  Preserve and enhance existing street tree plantings, especially the deodar cedar trees along 62nd Avenue NE. Plant similar species as individual trees die, except for cottonwoods and poplars which should slowly be replaced by tree species with less aggressive root systems. Be familiar with original planting plans in archives when specifying plants.  As and aid to designers, a list of historic plants has been provided, based on archived drawings (see Table 4.1.5.1, or consult the archived historic landscape plans). Augment this list with plants that are in character with the historic plantings, drought tolerant species when appropriate, and native plants. Confirm that plants from this historic list perform adequately in the Seattle area. Suggest reasonable substitutions if similar plants exist which are more suited to Northwest conditions.   Target specific discrete areas within public rights-ofway for establishment of richer plantings featuring perennials and small shrubs. These should be associated with high visibility, high use public areas such as seating areas or the traffic islands in front of Buildings 9, 25, and 47, originally planted in turf.  Select appropriate trees, shrubs, and ground covers with cultural requirements consistent with the setting  Photo 4.1.5.5 Rose garden south of Building 26S 4 - 46   Sand Point/Magnuson Park Design Guidelines Manual  4.1 Site Guidelines  4  which will grow to the desired mature size with a reasonable amount of care. Provide adequate clearance between plant material and building facade to prevent damage to building by plant materials.  Do not prune trees and shrubs into individual elements. Allow trees and shrubs to grow into their characteristic form and mature size while forming groves or masses. Topping shrubs and trees should be avoided.  Provide permanent sprayhead irrigation systems for each building or area landscape which is restored with new plantings. If possible, link irrigation systems to a central computerized control system which monitors flow rates, evaporation, and daily rainfall.  Utilize turf grasses as the predominant ground cover in larger areas accessible via mowers. Maintain existing turf on steep erodible slopes. Provide noninvasive ground cover plants such as Periwinkle beneath all shrubs in planting areas.  Maintain current steep slope turf areas. Do not utilize turf on new or restored slopes greater than 3:1. Active Recreation  Design landscape areas to be compatible with intense public use, to hold up under heavy pedestrian traffic, and to withstand short cutting through planting areas and across lawns.  The landscape character should be defined by tree plantings and lawn areas. Limit the extent of landscape plantings to accommodate open, flexible circulation, visibility, and to reduce maintenance and irrigation demand.  Provide shade trees adjacent to all sports field areas and at play areas and site furniture locations to ensure summer shade for users, particularly in the afternoon.  Plant shade trees adjacent to streets and in parking lots to break up expanses of paving, provide shade, and enhance the pedestrian scale.  Provide turf in all sports field areas except within the infield of baseball fields. Underdrain recreation turf in all areas with drainage problems. Use open swale drainage conveyances between fields for drainage and water quality. Surface drainage from rainfall and  irrigation systems should be connected to designated wet areas within Magnuson Park.  Minimize mown turf, other than athletic fields, to avoid attracting geese. Other deterrents to geese include letting meadows grow tall between fields, and maintaining a tall vegetation buffer between water and turf .  Utilize a free-draining soil material for turf areas which enhances long-term turf management (e.g., sand). Field levels will need to be significantly raised from existing elevations for positive drainage in most of Activity Area 4.  Irrigate all regularly used recreation turf and associated planting areas to ensure these areas are maintained to City Parks standards. Passive Recreation  Preserve and enhance the five habitat types documented to appear in Magnuson Park (Audubon Society 1997): Forest, Scrub/Shrub, Meadow/Wet Meadow, Managed and Disturbed Areas, and Shoreline.  Focus plant restoration efforts on preserving and enhancing habitat.  Maintain the natural character of the Magnuson Park landscape by avoiding formal planting arrangements and encouraging loose, informal, naturalistic landscape treatments.  Preserve the open, savanna-like character of the central and shoreline sections of Magnuson Park. Restrict new, existing, and naturalized tree plantings to limited areas which complement and enhance existing open views and view corridors (Figure 4.1.5.3).  Maintain the forested setting of Promontory Hill in the southeast corner of the park.  Follow prescriptions for site restoration noted in the recent Magnuson Park habitat report (Audubon Society 1997). Establish a program to eliminate or control invasive exotic species and promote the introduction of native species (see Table 4.1.5.2 at the end of this section for plant list), particularly in wildlife habitat areas. Eradicate to the extent possible the following species: Reed-canary grass, Himalayan Blackberry, Scot's Broom, Ivy, Pyracantha, Holly,  4 - 47   4  4.1 Site Guidelines  Sand Point/Magnuson Park Design Guidelines Manual  Figure 4.1.5.3 View from Sand Point Head  Clematis, Purple Loosestrife, and Poplar. While elimination of all exotic species may not be feasible, management of exotic species is a realistic goal. Focus efforts on mechanical plant removal measures. Avoid using chemical means to eradicate exotic species, except as a last resort, and then only in clearly defined situations under controlled conditions.  Survey existing hydrology and soils to determine specific cultural characteristics of the various settings within Magnuson Park.  Emphasize native plants, drought tolerance, hardiness, vigor, and aesthetic appropriateness when establishing new plantings.  Maintenance of new and existing plantings should be minimized by proper selection of species, planting in fall or early spring, deep soil preparation and proper drainage, mulching, weed eradication, and if necessary temporary irrigation.  Site irrigation should be limited to swimming beach areas and temporary irrigation measures for new plantings or restoration areas.  Restrict turf irrigation to limited high visibility, high use lawn areas. Irrigate all recreation turf areas. Large, informal open space areas of turf should be left 4 - 48  unirrigated. General Irrigation  Irrigate all new tree and shrub plantings either with permanent irrigation systems, temporary systems, or quick couplers and hose bibbs. New tree plantings in unirrigated lawn areas, along streets, or otherwise isolated from planting beds should have individual bubbler type irrigation.  Restrict turf irrigation to limited high visibility, high use lawn areas. Irrigate all recreation turf areas. Large, informal open space areas of turf should be left unirrigated.  Permanent irrigation systems should utilize conventional pop-up sprayhead type irrigation equipment which meets City standards and specifications. Provide flow metering, electronic controllers, and central control capabilities.  Irrigation systems should be separated by building, project area, or activity zone and be accompanied by individual irrigation controllers.  Restrict irrigation on all steep slopes and in planting areas less than 5' wide.

GX027-65-2519941	Intro     Author     Subject     Volume     Volume/Title     Home                  MOUNT RAINIER NATURE NOTES     Vol. XI   October - 1933   No. 8                   The biblical phrase which titles this article aptly describes many of our flowering plants at this season.  All of them, of course, bear fruit or seeds but in some of these this character is so unique or conspicuous that the beauty and interest of the plant in the fall season easily outstrips its spring beauty.            Throughout the summer one may have wondered along the woodland trails where the Western Yew tree grows and, in spite of several distinctions, failed to recognize it as something other than a conifer or cone bearing tree.  The foliage of the Yew is very similar in general appearance to that of some of its forest associates.  But at this season we cannot fail to note the difference.  The fruit - a small hard seed partially surrounded by a brilliant red, jelly-like covering or aril - is sharply contrasted to the green of the tree's foliage.  It cannot, in any way be confused with a cone, and so the Yew at this season, stands very much apart from its associates.                          All along the roads within the park - and beyond its borders too in some places - we see the bright red berries of the Red Elderberry and we find, too, the large attractive leaves of the Devil's Club (attractive so long as one does not touch them) rendered even more conspicuous by the spike of brilliant crimson berries that characterizes this plant at this time.                  One of the most attractive of the herbacious plants in late summer and early fall is the Queenscup or Alpine Beauty.  By this time the single white flower has given way to a beautiful turquois berry that adequately holds the interest of the flower lover in this plant.  And where we have been accustomed to finding a multitude of blooms of the familiar Avalanche Lily we now find in their place seed pods instead. Unfortunately the flower of this plant is so beautiful that the seed pod, however interesting, would have a hard time measuring up to its predecessor's standards.  This is not the case of the Western Anemone though!  True - the flower is beautiful in the early summer; but the seed pods - shaggy mops of silken strands, each strand attached to a seed - are to most people far more interesting than the flower which they probably have not even associated with the unique fruit cluster of the late summer.  There is one interesting thing in the case of this latter plant.  The flower blooms upon a short stem but a few inches above the ground.  There is no need for the plant to be raised higher at that season.  But as the season progresses the stem continues to grow until when the seeds are ripe and ready for dessimination the plant is some twelve to fourteen inches tall.  The reason?  This plant depends up the wind to scatter its seeds and so it raises its cluster of seeds, high so that the wind may accomplish its purpose in this regard to better advantage.                  In the case of the Sweet-After-Death the feathery white cluster of flowers give way to a small but unique crescent-shaped fruit.  The flowers of the White Rhododendron find their destiny in the capsule which eventually splits into five parts to scatter the seeds.  The familiar Salal - of which two species are found in the park - bears dark blue (almost black) berry while the Oregon Grape receives its name not from the flower but from the fruit.  So does the Huckleberry. There's a natural fruit that's really appreciated!    (C.F.B.)

The VRU information was obtained from the South Fork Clearwater River Landscape Assessment (USFS 1998). The HTG information was obtained from the document Biophysical Classification  Habitat Groups and Descriptions 5/96. Vegetation Response Units The VRUs are broad ecological land units that display unique patterns of habitat type groups (potential vegetation) and terrain. A VRU classification and delineation was developed for the South Fork Clearwater River Subbasin. Detailed information for each VRU within the subbasin is provided below. VRU 1: Convex Slopes, Subalpine Fir This VRU is common in the South Fork Clearwater River Subbasin at mid and upper elevations. Grand fir and subalpine fir habitat types are dominant. Historic Conditions Lodgepole pine was historically dominant in many settings in this VRU. Engelmann spruce, western larch, Douglas fir, and whitebark pine were less common. Wet meadows are important elements of this landscape. The relative proportion of trees by size class was about 5-10% non-forest (non-stocked), 20-30% seedling/sapling, 20-30% pole, 20-30% medium tree, and 5-15% large tree at any given time over this VRU in the subbasin. Old growth was typically limited to moist draw bottoms and north slopes and usually comprised from 10 to 15% of the area. Large, infrequent (75 to 150 years) severe fires were typical of most settings. Historically, about 700 acres burned per year in the subbasin. About 60-80% of stands originated from stand-replacing fires, and 20-40% from mixed severity fires. Moist lower slopes were most prone to mixed fire. Lodgepole pine, western larch, and Douglas fir sometimes survived one or more fires to form a scattered overstory. Large blocks (500 to 2,000 acres) of pole and medium-size fire-killed trees were typically present at any time within any 10,000 acres of this VRU. Mountain pine beetle activity cycled with fire in lodgepole pine and may have been important in developing fuel conditions that favored stand-replacing fires. Changes from Historic Conditions  With advancing forest succession and fire suppression, seral lodgepole pine, western larch, and whitebark pine have declined, and more shade tolerant grand fir and subalpine fir have increased. Lodgepole pine forests have decreased by 12% and Engelmann spruce-subalpine fir forests have increased by 9%. Blister rust has further reduced whitebark pine populations. H- 1 Appendix H   South Fork Clearwater River Subbasin Assessment and TMDLs  October 2003  Today, only about 70 acres of this VRU burn per year in the subbasin; a 90% decrease. Advancing forest succession has resulted in an 88% reduction in trees in the seedling/sapling structural stage and a 37% increase in trees in the medium and large tree stages. Fire suppression has also resulted in increased stand densities, as shade tolerant understories develop. Harvest has affected about 10% of the area. Recent harvest patterns have replaced large-scale, infrequent burned areas with frequent, small harvested areas more uniformly distributed across watersheds than the historical burned areas. The average harvest unit size is smaller than historic burn patch and there is not as much diversity in frequency of structural stages within subwatersheds. Each watershed is more like other watersheds in terms of the representation of structural stages. Due to fire suppression, extensive snag patches that result from large fires are no longer created. VRU 2: Glaciated Slopes, Subalpine Fir This VRU is common in the South Fork Clearwater River Subbasin at upper elevations. Subalpine fir and whitebark pine habitat types are dominant. Historic Conditions Lodgepole pine, Engelmann spruce, and subalpine fir were historically dominant on side slopes in this VRU. Whitebark pine was important on ridges. Rock outcrops, lakes and wetlands, and montane parklands were important elements of this landscape. The relative proportion of trees by size class was about 10-25% non-forest, 10-30% seedling/sapling, 30-65% pole, and 5-15% medium tree. Old growth was typically limited to moist trough bottoms and open ridges and usually comprised less than 10% of the area. Historically about 400 acres burned per year in the subbasin. Midslopes tended to experience stand-replacing fires at infrequent intervals (75 to 150 years). Open ridges or moist valley bottoms were more prone to mixed severity fires. Medium blocks (100 to 1,000 acres) of pole-size fires killed trees were often present at any time within 20,000 acres of this VRU. Changes from Historic Conditions With advancing forest succession and fire suppression, seral whitebark pine has declined. Blister rust has further reduced whitebark pine by a total of more than 75%. More shade tolerant Engelmann spruce-subalpine fir forests have increased more than 70%. Today, only about 18 acres burn each year in the subbasin, a 96% decrease. Advancing forest succession has resulted in an 84% decline in non-forest openings, a 71% decline in trees in the seedling/sapling structural stage, a 74% decline in trees in the pole stage, and a 746% increase in trees in the medium and large tree stages. Fire suppression has also resulted in increased stand densities in Engelmann spruce-subalpine fir forests, as shade tolerant understories develop. No recorded harvest has occurred. Due to fire suppression, extensive snag patches that result from large fires are no longer created.  H- 2  Appendix H   South Fork Clearwater River Subbasin Assessment and TMDLs  October 2003  VRU 3: Stream Breaklands, Grand Fir and Douglas Fir This VRU is common at lower to mid elevations in canyons in the South Fork Clearwater River Subbasin. Historic Conditions Small to medium blocks (10 to 200 acres) of pole and medium-size fire-killed trees were abundant at any time within any 10,000 acres of this VRU. Old growth pine and western larch, bunchgrass, understories, and rock outcrops are important elements of this landscape. On the VRU as a whole, the relative proportion of trees by size class was about 5-20% nonforest or non-stocked, 5-30% seedling/sapling, 10-20% pole, 20-40% medium tree, and 20-40% large tree. On south aspects, dry Douglas fir habitat types were dominant. Open stands of large Douglas fir and ponderosa pine were historically common. Low and mixed severity fires occurred at very frequent intervals (5 to 25 years) on south aspects. Here, 60-90% of the stands survived through one or more fires. Ponderosa pine old growth occupied about 40 to 60% of these warm dry sites. On north aspects, grand fir habitat types were dominant. Grand fir and Douglas fir were common cover types, with ponderosa pine and western larch and sometimes Engelmann spruce or lodgepole pine mixed in. Pacific yew grew on lower slopes. Mixed severity fires were common at frequent intervals (25 to 75 years) on north aspects. About 30-60% of the stands retained 10 or more trees per acre through at least one fire. Twenty to 30% of the stands included at least 10 trees per acre older than 150 years. Ponderosa pine, western larch, Douglas fir, and grand fir formed the old overstory. Changes from Historic Conditions With advancing forest succession and fire suppression, ponderosa pine/Douglas fir forests have declined by 13%. Annual grasslands and weedlands have increased. Timber harvest has resulted in a 128% increase in non-forest (non-stocked) openings. Forest succession and fire suppression have resulted in a 33% decline in trees in the seedling/sapling structural stage, an 83% decline in trees in the pole stage, a 36% decrease in trees in the medium tree stage, and a 6% increase in trees in the large tree stage. However, more of the large trees are in mixed conifer and less in open pine stands than before. Timber harvest has affected about 11% of the Forest lands in the subbasin over 50 years. Today, about 255 acres burn annually in the subbasin, a decline of 70%. Prescribed fire on dry south aspects burns an additional 500 to 1,000 acres annually. The ratio of stand replacement harvest to mixed or low severity treatments has been about 60% replacement to 34% less severe treatments. This is probably within the range of natural variability, but harvest has, until recently, favored removal of the fire tolerant overstory pine and retention of understory Douglas fir and grand fir, the reverse of fire disturbance effects. This is a higher ratio of stand replacement than would have occurred under natural disturbance regimes. Total canopy cover appears to have declined. Whether this is due to increased mortality from insects and disease or harvest is uncertain.  H- 3  Appendix H   South Fork Clearwater River Subbasin Assessment and TMDLs  October 2003  Due to fire suppression, extensive snag patches that result from large fires are no longer created. VRU 4: Rolling Hills, Grand Fir This VRU is common in the South Fork Clearwater River Subbasin at low and mid elevations. Grand fir habitat types are dominant. Historic Conditions Grand fir, Douglas fir, ponderosa pine, and western larch were historically dominant in this VRU. Lodgepole pine and Engelmann spruce were less common. Old growth pine and western larch and meadow complexes were important elements of this landscape. The relative proportion of trees by size class was about 5-10% non-forest, 5-50% seedling/sapling, 10-30% pole, 20-30% medium tree, and 10-50% large tree. Mixed and stand-replacing fires occurred at moderate intervals. About 50-60% of stands originated from stand-replacing fires and 40-50% experienced mixed and low severity fires. Ponderosa pine, western larch, Douglas fir, and grand fir often survived mixed severity fires to form a scattered overstory of old large trees. Ten to 25% of the stands included at least 10 trees per acre older than 150 years. Small to large blocks (1,100 to 2,000 acres) of pole-size trees to large fire-killed trees were common at any time within any 10,000 acres of this VRU. Changes from Historic Conditions  With advancing forest succession and fire suppression, ponderosa pine/Douglas fir forests have declined by 32%. Lodgepole pine forests have decreased by 31%. Grand fir/Douglas fir forests have increased by 43%. Forest succession and fire suppression have resulted in a 33% decline in trees in the seedling/sapling structural stage and a 12% decrease in trees in the large tree stage. The harvest of overstory pines has been most concentrated in this VRU, affecting about 29% of the Forest acres within the last 50 years. Today, about 5 acres burn annually in the subbasin, a decline of 99%. The ratio of stand replacement harvest to mixed or low severity treatments has been about 60% replacement to 40% less severe treatments. This is slightly more replacement than would have occurred under natural disturbance regimes. This is probably within the range of natural variability, but harvest has, until recently, favored removal of the fire tolerant overstory pine and retention of understory Douglas fir and grand fir, the reverse of fire disturbance effects. Total canopy cover appears to be about the same. Due to fire suppression, extensive snag patches that result from large fires are no longer created. VRU 5: Moraines, Subalpine Fir and Grand Fir This VRU is rare in the South Fork Clearwater River Subbasin at mid to upper elevations. Grand fir and subalpine fir habitat types are dominant. Lodgepole pine and Engelmann spruce are common seral species. Grand fir, Douglas fir, subalpine fir, and western larch are minor components.  H- 4  Appendix H   South Fork Clearwater River Subbasin Assessment and TMDLs  October 2003  Historic Conditions In swales, Engelmann spruce-subalpine fir old growth was usually extensive between areas where rare, large, stand-replacing fires occurred in this VRU. About 10-20% of stands included at least 10 trees per acre older than 150 years. Wetlands and old growth Engelmann spruce-subalpine fir forests were important elements of this landscape. The relative proportion of trees by size class was about 5% non-forest (non-stocked), 10-40% seedling/sapling, 20-60% pole, 5-30% medium tree, and 3-10% large tree. Mixed and stand-replacing fires occurred at infrequent intervals. About 35% of the stands originated from stand-replacing fires and 65% experienced mixed or low severity fires. Small to large blocks (100 to 2,000 acres) of pole-size to medium-size fire killed trees occurred occasionally within any 10,000 acres of this VRU. Changes from Historic Conditions With advancing forest succession and fire suppression, mixed conifer and Engelmann spruce-subalpine fir forests have increased. It is uncertain if whitebark pine was ever an important component in this area, but it is present now in only very small amounts. Forest succession and fire suppression have resulted in declines in trees in the seedling/sapling and pole structural stages and increases in trees in the medium and large trees stages. Harvest has affected about 19% of the Forest acres within the last 50 years. No acres have burned in the subbasin since fire suppression became effective. The ratio of stand replacement harvest to mixed or low severity treatments has been about 70% replacement to 30% less severe treatments. This is probably more replacement than would have occurred under natural disturbance regimes. Due to fire suppression, extensive snag patches that result from large fires are no longer created. VRU 6: Cold Basins, Grand Fir and Subalpine Fir This VRU is very common in the subbasin at mid elevations. Grand fir and subalpine fir habitat types are dominant. Historic Conditions Lodgepole pine was the dominant seral species in this VRU. Western larch, Douglas fir, and Engelmann spruce were important. Grand fir was important on mesic sites. Whitebark pine was found occasionally. Five to 15% of stands included at least 10 trees per acre older than 150 years. Large disturbances and meadow complexes were important elements of this landscape. The relative proportion of trees by size class was 5-10% non-forest (non-stocked), 10-30% seedling/sapling, 30-45%pole, 20-40% medium tree, and 5-20% large tree. Medium to large stand-replacing fires occurred at infrequent interval (75 to 150 years). About 60-90% of the stands originated from stand-replacing fires and 10-40% experienced mixed severity fires. Moderate to large blocks (500 to 1,000 acres) of pole-size to medium-size fire-killed trees were common at any time within any 10,000 acres of this VRU.  H- 5  Appendix H   South Fork Clearwater River Subbasin Assessment and TMDLs  October 2003  Changes from Historic Conditions With advancing forest succession and fire suppression, lodgepole pine has decreased by 23% and more shade tolerant mixed conifer and Engelmann spruce-subalpine fir forests have increased by 30%. Whitebark pine has essentially disappeared as even a minor component. Forest succession and fire suppression have resulted in a 53% decline in trees in the seedling/sapling stage, a 46% decline in trees in the pole structural stage, a 32% increase in trees in the medium tree stage, and a 20% increase in trees in the large tree stage. Riparian meadows appear to have declined either due to forest encroachment or agricultural conversion. Harvest has affected about 18% of the Forest acres within the last 50 years. About 13 acres have burned annually in the subbasin since fire suppression became effective, a decline of about 99%. The ratio of stand replacement harvest to mixed or low severity treatments has been about 70% replacement to 30% less severe treatments. This is probably within the range of what would have occurred under natural disturbance regimes. Due to fire suppression, extensive snag patches that result from large fires are no longer created. VRU 7: Moist Uplands, Grand Fir and Pacific Yew This VRU is common in the subbasin at mid elevations, but quite rare elsewhere in northern Idaho. Mesic grand fir habitat types are dominant and Pacific yew phases are common. Historic Conditions Grand fir, Douglas fir, and Pacific yew were the dominant species in this VRU. Western larch, Engelmann spruce, and lodgepole pine were less common. Old overstory trees (grand fir, western larch, Douglas fir, Engelmann spruce, and lodgepole pine) were common. About 30-40% of stands had 10 or more trees per acre older than 150 years. Two or more age classes were common. Pacific yew and mesic old growth were important elements of this landscape. The relative proportion of trees by size class was about 1  10% non-forest (nonstocked), 5-20% seedling/sapling, 10-25% pole, 25-35% medium tree, and 35-45% large tree. Small to medium fires of mixed severity occurred at infrequent intervals (75 to 150 years). Large stand-replacing fires occurred more infrequently. About 60% of the stands experienced mixed severity fires and about 40% originated from stand-replacing fires. Small and scattered blocks (5-100 acres) and infrequent large blocks of fire-killed medium and large trees occurred occasionally within any 10,000 acres of this VRU. Changes from Historic Conditions With harvest and planting, Douglas fir/ponderosa pine forests have increased 107%. Upland and riparian shrublands have declined. Forest succession and fire suppression have resulted in a 57% decline in trees in the seedling/sapling stage, a 45% decline in trees in the pole structural stage, and a 22% increase in trees in the large tree stage. Harvest has affected about 28% of the Forest acres within the last 50 years. About 5 acres have burned annually in the subbasin since fire suppression became effective, a decline of about 99%. The ratio of stand replacement harvest to mixed or low severity treatments has been about 70% replacement to  H- 6  Appendix H   South Fork Clearwater River Subbasin Assessment and TMDLs  October 2003  30% less severe treatments. This relative proportion of stand replacement is higher than would have occurred under natural disturbance regimes. Due to fire suppression, snag patches that result from large fires are no longer created. VRU 8: Stream Breaklands, Cedar and Grand Fir This VRU is rare in the subbasin, but is common north of the subbasin at low and mid elevations. Moist grand fir and cedar habitat types are dominant. Historic Conditions Grand fir and Douglas fir were the dominant species in this VRU. Western larch, western redcedar, western white pine, Engelmann spruce, and Pacific yew were less common. Ponderosa pine and lodgepole pine were minor species. Old overstory trees (Douglas fir, western larch, grand fir, and occasionally ponderosa pine) were common on ridges and lower slopes. About 10-15% of stands had 10 or more trees per acre older than 150 years. Coastal disjunct plant species, early seral tall shrub and hardwood communities, and cedar old growth along major streams were important elements of this landscape. The relative proportion of trees by size class was about 5-20% non-forest (non-stocked), 5-30% seedling/sapling, 10-20% pole, 30-50% medium tree, and 20-30% large tree. Small to medium fires occurred at moderate intervals (25-75 years) and large stand-replacing fires occurred at infrequent intervals (75 to 150 years). About 40-50% of stands experienced mixed severity fires, and 50-60% of stands originated from stand-replacing fires. Small and scattered blocks (5-100 acres) of fire-killed medium-size and large trees were common at any time within any 10,000 acres of this VRU, and large blocks (500 to 1,000 acres) occurred from time to time. Changes from Historic Conditions This VRU is poorly represented in the subbasin and only a few trends can be seen. Western white pine has almost disappeared because of blister rust and forest succession. Shrubs, hardwoods, trees in the seedling/sapling stage, and trees in the pole structural stage have probably declined. Trees in the medium and large tree stages have increased. Harvest has affected 2% of the acres. No acres have burned in the subbasin since fire suppression has become effective, a decline of 100%. Due to fire suppression, extensive snag patches that result from large fires are no longer created. VRU 9: Glaciated Slopes, Subalpine Fir and Whitebark Pine This VRU is rare in the subbasin, at highest elevations, but is more common to the south and east of the subbasin. Cold subalpine fir and whitebark pine habitat types are dominant.  H- 7  Appendix H   South Fork Clearwater River Subbasin Assessment and TMDLs  October 2003  Historic Conditions This VRU was the major stronghold of whitebark pine. Subalpine fir, Engelmann spruce, and lodgepole pine were also common. Old whitebark pine or lodgepole pine were common on rock outcrops and open ridges. About 5-15% of the stands had 10 or more trees per acre older than 150 years. Whitebark pine and open alpine communities were important elements of this landscape. The relative proportion of trees by size class was 30-40% non-forest (nonstocked), 10-30% seedling/sapling, 15-60% pole, 1-10% medium tree, and 1% or less large tree. Mixed severity fires occurred at moderate and infrequent intervals (25 to 10 years). About 40-60% of the stands experienced mixed severity fires and 40-60% of the stands originated from stand-replacing fires. Small to moderate blocks (50-200 acres) of fire-killed trees were common at any one time in any 10,000 acres of this VRU. Changes from Historic Conditions Some conclusions are based on limited data from neighboring watersheds. Anecdotal information suggests that similar changes have occurred in the subbasin. With advancing forest succession, fire suppression, and blister rust, whitebark pine has declined by 69%, and more shade tolerant Engelmann spruce-subalpine fir forests have increased by 190%. Today, only about 12 acres burn per year in the subbasin, a 90% decrease. Advancing forest succession has resulted in a 62% reduction in trees in the seedling/sapling structural stage, a 72% decline in trees in the pole stage, and a 4200% increase in trees in the medium tree stage. No recorded harvest has occurred. Due to fire suppression, snag patches that result from large fires are no longer created. VRU 10: Uplands, Alder, Grand Fir and Subalpine Fir Habitat Types This VRU is common in the South Fork Clearwater River Subbasin, but rare to the south. It is also called the grand fir mosaic. Mesic grand fir, subalpine fir, and alder habitat types are dominant. Historic Conditions Grand fir, Engelmann spruce, subalpine fir, and Sitka alder were historically important cover types in this VRU. Douglas fir, western larch, lodgepole pine, and Pacific yew were common on ridges. About 15-30% of the stands had 10 or more trees per acre older than 150 years. Open canopied and multi-aged old growth and tall shrub communities were important elements of this landscape. The relative proportion of trees by size class was 10-25% nonforest, 15-25% seedling/sapling, 20-30% pole, 25-40% medium tree, and 15-25% large tree. Small fires occurred frequently, but mixed severity infrequent fires were typical. Standreplacing fires were usually confined to ridges. About 40-60% of the stands experienced mixed severity fires and 40-60% of stands originated from stand-replacing fires. Small  H- 8  Appendix H   South Fork Clearwater River Subbasin Assessment and TMDLs  October 2003  blocks (5-50 acres) of fire-killed medium-size and large trees were common at any one time in any 10,000 acres of this VRU. Changes from Historic Conditions With forest succession and fire suppression, shrublands have declined 77%. Other changes in cover type have been minor. Forest succession and fire suppression have resulted in a 91% decline in trees in the seedling/sapling stage, a 63% decline in trees in the pole structural stage, a 25% increase in trees in the medium tree stage, and a 147% increase in trees in the large tree stage. Harvest has affected about 4% of the Forest acres within the last 50 years. About 2 acres have burned annually since fire suppression became effective, a decline of about 99%. The ratio of stand replacement harvest to mixed or low severity treatments has been about 80% replacement to 20% less severe treatments. This relative proportion of stand replacement is higher than what would have occurred under natural disturbance regimes. Due to fire suppression, snag patches that result from large fires are no longer created. VRU 12: Stream Breaklands, Bunchgrass and Shrubland This VRU is rare on National Forest lands in the subbasin, but is common in the lower canyon on private lands. Bluebunch wheatgrass and Idaho fescue habitat types are dominant, and shrubland habitat types are common. Historic Conditions Bluebunch wheatgrass and Idaho fescue were historically important. Shrublands occupied draws or lower slopes. Very frequent (5-25 years) low severity fires maintained open grasslands and rejuvenated shrublands. Changes from Historic Conditions This VRU is poorly represented on Forest lands. On all lands, only general trends are indicated. Disturbed grasslands (annuals and weeds) and pasture have replaced native perennials over more than 50% of their prior extent. Upland shrublands have increased as much as 100% due to fire suppression and brush invasions of former grasslands. About 2 acres have burned annually on National Forest lands in the subbasin since fire suppression became effective, a decline of about 82%. VRU 16: Plateaus, Bunchgrass and Shrubland This VRU occurs only on non-National Forest lands. Bluebunch wheatgrass, Idaho fescue, and shrubland habitat types are common.  H- 9  Appendix H   South Fork Clearwater River Subbasin Assessment and TMDLs  October 2003  Historic Conditions Bluebunch wheatgrass and Idaho fescue were historically important on this VRU. Shrublands occupied draws, lower slopes, and north aspects. Very frequent (5-25 years) low severity fires maintained open grasslands and rejuvenated shrublands. Changes from Historic Conditions On all lands, only general trends can been seen. Annual cropland has replaced native perennials over more than 80% of their prior extent. Hayland and pasture have largely replaced the remaining native prairie. Upland shrublands have probably also decreased. Fire incidence has certainly declined, but to what extent is unknown. VRU 17: Rolling Hills, Cedar and Grand Fir This VRU is rare in the South Fork Clearwater River Subbasin. Mesic grand fir and western redcedar habitat types are dominant. Historic Conditions Grand fir and Douglas fir were historically important cover types on this VRU. Western redcedar, western white pine, western larch, Engelmann spruce, and ponderosa pine were less common. About 20-35% of the stands had 10 or more trees per acre older than 150 years. Ridge top groves of large old cedar and grand fir old growth and early seral tall shrub communities were important elements of this landscape. The relative proportion of trees by size class was 10-25% non-forest, 15-25% seedling/sapling, 20-30% pole, 20-35% medium tree, and 15-40% large tree. Small fires occurred frequently, but mixed severity infrequent (75 to 150 years) fires were typical. About 40-60% of the stands originated from mixed severity fires and 40-60% of the stands originated from stand-replacing fires. Moderate sized blocks (50-500 acres) of firekilled medium-size and large trees were common at any one time in any 10,000 acres of this VRU. Changes from Historic Conditions This VRU is poorly represented in the subbasin and only a few trends can be seen. Western white pine has virtually disappeared due to blister rust and forest succession. Shrubs, hardwoods, trees in the seedling/sapling structural stage, and trees in the pole structural stage have probably declined. Trees in the medium and large tree stages have increased, but numbers of the largest old trees may have been reduced by harvest. Harvest has affected 11% of the acres. The ratio of replacement treatment to less severe treatments has been about 100% replacement. This is well above the historic ratio. No acres have burned in the subbasin since fire suppression has become effective, a decline of 100%. Due to fire suppression, extensive snag patches that result from large fires are no longer created.  H-10  Appendix H   South Fork Clearwater River Subbasin Assessment and TMDLs  October 2003  Habitat Type Groups Habitat type grouping is based on similarities in natural disturbance regimes, successional patterns, and structural characteristics of mature stands. The HTGs are intended to assist with subregional and landscape assessments. The HTGs are separated into forest and nonforest categories. Table H-1 presents vegetation conditions expected for non-forest HTGs and Table H-2 presents vegetation conditions expected for forest HTGs. A detailed description of HTGs is presented below. Forested Habitat Type Groups and Descriptions HTG #1 - Warm and Dry - Pinus ponderosa Types or Pseudotsuga menziesii/Grass Types This HTG is characterized in naturally functioning ecosystems by dry and open-grown parklike stands of Pinus ponderosa or Pseudotsuga menziesii with bunch grass understories. Most of the sites occur on hot and dry landscapes at low elevations and on west and south aspects. A natural fire-free interval of 5 to 25 years on these sites maintained these opengrown park-like stands (Fischer 1987). These fires were low severity, under-burning fires. Stand replacement fires were probably rare. HTG # 2 - Moderately Warm and Dry - Most Pseudotsuga menziesii Types and Dry Abies grandis Types These habitat types are characterized in naturally functioning ecosystems by open-grown stands of Pinus ponderosa or Pseudotsuga menziesii with grass and brush understories. Most of the sites normally occur at lower elevations on many aspects, but are also found at higher elevation on more southerly and westerly aspects. The natural fire-free interval for underburning was historically 5 to 50 years (Fischer 1987). The mostly low- and moderateseverity fires maintained open, park-like stands dominated by Pinus ponderosa. In some cases, stand composition was also high in Pseudotsuga menziesii and Larix occidentalis. Little information is available on stand-replacing fires, but these severe intensity fires occurred only after a fire-free interval probably exceeding 500 years on dry land types and 50-200 years on moist land types (Smith 1995). HTG #3 - Moderately Warm and Moderately Dry - Pseudotsuga menziesii with Linnaea borealis Understory and Most Abies grandis Types This HTG contains a highly variable group of habitat types. The group is a transition type between the dry and moist habitat types. It includes types characteristic of each. These habitat types were characterized in naturally functioning ecosystems by mixed species stands of Pinus ponderosa, Pseudotsuga menziesii, Larix occidentalis, Pinus contorta, and Abies grandix. Understories in absence of fire or other disturbance are composed primarily of dense Pseudotsuga menziesii or Abies grandix thickets, though other tree species may be present. The natural fire-free interval for under-burning was 15 to 50 years. Mixed intensities of moderate and severe fires commonly created mosaics of even-aged stands with  H-11  Appendix H   South Fork Clearwater River Subbasin Assessment and TMDLs  October 2003  survivor individuals and groups of trees (Smith 1995). Also common in this HTG are open, park-like stands dominated by Pinus ponderosa, Larix occidentalis, and Pseudotsuga menziesii. HTG #4 - Moderately Warm and Moist - Abies grandis Asarum and Clintonia Types These are warm and moist habitats that occur along the lower slopes and valley bottoms. The group is highly diverse and nearly all the conifer species in the area can occur in this HTG. Understory vegetation may be dominated by a wide variety of species. The fire-free interval is wide, from 50 years for the drier types to over 200 years for the more moist types. Typical fires are minor ground fires that create a mosaic within the stand. On the other extreme, with drying, a complete stand replacement fire can occur. Many times this is the result of a fire burning from an adjacent and drier type. Fire exclusion on these sites has changed them very little except to reduce the number of acres in early succession types. HTG #5 - Moderately Cool and Moist - Thuja plicata and Tsuga heterophylla Asarum and Clintonia Types These are moderately cool and moist sites. They contain many species, including Thuja plicata, western Tsuga heterophylla, Pseudotsuga menziesii, Picea engelmannii, Abies grandix, Pinus contorta, Tsuga mertensiana, Larix occidentalis, and Pinus monticola. Very high basal areas can be achieved on these types. Fire frequency is low due to the maritime influence on these sites. Fire severity can be highly variable due the common moist conditions, but can be severe during periods of drought. Fire-free intervals range from 50 to greater than 200 years (Fischer 1987). Many species do well on these sites and may thrive for centuries without disturbance. Thuja plicata is the most notable example. HTG #6 - Moderately Cool and Wet - Thuja plicata Athyrium, Oplopanax, and Adiantum Types These are very wet sites. They are forested riparian areas along streams and are associated with wetlands. Due to these very wet conditions, the fire-free interval can be very long. Intervals are probably much longer than the majority of fire group eleven, 50 to greater than 200 years. Centuries may pass without severe, stand-replacing fires (Smith 1995). HTG #7 - Cool and Moist - Clintonia and Menziesia Types These types are characterized by cool and moist site conditions. Species diversity can be high with Larix occidentalis, Pseudotsuga menziesii, Pinus monticola, Picea Engelmannii, Pinus contorta, Abies lasiocarpa, and Abies grandix. Other sites are dominated by Pinus contorta after stand-replacing burns. These sites are probably too cool for Tsuga heterophylla and Thuja plicata. Fire history information is scarce. Fire intervals are estimated at greater than 120 years for most sites (Fischer 1987).  H-12  Appendix H   South Fork Clearwater River Subbasin Assessment and TMDLs  October 2003  HTG #8 - Cool and Wet - Calamagrostis canadensis, Equisetum, Galium, and Streptopus These are very wet sites. They are forested riparian areas along streams and associated with wetlands. Due to these very wet conditions, the fire-free interval can be very long. Intervals between severe, stand-replacing fires are probably much longer than the majority of fire group nine (90 to 130 years) and are probably in excess of 150 years. HTG #9 - Cool and Moderately Dry - Cooler Abies lasiocarpa and Pinus contorta Types These are the cooler Abies lasiocarpa habitat types within the area. The fire-free interval of these types is 50-130 years (Fischer 1987). These periodic fire disturbances and the high number of moderate- to high-intensity fires favor species such as Pinus contorta, Pseudotsuga menziesii, and Larix occidentalis. Other species on these sites are commonly Abies lasiocarpa, Picea, and Pinus albicaulis. Stands dominated by Pinus contorta and over 80 years of age tend to build fuels to become a part of large stand-replacing fire events encompassing thousands of acres (Fischer 1987). These sites, especially in the Vaccinium caespitosum and scoparium types, are quite frosty. HTG #10 - Cold and Moderately Dry - Vaccinium scoparium and Luzula Types These types are upper elevation, cold, dry sites. Many of these sites are above the cold limits of conifers such as Pseudotsuga menziesii, Larix occidentalis, and Pinus monticola. Common species are Pinus albicaulis, Pinus contorta, Tsuga mertensiana, Abies lasiocarpa, and Larix lyallii. The fire-free interval varies considerably from 35 to over 300 years. Stand-replacing fires occur after intervals of more than 200 years (Fischer et al. 1987). Most fires are of low severity because of discontinuous fuels (Arno 1989). HTG #11 - Cold - High elevation Pinus albicaulis and Abies lasiocarpa Types These types are cold, high elevation sites. They are near timberline and above the cold limits of species such as Pseudotsuga menziesii and Larix occidentalis. Common species are Pinus albicaulis, Tsuga mertensiana, Abies lasiocarpa, and Larix lyallii. The fire-free interval varies considerably from 35 to over 300 years. Stand replacement fires occur after intervals of more than 200 years (Fischer et al. 1987).  H-13  Appendix H   South Fork Clearwater River Subbasin Assessment and TMDLs  October 2003  Table H-1.

GX001-11-12015382	"Forest Preserve District of Cook County (Illinois)       Nature Bulletin No. 532-A   June 1, 1974 Forest Preserve District of Cook County George W. Dunne, President Roland F. Eisenbeis, Supt. of Conservation  ****:IVIES  Strictly speaking, an ivy is one of five species of woody vines with  evergreen leaves. They are famous for their ability to climb and creep  over the walls of buildings. However, there are some other kinds of  woody climbing vines, also known as ivies, which shed their leaves  each autumn and belong to much different plant families. Further, there  are several plants popularly called ivies because they have long trailing  stems, although none of them is woody and they do not climb.  For example, Ground Ivy is one name for Creeping Charlie or Gill- over-the-ground, a pesky weed that spreads by means of long stems or  ""runners"" that take root at intervals. It has little purplish flowers and is  related to catnip in the Mint Family. Kenilworth Ivy, used in homes and  greenhouses, is another crawling plant with weak stems that root freely  at their joints. It belongs to the same family as our common mullein.  German Ivy, also used in hanging gardens because of its long twining  stems, has composite flowers and is related to such plants as burdock  and Canada thistle.  The true ivies are members of the Ginseng Family. Their woody vines  cling to wood or masonry surfaces by means of innumerable aerial  rootlets. They are peculiar in that leaves on the older vines have from 3  to 7 lobes, depending upon the species, but those on the young creeping  vines tend to be narrower and have fewer lobes. In autumn, clusters of  small greenish flowers bloom on the younger growths, followed by little  black or yellowish berries that do not ripen until the following spring.  These berries contain a poisonous substance. It is also present in the  leaves and stems which may cause a severe skin rash if they are handled  by susceptible people.  Best known and most widely used is the English Ivy, a European  species, it leaves are dark green above, much lighter underneath, and  rather stiff. At least two dozen varieties have been developed, some of  them for use as ground cover in heavily shaded places. Irish Ivy, which  has larger leaves, is an African species frequently used in England as a  ground cover beneath big yew trees where grass will not grow. It does  not do well in North America.  Of the deciduous ivies -- those that shed their leaves in autumn -- the  favorite in our country is the Boston or Japanese Ivy. It climbs and  clings to walls by means of short many-branched tendrils that have tiny  adhesive pads at their tips. The apple-green leaves assume beautiful  hues of red, orange and bronze in autumn. Its little bluish black berries  hang on until late in spring.  Our native American Ivy, a member of the Grape Family, is commonly  called Virginia Creeper or Woodbine. It has large compound leaves,  each with five-toothed leaflets, and is a harmless beautiful climber. It  should not be confused with Poison Ivy, that 3-leaves villain of the  Sumac Family.

GX271-36-16179821	"APPENDIX  SUITABLE SPECIES FOR STREAMSIDE STABILIZATION     INTRODUCTION The objective of this section is, through a review of the literature, to identify and characterize those common tree and shrub species that would be suitable candidates for riparian plantings in streamside stabilization projects of the Oregon Department of Transportation (ODOT) of Oregon. The product is a set of tables, one for each ODOT eco-region, that describe the riparian species found in the eco-region. The species lists are not exhaustive; less common species are not included.  ECO-REGIONS For the purposes of this report, the five ODOT Maintenance Region and District Map  (Sept. 1997) eco-regions, 1) Portland Metro Area; 2) Northwest Oregon; 3) Southwest Oregon;  4) Central Oregon and 5) Eastern Oregon, were used for identifying and grouping suitable riparian vegetation. The boundary between eco-region 4 and the three eco-regions lying to the west approximately follows the crest of the high Cascades. At the northern and particularly the southern ends, this boundary deviates from the Cascade crest. For the purpose of matching vegetation to eco-region, this boundary was assumed to follow the Cascade crest through its length.  OREGON NATURAL VEGETATION ZONES Each of ODOT's five eco-regions encompasses several of natural vegetation zones. These zones are characterized by different combinations of dominant tree and shrub species. The established vegetation zones of Franklin and Dyrness (1973; 1988) provided a suitable scale for the research and identification of riparian woody species. At a minimum, the dominant riparian trees and shrubs representative of each Franklin and Dyrness vegetation zone were identified, compiled and reduced to suitable candidates for each eco-region. In grouping species from different vegetation zones into a single, large scale ODOT eco-region, invariably some species are grouped together which do not naturally occur together. The Vegetation Classification Tables are designed to present information useful in determining plant associations appropriate to different riparian sites.  RIPARIAN ZONES Riparian zones can be characterized ""...as an ecotone between aquatic and upland ecosystems but have distinct vegetation and soil characteristics"" (Johnson and McCormick, 1979). ""As ecotones, they [can] encompass sharp gradients of environmental factors, ecological processes and plant communities"" (Gregory et al., 1991). Ultimately, riparian zones can be broadly viewed as three-dimensional zones of direct interaction between the aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems (Swanson et al. 1982). In this document, ""riparian"" will be restricted to lotic (riverine) ecosystems. In general, the gradients are not as sharp in western Oregon, producing broader riparian zones compared with similar streams east of the Cascades.  A-1    VEGETATION SELECTION STRATEGY The common riparian woody vegetation is listed table-form for each ODOT eco-region. Ecological characteristics are provided for each species to assist in matching species to specific project sites. Physiological characteristics pertinent to establishment and streambank stabilization are also evaluated. For a species' characteristic, where no information was available from the general literature or could be provided by the authors, NI is assigned in the tables. For a project, the first step is determining the site elevation and identifying species normally occurring at that elevation found in that eco-region. In addition to elevation range, the natural range of a species may be further restricted geographically within an eco-region. The Ecology-Associations category broadly describes geographic distribution within an eco-region for each species. It should be re-emphasized at this point that riparian interfaces produce complex and varied ecosystems and that this document is only meant to act as a guide. For comparison, a survey of nearby riparian zones is appropriate at each project site to assess local ecological conditions and associated plant communities. Since the tables characterize only common woody species for generalized ecological conditions, a survey is necessary for two reasons. First, the research sites from available literature represent only a sampling of the range of riparian communities found across the state. Second, in compiling the tables at the eco-region level, local community (site specific) detail was necessarily generalized. Riparian zones are also complex at the site scale, with different plant communities suitable for different locations within the zone. For any project, the riparian zone needs to be delineated and subdivided into lateral levels (defined under Riparian Zone Levels) as necessary for the specific site. At this point, plant species can be evaluated for use in respective Riparian Zone Levels. First, the Riparian Zone Level category provides a general guide for each species. Further information relevant to matching species to locations within the riparian zone is provided in the Wetland Indicator Status, Shade Tolerance, Flood Tolerance and Drought Tolerance categories. Additional ecological requirements and common plant associations may be described in the Ecology-Associations category. Site specific variables that influence riparian communities include hydrology, substrate, microclimate, aspect, slope and valley constraint. For any specific streambank location, the Tables will indicate that many plant species can grow there. Not all of these species can be grown successfully together; some will outcompete others. An inspection of nearby riparian plant communities will indicate which combinations are most likely to work. Since a main purpose of plantings is streambank stabilization, a category describing rooting characteristics pertinent to plant stability and soil binding is provided. Further, riparian zones are dynamic, subjecting plants to stresses affecting survivability. Growth response to damage and disturbance is described in the tables for each species. Since reproduction is important to longterm community function, key sexual and vegetative reproduction characteristics are described. Further research along several fronts could benefit ODOT's streambank stabilization projects in the future. Under-represented riparian communities, and those in areas of most concern to ODOT, should be adequately studied. Comparisons of community response to ecological A-2    processes and variables between project sites and natural systems should also be evaluated for developing future standards for measuring project success.  CLASSIFICATION TABLE CATEGORIES The following categories of information are provided for each species in the following tables:  Scientific and Common Names Scientific and common names are provided for all species listed. Except for three species of willow, scientific names follow Hitchcock and Cronquist (1973). Scientific names for the three willows (Salix boothii, Salix lucida and Salix Eastwoodiae) follow The Jepson Manual (1993). Additional nomenclature in common use (synonymy) is provided in parenthesis.  Wetland Indicator Status (WIS) The Wetland Indicator Status (WIS) is derived from the U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service ""National List of Plant Species that Occur in Wetlands"" (Reed 1988, National List of Vascular Plant Species that Occur in Wetlands: 1996 National Summary 1997). WIS categories estimate the probability of a species naturally occurring in wetland versus nonwetland across its entire range. For the purposes of this paper, the WIS published for region 9, the Northwest, was used. Table A.1: WIS Categories CATEGORY OBL FACW FAC FACU UPL NI DESIGNATION Obligate Wetland species: almost always occur in wetlands Facultative Wetland species: usually occur in wetlands Facultative Wetland species: equally likely to occur in wetlands or nonwetlands Facultative Upland species: usually occur in nonwetlands Obligate Upland species: almost always occur in nonwetlands No indicator status: WETLAND PROBABILITY >99 67 to 99 34 to 66 1 to 33 <1  A probability (expressed as estimated frequency of occurrence) for example, of 67% 99% (Facultative Wetland), means that across its range, of randomly selected sample plots containing the species, 67% - 69% would be found in a wetland. For Facultative categories, a positive (+) sign indicates a frequency toward the higher end of that specific category (more frequently found in wetlands). A negative (-) sign indicates a frequency toward the lower end of that category (less frequently found in wetlands).  A-3    Elevation Within each ODOT eco-region the approximate maximum elevation range (ft) for each species is provided. Elevation values in parenthesis, where included, indicate a more typical range. Changes in elevation normally result in changes in climatic variables (temperature, precipitation) which significantly influence vegetation composition. Elevation, in combination with other characteristics, particularly ecological associations, can provide a useful general guideline for a species potential range. However, the elevation range alone should not be construed as being precise, since multiple variables including local and regional geographic setting, microclimate and basin characteristics all play vital roles in determining a species range. Species presence may be especially variable at the lower and upper elevation range limits. Ultimately, a field survey should be conducted of each site to confirm the information compiled in this document.  Riparian Zone Level Transversely, the riparian zone has been divided into three levels, low (L), middle (M), and top (T) or transition. The low level includes the streambank that is seasonally inundated, located between normal low and high water levels. The middle zone, including the active floodplain, is above the typical high water level, but is subject to flooding by less-frequent high water events. The water table is near the surface in this zone and has a strong influence on the plant community. The top zone, often including older terraces, provides a transition with the upland community, but is still under influence by the stream. Due to variation in hydrology and geomorphology, riparian zone levels cannot be defined simply in terms of distance. Stream valley constraint and geomorphology are not characterized in these tables, but may be addressed as warranted under Ecology-Associations.  Ecology-Associations Additional information refining species regional ranges is provided under this heading. Vegetation zone distribution (Franklin and Dyrness, 1988) and geographic restrictions are included. Specific plant associations and stream basin characteristics are described where appropriate. Variability at the site level and between sites is inherent in riparian zones. The listed plant associations are not meant to be comprehensive, nor will all species listed necessarily occur together at a given site. Field surveys are important to refine associations at specific project sites.  Shade Tolerance Tolerance for shade is presented in a five point scale, with 1, indicating very shade intolerant (requires open space), through 5, indicating very shade tolerant (can grow under an overstory). For species where values were not provided in the available literature, tolerance values were assigned based on the authors' experience.  A-4    Flood Tolerance Tolerance for flooding is presented in a five point scale, with 1, indicating very flood intolerant, through 5, indicating very flood tolerant. For species where values were not provided in the available literature, tolerance values were assigned based on the authors' experience.  Drought Tolerance Tolerance for drought is presented in a five point scale, with 1, indicating very drought intolerant, through 5, indicating very drought tolerant. For species where values were not provided in the available literature, tolerance values were assigned based on the authors' experience.  Damage Response Vegetative growth response to damage and disturbance, including type and rate (if available) of response, is provided under this heading.  Roots and Soils Rooting characteristics and soils information pertinent to soil binding, plant stability and plant tolerances are provided under this heading.  Sexual Reproduction Fruit type and dispersal characteristics that may be pertinent for plant community development are described under this heading.  Vegetative Reproduction Natural vegetative reproduction capabilities beyond the vegetative growth response to damage and disturbance are described under this category.

Cockerell     GENERAL      DESCRIPTION :           common sunflower:  Summer         annual  with coarse foliage and showy yellow flowers, to 3 m tall. Plants        are highly variable wild forms of the cultivated sunflower. Native to the        U.S.        Texas blueweed:  Erect        herbaceous  perennial , to 0.7 m tall, with bluish-green foliage and         creeping roots . New shoots from root buds often create dense patches        of plants. Introduced from south central U.S. and northern Mexico.          SEEDLINGS : common sunflower:  Cotyledons oblong, 15-40 mm long,      joined at the bases, smooth. First few true leaves opposite, dull green, covered      with short bristly hairs that are rough to touch. Margins weakly round-toothed.      Subsequent leaves alternate. No description available for  Texas blueweed .     MATURE      PLANT : Boths species have a strong pungent      odor, especially when crushed.           common sunflower:  Stems        typically highly branched. Foliage covered with  stiff hairs that are        rough to touch . Lower leaves often opposite; upper leaves mostly alternate        and smaller. Leaves on long stalks,  heart-shaped   to ovate ,         mostly with cordate bases , 10-40 cm long, and often 3-veined from        the base. Margins coarsely toothed.        Texas blueweed:  Stems        often sparsely covered with short stiff hairs. Leaves typically  glabrous         or hairy on the margins (ciliate), sessile , bluish-green, covered        with a whitish film  (glaucous), mostly opposite,  oblong to lanceolate ,        3-8 cm long. Margins wavy, entire to shallowly lobed.          back      to top of page     ROOTS      and UNDERGROUND STRUCTURES :           common sunflower:  Seedlings        initially taprooted; develops a fibrous root system with maturity.        Texas blueweed:  Develops        an extensive system of woody horizontal creeping roots with buds every few        inches. Root fragments can produce new shoots from buds. Plants are shallow-rooted        in uncultivated soils, but develop deeper root systems on cultivated land.          FLOWERS : Showy composite flower heads solitary on long peduncles. Ray      flowers yellow.           common sunflower:  February-October.         Flower head receptacles 1.5-3.5(20) cm across. Unit of disk flowers flattened        on top, usually dark reddish or purplish-brown . Ray flower corollas        mostly greater than 2.5 cm long. Disk flower corollas 5-8 mm long with red        to purple or yellow lobes. Receptacle scales (chaffy bracts) deeply 3-lobed,        mostly glabrous. Phyllaries typically  greater   than 4 mm wide,        ciliate .        Texas blueweed:  June-November.         Flower head receptacles 1.2-2.5 cm across. Unit of disk flowers rounded        on top, yellowish . Ray flower corollas about 1 cm long. Disk flower        corollas 4-5 mm long with red lobes. Receptacle scales (chaffy bracts) hairy        at the tips, entire or 3-lobed.          FRUITS      and SEEDS : Similar to those of commercial      sunflower. Pappus scales 2(4), deciduous.           common sunflower:  Achenes        3-15 mm long. Pappus scales 2-3.5 mm long.        Texas blueweed:  Achenes        about 3 mm long. Pappus scales about 2 mm long.          back      to top of page     HABITAT :           common sunflower:  Disturbed        sites, roadsides, fields, especially cereal and safflower fields, shrublands.        Often infests fertile soils.        Texas blueweed:  Roadsides,        irrigated fields, stream and ditch banks, low drainage areas. Grows best        on cultivated soils and often infests alkaline or saline soils.          DISTRIBUTION :           common sunflower:  Throughout        California. To 1900 m (6250 ft).        Texas blueweed:  Sacramento        Valley (c Tehama Co.), San Francisco Bay region (w Alameda Co.), South Coast        (cw San Luis Obispo, c Santa Barbara, n & e Ventura, Los Angeles, sw        San Diego cos.), western Mojave Desert (w San Bernardino Co.). To 300 m        (1000 ft).          PROPAGATION/PHENOLOGY :           common sunflower:  Reproduces        by seed. Seedlings can emerge from depths of at least 10 cm. Mature plants        can tolerate temperatures to – 2º C, and seedlings are less sensitive        to freezing temperatures than mature plants.        Texas blueweed:  Reproduces        by vegetative clones from roots and by seed. Seed viability is often low.          MANAGEMENT      FAVORING/DISCOURAGING SURVIVAL : Cultivation      (to a depth of 20 cm at least every 2 months for Texas blueweed) reduces survival.     SIMILAR      SPECIES : Unlike  common sunflower ,       prairie sunflower  [ Helianthus petiolaris  Nutt. ssp.  petiolaris ][HELPE],      an introduced annual, has phyllaries typically  less than 4 mm wide  that      are not conspicuously ciliate and  truncate to wedge-shaped leaf bases .      Disturbed sites in the San Francisco Bay region and Southern California, excluding      deserts. To 450 m (1475 ft).  Maximilian sunflower  [ Helianthus maximilianii       Schrader][HELMA] is an introduced ornamental that has occasionally escaped      cultivation. It has short rhizome-like roots. Unlike  Texas blueweed ,       Maximilian sunflower   lacks   blue-green glaucous foliage       and has alternate entire leaves 10-30 cm long, usually folded along the midribs,      and without wavy margins. In addition, disk flower corolla lobes are yellow.      Disturbed sites in southern San Joaquin Valley (Fresno Co.) To 100 m (330      ft).             back to top of page      CONTROL      METHODS :        Prevention : Texas blueweed      is an aggressive perennial sunflower that is native to the grasslands of the      south central United States. It naturally persists in low densities in native      grasslands, but thrives in cultivated or heavily disturbed areas. Its reproductive      strategy is primarily vegetative, from root buds on lateral roots. Seed studies      from Texas have shown less than 1% of the total seed produced are viable.      However, blueweed seed may have reached California in contaminated alfalfa      or oats grown in Texas. Blueweed is highly competitive in several crops and      cropping systems including cotton, wheat, and sorghum. Texas blueweed is a      class A noxious weed in California. In agricultural fields, prevent new blueweed      infestations by planting certified crop seed and cleaning equipment after      working in infested fields.      Mechanical : The root system      of Texas blueweed is composed of two distinct parts: an extensive network      of shallow lateral roots with numerous root buds, and deeply penetrating feeder      roots. New shoots arise from root buds on the laterals and form dense semi-circular      patches. Hoeing, grubbing, or hand pulling small patches may be effective,      if continually repeated for several years. Intensive cultivation repeated      throughout the growing season for at least two years has been effective in      eradicating blueweed. This requires plowing to a minimum depth of seven inches      at monthly or bimonthly intervals. Infrequent cultivation will likely spread      the weed, as rootstocks may be severed and dragged by tillage equipment. Tillage      implements should be thoroughly cleaned after working in infested areas, to      prevent spread of root pieces to new fields.       There is no information available regarding mowing as a control strategy.      Mowing plants may prevent seed production, but should not be done after seed      set.      Grazing : Livestock may graze      young, newly emerged shoots, but tend to avoid plants as they mature. Maintaining      a healthy, competitive range may prevent blueweed from becoming established.      However, it will persist in native grasslands and may increase if overgrazing      occurs.      Chemical : Certain herbicides      have provided control of blueweed in the south central United States. However,      repeated applications may be necessary, and control may vary depending upon      the year. Dicamba, 2,4-D, MCPA, and picloram have been reported to control      blueweed. Clopyralid, which is now labeled for use in California rangelands,      is very effective on common sunflowers and may also control or suppress blueweed.      Imazapyr and glyphosate may also be effective for blueweed control. Refer      to the herbicide label for rates and timings.            References      Keeling, J. W. and Abernathy, J. R. 1988.

GX264-43-6738533	Invasive Alien Plant Species of Virginia Oriental Bittersweet (Celastrus orbiculatus Thunb.) Description Oriental bittersweet is a deciduous, twining vine with alternate, nearly round, glossy leaves. Small, greenish flowers occur in clusters in the axils. The leathery capsule surrounding the seed ripens to a bright orange. The native species, American bittersweet (Celastrus scandens), differs from the invasive by its leaves, which are somewhat longer than wide, and the terminal panicle of flowers. Consult a natural resource specialist for an accurate identification. Habitat This species grows in alluvial woods, roadsides, thickets and old home sites. From there it may spread to undisturbed mesic or dry-mesic forests. Distribution Oriental bittersweet, a native of Asia, was brought to the United States for cultivation during the middle of the nineteenth century. It is now naturalized in 21 of the 33 states where it was introduced, a region extending from Maine south to Georgia, and west to Iowa. Oriental bittersweet is found in over half the counties of Virginia. Threats This plant can overrun natural vegetation in much the same way as kudzu (Pueraria lobata), over-topping all other vegetation and forming thick, nearly pure stands. It can strangle shrubs and tree limbs, and weaken a tree by girdling the trunk and weighting the crown, making the tree more susceptible to wind and ice damage. There is some evidence that it can hybridize with American bittersweet, thus threatening genetic integrity of the native species. Control Light infestations of a few small plants can be controlled by cutting the vines and handpulling the roots. Dense infestations can be treated by cutting the vines followed immediately by application of a glyphosate herbicide to the stumps. Merely cutting vines without removing or killing the roots will only stimulate vigorous re-growth. To ensure rootkill, a late-season foliar application of herbicide may be necessary. Glyphosate herbicides are recommended because they are biodegradable. However, glyphosate is a nonselective, systemic herbicide that affects all green vegetation. To be safe and effective, herbicide use requires careful knowledge of the chemicals, appropriate concentrations, and the effective method and timing of their application. Contact a natural resource specialist for more information about controlling invasive plant species. Alternative Plants for Cultivation Many native species of vines are available through local nurseries or mail order. American bittersweet (Celastrus scandens ) is our native bittersweet and does not exhibit the  Oriental Bittersweet (Celastrus orbiculatus Thunb.)  invasive tendencies of Oriental bittersweet. Crossvine ( Bignonia capreolata ), trumpet honeysuckle (Lonicera sempervirens), and trumpet creeper ( Campsis radicans) are all climbing vines which produce bright red-orange flowers attractive to hummingbirds. Vi r gin's bower (Clematis virginiana) is a climbing vine which blooms in clusters of fragrant white flowers. Vi r g inia creeper (Parthenocissus quinquefolia) grows well in the shade and its cluster of dark purple berries are an important food for birds.

GX238-86-8211624	PSME 34 DOUGLAS-FIR/DWARF OREGONGRAPE/WESTERN SWORD-FERN Pseudotsuga menziesii/Berberis nervosa/Polystichum munitum  PSME/BENE2/POMU (N=37; BLM=37)  Distribution. This Association is scattered east of the Coast Range crest on dry sites. It occurs within the Glendale Resource Area, Medford District, Bureau of Land Management and on the Galice Ranger District, Siskiyou National Forest. This Association may also occur on the Illinois Valley Ranger District, Siskiyou National Forest. Distinguishing Characteristics. This Association is difficult to distinguish from other Douglas-fir associations. Douglas-fir associations have a consistently similar complement of vegetation, since the environmental range of the Series is narrow. Except for the occasional presence of Pacific yew and dwarf Oregongrape indicating more moist sites, using relative cover provides the best discrimination among the associations. Douglas-fir/Dwarf Oregongrape/Western Sword-fern only occurs in the Siskiyous east of the coastal crest and is not likely to be found in the Cascades. It occurs on all aspects, but rarely above 3300 feet in elevation or on ridgetops.   PSME 35 Soils. Parent material varies among sandstone, mudstone, serpentine and peridotite. Soil depth averages at least 14 inches. Textures are mostly sandy loam, loam, or clay loam. Average rock fragment content is 41 percent. Most fragments (29 percent) are of gravel size. Environment. Elevation ranges from about 1000 feet to about 3500 feet. The average is 2700 feet. The mode, slightly less, is about 2500 feet. This Association occurs on all aspects, but less often on south faces. This Association is normally distributed on all slope positions, with midslopes as the definitive mode. Slopes average about 46 percent. Average annual temperature is about 48 degrees F and average annual precipitation is about 51 inches. Approximately 4 percent of the forest floor is exposed bedrock, 50 percent is covered with litter, 6 percent is bare ground, and 8 percent is covered with moss. Vegetation Composition and Structure. Total species richness, low for the Series, is 29. The range for all layers is 16 to 48 species. Cover greater than 10 feet (3 meters) tall, usually trees, averages 74 percent. Tree cover less than 10 feet tall averages 11 percent; tall shrubs, greater than 20 inches (50 centimeters) tall, average 19 percent cover; low shrubs, less than 20 inches tall, average 35 percent cover; herb cover averages 22 percent. Douglas-fir and incense-cedar dominate the overstory, but because of their wide ecological amplitude do not specifically indicate site environment. Pacific madrone, with low cover and constancy, indicates the site is cool for the Series. Pacific yew and salal indicate cooler sites. Covers of species usually related to hotter, warmer sites (creambush ocean-spray and less so, California hazel) are relatively low in cover. Except for whipplevine, usually associated with warmer sites, vanillaleaf, western twinflower, western starflower, and pathfinder support the interpretation that this is one of the more mild associations of the Series.

This system consists of a set of mnemonic words (keywords) and associated data. A single keyword and its associated numeric data make up a keyword record.  Keyword Records A simulation file is comprised of a logical set of keyword records. The keyword always begins in the first column of the keyword record. Depending on the keyword, up to seven additional fields on the record may be used to tra nsmit data. These fields are referred to as parameter fields and the data that they contain are used when the option is implemented. Each parameter field consists of 10 columns. If a decimal point is included in numeric data, the parameter may be entered anywhere within the field. If integer values or alphanumeric data are used, they must be right-justified. The first ten columns of the keyword record are reserved for the keyword name, therefore the first parameter field begins in column 11 (fig. 1) Columns 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 ....:....0....:....0....:....0....:....0....:....0....:....0....:....0....:....0 DESIGN SITECODE THINBTA 0 3 2002 1.0 82 8.0 999 24.0 5 1.0 0 PP 16. 50 100 0  Figure 1 -- Example of a portion of a simulation file showing keyword records with keywords (columns 1 to 10) and up to 7 parameter fields (10-column fields beginning in column 11). The header with column designations is not part of the file and is included here only to help illustrate the format of the keyword records.  A simplifying feature of the keyword system is that default values exist for almost all program options. Keywords need only be used if the desired action differs from the default action. similarly, most parameters associated with keywords have default values. If such a field is left blank, the default value will be used. Many keywords contain a ""year or cycle"" parameter field. If the value entered in this field is in the range 0- 40 it is interpreted as a cycle number. If the value entered is 1000 or greater it is interpreted as a year. No other values are legal for this type of parameter field unless otherwise noted. Many keywords contain a ""species"" parameter field. Values entered in this field may be numeric or alpha codes. A numeric entry is interpreted as the species sequence number from the FVS variant that is being used. Alpha entries are interpreted as the alpha species code from the FVS variant that is being used. Refer to Appendix A for a list of species sequence numbers and species alpha codes.  Supplemental Records The fina l element of the keyword system is the supplemental data record. These records are required when the information needed does not fit the parameter field format. Supplemental data records are a maximum of 80 characters and occupy the records immediately following the keyword record. The exact format of the supplemental data records is dependent on the keyword selected, and will be described in the keyword description for the keywords that require them (fig. 2).  6   COMMENT Supplemental records are at most 80 characters wide and begin on the record that follows the keyword record. Syntax is unique to the keyword. END STDIDENT 0470003 Stand 002047.0003 at Clear Creek  Figure 2 -- Example of a portion of a simulation file showing keywords with associated supplemental data records.  PARMS Format Many of the ""activity"" keyword records may be coded using the PARMS format. This is a special form of the keyword record . It is equivalent to the standard form of the keyword record, but it allows expressions in place of constant parameters. See the individual keyword descriptions to determine whether a particular keyword may use the PARMS format. When using the PARMS format for a keyword record, the keyword is coded in the first eight columns, and the year/ cycle (field 1) is coded right justified in column 20 as is done when this feature is not used. The remainder of the record is coded PARMS (parameter2 , parameter3 , parameter4 , ... , parametern ) where the word PARMS begins somewhere in columns 21 through 30. Each ""parametern "" corresponds to the nth field of the keyword. Its value is represented by an expression that uses constants, variables (Event Monitor pre defined or user-defined), and/or Event Monitor functions. Refer to GTR INT- 275, User's Gu ide to the Event Monitor: Part of Prognosis Model Version 6 for a discussion of legal uses of variables, operators, and functions. If the keyword record is long, an ampersand (&) is used to continue the record on the following line. Figure 3 shows several keyword records that use the PARMS format. Columns 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 ....:....0....:....0....:....0....:....0....:....0....:....0....:....0....:....0 THI NDBH THINDBH THINBTA 2010 2010 2020 PARMS(10.0, 999.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0) 10.0 999.0 1.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 PARMS(BTPA -SPMCDBH(1,0,3), 1.0, 0.0, 999.0, 0.0, 999.0)  Figure 3 -- Example of keyword re cords using the PARMS format. The two THINDBH keyword records are equivalent. For the THINBTA keyword the residual stand density (field 2) is calculated using a pre -defined variable (BTPA) and an Event Monitor function (SPMCDBH).  When using the PARMS format, supply all of the parameters used by the keyword. Defaults are not used when parameters are left blank Ensure that all parameter values are within legal limits as FVS does not check for legal values when the PARMS format is used. Also ensure that variables are defined when the activity is called. If the PARMS function references a variable that is not defined when the activity is called, the activity is canceled.  Geographic Variants The different versions of the FVS model have been calibrated to specific geographic areas, and are referred to as ""variants"" (fig. 4). Each variant is actually a stand-alone application that contains growth parameters and other parameters based on data collected in the geographic area represented. The Central Rockies (CR) variant is unique in that it is comprised of submodels based on major forest type, each of which contains its own set of parameters. Individual variants may have a different subset of legal keywords, and may use different species codes than other  7   variants. Refer to individual keyword descriptions for a list of the variants for which use of the keyword is valid. Refer to Appendix A for a list of the valid species codes for each variant.

When FVS encounters an ADDFILE keyword in a keyword file it opens the auxiliary keyword file (see OPEN keyword) and reads in the keywords from that file. It then reads in the remaining keywords from the original file. Any number of ADDFILE requests can be included in a single simulation file (however, each must be preceded by an OPEN keyword). field 1: File reference number for the auxiliary keyword file (also kn own as an addfile). File reference numbers are a mechanism that FVS uses to keep track of external files. Numbers less than 30 are reserved for files that are currently used by FVS. Note: Any number of ADDFILE keywords can be requested in a simulation file, however each ADDFILE keyword must be preceded by a corresponding OPEN keyword with the same file reference number. The ADDFILE and OPEN keyword combination require that the auxiliary keyword file (or addfile) be read every time the simulation is run. This differs from using the ""Insert From File"" feature of the Suppose interface program. The Suppose program actually embeds the keywords from the auxiliary file into the current simulation file. Changing the auxiliary keyword file after it has b een embedded into the current simulation file has no effect on the current simulation file. When using ADDFILE and OPEN keywords, changing the auxiliary file will cause a change in the simulation when it is run again.  Note:  Caution: ADDFILE should not be used within the auxiliary keyword file. Example: OPEN EXTRA.KEY ADDFILE 40 40  BAIMULT  (Basal A rea Increment MULT iplier) Variants: All Related keywords: BAMAX, NOCALIB, CALBSTAT, READCORD, REGDMULT, FERTILIZ Multiplier to change the large tree basal area increment prediction. This modifies the diameter growth rate of trees in the large tree model. The diameter break that separates the large and small tree models varies by variant (Refer to the variant overview). field 1: Year or cycle in which the multiplier is applied. Once in effect it remains in effect until replaced by a subsequent multiplier. Default = 0 (All cycles) field 2: Species code to which the multiplier is applied. Default = All field 3: Multiplier value. (e.g. a value of 1.1 will increase the predicted basal area growth by 10%) Default = 1.0 (no change from predicted value) Note: Note: For any particular species this keyword remains in effect until a subsequent use of the keyword changes the multiplier for that species. The multiplier value itself remains constant over time, however this multiplier is applied after the scale factors have been applied. Scale factors may attenuate over time, therefore the modified basal area increment may also attenuate over time.  9   Note:  The PARMS format may be used with this keyword. See the introduction for a description of this format.  Caution: Many of the predictions in FVS are based on basal area increment. Changing the large tree basal area increment prediction also changes many of the other predictions made in the model. Reference: GTR INT -133, User's Guide to the Stand Prognosis Model, p. 94  BAMAX  (Basal A rea MAX imum) Variants: All Related keywords: BAIMULT, SDIMAX Modifies the maximum density and the associated mortality pattern for the stand. In the CI variant, crown ratio change is also affected. In all variants other than CI, EM, KT, and NI, BAMAX is used indirectly to set species SDI maximums if the SDIMAX keyword has not been used for that purpose. field 1: Maximum basal area (square feet) per acre. Defaults by variant: CI = 220 NI, KT = 310a EM = 500 a  BA maximums for NI and for habitat type 260. Habitat Code 130 170 250 260 280 290 310 320 330 420 470 510 520 530  KT are assigned by habitat type. 310 is the default BAMax 140 220 250 310 240 270 310 310 200 310 290 330 380 440 Habitat Code 550 570 610 620 640 660 670 680 690 710 730 830 850 99 9 BAMax 5 00 390 390 440 180 290 400 350 390 260 220 220 160 300  Caution: Use of this keyword can drastically change predicted yields. Note: This keyword is processed before any tree data is read. If after reading the tree data it is found that the stand is above 85% of the BAMAX value, the maximum basal area will be automatically recalculated without regard to the value set with this keyword. In all variants other than NI, KT, and CI, if both BAMAX and SDIMAX are specified, the SDIMAX values will override the BAMAX values.  Note:  10   BFDEFECT (Board Foot DEFECT) Variants: All Related keywords: MCDEFECT, BFVOLUME, BFFDLN Specifies species -specific board foot volume defect corrections for board foot volume estimates. In the eastern half of the US this keyword specifies defect for sawlogs and the sawlog portion of trees reported for pulpwood. (Defect for the remainder of the pulpwood is set using the MCDEFECT keyword.) Defect percentages are specified by species for the following five dbh's: 5, 10, 15, 20, 25 inches. For example, if the expected defect correction for a five- inch tree is 35 percent, a value of .35 would be entered in the keyword field 3. A linear interpolation function calculates the defect percentage for the specified dbh of the tree. For trees smaller than 5 inches dbh or greater than 25 inches dbh, a constant value for defect correction is applied based on the values in fields 3 and 7 respectively. field 1: Year or cycle in which the defect corrections are to take effect. Once in effect it remains in effect until replaced by a subsequent multiplier. Default = 0 (all cycles) field 2: Species code that will be affected by the defect corrections. Default = All field 3: Board foot volume defect correction percentage for a 5 -inch tree. All trees less than 5 inches dbh will be assigned this value of defect correction percentage. Range: 0.0 - 1.0, Default = 0.0 field 4: Board foot volume defect correction percentage for a 10- inch tree. Range: 0.0 - 1.0, Default = 0.0 field 5: Board foot volume defect correction percentage for a 15- inch tree. Range: 0.0 - 1.0, Default = 0.0 field 6: Board foot volume defect correction percentage for a 20- inch tree. Range: 0.0 - 1.0, Default = 0.0 field 7: Board foot volume defect correction percentage for a 25- inch tree. All trees greater than 25 inches dbh will be assigned this value of defect correction percentage. Range: 0.0 - 1.0, Default = 0.0 Note: No te: Note: For any particular species this keyword remains in effect until a subsequent use of the keyword changes the multiplier for that species. If used inside an Event Monitor sequence, BFDEFECT will not affect cycle 0 volumes. The PARMS format may be used with this keyword. In the PARMS format, however, 0 (zero) may not be used in the year/cycle field, and hence the defect will not affect cycle 0 volumes. See the introduction for a description of this format.  11   BFFDLN  (Board Foot Form and Defect Log linear equation) Variants: All Related keywords: MCFDLN, BFDEFECT, BFVOLEQU, BFVOLUME Sets species specific parameters for a log-linear form and defect correction equation for board foot volume estimates: ln(Vs ) = a0 + a1 ln(V0 ) where Vs V0 a0 a1 = = = = board foot volume corrected for form and defect uncorrected board foot volume intercept (field 2 value) slope coefficient (field 3 value)  field 1: Species code whose equation is to be changed. Default = All field 2: Intercept term for log- linear equation (a 0 ). Default = 0 field 3: Slope coefficient for log-linear equation (a 1 ). Default = 1 Reference: GTR INT -133, User's Guide to the Stand Prognosis Model, p. 24  BFVOLEQU (Board Foot VOLume EQUation) Variants: All Related keywords: BFVOLUME, BFDEFECT, BFFDLN Sets species specific parameters for the board foot volume equation: V = b 0 + b 1 D + b 2 DH + b 3 D2 H + b 4 Db5 Hb6 where V = b oard foot volume D = tree diameter at breast height (dbh) H = tree height  field 1: Species code whose equation is to be changed. Default = All field 2: Transition size code. Default = 0 0 indicates that field 3 is based on DBH 1 indicates that field 3 is based on DBH2 H field 3: Transition size. If DBH (or DBH2 H, based on the value in field 2) for a particular tree is less than this value, coefficients from the first supplemental record are used in the calculations. If greater than this value, coefficients from the second supplemental record are used. Default = 20.5 (For PN and WC: default = 0.0) Supplemental Records: Small-tree coefficients b0 to b 6 are entered in the first seven 10-column fields of the first supplemental record. Large-tree coefficients b0 to b6 are entered in the first seven 10-column fields of the second supplemental record. Note: This keyword is only recognized if the BFVOLUME keyword is used and field 7 of the BFVOLUME keyword has a value of 2 or 7.  12   BFVOLUME (Board Foot VOLUME) Variants: All Related keywords: VOLUME, BFDEFECT, BFVOLEQU, BFFDLN Sets the merchantability limits for board foot volume equations. In the eastern half of the US, this keyword sets the merchantability limits for sawlogs and the sawlog portion of trees reported for pulpwood. (The merchantability limits for the remainder of the pulpwood can be set with the VOLUME keyword.) field 1: Year or cycle number in which merchantability limits are to take affect. Once in effect they remain in effect until replaced by subsequent limits. Default = 0 (all cycles) field 2: Species code for which the limits are to be changed. Default = All field 3: Minimum merchantable DBH in inches. Defaults by variant: BM, CA, EC, EM, NI, KT, PN, WC CI, TT, UT AK NC, SO WS CS, LS, NE SE, SN CR CR (Black Hills) field 4: Minimum top diameter (inside bark (DIB) in (DOB) in the western US).

TWIGS volume equations. Western Sierra log rules.  Caution: If an entry is made in field 7, it must agree with the entry in field 7 of the VOLUME keyword Note: For any particular species this keyword remains in effect until a subsequent use of the keyword changes the limits for that species. GTR INT -133, User's Guide to the Stand Pro gnosis Model, p. 22 GTR INT -208, Supplement to the User's Guide..., p. 18  References:  CALBSTAT (CALiBration STATistics) Variants: All Related keywords: BAIMULT, NOCALIB, OPEN Outputs calibration scale factors computed from the input data to a file for later processing. By default the output will be written to unit 13, which is the same unit used for the CHEAPO output. If desired, however, users can direct the output to a different file using a combination of the CALBSTAT and OPEN keywords. field 1: File refere nce number for CALBSTAT output file. File reference numbers are a mechanism that FVS uses to keep track of external files. Numbers less than 30 are reserved for files that are currently used by FVS. Default = 13 Example sending output to new unit: CALBSTAT OPEN CALIBRAT.TXT 50 50  Note:  If using the Suppose interface program the CALBSTAT output file, by default, has the same base name as the simulation file with a .chp extension. This is the same file used, by default, for the CHEA PO output.  CFVOLEQU (Cubic Foot VOLume EQUation) Variants: All Related keywords: BFVOLEQU, VOLUME, MCDEFECT, MCFDLN Sets species specific parameters for the cubic foot volume equation: V = b 0 + b 1 D + b 2 DH + b 3 D2 H + b 4 Db5 Hb6 where V = board foot volume D = tree diameter at breast height (dbh) H = tree height  field 1: Species code whose equation is to be changed. Default = All field 2: Transition size code. Default = 1 for PP, 0 otherwise (PN and WC: default = 0) 0 indicates that field 3 is based on DBH 1 indicates that field 3 is based on DBH2 H  14   field 3: Transition size. If DBH (or DBH2 H, based on the value in field 2) for a particular tree is less than this value, coefficients from the first supplemental record are used in the calculations. I f greater than this value, coefficients from the second supplemental record are used. Default = 6000 for PP, 0 otherwise (PN and WC: default = 0) Supplemental Records: Small-tree coefficients b0 to b 6 are entered in the first seven 10-column fields of the first supplemental record. Large-tree coefficients b0 to b6 are entered in the first seven 10-column fields of the second supplemental record. Note: This keyword is only recognized if the VOLUME keyword is used and field 7 of the VOLUME keyword has a value of 1 or 7.  CHEAPO  (Computer Help for the Economic A nalysis of P rognosis Output) Variants: All Related keywords: OPEN Generates an program. By CALBSTAT combination output file required for subsequent execution of the CHEAPO II economic analysis default the output will be written to unit 13, which is the same unit used for the output. , If desired, however, users can direct the output to a different file using a of the CHEAPO and OPEN keywords.  field 1: File reference number for CHEAPO output file. File reference numbers are a mechanism that FVS uses to keep track of external files. Numbers less than 30 are reserved fo r files that are currently used by FVS. Default = 13 Example sending output to new unit: CHEAPO OPEN CHEAPDAT.TXT 40 40  Note:  If using the Suppose interface program the CHEAPO output file, by default, has the same base name as the simulation file with a .chp extension. This is the same file used, by default, for the CALBSTAT output. GTR INT -133, User's Guide to the Stand Prognosis Model, p. 86 GTR INT -211, User's Guide to CHEAPO II..., p. 21  References:  CLOSE  (CLOSE a file) Variants: All Related keywords: OPEN Closes a file that was opened using an OPEN keyword. field 1: File reference number for the file to be closed. This number must match the file reference number from the appropriate OPEN keyword. File reference num bers are a mechanism that FVS uses to keep track of external files. Numbers less than 30 are reserved for files that are currently used by FVS.  15   COMMENT (insert COMMENTs) Variants: All Related keywords: END Enters comments into the sequence of FVS keywords. The comments can be entered on as many supplemental records as desired. Signify the end of the comment with an END keyword. Including this set of keywords will not affect a simulation, however they are printed to the main FVS output file. Keywords contained in a COMMENT block are ignored in the simulation. To test the effects of omitting a keyword, a COMMENT keyword can be placed before it, and an END keyword can be placed after it. No fields are associated with this keyword, however supplemental records are used. Supplemental Record(s): Comments are entered in Columns 1 -80 on as many supplemental records as desired. The END keyword must follow the last supplemental record. Example: COMMENT This is a comment. Nothing placed in here will affect the simulation. END  Note:  If using the Suppose interface program comments may be added using the ""Edit Simulation Notes"" feature accessible through the Extras menu.  COMPRESS (COMPRESS the treelist) Variants: All Related keywords: TREELIST, CUTLIST, NOTRIPLE, NUMTRIP Reduces the number of tree records stored inside FVS. This is done automatically when room is needed to store new trees created by the Regeneration Establishment process. You can use this keyword manually to schedule the tree compression process. When there are many records in the treelist, the record compression algorithm can reduce the number of records while minimizing loss of within -stand variation in tree attributes that are important for increment prediction. As a result, the numb er of calculations required for the projection can be reduced without significant bias. Two methods are used to form new tree records. First, groups are formed by finding the largest differences between trees. Then those groups with the greatest variatio n are split to form new groups. Field 3 controls the weight given to these methods. field 1: Year or cycle in which the treelist will be compressed. Default = 1 field 2: Number of tree records that will remain following compression. Default = 150 fie ld 3: Percentage of new records that will be determined by finding the largest differences between trees. Remainder of records will result from splitting the classes with the greatest variation. Range: 0 - 100, Default = 50 field 4: Debug flag. Any numeric entry in this field will cause (a great deal of) output to be printed for the compression algorithm. Default = blank (no debug output) Note: If COMPRESS is specified for the first or second cycle, the tree records will be subsequently tripled unles s NOTRIPLE or NUMTRIP is used to suppress the record tripling feature.  16   Caution: Compression can cause trees to loose their plot specific identity, as they may be combined with ""like"" trees from a neighbor plot. References: GTR INT -208, Supplement to the User's Guide..., p. 19  COMPUTE (COMPUTE variables) Variants: All Related keywords: END The COMPUTE keyword is part of the FVS Event Monitor. It allows the user to define variables expressed as mathematical expressions containing constants, Event Monitor variables, Event Monitor functions, and variables previously defined using the COMPUTE keyword. The value of variables may depend on events such as harvest or mortality. Variables are defined using mathematical equations in supplemental records, which are up to 80 characters long. Each subsequent variable must be defined on a subsequent record. The END keyword must follow the last supplemental record. field 1: Year or cycle in which the expressions are to be evaluated. Enter 0 (zero) to have the exp ressions evaluated for every cycle. Default = 1 Supplemental record(s): Contains mathematical expressions that consist of a user-defined variable name on the left of the equal sign, and a value or expression that is already defined on the right of the equal sign. An END keyword must be included after the last supplemental record. Note: Expressions may contain up to 200 characters. If an expression is too long to fit on a single 80-character record, use an ampersand (&) at the end of the record to in dicate that the expression is continued on the next record. A variable name may no longer than eight characters and may not be a word that is reserved for use by FVS or the Event Monitor. A maximum of 200 variables may be computed for any simulation.

The Cover extension has its own unique set of keywords (see GTR INT - 190, Cover: A User's Guide...) The COVER keyword  17   sequence must be terminated with an END keyword. All keywords between COVER and END are considered Cover extension keywords. field 1: Year or cycle in which COVER calculations begin. COVER calculations will also be performed in all cycles after the one specified. Default = 1 field 2: File reference number for COVER output file. If this field is left blank the COVER report will be written to the FVS output file. If the value is any number other than 16 or blank, then an associated COVER output file needs to be opened with OPEN keyword. Default = 16 Note: When using the Suppose interface program, the END keyword that terminates the cover keyword sequence is included automatically.

In the case of crown dubbing (generating values for missing crown ratio data), the dubbed crown ratio is adjusted by the specified proportion. field 1: Year or cycle in which the multiplier is applied. Once in effect it remains in effect until repla ced by a subsequent multiplier. Default = 1 field 2: Species code to which the multiplier is applied. Default = All field 3: Multiplier value. For example, a value of 1.1 will make the crown ratio change 10% greater. A tree that had a crown ratio going from 90 to 80 (a 10% change) would now have a crown going from 90 to 79 (an 11% change, or 1.1 times the original change). When applied to dubbed crowns, the initial crown ratio is multiplied by this value. Default = 1.0 field 4: Minimum dbh in inches (greater than or equal to) to which the multiplier is applied. Default = 0.0 field 5: Maximum dbh in inches (less than) to which the multiplier is applied. Default = 999.0 field 6: Dubbing flag. Default =0 0 Applied to the crown change and dubbed crowns. Positive number Applied to dubbed crowns only.

See the introduction for a description of this format.  CUTEFF  (CUTting EFF iciency) Variants: All Related keywords: THINxxx Sets the proportion of trees represented by a tree record that can be removed in any thinning. For example, if a tree record that is designated for removal in a thinning represents 200 trees per acre and the cutting efficiency is set to 0.8, 160 trees per acre (80%) will be removed from that record leaving 40 trees per acre standing. The CUTEFF keyword alone does not remove trees. It must be followed by one or more thinning keywords that, in conjunction with the CUTEFF keyword, determine the number of trees to be removed from each tree record. field 1: Cutting efficiency. This is the proportion of the sample trees represented b y a record that is removed if a tree is designated for removal in a thinning. Range: 0.01 - 1.0, Default = 1.0 Note: Note: Note: Keyword order is important. The cutting efficiency specified on a CUTEFF keyword only applies to thinning keywords that follow the CUT EFF keyword. Multiple CUTEFF keywords can be included in a keyword set. There is also a cutting efficiency parameter on each thinning request keyword. If a value is specified as part of a thinning request, it only applies to that thinning re quest. If a value is not supplied with the thinning request, the cutting efficiency parameter associated with the CUTEFF keyword will be used.

If using the Suppose interface program the CUTLIST output file, by default, has the same base name as the simulation file with a .trl extension. This is the same file used, by default, for the TREELIST output.

If blank, debug output will be printed for all cycles. Default = All field 2: If debugs are desired for specific subroutines, a non-zero number is entered and the specific subroutines are listed on supplemental records. A blank or no entry will result in debugs for all subroutines. Default = All field 3: File reference number for DEBUG output file. File reference numbers are a mechanism that FVS uses to keep track of external files. Numbers less than 30 are reserved for files that are currently used by FVS.

A negative value is in terpreted as the inverse of a large-tree fixed area plot. Default = 40 field 2: Inverse of the small-tree fixed area plot (e.g. if the fixed area plot is 1/100 acre, enter 100 in this field). Default = 300 field 3: Break point diameter in inches. Any trees smaller than this diameter were sampled using the small-tree fixed area plots. Trees with diameters greater than or equal to this diameter were sampled using the specified BAF or large-tree fixed area plots. Default = 5.0 field 4: Number of plots in the stand. If blank or 0 (zero), the number of plots in the stand is determined by counting the numbers of unique plot identification codes on the tree record data. Default = blank (FVS count) field 5: Number of nonstockable plots in the stand (e.g. plo ts fell on a road or rock outcrop). If blank, count nonstockable plots on tree records (value class = 8). Default = blank (FVS count) field 6: Sampling weight (usually acres) for the stand. This weight does not affect the projection, but is used in programs that aggregate projections to produce a composite yield table. Default = blank (number of plots) field 7: Proportion of the stand considered stockable. A value entered in this field will override the calculation based on number of plots stockable versus total number of plots. Range: 0.0 - 1.0, Default = 1.0 Note: The Suppose interface program automatically includes a DESIGN keyword based on the stand and plot data in the stand list file. To override any field of the Suppose-generated DESIGN keyword, only enter values in the fields that are to be overridden.

The summary statistics table will still be written to the standard FVS output file. No fields are associated with this keyword. Note: Note: This keyword is required in order to use the ""Average Summary Table"" post processor. This post processor uses the ECHOSUM output file as input. If using the Suppose interface program the ECHOSUM output file, by default, has the same base name as the simulation file with a .sum extension. GTR INT -133, User's Guide to the Stand Prognosis Model, p. 48  Reference:  END  ( END special sequence) Variants: All Related keywords: COMMENT, COMPUTE, COVER, ESTAB, FMIN, OPEN Signifies the end of a special keyword sequence. Essentially, the END keyword returns control of the simulation to the base FVS system after an extension (such as the Establishment Model) has been called. No fields are associated with this keyword. Reference: GTR INT -133, User's Guide to the Stand Prognosis Model, p. 85  ENDIF  ( END an IF-then block) Variants: All Related keywords: IF, THEN Signifies the end of an Event Monitor IF-THEN block.

GTR INT -275, User's Guide t o the Event Monitor..., p. 2  Reference:  ESTAB  ( ESTABlishment model) Variants: All Related keywords: END Signifies the beginning of keywords for the Regeneration Establishment extension. This extension has its own unique set of keywords (see the Establishment keyword descriptions at the end of this guide, and GTR INT -279, User's Guide to the Regeneration Establishment Model...) The ESTAB  22   keyword sequence must be terminated with an END keyword. All keywords between ESTAB and END are considered Establishment extension keywords. field 1: Year or cycle of disturbance or beginning of regeneration. The seedling tally sequence will begin in this year. Default = 0 (all cycles) Caution: Some care is necessary when entering a disturbance date to insure that the regeneration establishment model is called at the correct time. Pay close attention to cycle boundaries when entering disturbance date. Caution: If the ESTAB keyword is embedded in an event monitor sequence, year of disturbance (field 1) is interpreted as years from the time the condition is true until establishment, or in other words, a lag time. (e.g. a 5 in field 1 means wait 5 years after condition is true to establish the stand.) Note: The Regeneration Establishment extension keyword sequence must begin with an ESTAB keyword and end with an END keyword; all keywords contained within this sequence are considered Regeneration Establishment keywords.

Currently fixed at 200 field 3: Rate of application for phosphorus in pounds per acre. Currently fixed at 0 field 4: Rate of application for potassium in pounds per acre. Currently fixed at 0 field 5: Multiplier for modifying the predicted response to fertilizer application (e.g. 1.1 results in a 10% increase over the predicted fertilization response). Default = 1.0 Note: Note: The effects are based on data from northern Idaho. The PARMS format may be used with this keyword. See the introduction for a description of this format.  Caution: If this keyword is embedded in an event monitor sequence, field 1 is interpreted as years from the time the event is true until implementation, or in other words, a lag time. (e.g. a 5 in field 1 means wait 5 years after event is true to fertilize the stand.)  23   FIXDG  (FIXed D iameter Growth) Variants: All Related keywords: BAIMULT, DGSTDEV, READCORD, REGDMULT Multiplier used to modify the diameter growth rate of the specified species within the specified diameter range. This modifier is applied after growth prediction calculations, therefore adjusting the diameter growth will not affect height growth for that cycle. However, the changed diameter growth and resulting change in basal area will affect mortality that cycle. field 1: Year or cycle in which the multiplier is applied. Enter 0 (zero) to affect all cycles. Default = 1 field 2: Species code to which the multiplier will be applied. Default = All field 3: Multiplier value.

Default = 0.0 fie ld 5: Maximum dbh in inches (less than) to which the mortality rate will be applied. Default = 0.0 Note: The PARMS format may be used with this keyword. See the introduction for a description of this format.  Caution: Many of the predictions in FVS are b ased on diameter increment. Changing the diameter increment prediction also changes many of the other predictions made in the model. Caution: If this keyword is embedded in an event monitor sequence, field 1 is interpreted as years from the time the event is true until implementation, or in other words, a lag time.

FIXMORT  (FIXed MORT ality) Variants: All Related keywords: MORTMULT, BAMAX, SDIMAX Induces mortality of a fixed proportion of the trees per acre represented by tree record of the specifie d species and within the specified diameter range. This can replace the predicted mortality or be in addition to the predicted mortality, or the effective mortality can be the larger of the two. For example, if a tree record represents 200 trees per acre o f the designated species and within the specified diameter range, and the mortality rate is set to 0.3 and set to replace predicted mortality, 60 trees per acre (30%) from that record will die strictly due to this keyword. field 1: Year or cycle in which specified mortality rate is to take effect. Enter 0 (zero) to affect all cycles. Default = 1 field 2: Species code to which mortality rate will be applied.

See the introduction for a description of this format.  Caution: This keyword may override BAMAX and SDIMAX related mortality. Caution: If this keyword is embedded in an event monitor sequence, field 1 is interpreted as years from the time the event is true until implementation, or in other words, a lag time. (e.g. a 5 in field 1 means wait 5 years aft er event is true to apply the mortality.)  25   FMIN  (F ire M odel INitialization) Variants: All Related keywords: END Signifies the beginning of keywords for the Fuels and Fire Effects extension. This extension has its own unique set of keywords. The FMIN keyword sequence must be terminated with an END keyword. All keywords between FMIN and END are considered Fire extension keywords. No fields are associated with this keyword.  FVSSTAND (FVS STAND tables) Variants: All Related keywords: TREELIST, CUTLIST Generates an output file specifically for running the FvsStand post processor. The post processor generates stand and stock tables in a variety of formats. The output file format is similar to that of the TREELIST and CUTLIST keywords. In addition FVS STAND output files contain stand structure and age data, as well as past tree measurement data. field 1: Cycle or year in which the output is to be printed. Enter 0 (zero) to print output for all cycles. Default = 1 field 2: Printing of treelist information. This field only has effect on the output if field 1 is 1 or the beginning year of the simulation. Default = 0 0 Print cycles 0 and 1 1 Print only cycle 1, suppress cycle 0 2 Print only cycle 0, suppress cycle 1 Note: Note: Use of this keyword does not automatically start the FvsStand post processor program. The FVSSTAND output file has the same base name as the simulation file with a .fst extension.  GROWTH  ( GROWTH measurement method) Variants: All Specifies the methods used to measure and input diameter growth, height growth and mortality data. This information is used by FVS to determine how to interpret the diameter increment, height increment, and tree history fields of the input tree data. Growth estimates can be either directly measured or computed as the difference between two successive diameter or height measurements. Furthermore, the values for diameter and height can describe the tree at either the start or the end of the growth period. field 1: Method used to measure diameter growth. Default = 0 0 Measured directly (e.g. increment core). Current diameter represents a measurement at the end of growth measurement period, and diameter increment represents previous growth. 1 Subsequent measurement. Current diameter represents a meas urement at the end of the growth measurement period, and diameter increment represents a total diameter measurement at the beginning of the growth measurement period.  26   2  3  Measured directly (e.g. increment core). Current diameter represents a measurement at the beginning of growth measurement period, and diameter increment represents subsequent growth. Subsequent measurement.

Current height represents a measurement at the end of growth measurement period, and height increment represents previous growth. 1 Subsequent measurement. Current height represents a measurement at the end of the growth measurement period, and height increment represents a total height measurement at the beginning of the growth measurement period. 2 Measured directly. Current height represents a measurement at the beginning of growth measurement period, and height increment represents subsequent growth. 3 Subsequent measurement. Current height represents a measurement at the beginning of the growth measurement period, and height increment represents a total height measurement at the end of the growth measurement period. field 4: Length of height growth measure ment period in years. Default = 5 field 5: Length of the mortality observation period in years. Default = 5 Note: When diameter or height growth is to be computed as the difference between two successive measurements, the values recorded in the tree data file for diameter growth and/or height growth should be total heights and/or total outside bark diameters, not the difference between the two measurements. The Suppose interface program automatically includes a GROWTH keyword based on the appropriate fields in the stand list file if those values are other than the defaults. The PARMS format may be used with this keyword. See the introduction for a description of this format.

This modifies the height growth rate of trees in the large tree model. The diameter break that separates the large and small tree models varies by variant (Refer to the variant overview). field 1: Year or cycle in which the multiplier is applied. Once in effect it remains in effect until replaced by a subsequent multiplier. Default = 1  27   field 2: Species code to which multiplier is applied.

Range: 0.0 - 1.0, Default = 0.0 field 6: Mean proportion of height growth retained (e.g. 0.8 will retain an average of 80% of the height growth on selected trees). Default = 1.0 field 7: Standard deviation of the distribution of the proportion of height growth retained. This allows for variability in height growth reduction among the selected trees.

GTR INT -208, Supplement to the User's Guide..., p. 20  References:  IF  (begin IF -then block) Variants: All Related keywords: THEN, ENDIF Signifies the beginning of an Event Monitor IF-THEN block (also called scheduling by condition). The Event Monitor keyword sequence must begin with an IF keyword. The next record must be a condition statement that evaluates to true or false. The next record is a THEN keyword. The sequence ends with an ENDIF keyword. All keywords contained between the THEN and ENDIF keywords will be executed whenever the condition is true. The condition is checked every cycle, unless that cycle falls within the minimum waiting time since the last time the condition was true. field 1: Minimum waiting time in years after the condition was found true before the condition will be evaluated again. Nothing in the IF -THEN block will occur  28   until after this period of time has passed since the condition was last found true, and at that point the condition will again begin to be evaluated. Syntax: IF Minimum waiting time Condition is true THEN Perform Activity ENDIF Example: If stand basal area exceeds 100 square feet per acre, thin the stand according to the THINDBH parameters. Once this condition is true, wait 30 years before checking the condition again: 30 0 0 99 1.0 0 0 0  IF BBA GT 100 THEN THINDBH ENDIF  Caution: The year/cycle field on activity keywords changes meanin g to become a delay period when the keywords are included in an Event Monitor IF- THEN block. Entering 2010 in the date field of an activity keyword that is in an IF-THEN block will cause a delay period of 2010 years. Note: When using the Suppose interfa ce program, scheduling by condition is accomplished by clicking the ""Schedule by Condition"" button in individual keyword windows, and then clicking the ""Condition"" button and selecting ""Free Form"" to set up the condition statement. The activity keyword that follows the THEN statement (the THINDBH keyword as shown in the example above) is not typed in explicitly, but is rather set up using the keyword window. When the condition statement has been typed in, the ""OK"" button is clicked to return to the keywo rd window to fill in the appropriate field values. The ENDIF keyword will be added automatically. GTR INT -275, User's Guide to the Event Monitor..., p. 2  Reference:  INVYEAR  (INVentory YEAR) Variants: All Related keywords: NUMCYCLE, TIMEINT Specifies the starting year for a projection. The year entered is assumed to be the year that the stand was inventoried. field 1: Starting year (4-digits) for the simulation (e.g. 1987). Default = 0 Caution: Any starting year may be used. Care must be taken to assure that the years for which options are requested fall within the range of dates defined by the parameters on the NUMCYCLE, TIMEINT and INVYEAR keywords. Note: The Suppose interface program automatically includes an INVYEAR keyword based on the inventory year field in the stand list file. If this field is blank, Suppose will use the current year as the inventory year. GTR INT -133, User's Guide to the Stand Prognosis Model, p. 8  Reference:  29   MANAGED (MANAGED stand) Variants: EM, KT, PN, SE, WC Acts as a flag to signify that the stand is managed (e.g. a plantation) or unmanaged. Once set to ""managed"", it remains in effect until a subsequent use of the keyword sets it to ""unmanaged"". When the flag is set to ""managed"" (field 2 = 1), growth rates are modified in the particular model(s) listed below by variant. Eastern Montana (EM) Kookantl (KT) Pacific Northwest Coast (PN) Southeast (SE) Westside Cascades (WC) Large Large Small Larg e Small tree tree tree tree tree diameter diameter diameter diameter diameter growth growth and small tree height growth growth growth for species SP and LP growth  field 1: Year or cycle. Default = 0 (all cycles) field 2: Management flag. Default = 1 0 Unmanaged 1 Managed Note: If the MANAGED keyword is not present in the simulation, the stand is considered unmanaged.  MCDEFECT (Merchantable Cubic foot DEFECT) Variants: All Related keywords: BFDEFECT, MCFDLN, VOLUME Specifies species -specific cubic - foot volume defect corrections for cubic foot volume estimates. In t he eastern half of the US this keyword specifies defect only for the pulpwood that is smaller than the merchantable limits for sawlogs. (Defect for the sawlog portion of pulpwood trees is set using the BFDEFECT keyword.) Defect percentages are specified by species for the following five dbh's: 5, 10, 15, 20, 25+ inches. For example, if the expected defect correction for a five-inch tree is 35 percent, a value of .35 would be entered in field 3. A linear interpolation function calculates the defect percentage for the specified dbh of the tree. For trees smaller than 5 inches dbh or greater than 25 inches dbh, a constant value for defect correction is applied based on the values in fields 3 and 7 respectively. field 1: Year or cycle in which the defect corrections are to take effect. Once in effect it remains in effect until replaced by a subsequent multiplier. Default = 0 (all cycles) field 2: Species code for which the defect corrections are to be applied.

Range: 0.0 - 1.0, Default = 0.0 field 5: Cubic foot volume defect correction percentage for a 15 -inch tree. Range: 0.0 - 1.0, Default = 0.0  30   field 6: Cubic foot volume defect correction percentage for a 20 -inch tree. Range: 0.0 - 1.0, Default = 0.0 field 7: Cubic foot volume defect correction percentage for a 25 -inch tree. All trees greater than 25 inches dbh will be assigned this value of defect correction percentage. Range: 0.0 - 1.0, Default = 0.0 Note: Note: Note: For any particular species this keyword remains in effect until a subsequent use of the keyword changes the multiplier for that species. If used inside an Event Monitor sequence, BFDEFECT will not affect cycle 0 volumes. The PARMS format may be used with this keyword. In the PARMS format, however, 0 (zero) may not be used in the year/cycle field, and hence the defect will not affect cycle 0 volumes. See the introduction for a description of this format.

The code does NOT affect the projection, but is printed with each output table. When this keyword is not used, the code ""NONE"" is used. No fields are associated with this keyword, however a supplemental record that contains the code entered in Columns 1- 4 is required. When the supplemental record is blank, no code is printed.

The accumulated removals across all thinnings in a cycle must exceed the standards for all the units of measure (fields 2, 3, and 4), or none of the thinnings in that cycle will be implemented. field 1: Year or cycle in which minimum harvest standards will be applied. Once in effect, it remains in effect until a subsequent MINHARV keyword changes the standards. Default = 1 field 2: The minimum acceptable harvest volume in merchantable cubic -feet per acre.

If both keywords are included in a simulation, the one that appears later in the simulation file will determin e the model type. When using the CR or SE variants with the Suppose interface program, Suppose automatically includes a MODTYPE keyword. The field values are based on the model type, physiographic region, and forest type fields in the stand list file. If any of these fields are blank, the default values are used.  Note:  MORTMULT (MORT ality MULT iplier) Variants: All Related keywords: FIXMORT, SDIMAX, BAMAX Multiplier used to alter predicted mortality rate. In variants AK, BM, CA, CR, EC, EM, KT, NC, NI, PN, SO, TT, UT, and WS, the multiplier is applied to the predicted background mortality only, and density related mortality is unaffected. (Use SDIMAX to modify density related mortality.) In the other variants the multiplier is applied to all predicted mortality. field 1: Year or cycle in which multiplier is applied. Once in effect, it remains in effect until replaced by a subsequent multiplier. Default = 1 field 2: Species code to which multiplier is applied. Default = All field 3: Multiplier value.

No fields are associated with this keyword. Note: In the AK, CI, EM, KT, and NI variants, natural regeneration is automatically scheduled in a simulation after ""significant"" thinning events or in the absence of disturbance for a period of twenty years if the user schedules no regeneration. The NOAUTOES keyword cancels both types of automatic natural regeneration.  NOCALIB  (NO CALIBration scale factors) Variants: All Related keywords: BAIMULT Suppresses calculation of scale factors for large-tree diameter increment model and small-tree height increment model. Calibration is the default mode of the system and each species is calibrated independently. For a particular species, if there are at least five large-tree diameter increment measurements or three small-tree height increment measurements, a scale factor will be calculated for that species and growth will be adjusted accordingly. This keyword suppresses all calibration for a species (or for all species), therefore tree growth will be exactly as predicted by the model in the absence of growth information. field 1: Species code for which calculation of scale factors is to be suppressed. Note: Non-calibration is appropriate when growth measured in the sample is not typical. This might be the case during insect epidemics or prolonged drought, which would tend to show artificially low g rowth rates. This might also be the case if only site trees were measured for growth, which would tend to show artificially high growth rates. GTR INT -208, Supplement to the User's Guide..., p. 11  Reference:  NOHTDREG (NO HeighT- D iameter REGression) Variants: All Related keywords: HTGMULT, READCORH Suppresses the calibration of coefficients for height-diameter equations based on input tree data. Height-diameter equations are used in dubbing the heights of trees that have missing recorded heights. W hen the calibration of coefficients for the height dubbing process is suppressed, heights are dubbed using region-wide default coefficients. Calibration of coefficients for a species is automatically suppressed if less than three non-top -damaged trees of that species are available for the calculations.  34   field 1: Species code for which calibration of the coefficients for the height-diameter relationship will be suppressed. Default = All field 2: Suppression flag. Defaults: BM, EC, KT, NC, PN, SO, WC = 0, others = 1 0 Suppress calibration of coefficients (i.e. use defaults). 1 or greater No suppression of calibration of coefficients.  NOTREES  (NO TREE record S ) Variants: All Related keywords: ESTAB Specifies that no projectable tree records will be used as input, which permits ""bare ground"" simulations. The Regeneration Establishment Model can then be used to generate a list of seedlings to be projected. If the NOTREES keyword is not used, at least two live-tree records must be present in the input tre e data. Reference: GTR INT -208, Supplement to the User's Guide..., p. 19  NOTRIPLE (NO tree record TRIPLE) Variants: All Related keywords: NUMTRIP, DGSTDEV Suppresses record tripling. When a stand is represented by relatively few records (less than approximately 100) tripling is a mechanism to increase the number of replications to help stabilize the random effects (see DGSTDEV). Each tree record is split into three records such that the three records together represent the same number of trees per acre as the original record. The new records are similar except for diameter growth, and the weighted average of the new records is equal to the original record. Unless otherwise specified, records are tripled twice), once in the first cycle and once in t he second cycle. If the total number of records would exceed 1350 tripling is not done. No fields are associated with this keyword. Reference: GTR INT -133, User's Guide to the Stand Prognosis Model, p. 92  NUMCYCLE (NUM ber of CYCLEs) Variants: All Related keywords: TIMEINT, INVYEAR Specifies the number of cycles to run the projection. A cycle is the period of time for which tree characteristics are predicted, and for which inventories are reported (see TIMEINT). The maximum number of cycles in a pro jection is 40. field 1: Number of cycles to be projected. Note: The Suppose interface program automatically includes a NUMCYCLE keyword (with a default of ten cycles). This may be overridden by using the ""Set Time Scale"" option, or by including an addit ional NUMCYCLE keyword. Use of a NUMCYCLE keyword will override the entries from the ""Set Time Scale"" option. GTR INT -133, User's Guide to the Stand Prognosis Model, p. 8  Reference:  35   NUMTRIP  (NUM ber of times TRIPled) Variants: All Related keywords: NOT RIPLE, DGSTDEV Specifies the number of times tree records will be tripled. Tripling will be attempted once in the first cycle and once in each subsequent cycle for the number of times specified. If the total number of records would exceed 1350 tripling is not done. When a stand is represented by relatively few records (less than approximately 100) tripling is a mechanism to increase the number of replications to help stabilize the random effects (see DGSTDEV). Each tree record is split into three records such that the three records together represent the same number of trees per acre as the original record. The new records are similar except for diameter growth, and the weighted average of the new records is equal to the original record. Unless otherwise specified, records are tripled twice), once in the first cycle and once in the second cycle. field 1: Number of times tripling will be attempted. Default = 2 Note: In a bare ground projection, the number of times that records will be tripled is one less than the number specified because tripling occurs before the addition of regeneration records to the treelist. For example, if you want the tree records to be tripled twice in a bare ground projection, set the value in field 1 to 3. GTR INT -133, User's Guide to the Stand Prognosis Model, p. 92  Reference:  OPEN  (OPEN a file) Variants: All Related keywords: ADDFILE, CLOSE Requests that an external file be opened for input (e.g. an addfile) or output (e.g. a treelist file). A supplemental record is required to specify a filename for the unit that is to be opened. field 1: File reference number for the input or output file. File reference numbers are a mechanism that FVS uses to keep track of external files. Numbers less than 30 are reserved for f iles that are currently used by FVS. field 2: Code for specifying the meaning of blanks in numeric fields. Default = 0 0 Treat blanks as zeros non -zero Treat blanks as null characters field 3: File status code. Default = 0 0 Unknown (file may or may not currently exist) 1 New (file does not currently exist) 2 Old (file currently exists) field 4: Maximum record length in the file (number of characters per line).

Choose unformatted only when the sole purpose of creating this file is for use as input to another program that requires unformatted input. 1 Formatted 2 Unformatted Supplemental record: Specify a filename for the input or output file that is to be opened. The maximum permitted length of the filename is 40 characters , and there can be no leading blanks.  36   Note:  There is no default value for the file reference number (field 1). If this field is left blank the OPEN request is ignored.  PROCESS  (PROCESS the keywords) Variants: All Signifies the end of a set of keywords that define a single projection and triggers the beginning of the simulation. The PROCESS keyword must be present or the projection will not run. Multiple PROCESS keywords (i.e. multiple projections) are possible within a single simulation file. No fields are associated with this keyword. Note: The Suppose interface program automatically includes a PROCESS keyword. If multiple stands are selected, multiple PROCESS keywords will be included and multiple projections will result.

Default = 2 1 Prune to a specified height to base of live crown (field 3) without regard to the proportion of live crown this would remove 2 Prune to a specified height to base of live crown (field 3). If this would result in removing more than a specified proportion (field 4) of the live crown ratio, only remove enough crown to reach the specified proportion, instead of the specified height. 3 Prune to a s pecified height to base of live crown (field 3). If this would result in removing more than a specified proportion (field 4) of the live crown ratio, do not prune the tree. 4 Remove a specified proportion (field 4) of the live crown. 5 Remove a specified length (field 3) of the live crown without regard to the proportion of live crown this would remove. 6 Remove a specified length (field 3) of the live crown. If this would result in removing more than a specified proportion (field 4) of the live crown ratio, only remove enough to reach the specified proportion, rather than removing the specified length. 7 Remove a specified length (field 3) of the live crown. If this would result in removing more than a specified proportion (field 4) of the live crown ratio, do not prune the tree. field 3: Height in feet. Default = 0 If field 2 = 1, 2, or 3, this is the height to the base of live crown. If field 2 = 5, 6, or 7, this is the length of crown to be removed.  37   field 4: Maximum proportion. Range: 0.0 - 1.0, Default = 0.5 If field 2 = 2 or 6, this is the maximum proportion of live crown that can be removed. If field 2 = 3 or 7, this is the threshold that determines whether the tree will be pruned or not. If field 2 = 4, this is the proportion of live crown to be removed. field 5: Species code to be pruned. Default = All field 6: Minimum dbh in inches (greater than or equal to) that will be considered for pruning. Default = 0.0 field 7: Maximum dbh in inches (less than) that will be considered for pruning. Default = 99.0 Note: Note: Note: Note: Note: All prunings are considered in the same context as thinnings, and are done at the beginning of the cycle in which they are scheduled. All thinnings scheduled within a cycle are done before any pruning requests are processed. (i.e. the only trees that will be pruned are those left after the thinning) If no trees remain after thinning, all pruning requests will be cancelled. If the combination of parameters on a pruning keyword results in no trees being pruned, the pruning request is cancelled. The PARMS format may be used with this keyword. See the introduction for a description of this format.  Caution: If this keyword is embedded in an event monitor sequence, field 1 is interpreted as years from the time the event is true until implementation, or in other words, a lag time. (e.g. a 5 in field 1 means wait 5 years after event is true to prune the stand.)  RANNSEED (RANdom Number SEED) Variants: All Reseeds the pseudorandom number generators used in the FVS model. If a 0 (zero) is used as the replacement value for the seed, the model will run stochastically (i.e. results will vary for multiple runs of the same simulation file). With any non-zero seed value the model will run deterministically (i.e. the results will be the same for multiple runs of the same simulation file). field 1: Replacement value for the pseudorandom number seed (should be an odd integer). Default = 55329 Note: The FVS base model and the Regeneration Establishment extension use separate pseudorandom number generators. Each one can be reseeded independently. Using a RANNSEED keyword inside an ESTAB- END sequence affects the Regeneration Establishment extension.

The value of the maximum stand density index is an important variable in determining stand mortality and normal stocking for automatic thinnings. Also, in some variants, maximum SDI is used to model crown ratio change for individual tree records. Maximum SDI for a stand is computed as a weighted average of the SDI maximums for each species in the stand. The weight for a species is calculated as the total basal area for that species divided by the total basal area in the stand. Maximum stand SDI is used in all v ariants to determine normal stocking for automatic thinnings. In addition, it is used to calculate density related mortality in all variants except CI, CS, LS, NE, and NI. field 1: Species code for which the maximum stand density index applies. Default = All field 2: Maximum stand density index value. Defaults are based on the predominant species in the stand or are a function of plant community (see defaults below). field 3: No longer used. field 4: No longer used. field 5: Percentage of theoretical ma ximum density at which density-related mortality is invoked. Default = 55, Lower limit = 10 field 6: Percentage of theoretical maximum density at which the stand reaches actual maximum density.

Default = 0 0 No stagnation effect 1 Include stagnation effect when stand SDI is above 70% of maximum SDI SDI is computed using the following equation: SDI = N(D/10)1.605 where: SDI = stand density index N = number of trees per acre in the stand D = quadratic mean diameter in the stand Caution: Use of this keyword can drastically change predicted yields. Caution: If multiple SDIMAX keywords are used, fields 5, 6, and 7 should only be specified once. Note: This keyword is process ed before any tree data is read. If after reading the tree data it is found that the stand is above the upper limit of maximum density, the maximum SDI will be automatically recalculated without regard to the value set with this keyword. In all variants other than NI, KT, and CI, if both SDIMAX and BAMAX are specified, the SDIMAX values will override the BAMAX values.

The primary use of this keyword is to turn off the autocorrelation by setting both parameters to 0 (zero). Use of other values is strongly discouraged unless the user understands well the implications on the model. field 1: Autoregressive operator  for the ARMA(1,1) model. Default = 0.74 field 2: Moving-average operator  for the ARMA(1,1) model. Default = 0.42 Note: Setting the value of both fields to 0 (zero) turns off the autocorrelation.  Caution: Many of the predictions in FVS are based on diameter increment. Changing the diameter increment prediction also changes many of the other predictions made in the model.  SITECODE (SITE index CODE) Variants: All except CI, KT, and NI Sets species -specific site index values. If a SITECODE keyword is present, all species for which site index values were not explicitly set will be assigned site index values derived from the site index of the specified site species. If no SITECODE keyword is present, site index defaults are assigned as shown in Appendix B.  44   field 1: Species code. If blank, all species will be assigned the value in field 2. Default = blank (all species) field 2: Site index in feet. For the NC, SO, and WS variants, a value less than 10 is interpreted as a Dunning site code and is converted to a site index for each species as described in the technical documentation for those variants. Defaults shown in Appendix B field 3: Site species override code. A non-zero value designates the species in field 1 as the site species for the stand. Default = 0 Note: If field 3 is 0 (zero) or blank in each of the SITECODE keywords used, the species from the first SITECODE keyword with a non-zero, non-blank species code becomes the site species for the stand. The Suppose interface program automatically includes a SITECODE keyword based on the site index and site species fields of the stand list file if those fields are not blank.  Note:  SPCODES  (SPecies CODES) Variants: All Related keywords: TREEFMT Identifies species codes used on the input tree records. This keyword is used when the species codes in the input tree records do not match the standard FVS species codes for the variant being used (see Appendix A). One or more supplemental records are required that contain the species codes from the input tree records. field 1: FVS species sequence number (integer) whose alpha code is to be overridden. Do not enter the 2-character alpha species code. If blank, all species codes are to be replaced. Supplemental record(s): Species codes from the input tree records are left justified in 4-character fields. If field 1 identifies a specific species, the supplemental record consists simply of one 4-character field. If field 1 is blank, then all species codes are to be overridden and each supplemental record consists of up to twenty consecutive 4character fields. In this case, the species codes are entered sequentially in the order of the species sequence numbers (see Appendix A). Each species in FVS can be represented by only one code from the input tree records. Example 1, single species: SPCODES LPP 7  Example 2, all species in a variant with 24 species : SPCODES SAF CF3 DF 217 WF2 MTH CW A99 990 999 68 WL5 BC LP5 LPP PY PP1 WBP WWP J BS2 93 WTS ASP  Note:  The codes in the supplemental records are interpreted literally and blanks are not equivalent to zeros. For example, ""WP "" is different than "" WP"" (trailing spaces vs. leading spaces). Also "" 3"" is different than "" 03"". If all tree records are ultimately reported by FVS as ""other species"" or something similar, an error has probably been made in the preparation of either the SPCODES or TREEFMT keywords.  Note:  45   SPECPREF (SPECies removal PREF erence) Variants: All Related keywords: TCONDMLT, THINxxx Sets the removal preference for a species. This affects the order in which trees are selected for removal when a harvest is implemented. When a thinning is implemented, tree records with the highest removal priority are selected first, and selection continues based on removal priority until the parameters of the thinning have been met, or until all records have been selected. The removal priorit y is determined by the equation below: Removal Priority = (DBH * FD ) + SP + (TVC * FT) + (MR * FM) + (STS * FS) All terms after the first default to zero . (See TCONDMLT and refer to the Dwarf Mistletoe Impact Model keyword documentation for MISTPREF for a discussion of the other terms). The relevant part of the equation for this keyword is: Removal Priority = (DBH * FD ) + SP where: DBH = diameter at breast height FD = 1 for thinning from above, -1 for thinning from below SP = species preference For the species designated in field 2 of the SPECPREF keyword, the SP (species preference) term has the value assigned in field 3. Species preference for other species are set with additional SPECPREF keywords, otherwise they have a default value of 0 (zero). The SPECPREF keyword alone does not remove trees. It must be followed by one or more thinning keywords, which, in conjunction with the SPECPREF keyword, determine the order of tree records selected. field 1: Year or cycle the preference is to be applied. Once in effect it remains in effect until replaced by a subsequent multiplier. Default = 1 field 2: Species code whose removal priority is to be changed. A valid code is required or the keyword is ignored. field 3: Preference value for removal of species identified in field 2. A positive value increases the chance for tree removal and a negative value increases the chance for tree retention. Default = 0 Example: In a thinning from above, a 15- inch PP is selected for harvest before a 12 -inch WF. If a SPECPREF keyword is used to assign a preference of 5 to WF, then the WF (whose removal priority is now 12*1 + 5, or 17) is selected before the PP, even though the PP is larger.  Note: Note:  For any particular species this keyword remains in effect until a subsequent use of the keyword changes the priority for that species. Keyword order may be important. If a SPECPREF keyword is specified for the same year that a thinning keyword is specified, the species preference will affect the thinning only if the SPECPREF keyword appears in the keyword sequence before the thinning keyword. The PARMS format may be used with this keyword. See the introduction for a description of this format.  Note:  Caution: The SPECPREF keyword has no effect on thinning done with t he THINDBH or THINHT keywords.  46   Reference:  GTR INT -133, User's Guide to the Stand Prognosis Model, p. 26  STATS  (STATistic S ) Variants: All Requests that optional output tables that show a statistical description of the input (inventory) data for a pro jection be written to the standard FVS output file. Statistics reported include board -foot volume, cubic -foot volume, trees per acre, and basal area per acre for each species present in the stand. Also included are the mean, standard deviation, coefficie nt of variation, and confidence limits across sample plots for stand totals of these volume and density measures. The user-defined significance level defines the corresponding Student's t -value computed by the program. field 1: Significance level for com puting confidence limits. Default = 0.05 Caution: No corrections are made to account for non-stockability if the stand contains nonstockable plots. These plots are included in the calculations.  STDIDENT (STanD IDENTification) Variants: All Specifie s a stand identification code and optional descriptive title to label output tables. No fields are associated with this keyword. Stand identification information is entered on a supplemental record. Supplemental record: Contains a stand identification code of up to 26 characters. This stand ID will appear with every output table. A blank character indicates the end of the stand identification code. Anything entered after the blank, up to column 80, is read as an optional ""Title"" that will appear wit h some of the output tables. Example: STDIDENT C24S112 Stand 112 in Clear Creek drainage  This example uses ""C24S112"" as the stand ID. This appears along with ""Stand 112 in Clear Creek drainage"" in the headings of tables in the main FVS output file. No te: The Suppose interface program automatically includes a STDIDENT keyword based on the Stand ID field in the stand list file and the Location Name field in the locations file.

If no value was previously assigned, the default is used. The Suppose interface program automatically includes a STDINFO keyword based on the corresponding fields in the stand list file. GTR INT -133, User's Guide to the Stand Prognosis Model, p. 12  Reference:  STOP  (STOP processing) Variants: All Marks the end of the keyword record file. When the STOP keyword is encountered, program execution ends. No fields are associated with this keyword. Reference: GTR INT -133, User's Guide to the Stand Prognosis Model, p. 8  STRCLASS (STRuctural CLASS) Variants: All Requests that structural written to the main FVS the Event Monitor. The Monitor structural stage class calculations are done by FVS. A table of structural statistics can be output file . The structural class computation results are made available to STRCLASS keyword must be present if the user is going to use Event variables (refer to the list in the Note that follows this description).  field 1: A nonzero entry causes FVS to print the table of structural statistics in the main FVS output file. 0 (zero) suppresses printing of the tables. Default = 1 field 2: The percentage of a tree's height that is used to define the minimum gap size. Range: 0 -100, Default = 30 field 3: The dbh boundary (in inches) separating seedling/sapling-sized trees from pole sized trees. Default = 5.0 field 4: The dbh boundary (in inches) separating pole -sized trees from large trees that may be considered old.

SVS  (Stand Visualization System input) Variants: All Generates an output file specifically for running the Stand Visualization System (SVS) post processor. The SVS software is not a part of the FVS software. It is maintained by the Pacific Northwest Research Station. It generates 3D drawings of the stand based on information produced by FVS. field 1: Plot geometry and tree placement. Default = 1 0 Square SVS layout, ignore FVS plot designations 1 Square SVS layout, position trees by FVS plot designation 2 Round SVS layout, ignore FVS plot designations 3 Round SVS layout, position trees by FVS plot designation field 2: Output file organization. Default = 0 0 Images in separate files, an index file is created 1 Images all in one file, no index file is created field 3: Draw range poles. Default = 0 0 Range poles are drawn at the edges of the SVS layout 1 No range poles field 4: Draw subplot boundaries. Default = 0 0 FVS plot boundaries are drawn as lines in the SVS layout 1 No FVS plot boundaries drawn Note: Note: Use of this keywo rd does not automatically start the SVS post processor program. The output files created by the SVS keyword vary based on the value in field 2 of this keyword. If an index file is produced, it has the same base name as the simulation file with a _i ndex.svs appended. The image files associated with the index file are placed in a directory with the base name of the simulation file. The first image file is named with the simulation base name with _001.svs appended, and subsequent files are named simi larly using subsequent numbers in the names. (e.g. simulation file testrun.key produces index file testrun_index.svs, and image files testrun_001.svs, testrun_002.svs, etc.) If all images are in a single file, that file is named with the simulation base name with .svs as the extension (e.g. simulation file testrun2.key produces image file testrun2.svs).  TCONDMLT (Tree Condition MULTiplier) Variants: All Related keywords: SPECPREF, THINxxx Sets the tree value class multiplier and/or the special tree status multiplier in the harvest priority algorithm. This affects the order in which trees are selected for removal when a harvest is implemented. When a thinning is implemented, tree records with the highest removal priority are  50   selected first, and selection continues based on removal priority until the parameters of the thinning have been met, or until all records have been selected. The removal priority is determined by the equation below: Removal Priority = (DBH * FD ) + SP + (TVC * FT) + (MR * FM) + ( STS * FS) All terms after the first default to zero . (See SPECPREF and refer to the Dwarf Mistletoe Impact Model keyword documentation for MISTPREF for a discussion of the other terms). The relevant part of the equation for this keyword is: Removal Priority = (DBH * FD ) + (TVC * FT) + (STS * FS) where: DBH = diameter at breast height FD = 1 for thinning from above, -1 for thinning from below TVC = tree value class (column 48 of the standard input tree record; 1 = desirable, 2 = acceptable, 3 = undesirable) FT = tree value class multiplier (field 2 value). STS = special tree status (the severity code associated with a damage code of 55 in the input tree record) FS = special tree status multiplier (field 3 value) The tree value class multiplier F T is applied to the value class of all tree records. A value of 0 (zero) causes value class to be ignored in determining removal priority. The special tree status multiplier FS is applied to the special tree status of any records that were given a special tree s tatus (a special tree status code is the severity code associated with a damage code of 55). Special tree status codes are arbitrary. They were incorporated as a mechanism to allow modification of the removal priority based on user-defined attributes that would be otherwise unavailable to the user. A value of 0 (zero) causes special tree status to be ignored in determining removal priority. The TCONDMLT keyword alone does not remove trees. It must be followed by one or more thinning keywords, which, in conjunction with the TCONDMLT keyword, determine the order of tree records selected. field 1: Year or cycle in which the change is to be implemented. Once in effect it remains in effect until replaced by a subsequent multiplier. Default = 1 field 2: Tree value class multiplier. A positive value increases the chance for removal of lower value class trees. A negative value increases the chance for removal of higher value class trees. Default = 0 field 3: Special tree status multiplier. A positive value increases the chance of removal of trees with a high special tree status code. A negative value increases the chance of retention of trees with a high special tree status code. Default = 0 Note: Note: This keyword remains in effect until a subsequent use of the keyword changes the multipliers. Keyword order may be important. If a TCONDMLT keyword is specified for the same year that a thinning keyword is specified, the multipliers will affect the thinning only if the TCONDMLT keyword appears in the keyword sequence before the thinning keyword. The PARMS format may be used with this keyword. See the introduction for a description of this format.  Note:  Caution: The TCONDMLT keyword has no effect on thinning done with the THINDBH or THINHT keywords.  51   Reference:  GTR INT -133, User's Guide to the Stand Prognosis Model, p. 26  THEN  (schedule if-THEN activities) Variants: All Related keywords: IF, ENDIF Signifies the scheduling portion of an Event Monitor IF -THEN block. The Event Monitor keyword sequence must begin with an IF keyword. The next record must be a condition statement that evaluates to true or false. The next record is a THEN keyword. The sequence ends with an ENDIF keyword. All keywords contained between the THEN and ENDIF keywords will be executed whenever the condition is true. Any activity that can be normally scheduled can be alternatively scheduled within the Event Monitor IF -THEN block. The scheduling date (field 1) on the activity is then interpreted as a delay period. If the d ate entered is 10, the activity will be scheduled 10 years following the each date that the logical expression is true. Multiple activities can be scheduled in a single IF -THEN block, and all will be triggered by the same condition. Example: If stand bas al area exceeds 100 square feet per parameter of the THINDBH keyword is now a stand according to the THINDBH parameters. 30 years (parameter on the IF keyword) before 30 10 0 99 1.0 0 0 0  acre, wait 10 years (first delay period) and then thin the Once this condition is true, wait checking the condition again:  IF BBA GT 100 THEN THINDBH ENDIF  Caution: The year/cycle field on activity keywords changes meaning to become a delay period when the keywords are included in an Event Monitor IF- THEN block. Entering 2010 in the date field of an activity keyword that is in an IF-THEN block will cause a delay period of 2010 years. Note: When using the Suppose interface program, scheduling by condition is accomplished by clicking the ""Schedule by Condition"" button in individual keyword windows, and then clicking the ""Condition"" button and selecting ""Free Form"" to set up the condition statement. The activity keyword that follows the THEN statement (the THINDBH keyword as shown in the example above) is not typed in explicitly, but is rather set up using the keyword window. When the condition statement has been typed in, the ""OK"" button is clicked to return to the keyword window to fill in the appropriate field values. The ENDIF keyword will be added automatically. GTR INT -275, User's Guide to the Event Monitor..., p. 2  Reference:  THINABA  (THIN from A bove to Basal A rea target) Variants: All Related keywords: THINxxx, SPECPREF, TCONDMLT, CUTEFF Schedules a thinning from above to a basal-area-per-acre target. Only trees with dbh's and heights within the user-defined ranges are considered for removal. The tree record with the largest diameter within the specified range is considered for removal first, and the proportion of that tree record specified in field 3 is removed. The tree record with the next largest diameter is considered next, then the next largest and so on until the residual basal area target is met or all records in the specified range have been considered. The residual target basal area is specified only for the user-  52   defined range of dbh and height, and does not represent the total residual unless the range of dbh's and heights includes all trees in the stand. field 1: Year or cycle that thinning is scheduled.

The total residual will also include all trees that do not fall within this range. Caution: If the cutting efficiency is set too low, the model may not be able to attain the residual target specified. The thinning request will be completed, but the residual stand condition will be greater than the specified target. Caution: If a thinning keyword is embedded in an event monitor sequence, year (field 1) is interpreted as years from the time the condition is true u ntil implementation, or in other words, a lag time. (e.g. a 5 in field 1 means wait 5 years after condition is true to thin the stand.) Note: Note: If field 2 is blank the keyword is ignored. If the initial stand condition is already less than the target specified, the thinning will be cancelled. Look at the ""Activity Summary"" portion of the standard FVS output to see which requests were implemented and which were cancelled. A thinning is always done in the first year of the cycle in which it is scheduled, even if the year entered in field 1 is not the first year of the cycle. If a thinning must occur in a particular year, a TIMEINT keyword may be needed to change the length of a cycle so that the desired year for the thinning becomes the first y ear of a cycle. Multiple thinning keywords can be scheduled for the same year to simulate different aspects of a single harvest. Care must be taken to ensure that the dbh and height ranges do not unintentionally overlap, or the residual may not be what was expected. Total residuals must be calculated carefully. The PARMS format may be used with this keyword. See the introduction for a description of this format.

Many actions (e.g. thinnings) in FVS are implemented in the first year of the cycle in which they are scheduled, regardless of the actual year in the cycle that the action was scheduled. The only way to ensure that an action can be implemented in the same year that it is scheduled is to schedule the action in the first year of a cycle. This may not be possible if the cycles are left at their default length of ten years. A TIMEINT keyword can be used to change the length of a cycle so that the desired year for a particular action becomes the first year of a cycle. field 1: Cycle number whose length is to be changed. Enter 0 (zero) to change the length of all projection cycles. Default = 1 field 2: Cycle length in years for the cycle(s) referenced in field 1.

Instead, subsequent cycles are affected by other TIMEINT keywords, or are assigned default lengths. Note: Multiple TIMEINT keywords can be scheduled for a simulation. If multiple TIMEINT keywords are scheduled to affect any particular cycle, the last encountered use of the keyword will override the effects of all the previous. The Suppose interface program automatically includes a TIMEINT keyword whenever there are stands in a simulation that have different inventory years. The TIMEINT keyword is used to change the first cycle for stands that were inventoried earlier to bring all the simulations so a common year. Simulations for these stands will contain one additional cycle. From that point the simulations run with default cycle length.

The following is the default tree format used to read the input tree variables (I4,T1,I7,F6.0,I1,A3,F4.1,F3.1,2F3.0,F4.1,I1,6I2,2I1,I2,2I3,2I1) Where: I indicates ""read as an integer"" and th e trailing number indicates the number of columns to read (e.g. I4 indicates 4 columns are to be read as integer input). F indicates ""read as decimal input"" and the trailing numeric code indicates the total number of columns and number of decimal places (e.g. F4.1 indicates 4 columns are to be read as decimal input and 1 decimal place will be kept. If no decimal point is present, the last digit is assumed to be tenths). A indicates ""read as alpha characters"" and the trailing number indicates the number of columns to read (e.g. A3 indicates 3 columns are to be read, and letters or other characters may be present. Blanks are read in as well).  64   T indicates a tab to a specific column. The trailing number indicates the column of the first character to be read using the next format listed. Commas (,) separate individual format specifications. Numbers that precede a letter indicate that the format specification is repeated that number of times (e.g. 2I3 is equivalent to I3,I3). No fields are associated with this keyword. The format statement is entered on two supplemental records. Supplemental records: Two supplemental records are required, each a maximum of 80 characters long. The supplemental records comprise a FORTRA N format statement of the type described above. If the entire format statement is included in a single supplemental record, the second supplemental record will be blank, but it must still be included.

Caution: If decimal input was specified in the format statement but no decimal point appears in the input, the decimal point will be assumed and its placement will be determined by the format statement. For example, the format statement F4.1 will cause input of 1234 to be read as 123.4.  65   Caution: Tree count is used in conjunction with the plot design information in the DESIGN keyword to determine the number of trees per acre each record represents. For example, a single seedling (tree count = 1) on one of five 1/100 acre fixed plots represents 20 seedlings per acre in the stand. Note: Species and dbh are required fields. It is also suggested that minimally plot ID, tree count, tree history, and live height are included. In the absence of corresponding data, each tree record will be assumed to represent one live tree, all will be assumed to have been recorded on a single plot. If fields were not included in the tree data records tab to blank data columns and read blank data for those fields. If all tree records are ultimately reported by FVS as ""other species"" or something similar, an error has probably been made in the preparation of either the TREEFMT or SPCODES keywords. The Suppose interface pro gram automatically includes a TREEFMT keyword with the default format. If the tree data records are in a different format, an additional TREEFMT keyword must be added with the proper format statement.

descriptions of the keywords that are used with the Regeneration Establishment extension to the Forest Vegetation Simulator. With only a few exceptions, the keywords in this section are only recognized by FVS when they are contained in a sequence that begins with the keyword ESTAB and ends with the keyword END. Base model keywords are not recognized when they appear inside this sequence. The following is a list of all the Regeneration Establishment model keywords. For a full description of t he Regeneration Establishment model refer to GTR INT- 279, User's Guide to Version 2 of the Regeneration Establishment Model: Part of the Prognosis Model. AUTALLY BUDWORM BURNPREP END ESTAB EZCRUISE HABGROUP HTADJ INGROW MECHPREP MINPLOTS NATURAL NOAUTALY NOINGROW NOSPROUT OUTPUT PASSALL PLANT PLOTINFO RANNSEED RESETAGE SPECMULT SPROUT STACKADJ TALLY TALLYONE TALLYTWO THRSHOLD  85   AUTALLY  (AUtomatic seedling TALLY) Regeneration Establishment Extension Variants: AK, CI, EM, KT, NI Related keywords: THRESHOLD, NOAUTALY, TALLY, TALLYONE, TALLYTWO Requests automatic scheduling of regeneration following thinnings in which certain thresholds are exceeded. When 10 to 30 percent of the trees per acre or total cubic foot volume is removed, a single regeneration tally is scheduled. When more than 30 percent of the trees per acre or total cubic foot volume is removed, a tally sequence is scheduled. These percentages can be modified using the THRESHOLD keyword. No fields are associated with this keyword. Note: This keyword is only used in FVS variants that have the capability for automatic prediction of natural regeneration (AK, CI, EM, KT, and NI).  Caution: The base model keyword NOAUTOES invokes the NOAUTALY, NOINGROW and NOSPROUT keywords. Reference: GTR INT -2 79, User's Guide to the Regeneration Establishment Model..., p. 8  BUDWORM (spruce BUDWORM ) Regeneration Establishment Extension Variants: All Specifies defoliation histories for western spruce budworm and the effects of budworm defoliation on regeneration success. field 1: Year or cycle that defoliation began. A 0 (zero) or blank results in an error message. field 2: Last year of defoliation. A 0 (zero) or blank is replaced with the value in field 1 resulting in one year of defoliation. Note: Note: Up to 20 BUDWORM keyword records can be present in a projection. If budworm effects are represented by the Budworm Model then this keyword is not necessary. GTR INT -279, User's Guide to the Regeneration Establishment Model..., p. 11  Reference:  BURNPREP (BURNing site PREParation) Regeneration Establishment Extension Variants: ALL Related keywords: MECHPREP Specifies the percentage of regeneration plots receiving site preparation by burning. When site preparation treatments have not been specified or assigned with BURNPREP or MECHPREP keywords, default equations are invoked. These equations predict the proportion of the stand receiving each of the three treatments (burning, mechanical scarification, and no disturbance) based on site characteristics such as slope, aspect, habitat type, residual basal area, elevation, and topographic position.  86   field 1: Year or cycle of site preparation. Default = 0 (all cycles) field 2: Percentage of plots to be treated. Range: 0 -100, Default = 0 Note: Note: The sum of mechanical and burn treatments must be less than, or equal to, 100 percent. If the sum is less than 100 percent, the difference is the percentage of undisturbed plots. Site preparations can be assigned to individual plots if desired. See PLOTINFO keyword. GTR INT -279, User's Guide to the Regeneration Establishment Model..., p. 11  Reference:  END  ( END of regeneration sequence) Regeneration Establishment Extension Variants: ALL Related keywords: ESTAB Signifies the end of the Regeneration Establis hment sequence of keywords that was begun with the ESTAB keyword. Essentially, the END keyword returns control of the simulation to the base FVS system after the Regeneration Establishment extension has been called. No fields are associated with this ke yword. Reference: GTR INT -279, User's Guide to the Regeneration Establishment Model..., p. 12  ESTAB  ( ESTABlishment model) Regeneration Establishment Extension Variants: All Related keywords: END Signifies the beginning of keywords for the Regeneration Establishment extension. The ESTAB keyword sequence must be terminated with an END keyword. All keywords between ESTAB and END are considered Establishment extension keywords. field 1: Year or cycle of disturbance or beginning of regeneration. The seedling tally sequence will begin in this year. Default = 0 (all cycles) Caution: Some care is necessary when entering a disturbance date to insure that the regeneration establishment model is called at the correct time. Pay close attention to cycle boundaries when entering disturbance date. Caution: If the ESTAB keyword is embedded in an event monitor sequence, year of disturbance (field 1) is interpreted as years from the time the condition is true until establishment, or in other words, a lag time. (e .g. a 5 in field 1 means wait 5 years after condition is true to establish the stand.) Note: The Regeneration Establishment extension keyword sequence must begin with an ESTAB keyword and end with an END keyword; all keywords contained within this sequence are considered Regeneration Establishment keywords.

This keyword is used if the stand inventory did not include regeneration less than 3 inches dbh. No fields are associated with this keyword. Refere nce: GTR INT -279, User's Guide to the Regeneration Establishment Model..., p. 12  HABGROUP (HABitat type GROUP) Regeneration Establishment Extension Variants: All Requests that an optional output table that shows habitat types within the habitat type g roups shown in the regeneration summary output table be written to the standard FVS output file. No fields are associated with this keyword. Reference: GTR INT -279, User's Guide to the Regeneration Establishment Model..., p. 12  HTADJ  (regeneration Heig h T ADJustment) Regeneration Establishment Extension Variants: All Specifies a species -specific initial height adjustment for newly established trees before the tree records are passed to the base FVS model. field 1: Year or cycle the adjustment is to be applied. Once in effect it remains in effect until replaced by a subsequent multiplier. Default = 1 field 2: Species code for trees to be adjusted. Default = All field 3: Height in feet to be added to the seedling height assigned by the Regeneration Establishment extension. A negative value results in a reduction in height. Default = 0 Note: Note: The HTADJ keyword should not be confused with the FVS base model keyword REGHMULT, which is a multiplier. The value entered in field 3 can be positive o r negative, but resulting heights will not be shorter than a preset minimum (usually 0.5 or 1.0 feet), nor taller than the height of a tree 3 inches dbh.

Ingrowth will occur every 20 years after the completion of a regeneration period if there are no regeneration activities scheduled for the next cycle. Tree records that are created for ingrowth tallies can include trees up to 20 years old, so an assortment of tree sizes is added to the simulation. No fields are associated with this keyword. Note: This keyword is only used in FVS variants that have the capability for automatic prediction of natural regeneration (AK, CI, EM, KT, and NI).  Caution: The base model keyword NOAUTOES invokes the NOAUTALY, NOINGROW and NOSPROUT key words. Reference: GTR INT -279, User's Guide to the Regeneration Establishment Model..., p. 8  MECHPREP (MECHanical site PREParation) Regeneration Establishment Extension Variants: All Related keywords: BURNPREP Specifies the percentage of regeneration plots receiving site preparation by mechanical means. When site preparation treatments have not been specified or assigned with MECHPREP or BURNPREP keywords, default equations are invoked. These equations predict the proportion of the stand receiving each of the three treatments (burning, mechanical scarification, and no disturbance) based on site characteristics such as slope, aspect, habitat type, residual basal area, elevation, and topographic position. field 1: Year or cycle of site preparation. De fault = 0 (all cycles) field 2: Percentage of plots to be treated. Range: 0 -100, Default = 0 Note: Note: The sum of mechanical and burn treatments must be less than, or equal to, 100 percent. If the sum is less than 100 percent, the difference is the percentage of undisturbed plots. Site preparations can be assigned to individual plots if desired. See PLOTINFO keyword. GTR INT -279, User's Guide to the Regeneration Establishment Model..., p. 11  Reference:  MINPLOTS (MIN imum number of PLOTS ) Regenera tion Establishment Extension Variants: All Specifies the minimum number of plots to process. The regeneration model produces plot-to -plot variation in the number of trees per plot, species composition, and initial tree heights. Stand statistics are averages of plot predictions, so a large number of plots reduces the random variation for the stand. Plots are repeatedly doubled until the user-specified minimum number is reached.  89   field 1: Minimum number of plots to process. Minimum = 20, Default = 50 Reference: GTR INT -279, User's Guide to the Regeneration Establishment Model..., p. 13  NATURAL  (NATURAL regeneration) Regeneration Establishment Extension Variants: All Related keywords: PLANT Specifies natural regeneration that will be added to the stand. field 1: Year or cycle of regeneration. An entry is required, and must be equal to, or greater than, the disturbance date specified on the ESTAB keyword. field 2: Species code for trees to be naturally regenerated. Entry required field 3: Number of trees per acre of the species designated in field 2 to be regenerated. Default = 0 field 4: Percent survival expected for this species at the end of the current cycle. Range: 0 -100, Default = 100 field 5: Average seedling age in years for the year specified in field 1. Default = 2 field 6: Average seedling height in feet five years from the time of seedling appearance or at the end of the cycle, whichever is earlier. field 7: Shade code. Default = 0 0 Seedlings occur uniformly on plots thro ughout the stand. 1 Seedlings occur more frequently on plots with more overstory basal area. 2 Seedlings occur more frequently on plots with less overstory basal area. Note: Note: A separate NATURAL keyword is necessary for each species. Use of this keyword sets STOCKADJ to 0.0 and activates the NOINGROW and NOAUTALY keywords. GTR INT -279, User's Guide to the Regeneration Establishment Model..., p. 11  Reference:  NOAUTALY (NO AUTomatic seedling TALLY) Regeneration Establishment Extension Variants: AK, CI, EM, KT, NI Related keywords: AUTALLY, NOINGROW, NOSPROUT Suppresses the automatic scheduling of regeneration following thinnings (see AUTALLY). No fields are associated with this keyword. Note: This keyword is only used in FVS variants that have th e capability for automatic prediction of natural regeneration (AK, CI, EM, KT, and NI).  90   Note:  The base model keyword NOAUTOES invokes the NOAUTALY, NOINGROW and NOSPROUT keywords. GTR INT -279, User's Guide to the Regeneration Establishment Model..., p. 13  Reference:  NOINGROW (NO automatic INGROW th) Regeneration Establishment Extension Variants: AK, CI, EM, KT, NI Related keywords: INGROW, NOAUTALY, NOSPROUT Suppresses the automatic scheduling of ingrowth (see INGROW). No fields are associated with t his keyword. Note: Note: This keyword is only used in FVS variants that have the capability for automatic prediction of natural regeneration (AK, CI, EM, KT, and NI). The base model keyword NOAUTOES invokes the NOAUTALY, NOINGROW and NOSPROUT keywords. GTR INT -279, User's Guide to the Regeneration Establishment Model..., p. 13  Reference:  NOSPROUT (NO stump or root SPROUT ing) Regeneration Establishment Extension Variants: All Related keywords: SPROUT, NOINGROW, NOAUTALY Suppresses the automatic scheduling of root and stump sprouting following thinning (see SPROUT). No fields are associated with this keyword. Note: The base model keyword NOAUTOES invokes the NOAUTALY, NOINGROW and NOSPROUT keywords.  OUTPUT  (OUTPUT tables) Regeneration Establishme nt Extension Variants: All Specifies printing of regeneration summary tables. field 1: Summary table output flag. Default = 1 0 Suppress all output (tree records still passed to FVS model) 1 Print standard regeneration summary table 2 Print calculations as they occur (i.e. debug printout) 3 Print standard summary tables plus plot summary table field 2: File reference number for output. If this field is left blank output will be written to the FVS output file. If the value is any number other than 16 or blank, then an associated output file needs to be opened with OPEN keyword. Default = 16  91   Caution: The debug option produces a great deal of output that is not useful to most users. Reference: GTR INT -279, User's Guide to the Regeneration Establishme nt Model..., p. 12  PASSALL  (PASS ALL seedling records) Regeneration Establishment Extension Variants: All Requests the transfer of ""all"" predicted seedlings from the Regeneration Establishment model to the FVS tree list during the tally. ""All"" seedlings include ""desirable"", ""acceptable"", and ""excess"" seedlings. No fields are associated with this keyword. Reference: GTR INT -279, User's Guide to the Regeneration Establishment Model..., p. 4  PLANT  (PLANT seedlings) Regeneration Establishment Extension Variants: All Related keywords: NATURAL Specifies planting of seedlings that will be added to the stand. field 1: Year or cycle of regeneration. An entry is required, and must be equal to, or greater than, the disturbance date specified on the ESTAB keyword. field 2: Species code for trees to be naturally regenerated. Entry required field 3: Number of trees per acre of the species designated in field 2 to be planted. Default = 0 field 4: Percent survival expected for this species at the end of t he current cycle. Range: 0 -100, Default = 100 field 5: Average seedling age in years for the year specified in field 1. Default = 2 field 6: Average seedling height in feet five years from the time of planting or at the end of the cycle, whichever is earlier. field 7: Shade code. Default = 0 0 Seedlings occur uniformly on plots throughout the stand. 1 Seedlings occur more frequently on plots with more overstory basal area. 2 Seedlings occur more frequently on plots with less overstory basal area. Note: Note: A separate PLANT keyword is necessary for each species. Planted trees are in addition to natural regeneration and do compete with naturals in the best tree selection process.  92   Note:  The STOCKADJ keyword can be used in conjunction with planting to suppress natural regeneration so that only planted trees are passed to the FVS model. GTR INT -279, User's Guide to the Regeneration Establishment Model..., p. 11  Reference:  PLOTINFO (PLOT INFO rmation) Regeneration Establishment Extension Variants: A ll Related keywords: NATURAL Specifies plot specific values for slope, aspect, habitat type, topographic position, and site preparation. This keyword is used when plot information is not contained on the tree data records. A separate record is required for each plot (either as a supplemental record or as a record in the file designated in field 1 and opened with an OPEN keyword). field 1: File reference number for input. If this field is left blank supplemental data records are assumed to follow immediately after the PLOTINFO keyword in the keyword file. Supplemental record format: Columns 1 -10: Plot identification number coded the same as in the FVS model. A record with a negative number in these columns must be present to signify the end of PLOTINFO supplemental data records. Column 11: Column 12: Column 13- 15: Column 16: Column 17: Reference: Slope percent code. Aspect code. Numeric habitat type code. Topographic position code. Site preparation code.

If a (i.e. results the model simula tion  field 1: Replacement value for the pseudorandom number seed (should be an odd integer). Default = 55329 Note: The FVS base model and the Regeneration Establishment extension use separate pseudorandom number generators. Each one can be reseeded independently. Using a  93   RANNSEED keyword inside an ESTAB- END sequence affects the Regeneration Establishment extension. References: GTR INT -133, User's Guide to the Stand Prognosis Model, p. 94 GTR INT -208, Supplement to the User's Guide..., p. 14 GTR INT -279, User's Guide to the Regeneration Establishment Model..., p. 32 Refer to GTR INT- 394, Implications of Random Variation in the Stand Prognosis Model, for a discussion of the stochastic nature of the model.  RESETAGE (RESET stand AGE) Regeneration Establishment Extension Variants: All Sets the stand age to zero to make FVS model output correspond to the actual age of the stand. Age is strictly for reporting purposes and has no effect on growth or survival prediction. Its only effect is on the calculation of mean annual increment. This keyword is useful when average stand age has changed due to thinnings and plantings. field 1: Year or cycle that stand age is to be changed (usually the year of disturbance). field 2: New stand age. Default = 0 Note: This is also a base model keyword. Both have exactly the same effect.  SPECMULT (SPECies occurrence MULT iplier) Regeneration Establishment Extension Variants: AK, CI, EM, KT, NI Specifies a species -specific multiplier that increases or decre ases the probability of a species' occurrence in natural regeneration. The multiplier does not set the probability of a species' occurrence; it is multiplied by the default probability to increase or decrease the probability of occurrence. Thus, a multip lier of 1.0 has no effect on the default probability for that species. field 1: Year or cycle the multiplier takes effect. Default = 1 field 2: Species code to which the multiplier will be applied. Entry required field 3: Multiplier value. Range: 0.0 -1.0, Default = 1.0 Note: Note: A separate SPECMULT keyword record is needed for each species to be modified. This keyword is only used in FVS variants that have the capability for automatic prediction of natural regeneration (AK, CI, EM, KT, and NI). GTR INT -279, User's Guide to the Regeneration Establishment Model..., p. 13  Reference:  94   SPROUT  (stump or root SPROUT ing) Regeneration Establishment Extension Variants: All Related keywords: NOSPROUT, INGROW, AUTALY Requests the automatic scheduling of root and stump sprouting following thinning. Only those species that are prone to stump or root sprouting will have this type of regeneration scheduled. This keyword has no effect on species that do not sprout. No fields are associated with this keyword. Caution: The base model keyword NOAUTOES invokes the NOAUTALY, NOINGROW and NOSPROUT keywords.  STOCKADJ (STOCK ing ADJustment) Regeneration Establishment Extension Variants: AK, CI, EM, KT, NI Adjusts the probability of natural regeneration stocking upward or downward. The probability of stocking will be multiplied by the value entered in field 2, but the product will be bounded within the interval [0,1]. The multiplier is calculated by dividing the desired probability of stocking by the predicted probability of stocking. As an example, suppose the regeneration model predicts the probability of stocking 10 years after a harvest is 0.40 and it is desired to raise this figure to 0.50 in a subsequent run. The value to enter in field 2 is 1.25 (0.50/0.40 = 1.25). In other words, the desired probability is 1.25 times the predicted probability. field 1: Year or cycle the multiplier takes effect. Default = 1 field 2: Multiplier for the probability of stocking. Default = 1.0 (CI default = 0.0)  Note:  If field 2 is blank or 0 (zero) natural regeneration is cancelled so that only planted trees regenerate. This is useful in simulating growth of plantations or to input a list of trees on a habitat type that the Regeneration Establishment extension is not presently calibrated for. This keyword is only used in FVS variants that have the capability for automatic prediction of natural regeneration (AK, CI, EM, KT, and NI). GTR INT -279, User's Guide to the Regeneration Establishment M odel..., p. 15  Note:  Reference:  TALLY  (seedling TALLY) Regeneration Establishment Extension Variants: All Related keywords: TALLYONE, TALLYTWO, AUTALY Schedules a tally sequence for prediction of regeneration, and optionally supplies a disturbance year. Regeneration is reported in a summary called a tally. At each tally, new regeneration is added to the FVS Model tree list and a regeneration summary output table is printed. A tally will be predicted for every cycle boundary for 20 years following the beginning of the sequence. For example, if cycle lengths we re 5 years, four tallies would result.  95   field 1: Year or cycle the tally sequence is to begin. Entry required field 2: Optional field to supply the year of disturbance. This value takes precedence over the valu e in field 1 of the ESTAB keyword record. If blank, the year of disturbance is determined from field 1 of the ESTAB keyword record. Reference: GTR INT -279, User's Guide to the Regeneration Establishment Model..., p. 13  TALLYONE (seedling TALLY ONE) Regeneration Establishment Extension Variants: All Related keywords: TALLYTWO, TALLY, AUTALY Specifies the year in which the first regeneration tally is to occur, and optionally supplies a disturbance year. Regeneration is predicted at the end of the cycle , so the specified tally year should be one year prior to the end of the cycle. For example, if, in a simulation using 5-year cycles, a regeneration harvest is scheduled for 2010 and the first tally is desired 10 years later, the tally year specified in t he TALLYONE keyword should be 2019 (one year prior to the 2020 cycle boundary). The TALLYONE keyword takes precedence over the tally sequence scheduled by the ESTAB keyword or the TALLY keyword. field 1: Year the first regeneration tally is to be reported. Entry required field 2: Optional field to supply the year of disturbance. This value takes precedence over the value in field 1 of the ESTAB keyword record. If blank, the year of disturbance is determined from field 1 of the ESTAB keyword record. Note: At the first regeneration tally (TALLYONE), both planted trees and natural regeneration are passed to the FVS model. GTR INT -279, User's Guide to the Regeneration Establishment Model..., p.7,12  Reference:  TALLYTWO (seedling TALLY TWO) Regeneration Establishment Extension Variants: All Related keywords: TALLYONE, TALLY, AUTALY Specifies the year in which the second regeneration tally is to occur, and optionally supplies a disturbance year (see TALLYONE). If a TALLYTWO is scheduled without a TALLYO NE being scheduled, the TALLYTWO is changed to a TALLYONE. Regeneration is predicted at the end of the cycle, so the specified tally year should be one year prior to the end of the cycle. The TALLYTWO keyword takes precedence over the tally sequence scheduled by the ESTAB keyword or the TALLY keyword. field 1: Year the second regeneration tally is to be reported. Entry required field 2: Optional field to supply the year of disturbance. This value takes precedence over the value in field 1 of the ESTAB keyword record. If blank, the year of disturbance is determined from field 1 of the ESTAB keyword record. Reference: GTR INT -279, User's Guide to the Regeneration Establishment Model..., p.7,12  96   THRSHOLD (automatic regeneration THReSHOLD s) Regeneration Establishment Extension Variants: All Related keywords: AUTALY Changes the threshold values that schedule automatic regeneration tallies following thinnings. Values refer to the percentage of either trees per acre or total cubic foot volume removed in the thinnings. A single regeneration tally is scheduled if the percentage removed falls between the lower and upper percentages specified on this keyword. An entire tally sequence is scheduled if the percentage removed is greater than the upper percentage specified on this keyword. If this keyword is not used the lower percentage is 10 and the upper percentage is 30. field 1: Lower removal percentage. Range: 2.5 -95.0, Default = 10 field 2: Upper removal percentage. Range: 5.0 -97.5, Default = 30 No te: The value in field 1 must be lower than the value in field 2. GTR INT -279, User's Guide to the Regeneration Establishment Model..., p.8,13  Reference:  97"
GX270-24-7706860	"DEER-RESISTANT ORNAMENTAL PLANTS FOR LANDSCAPING IN WESTERN OREGON All animals have food preferences and dislikes. People living near deer habitat can use this trait to their advantage in selecting ornamental plants for landscaping. Selection of unpalatable or ""deer-resistant"" plants will generally eliminate or reduce the problem of browsing damage by deer. This approach is often preferable to construction of high deer fences, which are expensive and not very attractive, or the use of offensive noise and odor repellents. Only poisonous plants are completely deer-proof. Palatability of plants to deer depends on the quality and quantity of other available food. During periods of food shortage, plants normally not eaten by deer will be readily browsed. Palatability also varies with plant age, fertilizer rates, seasonal phenological changes and other factors.

GX261-10-9361493	NURSERY/LANDSCAPING Contest Overview The purpose of the Nursery/Landscaping Contest is to encourage students to gain knowledge of the production, marketing, utilization, and culture of landscape plants. Contest Objectives In preparing for the contest, the student should develop the following skills: 1. Identification of woody ornamental and turf plants commonly used in Missouri landscapes. 2. Ability to recognize the characteristics of a given plant which adds to or detracts from its quality or usefulness. 3. Understanding of the basic principles involved in correct use of plants in the landscape. 4. Ability to diagnose common problems encountered in the culture of landscape plants and to prescribe methods for preventing or correcting these problems. Contest Format and Scoring The contest will consist of four parts: 1. General Knowledge Examination 2. Practicum - Plant Disorder Diagnosis 3. Landscape Design Problem 4. Identification 1. General Knowledge Examination (200 points) This portion of the contest will test the contestant's knowledge and understanding of the production, marketing, utilization, and culture of landscape plants. It will consist of 50 multiple choice questions selected from the following: (1) Turf Grasses (2) Shrubs (3) Trees (4) Pests and Pesticides (5) Soils (6) Planting (7) Fertilizers (8) Pruning (9) Landscaping Nursery-Landscape (10-01-03) 1   2. Practicum - Plant Disorder Diagnosis (100 points) This portion of the contest will test the ability of the contestants to identify diseases, insects, weeds, and physiological disorders based on plant systems or on the pests themselves. Contestants will be required to make diagnoses on 20 specimens drawn from the supplemental information list (Form 67, p.119-96). Specimens may be live, preserved, photographs, or symptoms associated with disorders. 3. Landscape Design Problem (100 points) - 1 Hour This practicum is designed to evaluate participants' knowledge of and ability in (1) evaluating a landscape design; (2) reading a landscape drawing; (3) measuring and calculating materials needed to execute a landscape plan; and (4) evaluating factors that affect profitability of a landscape business. A landscape drawing and scratch paper will be provided to the participants. There will be 20 objective questions about the landscape plan, and each correct answer has a value of 5 points. The questions may include such areas as determining how accent was provided in the public area, the form and size specified for a certain plant, the cost of fencing, the number of patio pavers required, the area of sod to be installed, the volume of mulch required and the labor cost to install a ground-cover bed. 4. Identification (200 points) Each contestant will be required to identify 50 specimens from the Nursery/Landscaping Supplemental Information List (pp. 4, 5 and 6). A specimen may be twigs, foliage, flower, fruit, or an entire plant. Specimens will be identified by number. The contestant will need to match the specimen with the correct name on the answer sheet and write the number of the specimen in the blank next to the name. A plant may be represented by more than one specimen. A minimum of 30 seconds per identification sample will be allowed and a 10-minute review period will be allowed at the end. Contest Rules A team will consist of three or four members. The team score will be the total of the 3 highest individual scores for the respective team. References - Identification Catalogs from mail order seed and nursery companies are an excellent source of information. They can be obtained free of charge from most companies. Farm and garden magazines are full of addresses for these companies in the spring of the year.  Nursery-Landscape (10-01-03)  2   Trees of Missouri, Carl Settergren & R.E.

Unit Overview Presents goals and objectives for the unit. Before You Begin Consider how your current activities and experiences rela te to this topic. Content Presents specific material about this subject under several headings. Next? Think about how you can use the information in your daily responsibilities and in developing your career in forestry. For More Information Lists other sources of information about this subject, as well as the literature cited in the unit. Appendix Some units have an appendix that may include checklists or other information. In addition, each unit has two sections that will help you assess your learning of the information. Checking Your Understanding At the end of major sections in the unit, there are short- answer questions about the information you have read. After you have written the answers, you may compare your responses to the answers provided at the end of each unit. Case Study These are stories based on the real experiences. The questions at the end of the case study challenge you to use the information you learned to solve a problem similar to what you will be facing when working. You will be asked to analyze an actual urban forestry problem and prepare your solutions. There are no right or wrong answers -- only what you decide is the best course of action after considering all of the information.  http://www.urbanforestrysouth.org/pubs/ufmanual/dendro/index.html  11/09/2001   Dendrology  Page 5 of 46  Dendrology Table of Contents Overview Before You Begin What is Dendrology?

For More Information Checking Your Answers  http://www.urbanforestrysouth.org/pubs/ufmanual/dendro/index.html  11/09/2001   Dendrology  Page 6 of 46  Overview Many different aspects of urban forestry depend on your knowledge of dendrology. Some examples include tree health problems, species selection, hazard- tree identification, tree inventories, and urban wildlife habitat identification. Your knowledge of dendrology and skill in identifying trees can help you communicate this information and make recommendations to the community. This unit first defines dendrology and reviews types of trees in the south. The second section is about taxonomy of trees, which includes classification, naming trees, and tree identification. This information provides a foundation for the final section, which describes how the urban environment influences tree identification. Can You Tell the Difference? The ""Sweet"" Smell of Spring It happens every year at the same time. You would think after so many years that Bob would be prepared for this, but he swears that each spring ""it"" is worse than ever before. The ""it"" that Bob is referring to is the Gingko tree that is planted by the entrance to the maintenance yard for the public utility. Working in the local office of the State forestry agency, Bob gets a lot of the complaints, which is putting it nicely, about the SMELL! You see, someone, who could not tell the difference between a male and female Gingko tree, planted a female one. While the leaves are just as golden in the fall as the male gingko's leaves, the fruits of the female gingko have a horrible odor. Since the utility company does not want to cut it down, the most that Bob can do is offer his sympathy to the maintenance supervisor who is worried that he needs to post guards so that someone does not solve the problem with a chainsaw. The tree did make its point though. It is now in the city tree ordinance that only male gingko trees can be planted in the city. Trees Trees are funny Do you know why? They change their clothes The same as you or I They're green in summer Red in fall And when it turns cold They wear no clothes at all Molly Dwyer, age 7  http://www.urbanforestrysouth.org/pubs/ufmanual/dendro/index.html  11/09/2001   Dendrology  Page 7 of 46  Before You Begin This unit looks at many of the individual parts of a tree, such as the leaf, stem, flower, and fruit that give a tree its unique identity. These questions will help you think about how this information can be used in your job:   What are some instances when identifying a specific tree has been necessary?    How do you usually go about identifying the species of a tree you are not familiar with?    How does being able to name and identify trees help you in your job, particularly when you are working with a property owner or local group?  Think about the work you and others in your office do that involves tree identification, and what part this pla ys in your job.  http://www.urbanforestrysouth.org/pubs/ufmanual/dendro/index.html  11/09/2001   Dendrology  Page 8 of 46  What is Dendrology? Dendrology actually means ""the study of trees."" In common usage it has come to mean the taxonomy of woody plants (Harlow and others 1979), which is the systematic classification, naming, and identification of trees based on natural attributes and relationships. The study of dendrology also includes knowledge about characteristics of trees and their geographical range.  Dendrology in Urban Forestry  Learning how to identify trees takes time and experience, but once familiar with how to do it, it is a valuable skill for urban foresters. Some activities in which knowing about dendrology will be most useful are noted in table 1. Table 1.

A tree is a woody plant with several distinguishing characteristics: Often reaches 15 feet or more in height at maturity Has a single trunk or dominant multiple trunks Has no normal branches on the lower trunk Has at least a partially defined crown Usually larger than other plants and tend to be long- lived  The growth form or shape, rather than size, is the feature that distinguishes a tree from other plants such as shrubs (Harris 1992). A shrub is a woody plant with multiple stems that is capable of growing to a height of 15 feet. http://www.urbanforestrysouth.org/pubs/ufmanual/dendro/index.html 11/09/2001   Dendrology  Page 9 of 46  Trees Common to the South  There are two major classes of trees, Gymnosperms and Angiosperms, both of which are found in the South. The Gymnosperms are often called evergreens or softwoods. The Angiosperms include hardwoods, palms and yuccas. Softwoods Softwoods belong to a group of plants known as conifers. These trees have needles or scales for foliage and cones for reproduction. This separates them from the hardwood and palm trees. Most softwoods keep their foliage for two or more years. Examples of softwoods include pines, hemlocks, cedars, and cypresses. Hardwoods Most tree species found in the South are hardwoods. Usually, they lose their broadleaf foliage in the fall and develop new leaves in the spring. There are exceptions to this, with some hardwoods being classified as evergreens, particularly in tropical and sub- tropical climates. Examples of hardwoods include maple, oak, elm, pecan, and walnut trees. Palms and yuccas Palms and yuccas include fewer species than the softwoods and hardwoods. They are most prevalent in semi- tropical and tropical coastal areas, such as the lower peninsular of Florida and the Florida Keys. Three types of trees that grow in the South are softwoods, hardwoods, and palms.  http://www.urbanforestrysouth.org/pubs/ufmanual/dendro/index.html  11/09/2001   Dendrology  Page 10 of 46  Taxonomy of Trees Taxonomy is the categorizing or classifying of trees. There are three components of tree taxonomy:     Classification, which is the basis for the other two components. Naming trees Identifying trees  Classification of Trees Since ancient times, humans have attempted to classify plants. Today, there is no single method of classifying plants because of the complexity of relationships among plants. The U.S. and other countries prefer a system developed by German taxonomists Adolf Engler and Karl Pramtl. This plant classification system provides a systematic way to identify trees based on genetic relationships. It also facilitates the communication between people when they are discussing specific plants. Two principles of this system are important in understanding how plants are categorized:     The reproductive organs (flowers and fruit) are the basis of the classification system. Other important characteristics are leaves and wood anatomy. Trees can be classified as closely related when they have similar fruits even though they have different leaves and buds.. The characteristics of a tree in its natural habitat influence its classification.  Classification Definitions  Using the classification system requires knowing the terminology and definitions used in dendrology. The classifications in table 2 divide trees into increasingly smaller groups; each one is given a Latin name. This method of naming natural things is common in science. Knowing the family name helps to understand relationships among trees. The genus and species names are the most important ones to know because a tree's scientific name is made up of these two names, such as Magnolia grandiflora (southern magnolia). Table 3 shows an example of the classification structure for the loblolly pine, a gymnosperm, and the Southern red oak, an angiosperm. The definitions in table 4 are often used to describe trees found in urban areas.  http://www.urbanforestrysouth.org/pubs/ufmanual/dendro/index.html  11/09/2001   Dendrology  Page 11 of 46  Table 2. Definitions of classification taxonomy Classification Kingdom Division Definition All living things are classified into kingdoms (e.g. plants and animals). Trees are in the plant kingdom. This is the first category of the plant kingdom and is based on the plant's means of reproduction. Trees, in the Spermatophyte division, reproduce through seeds. Trees are then divided into two classes, Gymnosperms and Angiosperms, by the method they use to develop the seeds used for reproduction. Gymnosperms, such as conifers, produce an open seed on a structure such as a cone . Angiosperms are flowering trees that have seeds enclosed in an ovary. Trees are further classified into orders according to certain other characteristics of seed reproduction. Angiosperms are divided into two major groups, monocotyledons and dicotyledons, based in part on the number of primary leaves (one or two) present in the seed plant. The Sabal palmetto is an example of a monocotyledon. Most trees are dicotyledons, such as members of the walnut or oak families. A group of closely related trees, usually including one or more genera (plural of genus) make up a family. The rose family, Rosaceae, is a family in the dicot group, and includes cherry, apple, and pear trees. A collection of closely related species is a genus. The species usually are structurally similar or have common ancestry. Examples are the cherry and plum trees that are a genus, Prunus, of the rose family. A collection of individuals with characteristics so similar that they suggest common parentage, a species is a tree distinct and unlike others. The black cherry, Prunus serotina, is a species of the genus Prunus. Species is the basic, and probably most important (Dirr 1990) unit of taxonomy or classification of a tree.  Class  Order  Family  Genus  Species  A monotype exists when there is only one type of tree in the order, family, or genus. The Oriental ginkgo (Gingko biloba) is a monotype because the order has only one family, and the family has only one genus, and the genus has only one species.  http://www.urbanforestrysouth.org/pubs/ufmanual/dendro/index.html  11/09/2001   Dendrology  Page 12 of 46  Table 3.

Definitions related to tree species identification Term Hybrid Definition A tree produced by crossing two different species is considered a hybrid. Hybridization has been used to create new variations of a species for urban areas. An example is the Cornus.kousa x florida.celestial, a hybrid of the Kousa dogwood and the flowering dogwood that was developed for greater resistance to disease. Within a species, a tree that has distinctive but minor differences from other trees of the same species is a variety. These differences are inheritable and can be reproduced from seed (Dirr 1990). A variety that is significantly different from the standard species is often the beginning of a new species. Variations in the color of the leaves or flowers or a difference in the fruit will distinguish one variety of a tree from others in the species. Trees that have been cultivated to produce specific, distinguishing characteristics are cultivars. These specimens retain the features created in the development of the cultivar, but they usually can only be reproduced by grafting to maintain the characteristics. This method of reproduction distinguishes it from a variety, although the term cultivar and variety are often used interchangeably (Dirr 1990). A population of trees that develops asexually from a single tree is a clone. Sassafras and sweetgum are trees that reproduce as clones. Trees that are indigenous to a particular region or environment are considered to be native. This usually suggests that the species originated in the region and has a certain compatibility with it. A native tree, however, may not be compatible in urban locations in that region because of modifications to the habitat, including soil, water, and nutrient cycles. Trees that are not native to the area in which they grow are considered to be exotics. Exotics may be resistant to local insect and disease problems, but may also bring in unexpected and undesirable insect and diseases. They may also become invasive. Exotics become naturalized when they grow and reproduce in an area.  Variety  Cultivar  Clone Natives  Exotics  http://www.urbanforestrysouth.org/pubs/ufmanual/dendro/index.html  11/09/2001   Dendrology  Page 14 of 46  Naming Trees Naming trees with Latin names is the second component of tree taxonomy. Each species has a scientific Latin name that is used universally. However, every tree also has one or more common names by which it is known in various parts of its range.  Scientific Name  A system of standardized Latin names for plants was developed in the 18th century and is now used throughout the world as a universal system for naming trees. The complete scientific name for a tree consists of three parts:     Genus; for the loblolly pine it is Pinus Species; for the loblolly pine it is Pinus taeda The full or abbreviated name of the person or persons who originally described the species; the full name of the loblolly pine is Pinus taeda L (L. is the initial for Linnaeus, the Swedish botanist of the 18th century).  Common Name  The common names of trees often reflect their major characteristics, such as the red maple. Names, however, may originate from other sources, such as the location where the trees grow naturally. Examples are swamp white oak and river birch, trees that grow in low- lying or riparian areas with moist soils. Some of the sources of common tree names are:        Habitat - swamp white oak, river birch Distinctive feature - weeping willow, bigleaf maple Locality or region - southern red oak, southern magnolia Use - sugar maple, paper mulberry In commemoration - Douglas fir, Englemann spruce Adaptations from other languages - frijolito, hickory  Using common names of trees often leads to confusion when talking with other people. Two trees, like two humans, may share the same common name while actually being quite dissimilar. Trees may also have multiple names. For example, loblolly pine is known in various parts of its range by 25 other names, including juice pine and bull pine. The American Joint Committee on Horticultural Nomenclature has attempted to adopt one common name for each species (Harlow and others 1979). Refer to the ""For More Information"" section for a list of resources on scientific and common names of a trees.  http://www.urbanforestrysouth.org/pubs/ufmanual/dendro/index.html  11/09/2001   Dendrology  Page 15 of 46  Checking Your Understanding of the Classification and Naming of Trees On a separate sheet of paper, briefly answer the following questions: 1. Why is the classification of trees useful? What is the basic unit of classification that you need to be most familiar with when talking about trees? 2. What are the two major classes of trees? What distinguishing characteristic determines the class a tree belongs in, and why is it important? 3. How can the common names of trees help you select a tree for planting, and where can you find the common and scientific names for a particular tree? Answers are at the end of the unit.  http://www.urbanforestrysouth.org/pubs/ufmanual/dendro/index.html  11/09/2001   Dendrology  Page 16 of 46  Tree Identification The identification of trees is the third aspect of tree taxonomy or classification. Trees are classified into groups primarily by their fruits and flowers, but the leaves and twigs are usually more accessible for identification. Tree identification in urban locations requires knowing many trees because of the numerous exotics that have been introduced from around the country and the world. The most important features to look for in identifying a tree are:        leaves twigs and stems bark flowers fruit and seeds cones  Trees are identified by several different methods. Parts of a tree may be compared to illustrations in a manual, although this can be time consuming. A better way is to use keys specifically designed to aid in identifying trees. Keys Keys are tools that lead the user through the steps of identification based on the features of the tree. The key often focuses on the fruit or flower since this is the primary means for classifying trees. However, keys have also been developed for other fe atures such as leaves, stems, buds and bark. Using a key involves making choices at each step in the outline provided. It begins with general, easily observable features and works through to increasingly detailed traits. To do this successfully requires practice, experience, patience and familiarity with the scientific terminology used. A key is intended only to help in tree identification, and should not be the only means used in doing the job (Dirr 1990). Publications and other resources for identifying plants are listed in the ""For More Information"" section at the end of this unit.  Leaves  One way to identify a tree is by its leaves. Leaves have many distinguishing characteristics and these characteristics can be used for identification. Each of these features will be defined and illustrated in this unit:    Part Type 11/09/2001  http://www.urbanforestrysouth.org/pubs/ufmanual/dendro/index.html   Dendrology        Page 17 of 46  Shape Arrangement on the stem Venation Shape of apex and base Margin Surface  Leaf parts Knowing the parts of a leaf will help with tree identification (figure 1).      The lamina is the blade or broad part of the leaf. The leaf is attached to the twig with a supporting stalk called a petiole. It may be either short or long, grow in a variety of different shapes, and may not exist in some trees. Some petioles enclose next season's bud in the base. When the leaf is attached directly to the twig, rather than to the petiole, it is said to be sessile. Stipules are a pair of small, scaly or leaf- like organs that may be attached to the twig on either side of the petiole. Some stipules will leave scars that are visible on the twig in the winter. Plants that have stipules are called stipulate, while those without them are called estipulate. Figure 1. Parts of a simple leaf. (Illustration by Gene Wright)  Leaf types Determining the type of leaf can be the first step in tree identification. There are two different leaf types, hardwood and softwood.   Hardwoods can have either a simple or a compound leaf. A simple leaf has a single blade or lamina, as shown in figure 1. A compound leaf has two or more blades that are called leaflets. The stalk to which the blades are attached is called a rachis. The arrangement of the leaflets on the rachis determines the particular type of compound leaf. There are several types of compound leaves, which are described in figures 2,3,4, 5 and 6. 11/09/2001  http://www.urbanforestrysouth.org/pubs/ufmanual/dendro/index.html   Dendrology  Page 18 of 46  Figure 2.

A leaf with an odd number of leaflets on the rachis is called an odd pinnate leaf. A boxelder tree has odd pinnate leaves. (Illustration adopted from ""Manual of Woody Landscape Plants: Their Identification, Ornamental Characteristics, Culture, Propagation and Uses"" (Dirr 1990); Illustration drawn by Gene Wright)  Figure 4. A leaf with an even number of leaflets is called an even pinnate, such as the hornless common honeylocust.

A palmately compound leaf has each leaflet attached to a common point, such as the Virginia creeper. (Illustration adopted from ""Manual of Woody Landscape Plants: Their Identification, Ornamental Characteristics, Culture, Propagation and Uses"" (Dirr 1990); Illustration drawn by Gene Wright)    Softwoods, such as conifers, usually have different leaf types than hardwoods. Not all softwoods have evergreen foliage. The three types of softwood leaves are awl- like (figure7), scale- like (figure 8), and needle- like (figure 9).  Figure 7. Awl-like needles are elongated, taper to a fine point, and are usually sharp to the touch. Many Junipers have awllike shaped foliage.

Scale-like foliage overlaps like the shingles on a roof or the scales of a fish. This type of foliage often feels soft when touched. The eastern redcedar has this type of foliage.

Needle-like foliage, like that of the pine family, is found on several evergreen genera and species. Needles may be flat or angular in cross-section. The number of needles and the length of the needles may also help in identification. (Illustration adopted from ""Manual of Woody Landscape Plants: Their Identification, Ornamental Characteristics, Culture, Propagation and Uses"" (Dirr 1990); Illustration drawn by Gene Wright) Leaf shape The shape of the leaf is very useful in tree identification and is usually the same on all trees in a species. Determined by the outline of the blade of the leaf, there are several different shapes, some of which are shown in figure 10. Leaflets on a compound leaf may have two different shapes, depending whether they are located on the side or tip of the stalk.  http://www.urbanforestrysouth.org/pubs/ufmanual/dendro/index.html  11/09/2001   Dendrology  Page 21 of 46  Ovate  Lanceolate  Cordate  Spatulate  Ellipitcal  Obovate  Oblanceolate  Obcordate  Oblong  Reniform  Linear  Cuneate  Peltate  Hastate  Figure 10.

Hardwood leaves are arranged in one of three ways, opposite (figure 11), whorle d (figure 12) and alternate (figure 13).  http://www.urbanforestrysouth.org/pubs/ufmanual/dendro/index.html  11/09/2001   Dendrology  Page 22 of 46  Figure 11. Opposite leaf arrangement refers to leaves that are even with each other on opposite sides of the twig.

Alternate leaf arrangement occurs when one leaf is attached at each node, arranged in a spiral pattern around the twig. (Illustration adopted from ""Manual of Woody Landscape Plants: Their Identification, Ornamental Characteristics, Culture, Propagation and Uses"" (Dirr 1990); Illustration drawn by Gene Wright)  Leaf venation The venation, or the pattern of the veins, may help in identifying hardwood trees. The four primary venation patterns are pinnate (figure 14), palmate (figure 15), parallel (figure 16), and dichotomous (figure 17).  http://www.urbanforestrysouth.org/pubs/ufmanual/dendro/index.html  11/09/2001   Dendrology  Page 23 of 46  Figure 14. Pinnate venation has a prominent central vein that extends from the base, where the petiole attaches to the blade, to the apex or tip of the leaf. The overall effect is that of a fishbone. (Illustration adopted from ""Manual of Woody Landscape Plants: Their Identification, Ornamental Characteristics, Culture, Propagation and Uses"" (Dirr 1990); Illustration drawn by Gene Wright)  Figure 15. Palmate venation is when three or more veins branch from the base of a leaf.

The part of the blade nearest to the petiole is called the base. Examples of common shapes for apices and bases are shown in figures 18 and 19.

(Illustration adopted from ""Manual of Woody Landscape Plants: Their Identification, Ornamental Characteristics, Culture, Propagation and Uses"" (Dirr 1990); Illustration drawn by Gene Wright) Leaf margin The edge of the leaf is called the margin. The margin is distinctive and may serve to assist in separating closely related forms. Examples of leaf margins are shown in figure 20.  http://www.urbanforestrysouth.org/pubs/ufmanual/dendro/index.html  11/09/2001   Dendrology  Page 25 of 46  Entire  Serrate  Serrulate  Doubly- serrate  Dentate  Crenate  Incised  Sinuate  Figure 20. Examples of different types of leaf margins. (Illustrations adopted from ""Manual of Woody Landscape Plants: Their Identification, Ornamental Characteristics, Culture, Propagation and Uses"" (Dirr 1990); Illustration drawn by Gene Wright) Leaf surface The surface and texture of the leaf are other means of identification. The hair, resin glands, waxes, blooms, and scales provide valuable clues in naming a tree. The texture of the leaf may feel like leather or like paper.  Twigs and Stem  Twigs are useful in identifying trees except for a short period during the spring when the buds are opening and shoots are elongating on these small branches. Several features of twigs, including buds, leaf scars, lenticels, pith, spurs, thorns, spines, and prickles, can help describe them (table 5 and figure 21). Other factors to consider are color, taste, and odor. The color of the bark can be an most important feature on young stems.  http://www.urbanforestrysouth.org/pubs/ufmanual/dendro/index.html  11/09/2001   Dendrology  Page 26 of 46  Table 5. Twig characteristics that help with identification Characteristic Buds Description     Leaf scars      Pith      Spurs        Are one location of growth tissue in a tree. Are usually visible on the twig. May be either lateral, on the side of the twig, or terminal, at the tip of the twig. Are scaly or naked, smooth or fuzzy. Are where a leaf falls from the twig. Vary in size and shape. Have one or more minute dots or patches that show where the ruptured strands of vascular tissue passed from twig to leaf. Are small, normally lens- shaped patches on the stem that facilitate gas exchange. May be wart- like. Is the central portion of the twig. Is usually lighter or darker than the wood that surrounds it. Varies in color. Is star- shaped or pentagonal in oaks, triangular in alders, terete or cylindrical- like in ash and elms, and chambered in walnuts. Varies in composition; in most cases is solid, spongy, or hollow. Are dwarfed twigs with some internodal development. May grow for several years. Produce the fruit on many apple varieties Pointed structures that project from the sides of a twig; are important features in some species. Thorns are modified twigs. Spines are modified stipules. Prickles develop from surface tissue and are easily removed.

Characteristic parts of a twig that help in the identification process. (Illustration adopted from ""Manual of Woody Landscape Plants: Their Ident ification, Ornamental Characteristics, Culture, Propagation and Uses"" (Dirr 1990); Illustration drawn by Gene Wright)  Bark  Bark is one of the most important features for tree identification because of its year- round accessibility. It is especially useful when the tree's leaves and twigs are inaccessible or unavailable during the fall and winter. The shape of the bark is characteristic of some species, for example, the small, rectangular plates on flowering dogwood. Bark on young trees differs from that on more mature trees. Experience is the best way to learn bark characteristics. Table 6 describes bark characteristics that can be used for identifying mature trees. Typical bark textures are illustrated in figure 22. Table 6. Bark characteristics that help with identification Characteristic Shape or general appearance Texture Thickness Color Description The shape of the bark is often characteristic of some species, for example, the small- rectangular plates on the flowering dogwood. The feel of the bark, such as the smoothness of cherry trees or the layering or plating of white oaks, is important. The thickness of the bark can vary within a species as well as between species. Bark color varies with age, location, site, and light conditions.  http://www.urbanforestrysouth.org/pubs/ufmanual/dendro/index.html  11/09/2001   Dendrology  Page 28 of 46  Smooth  Furrowed  Scaly  Warty  Shaggy  Figure 22. The differences in bark can be helpful in tree identification. (Illustrations by Gene Wright)  Flowers  Flowers are best feature for identifying trees, but are available only for a short period each year. Leaves, twigs, and bark are usually available for identification, but if there is doubt about a certain tree, the flower is the surest way to identify it. Although not always noticeable to the casual observer, all hardwoods bear flowers. Some produce flowers annually, while others flower less often. Flowers are modified leaves that have undergone change to the point that they have become or support the reproductive organs of the plants. Complete and incomplete flowers A complete flower has four parts (figure 23). An incomplete flower is one that lacks any of these four parts.      Calyx (composed of sepals) Corolla (composed of petals) Stamens Pistils  http://www.urbanforestrysouth.org/pubs/ufmanual/dendro/index.html  11/09/2001   Dendrology  Page 29 of 46  Figure 23. A complete flower has all four parts. (Illustration adopted from ""Manual of Woody Landscape Plants: Their Identification, Ornamental Characteristics, Culture, Propagation and Uses"" (Dirr 1990); Illustration drawn by Gene Wright)  Perfect and imperfect flowers A perfect flower includes actively functioning organs of both sexes but may lack sepals or petals. The stamen is the male reproductive structure, and the pistil is the female reproductive structure. A perfect flower may be either complete or incomplete. A flower lacking either functional stamens or pistils is imperfect. These flowers may also be known as unisexual flowers, meaning they are either pistilate (female) or staminate (male). These may occur on the same tree, or the male and female parts may be on separate trees, as in the gingko. Arrangement of flower blooms Flowers bloom in different arrangements (figure 24).    Individual or single bloom flowers are typical of many woody plants, for example the magnolia. A cluster or an inflorescence is a collection of individual flowers arranged in a specific pattern (Dirr 1990). One that blooms at the end of a central stalk, or rachis, is referred to as a determinate flower. The dogwood tree has a determinate flower. If the flowers open progressively from the base to the apex or from the outside to the center in flat- topped clusters, the flower is indeterminate. The flowering crabapple has an indeterminate flower.  A flower at the end of a twig is a terminal flower. An inflorescence that appears in a leaf axil, or bud, is described as axillary. Flowers may also appear from separate flower buds, which are normally located near the tips of the twigs.  http://www.urbanforestrysouth.org/pubs/ufmanual/dendro/index.html  11/09/2001   Dendrology  Page 30 of 46  Determinate  Indeterminate  Figure 24. The characteristic inflorescence of a flower is helpful in identification. (Illustrations adopted from ""Manual of Woody Landscape Plants: Their Identification, Ornamental Characteristics, Culture, Propagation and Uses"" (Dirr 1990); Illustration drawn by Gene Wright)  Fruits and Seed  Another key to identifying a hardwood is its fruit or seed. A fruit is the seed- bearing organ of the plant. Using fruit is somewhat limited, however, because some trees do not bear fruit and others do so only for a short time or at irregular intervals. Fruits develop from flowers. Solitary flowers that have a single pistil produce a single fruit. A cluster of flowers with multiple pistils produces a cluster of fruit or a compound fruit. Some fruits have only one seed, others develop many seeds. In most species, pollination and fertilization must occur for fruit to develop. Fruit development can take from a week or two in elms to two growing seasons in red oaks. Examples of different types of fruit are shown in figure 25.  http://www.urbanforestrysouth.org/pubs/ufmanual/dendro/index.html  11/09/2001   Dendrology  Page 31 of 46  Pome (Apple)  Berry (Persimmon)  Drupe (Cherry)  Nut - Dehiscent Husk (Hickory)  Nut - Indehiscent (Oak Acorn)  Double Samara (Maple)  Capsule (Paulownia)  Legume (Black Locust)  Multiple Head of Nutlets (Sweet Gum)  Figure 25. The type of fruit a tree produces can be used in identification. (Illustrations adopted from ""Manual of Woody Landscape Plants: Their Identification, Ornamental Characteristics, Culture, Propagation and Uses"" (Dirr 1990); Illustration drawn by Gene Wright) Seed production and germination depend on many factors, such as temperature extremes, conditions of the tree, and presence or absence of competition. Seed quality, including germination capacity, can vary greatly and is influenced by factors such as the tree's nutrient storage, availability of water, and temperatures and weather conditions. Conifers do not bear fruit, they bear cones.  http://www.urbanforestrysouth.org/pubs/ufmanual/dendro/index.html  11/09/2001   Dendrology  Page 32 of 46  Simple fruits Simple fruits develop in various forms. There are two basic types, dry and fleshy, each of which has a wide range of variations.     The two primary forms of dry fruit are indehiscent, which do not split open at maturity, and dehiscent, which do split open when ripe. Indehiscent fruits are usually one- seeded with the seed enclosed in various types of coverings. Species with this type of fruit include maples and oaks. Dehiscent fruits are usually manyseeded and are enclosed in a covering that splits when the fruit is ripe, such as the redbud, magnolia, and rhododendron. Fleshy fruits are usually multi- seeded, the seeds are surrounded by a fleshy pulp, or pericarp, which is sometimes edible. These may be classified as a berry (blueberry and persimmon), drupe (cherry, plum, and holly), or pome (apple or pear).  Compound fruits Fruits that develop from multiple pistils are called compound. Two types of compound fruit are aggregrate and multiple.    Aggregate fruits develop from a single flower that has many pistils (Dirr 1990) that form many fruitlets in a single mass, such as the magnolia or tulip tree. When several flowers together contribute to the development of a single fruit, it is called a multiple fruit (Dirr 1990). The fig tree and the mulberry produce examples of this type of fruit.  Cones  Seeds for softwoods (conifers) are found in cones. Most conifers are monecious. Monecious means that both male and female reproductive parts are located in separate structures on the same tree. A few conifers are dioecious; the male and female reproductive parts are on separate trees. Male and female structures are called cones or stobili (figure 26). Cones consist of an egg or pollen- bearing scales attached to the central stem. The scales may be arranged spirally or they may appear in pairs. Characteristics of three different types of cones are described in table 7. Figure 26. Seeds are produced on cones in conifers. (Illustration by Gene Wright)  Table 7. Types of cones http://www.urbanforestrysouth.org/pubs/ufmanual/dendro/index.html 11/09/2001   Dendrology  Page 33 of 46  Type of Cone Description Pollen cones  Are generally small, non- woody and short lasting.  Emerge from buds, release pollen, wither and drop within a few weeks.  Bear sacs on the bottom of each scale known as pollen sacs or microsporangia.  Release thousands of pollen grains when the sacs burst.  Are modifications of shoots, and the scales are modified leaves.  Are found in the mid- to lower crown. Female cones         Are larger than male cones. Are usually woody. May persist for many years. Develop to maturity in one or more season and release their seeds in late summer to autumn. Bear two megasporangia on the top of each scale which contains an ovule. This ovule develops into a seed following pollination and develops an embryo. Are found in the upper crown of a tree in some species. These cones are closed tightly with pine tar. Heat from a fire is needed to open the cone. The sand pine and pitch pine have this type of cone.  Seritinous cones    Tree Form or Shape  Tree form and shape can be useful features for identification. There are two primary tree forms, excurrent and decurrent. Trees that are excurrent, such as conifers, have a dominant trunk with smaller side branches. This form gives the tree a conical or triangular shape. Trees that are decurrent, such as oaks, have spreading branches that give the crown a full, round appearance. A tree may grow differently in various parts of its range so its appearance may vary. A tree that grows large in one part of its range may be shrub- like at the extreme limit of its range. Remember to take into account the habitat and range of a tree, as well as its physical characteristics, when making an identification.  http://www.urbanforestrysouth.org/pubs/ufmanual/dendro/index.html  11/09/2001   Dendrology  Page 34 of 46  How the Urban Environment Influences Tree Identification Tree identification in urban areas can be complicated. There are usually a large number of species in urban areas, including native and exotic trees. And various conditions associated with the urban environment may alter specific characteristics of a tree, such as changing the appearance of the leaves or bark that help in tree identification. Examples of site factors that may alter a tree's appearance include compacted soils, excessive soil moisture, and extreme temperatures. The capacity of a tree to adapt to new conditions is a measure of its tolerance.  Size, Form, and Shape  In an urban environment, trees are often growing in very different conditions than those species growing in a rural or forested area. Trees in urban locations are often smaller and shaped differently than those in forests for several reasons. Individual specimens In urban locations, a tree is often planted as an individual specimen. This exposes it to more light and wind, and usually higher temperatures. Urban trees also will commonly have larger crowns and thicker and shorter trunks than the same species growing in a forest. Range may change It is important to remember that a tree's range may change as the environment is altered. One factor that may change the range is the loss of trees when an area is urbanized. Fewer trees may change the temperature and the flow patterns of wind and water. Another factor that alters the range of a species is its introduction to new areas. When a plant foreign to a region becomes established and reproduces, it is said to be ""naturalized."" These two situations may greatly extend the range of a tree or reduce it to the point of extinction. Planting a tree out of its natural range can also influence its form and shape. For example, planting river birches far from the river may change their appearance. Soil conditions Soil conditions, such as limited soil volume, compaction, drainage, poor aeration, and limited nutrients can influence sprouting and twig elongation may be shortened. Pruning Pruning can change the natural shape of a tree.  http://www.urbanforestrysouth.org/pubs/ufmanual/dendro/index.html  11/09/2001   Dendrology  Page 35 of 46  Changing the natural shape of a tree can make it more challenging to identify.  Leaves    The soil conditions at the site can also influence leaf size and color. Leaves may be stunted in size. Color may be altered.  Bark    The bark of a tree can also be influenced by the urban environment. In heavily shaded areas lichen may grow on the bark, changing the color. If the bark has been damaged by insects, rodents, or othe r pests identification in the winter may be difficult.  Flowers    Urban locations may affect the natural cycle of a tree's growth. Variations in light and temperature patterns may change the time of year that a tree produces new foliage, flowers, or fruits Soil fertility also influences the time that a tree flowers and the number of flowers produced.  http://www.urbanforestrysouth.org/pubs/ufmanual/dendro/index.html  11/09/2001   Dendrology  Page 36 of 46  Checking Your Understanding of Tree Identification On a separate sheet of paper, briefly answer the following questions: 1.

It was wintertime, and cold and wet. The fact that the tree Tom had been asked to look at was in a bottomland made it seem even colder and wetter. Working in the local office of the State forestry agency, he had been asked by a construction company to make some recommendations about a large tree that was on their construction site. They wanted to save the tree if possible and needed to know what steps to take. The tree was more than 45 feet tall, but Tom was surprised that it had survived this long. From the shape of the tree and its bark, he identified it as a white oak. He wanted to help the construction company save the tree, but this was going to take a lot of work. In addition to the impact of the construction work in the area, the soil in which the tree was growing was moist, compacted, and poorly drained. Tom's recommendations were extensive. A white oak needs moist, but well- drained soil. To maintain the health of this tree after the construction was over, he outlined a series of steps to improve the soil and the drainage at the site. This included aerating and amending the soil and, most importantly, creating a system to keep the soil well drained. In the meantime, he suggested fencing around the tree to protect it from equipment damage during the building. By spring the construction would be finished, and they would be able to implement the maintenance program Tom had suggested.  You and the Oak Tree  If you are called by the construction company, how would you identify the tree, and what recommendations might you make? On a separate sheet of paper, write what you would have done in this case, using these challenge questions as a guideline.       How would you go about identifying the tree? What specific tree characteristics would you consider in making the identification? What physical site factors would influence your decision? Why is proper identification important? How would your recommendations relate to your identification?  The outcome of the real story follows this case study. After you have written the steps you would follow, compare your story with what really happened.  http://www.urbanforestrysouth.org/pubs/ufmanual/dendro/index.html  11/09/2001   Dendrology  Page 38 of 46  The Rest of the Story The Switch Two months later Tom was back at the site, going over plans for the drainage system. He wanted to make sure that water runoff from the site would drain away from the tree so that the soil amendments and aeration would continue to benefit the tree. There was just a hint of spring in the air, and Tom noticed that the tree was in bud, with just the first few leaves of spring beginning to grow. And wasn't he surprised! What he had identified as a white oak based on the bark characteristics was actually a swamp oak, growing exactly where is should be, in poorly drained bottomland. Somewhat sheepishly, he went to the construction managers to say that the concerns about keeping the soil drained were not necessary. The proper care of the tree would be much easier, since the tree was growing where it should. In this case, proper identification of the tree not only saved extra maintenance costs, but also probably saved the life of the tree.  A Tree by Any Other Name      Were the characteristics that you used in identifying the tree different from Tom's? If so, what were they? What biological or environmental factors did you consider when making the identification? How might your identification affect things like the time and cost for the care and maintenance of the tree? What have you learned from Tom's story that can help with your work in urban forestry?  http://www.urbanforestrysouth.org/pubs/ufmanual/dendro/index.html  11/09/2001   Dendrology  Page 39 of 46  Next?

Why is the classification of trees useful? What is the basic unit of classification that you need to be most familiar with when talking about trees? The classification of trees has three useful purposes:      Assists in the identification of trees. This provides a common language for talking about trees. Helps determine specific characteristics of a tree that are important in selecting a tree for a specific location, in diagnosing and controlling insects and disease, planning proper care and maintenance, and in dealing with hazard- tree problems. Provides an understanding of the inherited relationships among the species of trees.  The basic unit of classification for a tree is the species. This is the level of classification that puts all the trees with the same, distinguishing characteristics together. The scientific name of a tree made up of the genus and species name. 2. What are the two major classes of trees? What distinguishing characteristic determines the class a tree belongs in, and why is it important? Trees are divided into two major classes based on the way that they develop the seeds used for reproduction. For this reason, the flower or cone that produces the seed and the seed itself are important in the identification of trees.     Gymnosperms or softwoods - This class of tree produces an open seed on a cone or other similar structure. Most trees in this class are conifers, many of which belong to the pine family. Other trees in this class are cypresses, cedars, redwoods, yews, and gingkoes. Angiosperms or hardwoods - These are flowering trees that produce their seed in an enclosed ovary. They are often described as hardwoods. With many thousands of species, they live in a variety of climates with a great variation in size and form.  3. How can the common names of trees help you select a tree for planting, and where can you find the common and scientific names for a particular tree? The common names of trees often reflect a primary feature of their growth habits, the region where they are commonly found, or the type of land in which they prefer to grow. Attention to these characteristics helps in selecting the proper tree for a specific location.  http://www.urbanforestrysouth.org/pubs/ufmanual/dendro/index.html  11/09/2001   Dendrology  Page 45 of 46  The same species of tree may have many different common names, with different ones used in different areas, but there is only one scientific name for each species. The publication Standardized Plant Names gives you both the scientific name and all the common names for each species.  Checking Your Answers for Tree Identification 1. What parts of a tree can be used for identification? Are there seasonal limitations for the use of each of them? What part of the tree is most commonly used for identification purposes? What part of the tree provides the surest means of identification? The five main parts of a tree that can help in identifying are:          Leaves are the most commonly used means for identifying a tree because they are available most of the time, and are often the most prominent and distinctive part of the tree. In evergreen trees, leaves are present year- round. In deciduous trees leaves are only available during spring, summer, and early fall. Twigs and stems can be used for identification except during the spring when bud growth and shoot elongation are taking place. Bark is one of the most useful identifiers because it is available when many of the other parts are not. Because there tends to be less lichen or moss growing on it in urban area, it can be very helpful for tree identification in cities. Flowers appear for only a short time, and therefore are limited in their usefulness for identification. However, because the classification system of trees is based on how trees produce seeds, flowers are the best feature for id entifying a tree. The fruit and seed can also help in identifying a tree because they are important to the way trees are classified. However, they can appear at irregular intervals and are available for only a short time.  2. What are seven major characteri stics of leaves that can be used in identifying trees? Briefly describe each.        Types - The two different types of leaves are hardwood and softwood. Hardwoods can have either a simple or compound leaf. Softwoods can have a needle - like, scale- like, or awl- like type of foliage. Shape - The shape, or outline, of the leaf is usually typical of the species. Leaf arrangement - Leaves in hardwoods can be arranged in opposite, whorled, or alternate patterns. Venation of the leaf - The pattern of veins in hardwood leaves have four primary patterns: pinnate, palmate, parallel, and dichotomous. Leaf apex and base - The leaf apex is the tip of the leaf blade, and the base is the part nearest the petiole, or supporting stalk. Both have shapes common to a species. 11/09/2001  http://www.urbanforestrysouth.org/pubs/ufmanual/dendro/index.html   Dendrology    Page 46 of 46  Leaf margin - The edge of the leaf is distinctive, and can be used to distinguish between similar looking leaves. Surface of leaf - The texture, or the way that a leaf feels, can help in identification.  3. How can the urban environment affect your efforts to identify a tree? There are a number of conditions in the urban environment that may change the appearance of a tree. These may include:        Soil conditions Light patterns Temperature patterns Moisture or water conditions Physical damage Pruning  Light and temperature conditions can change the time of year that a tree produces new leaves, flowers, and fruits. Site location may affect the form of the tree. Soil and moisture conditions may alter root growth, influencing tree growth and vigor. All these factors may change the appearance of the different parts of a tree used for identification, such as the leaves, twigs, and bark.  http://www.urbanforestrysouth.org/pubs/ufmanual/dendro/index.html  11/09/2001"
