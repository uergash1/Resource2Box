Pening de Vries, S.J. Scherr, and S. Sompatpanit (eds.). Responses to Land Degradation. Proc. 2nd. International Conference on Land Degradation and Desertification, Khon Kaen, Thailand. Oxford Press, New Delhi, India.    A land quality and population-carrying capacity based assessment of food security for six management and population scenarios is presented for 24 Asian countries. Two databases were used: the 1:5,000,000  FAO/Unesco Soil Map of the World,  converted to  Soil Taxonomy , and climatic records for about 4,000 stations in Asia. This information and 25 stress factors derived from it were used to group the units of the soil map in one of nine land quality classes. The land area of each class was partitioned for different agricultural and non-agricultural uses. Each land quality class was empirically assigned an optimal population-carrying capacity (persons ha -1) for each of three levels of management inputs. The ratio of (i) the 1995 population and (ii) the 2025 population to the optimal population-carrying capacity was used to group the countries in three risk categories for the three management input levels and two population levels, resulting in six scenarios of food security for each country. Although the assessments inevitably lack precision, they are nevertheless considered an improvement over previous and more intuitive estimates. The analysis shows that, for Asia as a whole, food insecurity is an acute problem. In fact, for some countries the Malthusian prophecy is rapidly becoming a reality. The study also quantified the relative scarcity of prime agricultural land in Asia and the resulting imperative to preserve these areas for food production and optimise the land use of the remaining areas.    The notion of food security is not new. Marie-Jean-Antoine-Nicolas Caritat, Marquis de Condorcet, a French philosopher known for his worship of reason noted that France was finite, but the potential number of French infinite. When hunger threatens, he wrote, ""new instruments, machines and looms"" will continue to appear, and ""a very small amount of ground will be able to produce a great quantity of supplies"" (Mann, 1993). Thomas Robert Malthus created wide awareness of the problem of food security in his Essay on Population (Malthus, 1798). He proclaimed that ""the power of population is indefinitely greater than the power in the earth to produce subsistence for man"". Immediately from the publication of the essay to this day, Malthus became the subject of controversy (Mann, 1993; Greenland  et al. , 1998).    The concepts of Malthus and Condorcet dominate the two extremes of the debate that endures today. The pessimists, who tend to be biologists and ecologists, have argued for two centuries that an ever-growing population will inevitably bring the apocalypse with poverty, hunger, despair, and social unrest. The optimists, who tend to be economists, argue that human ingenuity and markets will cope with the problem. They base their view on the fact that none of the anticipated catastrophes have so far materialized.    One reason for the divergence of opinion is the scarcity of empirical data that would allow more unequivocal conclusions. By necessity, arguments on both sides of the issue are currently intuitive and speculative rather than based on scientific fact. In an attempt to inject some science into the debate, we provide estimates of population-carrying capacity for Asia that are based on reliable soil and climate data.    Definitions      Land quality   is a measure of the land to perform specific functions. In the context of this study, the function is to sustain grain production and respond to cultural practices conducive to sustainable land management. The principal determinants of land quality are soil performance and resilience.    Food security   has been defined by Swaminathan (1986) as ""providing physical and economic access to balanced diets and safe drinking water to all people at all times"". He subsequently stated that ""a dynamic concept of carrying capacity would imply, in operational terms, the conservation of natural ecosystems as well as their continuous improvement through research, training, technology, community cooperation, and public policies"" (Swaminathan, 1991).    Population-carrying capacity   is the perceived ecological ceiling beyond which a habitat cannot support any given species indefinitely. When the maximum sustainable population level is surpassed, the resource base begins to decline (Postel, 1994).       Scope of the Study    The three basic driving sources conducive to the world’s natural resource depletion, and thus implicitly food security, are (i) continuing population growth, (ii) increasing global economic output, and (iii) the widening gap in the distribution of income (Postel, 1994). Consequently, food security is an exceedingly complex and multi-faceted issue. Among the factors that combine to interact to control the problem are,  inter alia , natural disasters, war, inadequate policies, poverty, insufficient research and development, lack of infrastructure, trade, land degradation, endowment of natural resources, population growth, and cultural idiosyncrasies. Any of these factors can cause food insecurity as has been discussed in many publications, including those by Anderson (1991), Brown (1997), Postel (1994), and Swaminathan (1994).    We recognize the importance of the factors, but it would be obviously beyond the scope of this paper to discuss them in any detail. We therefore base our analysis on factual soil and climate information and the best available population estimates. Although we consider land degradation to be a major cause of declining agricultural productivity, we felt obliged to ignore it in our study as there is no reliable information available regarding the pace, scale, and geography of land degradation in Asia other than the rather qualitative study by ISRIC (Oldeman  et al.,  1991). Similarly, we realize that in some areas of the region, for example, northern China and southern India, scarcity of water may be more of a constraint to grain production than land. Again, we excluded this aspect from our study on account of lack of adequate data. Also, we did not consider the possible consequences on food production caused by global climate change.     Methodology    Two databases provided the biophysical basis for our assessment: First, the  FAO/Unesco Soil Map of the World  at a scale of 1:5,000,000, which is digitally available (FAO, 1991), the units of which were converted to taxa of  Soil Taxonomy  (Soil Survey Staff, 1998) on the basis of commonality of the criteria that define the taxa in the two systems. Second, a climate database with records for about 4,000 stations in Asia, which allowed to compute the soil moisture and temperature regimes. The pedoclimate map was then superimposed on the soil map. The soil and pedoclimate information was used to place each map unit into one of nine land quality classes with Class I having the most favourable and Class IX the least desirable attributes for grain production. The theoretical matrix for the nine classes, which is based on soil performance and soil resilience, is shown in Table 1. The concepts and characteristics that circumscribe the land quality classes are summarized in Table 2. To facilitate placement into these classes, a list of 25 land stresses that constrain grain production was developed. Table 3 lists these stresses in priority order.       Table 1.

Properties of land quality classes.         Land quality class    Properties             I    This is prime land. Soils are highly productive, with few management-related constraints. Soil temperature and moisture conditions are ideal for annual crops. Risk for sustainable grain crop production is generally <20%.        II, III    The soils are good and have few problems for sustainable production. The lower resilience characteristics of Class II soils make them more risky, particularly for low-input grain crop production. However, their productivity is generally very high and consequently, response to management is high. Conservation tillage is essential. Risk for sustainable grain crop production is generally 20–40%.        IV, V, VI    If there is a choice, these soils must not be used for grain crop production, particularly soils belonging to Class IV. All three classes require important inputs of conservation management. Lack of plant nutrients is a major constraint and so a good fertilizer-use plan must be adopted. Productivity is not high and so low-input farmers must receive considerable support to manage these soils or be discouraged from using them. Land can be set aside for national parks or as biodiversity zones. Risk for sustainable grain crop production is 40–60%.        VII    These soils may only be used for grain crop production if there is a real pressure on land. They are definitely not suitable for low-input grain crop production; their low resilience makes them easily prone to degradation. As in Classes V and VI, biodiversity management is crucial in these areas. Risk for sustainable grain crop production is 60–80%.        VIII, IX    These soils belong to very fragile ecosystems or are very uneconomical to use for grain crop production. They should be retained under their natural state. In Class VIII, which is largely confined to the tundra and boreal areas, timber harvesting must be done very carefully with considerable attention to ecosystem damage. Risk for sustainable grain crop production is >80%.               Table 3.  Description of major land resource stresses or conditions.

Multiple stresses were not considered although it is recognized that these may be the rule rather than the exception.    A country boundary overlay enabled a GIS computation of the area of the recognized land quality classes for each country. The error of such computation is estimated to be about 50 km2. Population and arable land area data for 1995 and projections for 2025 were taken from FAO statistics. We then partitioned the land area in each land quality class for various land uses as shown in Table 4. These were the land areas subsequently used in the assessments.        Table 4.

We used the ratio of the number of people that can ideally be supported, as computed on the basis of land areas for each land quality class (Table 6) and the assumption shown in Tables 4 and 5, to the 1995 population and the estimated population in 2025 as indices of risk. The thresholds for levels of vulnerability were placed at the following ratios: low risk, <0.8; medium risk, 0.8–2.0; and high risk, >2.0.     Results    Land quality    The respective areas of the nine land quality classes described in Table 2 are listed in Table 6 for each country. The classes were established by using the land stress criteria defined in Table 3. (A detailed but as yet unpublished study by Eswaran  et al.  [personal communication] provided the kind and extent of the land resource stresses for all Asian countries.) An additional critical consideration was the level of capital investment required to correct these constraints for sustainable grain production. The data in Table 6 are displayed on the map in Figure 1.    Figure 1. Land quality classes of Asia      Table 6 and Figure 1 show that the area of land quality classes varies greatly among and within countries. It is interesting that Class I land only amounts to about 1% of the region’s land. By contrast, nearly half of the land area (49.5%) is occupied by land of Classes VII, VIII, and IX, which is either too cold, too wet, too steep or otherwise unsuited for sustainable grain production. Land in Classes I to III covers about 13% and constitutes the most productive arable land. It is probably correct to assume that, with the exception of a few countries such as Papua New Guinea, this land is for the most part already under cultivation. Land in Classes IV to VI has various constraints whose rectification may require substantial inputs. These lands are also susceptible to degradation. The data clearly show that Asia as a whole is endowed with land resources of predominantly inferior agricultural potential. This situation is aggravated by presumably widespread land degradation. As there are no reliable estimates of land degradation on a country by country basis available, we had to ignore this factor. Rather, our appraisal of land quality represents the inherent quality of land before human interference or natural processes adversely, or favourably, affected it.     Population-carrying capacity    Estimates of the amount of land needed to support one person vary widely. Smil (1987) argued that a minimum of 0.07 ha capita-1 is needed, which translates to 14 persons ha-1. Lal (1989), on the other hand, felt that 0.5 ha of arable land is required per capita, equivalent to 2 persons ha-1. Although Smil’s estimate appears to be unrealistically high, it is now nevertheless used by organizations of the UN as a threshold index.    Most population-carrying appraisals are based on total arable, or total land areas, which commonly leads to erroneous conclusions. We therefore stratified the land resource by land quality and assigned different carrying capacities, as explained in the section on methodology. The results of our study are presented in Table 7 and illustrated in Figure 2 for representative socioeconomic, demographic, and land endowment situations. The data indicate that, with low levels of management inputs, the current population exceeds what may be considered the optimal carrying capacity in all countries of the region except Kampuchea, Laos, Myanmar, and Papua New Guinea. With medium and high levels of management, the carrying capacity increases proportionally. With the projected population in 2025, per capita availability of arable land will have declined markedly beyond the sustainable carrying capacity of the land resource in all of the region except Kampuchea, Laos, and Papua New Guinea.     Figure 2. Population in 1995 and 2025, and land-based population carrying capacity for three levels of management input for representative countries of Asia.         Food security    Land-based food security in Asia is illustrated in Figure 3 for three levels of management inputs. This figure and the information presented in Table 7 and Figure 2 clearly indicate that Asia’s countries are at various levels of vulnerability to food security. Only three countries—Kampuchea, Laos, Papua New Guinea—are food secure. However, the three largest countries of Asia—China, India, and Indonesia—that account for most of its land area (14,126,040 km 2 ; 66.9%) and population (2,398.14 million; 73.9%) will experience difficulty in adequately feeding their populations unless they employ medium and high levels of agricultural technology. They are nonetheless much better off than countries like Afghanistan, Bangladesh or Pakistan (see Figure 2). For these countries, it appears, the Malthusian prophecy has already become a reality.    The current population of Asia is about 3.2 billion and is expected to grow to 4.5 billion by 2025. Our analysis clearly shows that most Asian countries will not be able to feed their projected populations without irreversibly degrading its land resources, even with high levels of management inputs. The reality may, in fact, be worse than our study indicates because, as mentioned above, we only considered inherent land quality, current climate, and estimated population levels. All of these determinants may change over time and aggravate the situation. Moreover, as also mentioned, we disregarded other conditions that may play a decisive role in food security, such as land degradation, patterns of consumerism, and economic development. For example, a large share of Asia’s population is moving up the food chain, eating more pork, poultry, beef, and eggs and drinking more beer, all of which are grain-intensive products (Brown, 1997). Thus, Hazell (1998) estimates that in China cereal requirements for animal feed will increase more than twofold from about 73 million metric tons in 1993 to 178 million metric tons in 2020. This grain will obviously not be available for direct human consumption. These and other speculative circumstances not taken into account may combine to affect food security and thus introduce a margin of error in our assessment.    Figure 3.

Only a few countries will be able to feed their growing populations without increasing land management input levels markedly. Most countries of the region lack the capital resources to make the financial investments required to increase land productivity. Nevertheless, the three largest and most populous countries of Asia—China, India, and Indonesia—should be able to meet minimal food requirements, provided the level of management technology is increased. It appears unlikely, however, that countries like Afghanistan and Pakistan will be able to produce sufficient food now or in the future. Although the same is true for industrialized countries like Japan, Singapore, and Taiwan, they can rely on non-agricultural industry, commerce, and servicing functions to earn the money to import food.    There are several adverse aspects precipitated by the current and future situation of local and global environmental consequence. First, farmers in the poorer countries will be forced to eke out a living by exploiting fragile land resources, which often results in irreversible degradation and permanent loss of biodiversity. Second, our analysis revealed the relative scarcity of prime agricultural land in Asia and the resulting imperative to preserve these areas for food production and optimize the land use of the remaining areas. This implies that soil scientists must expand their horizons and explore all functions of the soil and land resource in support of food security and quality of life. Third, although there is nothing inherently wrong with importing food from elsewhere, this leads to the appropriation of natural resources in other countries, which may not be a sustainable procedure.    We believe that to confront the problem of food security in Asia, massive infusions of capital are needed to support,  inter alia :       agricultural research and development, particularly in biotechnology and other cutting edge technologies,   the development of policies and practices conducive to sustainable land management,   the development of indices of land quality and their monitoring, and   elaboration of early warning indicators of land degradation.      The establishment of an International Convention on Land Degradation with the mandate and funding to halt or reverse the deterioration of the global land resource would be a commendable first step to address these issues.

In 1932, French Indochina annexed the islands and set up a weather station on Pattle Island; maintenance was continued by its successor, Vietnam. China has occupied the Paracel Islands since 1974, when its troops seized a South Vietnamese garrison occupying the western islands. The islands are claimed by Taiwan and Vietnam.                                                                        Geography                  Paracel Islands                                             Top of Page                                                              Location:                                                     Southeastern Asia, group of small islands and reefs in the South China Sea, about one-third of the way from central Vietnam to the northern Philippines                               Geographic coordinates:                                                                16 30 N, 112 00 E                               Map references:                                                                    Southeast Asia                                 Area:                                                                                               total:  NA sq km      water:  0 sq km      land:  NA sq km                               Area - comparative:                                                                NA                               Land boundaries:                                                                0 km                               Coastline:                                                                518 km                               Maritime claims:                                                                NA                               Climate:                                                                tropical                               Terrain:                                                                mostly low and flat                               Elevation extremes:                                                                       lowest point:  South China Sea 0 m      highest point:  unnamed location on Rocky Island 14 m                               Natural resources:                                                                none                               Land use:                                                                       arable land:  0%      permanent crops:  0%      other:  100% (1998 est.)

It was able to take advantage of its natural resources to rapidly develop its agricultural and manufacturing industries and to make a major contribution to the British effort in World Wars I and II. Long-term concerns include pollution, particularly depletion of the ozone layer, and management and conservation of coastal areas, especially the Great Barrier Reef. A referendum to change Australia's status, from a commonwealth headed by the British monarch to a republic, was defeated in 1999.

Rising output in the domestic economy has been offsetting the global slump, and business and consumer confidence remains robust. Australia's emphasis on reforms is another key factor behind the economy's strength. The stagnant economic conditions in major export partners and the impact of the worst drought in 100 years cast a shadow over prospects for 2003.

Cuba's Communist revolution, with Soviet support, was exported throughout Latin America and Africa during the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s. The country is now slowly recovering from a severe economic recession in 1990, following the withdrawal of former Soviet subsidies, worth $4 billion to $6 billion annually. Cuba portrays its difficulties as the result of the US embargo in place since 1961. Illicit migration to the US - using homemade rafts, alien smugglers, or falsified visas - is a continuing problem. Some 2,500 Cubans attempted the crossing of the Straits of Florida in 2002; the US Coast Guard apprehended about 60% of the individuals.

It has undertaken limited reforms in recent years to increase enterprise efficiency and alleviate serious shortages of food, consumer goods, and services but is unlikely to implement extensive changes. A major feature of the economy is the dichotomy between relatively efficient export enclaves and inefficient domestic sectors. The average Cuban's standard of living remains at a lower level than before the severe economic depression of the early 1990s, which was caused by the loss of Soviet aid and domestic inefficiencies. High oil import prices, recessions in key export markets, damage from Hurricanes Isidore and Lili, and the tourist slump after 11 September 2001 hampered growth in 2002.

Since then, some 200,000 Burundians have perished in widespread, often intense ethnic violence between Hutu and Tutsi factions. Hundreds of thousands have been internally displaced or have become refugees in neighboring countries. Burundi troops, seeking to secure their borders, intervened in the conflict in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in 1998. More recently, many of these troops have been redeployed back to Burundi to deal with periodic upsurges in rebel activity. A new transitional government, inaugurated on 1 November 2001, was to be the first step toward holding national elections in three years. While the Government of Burundi signed a cease-fire agreement in December 2002 with three of Burundi's four Hutu rebel groups, implementation of the agreement has been problematic and one rebel group refuses to sign on, clouding prospects for a sustainable peace.

The economy is predominantly agricultural with roughly 90% of the population dependent on subsistence agriculture. Economic growth depends on coffee and tea exports, which account for 90% of foreign exchange earnings. The ability to pay for imports, therefore, rests primarily on weather conditions and international coffee and tea prices. The Tutsi minority, 14% of the population, dominates the government and the coffee trade at the expense of the Hutu majority, 85% of the population. Since October 1993 an ethnic-based war has resulted in the death of over 200,000 persons, sent 800,000 refugees into Tanzania, and displaced 525,000 others internally. Doubts about the prospects for sustainable peace continue to impede development. Only one in two children go to school, and approximately one in ten adults has HIV/AIDS. Food, medicine, and electricity remain in short supply.                               GDP:                     purchasing power parity - $3.146 billion (2002 est.)

Under the DOP, Israel agreed to transfer certain powers and responsibilities to the Palestinian Authority, which includes the Palestinian Legislative Council elected in January 1996, as part of the interim self-governing arrangements in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. A transfer of powers and responsibilities for the Gaza Strip and Jericho took place pursuant to the Israel-PLO 4 May 1994 Cairo Agreement on the Gaza Strip and the Jericho Area and in additional areas of the West Bank pursuant to the Israel-PLO 28 September 1995 Interim Agreement, the Israel-PLO 15 January 1997 Protocol Concerning Redeployment in Hebron, the Israel-PLO 23 October 1998 Wye River Memorandum, and the 4 September 1999 Sharm el-Sheikh Agreement. The DOP provides that Israel will retain responsibility during the transitional period for external and internal security and for public order of settlements and Israeli citizens. Direct negotiations to determine the permanent status of Gaza and West Bank had begun in September 1999 after a three-year hiatus, but have been derailed by a second intifadah that broke out in September 2000. The resulting widespread violence in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, Israel's military response, and instability within the Palestinian Authority continue to undermine progress toward a permanent agreement.

The downturn was largely the result of Israeli closure policies - the imposition of generalized border closures in response to security incidents in Israel - which disrupted previously established labor and commodity market relationships between Israel and the WBGS (West Bank and Gaza Strip). The most serious negative social effect of this downturn was the emergence of high unemployment; unemployment in the WBGS during the 1980s was generally under 5%; by 1995 it had risen to over 20%. Israel's use of comprehensive closures decreased during the next few years and, in 1998, Israel implemented new policies to reduce the impact of closures and other security procedures on the movement of Palestinian goods and labor. These changes fueled an almost three-year-long economic recovery in the West Bank and Gaza Strip; real GDP grew by 5% in 1998 and 6% in 1999. Recovery was upended in the last quarter of 2000 with the outbreak of violence, triggering tight Israeli closures of Palestinian self-rule areas and a severe disruption of trade and labor movements. In 2001, and even more severely in 2002, Israeli military measures in Palestinian Authority areas resulted in the destruction of capital plant and administrative structure, widespread business closures, and a sharp drop in GDP. Another major loss has been the decline in income earned by Palestinian workers in Israel. International aid of $2 billion in 2001-02 to the Gaza Strip and West Bank have prevented the complete collapse of the economy.

France ceded possession to Great Britain in 1763, which made the island a colony in 1805. In 1980, two years after independence, Dominica's fortunes improved when a corrupt and tyrannical administration was replaced by that of Mary Eugenia CHARLES, the first female prime minister in the Caribbean, who remained in office for 15 years. Some 3,000 Carib Indians still living on Dominica are the only pre-Columbian population remaining in the eastern Caribbean.

Hurricane Luis devastated the country's banana crop in 1995 after tropical storms wiped out a quarter of the 1994 crop. The economy subsequently has been fueled by increases in construction, soap production, and tourist arrivals. Development of the tourism industry remains difficult however, because of the rugged coastline, lack of beaches, and the absence of an international airport.

Potatoes, cauliflower, tomatoes, and especially flowers are important export crops, shipped mostly to the UK. The Jersey breed of dairy cattle is known worldwide and represents an important export income earner. Milk products go to the UK and other EU countries. In 1996 the finance sector accounted for about 60% of the island's output. Tourism, another mainstay of the economy, accounts for 24% of GDP. In recent years, the government has encouraged light industry to locate in Jersey, with the result that an electronics industry has developed alongside the traditional manufacturing of knitwear. All raw material and energy requirements are imported, as well as a large share of Jersey's food needs. Light taxes and death duties make the island a popular tax haven.

Under the DOP, Israel agreed to transfer certain powers and responsibilities to the Palestinian Authority, which includes the Palestinian Legislative Council elected in January 1996, as part of the interim self-governing arrangements in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. A transfer of powers and responsibilities for the Gaza Strip and Jericho took place pursuant to the Israel-PLO 4 May 1994 Cairo Agreement on the Gaza Strip and the Jericho Area and in additional areas of the West Bank pursuant to the Israel-PLO 28 September 1995 Interim Agreement, the Israel-PLO 15 January 1997 Protocol Concerning Redeployment in Hebron, the Israel-PLO 23 October 1998 Wye River Memorandum, and the 4 September 1999 Sharm el-Sheikh Agreement. The DOP provides that Israel will retain responsibility during the transitional period for external security and for internal security and public order of settlements and Israeli citizens. Direct negotiations to determine the permanent status of Gaza and West Bank had begun in September 1999 after a three-year hiatus, but have been derailed by a second intifadah that broke out in September 2000. The resulting widespread violence in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, Israel's military response, and instability within the Palestinian Authority continue to undermine progress toward a permanent agreement.

The downturn in economic activity was largely the result of Israeli closure policies - the imposition of border closures in response to security incidents in Israel - which disrupted labor and commodity market relationships between Israel and the WBGS. The most serious social effect of this downturn was rising unemployment; unemployment in the WBGS during the 1980s was generally under 5%; by 1995 it had risen to over 20%. Israel's use of comprehensive closures during the next five years decreased and, in 1998, Israel implemented new policies to reduce the impact of closures and other security procedures on the movement of Palestinian goods and labor. These changes fueled an almost three-year-long economic recovery in the West Bank and Gaza Strip; real GDP grew by 5% in 1998 and 6% in 1999. Recovery was upended in the last quarter of 2000 with the outbreak of violence, which triggered tight Israeli closures of Palestinian self-rule areas and severely disrupted trade and labor movements. In 2001, and even more severely in 2002, Israeli military measures in Palestinian Authority areas have resulted in the destruction of much capital plant and administrative structure, widespread business closures, and a sharp drop in GDP. Another major loss has been the decline in earnings of Palestinian workers in Israel. International aid of $2 billion in 2001-02 to the West Bank and Gaza Strip have prevented the complete collapse of the economy.

They are surrounded by rich fishing grounds and potentially by gas and oil deposits. They are claimed in their entirety by China, Taiwan, and Vietnam, while portions are claimed by Malaysia and the Philippines. About 50 islands are occupied by China (about 450 soldiers), Malaysia (70-90), the Philippines (about 100), and Vietnam (about 1,500).

The proximity to nearby oil- and gas-producing sedimentary basins suggests the potential for oil and gas deposits, but the region is largely unexplored, and there are no reliable estimates of potential reserves; commercial exploitation has yet to be developed.                                                                             Transportation                  Spratly Islands                                             Top of Page                                                              Waterways:                                                     none                               Ports and harbors:                                                                none; offshore anchorage only                               Airports:                                                                3 (2002)                               Airports - with paved runways:                                                                       total:  1      914 to 1,523 m:  1 (2002)                               Airports - with unpaved runways:                                                                       total:  2      914 to 1,523 m:  1      under 914 m:  1 (2002)                                                                Military                  Spratly Islands                                             Top of Page                                                              Military - note:                                                     Spratly Islands consist of more than 100 small islands or reefs, of which about 45 are claimed and occupied by China, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan, and Vietnam                                                                Transnational Issues                  Spratly Islands                                             Top of Page                                                              Disputes - international:                                                     all of the Spratly Islands are claimed by China, Taiwan, and Vietnam; parts of them are claimed by Malaysia and the Philippines; in 1984, Brunei established an exclusive fishing zone that encompasses Louisa Reef in the southern Spratly Islands but has not publicly claimed the island; claimants in November 2002 signed the ""Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea"", a mechanism to ease tension but which fell short of a legally binding ""code of conduct""              This page was last updated on 18 December, 2003"

Five years later the civilian government was replaced by a military regime that soon declared a socialist republic. It continued to rule through a succession of nominally civilian administrations until 1987, when international pressure finally forced a democratic election. In 1989, the military overthrew the civilian government, but a democratically-elected government returned to power in 1991.

Suriname's economic prospects for the medium term will depend on renewed commitment to responsible monetary and fiscal policies and to the introduction of structural reforms to liberalize markets and promote competition. The government of Ronald VENETIAAN has begun an austerity program, raised taxes, and attempted to control spending. However, in 2002, President VENETIAAN agreed to a large pay raise for civil servants, which threatens his earlier gains in stabilizing the economy. The Dutch Government has agreed to restart the aid flow, which will allow Suriname to access international development financing. The short-term economic outlook depends on the government's ability to control inflation and on the development of projects in the bauxite and gold mining sectors.

An important air and naval base was constructed in 1940-41. In December 1941, the island was captured by the Japanese and held until the end of World War II. In subsequent years, Wake was developed as a stopover and refueling site for military and commercial aircraft transiting the Pacific. Since 1974, the island's airstrip has been used by the US military and some commercial cargo planes, as well as for emergency landings. There are over 700 landings a year on the island.                                                                        Geography                  Wake Island                                             Top of Page                                                              Location:                                                     Oceania, atoll in the North Pacific Ocean, about two-thirds of the way from Hawaii to the Northern Mariana Islands                               Geographic coordinates:                                                                19 17 N, 166 36 E                               Map references:                                                                    Oceania                                 Area:                                                                                               total:  6.5 sq km      water:  0 sq km      land:  6.5 sq km                               Area - comparative:                                                                about 11 times the size of The Mall in Washington, DC                               Land boundaries:                                                                0 km                               Coastline:                                                                19.3 km                               Maritime claims:                                                                       exclusive economic zone:  200 NM      territorial sea:  12 NM                               Climate:                                                                tropical                               Terrain:                                                                atoll of three coral islands built up on an underwater volcano; central lagoon is former crater, islands are part of the rim                               Elevation extremes:                                                                       lowest point:  Pacific Ocean 0 m      highest point:  unnamed location 6 m                               Natural resources:                                                                none                               Land use:                                                                       arable land:  0%      permanent crops:  0%      other:  100% (1998 est.)

Independent for over 300 years, Iceland was subsequently ruled by Norway and Denmark. Fallout from the Askja volcano of 1875 devastated the Icelandic economy and caused widespread famine. Over the next quarter century, 20% of the island's population emigrated, mostly to Canada and the US. Limited home rule from Denmark was granted in 1874 and complete independence attained in 1944. Literacy, longevity, income, and social cohesion are first-rate by world standards.

In the absence of other natural resources (except for abundant hydrothermal and geothermal power), the economy depends heavily on the fishing industry, which provides 70% of export earnings and employs 12% of the work force. The economy remains sensitive to declining fish stocks as well as to fluctuations in world prices for its main exports: fish and fish products, aluminum, and ferrosilicon. Government policies include reducing the budget and current account deficits, limiting foreign borrowing, containing inflation, revising agricultural and fishing policies, diversifying the economy, and privatizing state-owned industries. The government remains opposed to EU membership, primarily because of Icelanders' concern about losing control over their fishing resources. Iceland's economy has been diversifying into manufacturing and service industries in the last decade, and new developments in software production, biotechnology, and financial services are taking place. The tourism sector is also expanding, with the recent trends in ecotourism and whale watching. Growth had been remarkably steady in 1996-2001 at 3%-5%, but could not be sustained in 2002 in an environment of global recession. Growth resumed in 2003, and inflation dropped back from 5% to 2%.

Cartier Island, a former bombing range, is now a marine reserve.                                                                        Geography                  Ashmore and Cartier Islands                                             Top of Page                                                              Location:                                                     Southeastern Asia, islands in the Indian Ocean, northwest of Australia, south of the Indonesian half of Timor island                               Geographic coordinates:                                                                12 14 S, 123 05 E                               Map references:                                                                    Southeast Asia                                 Area:                                                                                               total:  5 sq km      note:  includes Ashmore Reef (West, Middle, and East Islets) and Cartier Island      water:  0 sq km      land:  5 sq km                               Area - comparative:                                                                about eight times the size of The Mall in Washington, DC                               Land boundaries:                                                                0 km                               Coastline:                                                                74.1 km                               Maritime claims:                                                                       contiguous zone:  12 NM      continental shelf:  200-m depth or to the depth of exploitation      territorial sea:  12 NM      exclusive fishing zone:  200 NM                               Climate:                                                                tropical                               Terrain:                                                                low with sand and coral                               Elevation extremes:                                                                       lowest point:  Indian Ocean 0 m      highest point:  unnamed location 3 m                               Natural resources:                                                                fish                               Land use:                                                                       arable land:  0%      permanent crops:  0%      other:  100% (all grass and sand) (1998 est.)

Government expenditures regularly exceed revenues, and the shortfall is made up by critically needed grants from New Zealand that are used to pay wages to public employees. Niue has cut government expenditures by reducing the public service by almost half. The agricultural sector consists mainly of subsistence gardening, although some cash crops are grown for export. Industry consists primarily of small factories to process passion fruit, lime oil, honey, and coconut cream. The sale of postage stamps to foreign collectors is an important source of revenue. The island in recent years has suffered a serious loss of population because of migration of Niueans to New Zealand. Efforts to increase GDP include the promotion of tourism and a financial services industry, although Premier LAKATANI announced in February 2002 that Niue will shut down the offshore banking industry. Economic aid from New Zealand in 2002 was about $2.6 million.                               GDP:                     purchasing power parity - $7.6 million (2000 est.)

The dictatorial regime of Idi AMIN (1971-79) was responsible for the deaths of some 300,000 opponents; guerrilla war and human rights abuses under Milton OBOTE (1980-85) claimed at least another 100,000 lives. During the 1990s, the government promulgated non-party presidential and legislative elections.

Agriculture is the most important sector of the economy, employing over 80% of the work force. Coffee accounts for the bulk of export revenues. Since 1986, the government - with the support of foreign countries and international agencies - has acted to rehabilitate and stabilize the economy by undertaking currency reform, raising producer prices on export crops, increasing prices of petroleum products, and improving civil service wages. The policy changes are especially aimed at dampening inflation and boosting production and export earnings. During 1990-2001, the economy turned in a solid performance based on continued investment in the rehabilitation of infrastructure, improved incentives for production and exports, reduced inflation, gradually improved domestic security, and the return of exiled Indian-Ugandan entrepreneurs. Ongoing Ugandan involvement in the war in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, corruption within the government, and slippage in the government's determination to press reforms raise doubts about the continuation of strong growth. In 2000, Uganda qualified for enhanced Highly Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) debt relief worth $1.3 billion and Paris Club debt relief worth $145 million. These amounts combined with the original HIPC debt relief added up to about $2 billion. Growth for 2001-02 was solid despite continued decline in the price of coffee, Uganda's principal export. Prospects for 2003 are mixed, with probable strengthening of coffee prices yet with halting growth in the economies of major export customers.

The economy is predominately agricultural, with about 90% of the population living in rural areas. Agriculture accounted for nearly 40% of GDP and 88% of export revenues in 2001. The economy depends on substantial inflows of economic assistance from the IMF, the World Bank, and individual donor nations. In late 2000, Malawi was approved for relief under the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) program. In November 2002 the World Bank approved a $50 million drought recovery package, which is to be used for famine relief. The government faces strong challenges, e.g., to fully develop a market economy, to improve educational facilities, to face up to environmental problems, to deal with the rapidly growing problem of HIV/AIDS, and to satisfy foreign donors that fiscal discipline is being tightened. The performance of the tobacco sector is key to short-term growth as tobacco accounts for over 50% of exports.

A unified kingdom arose circa 3200 B.C. and a series of dynasties ruled in Egypt for the next three millennia. The last native dynasty fell to the Persians in 341 B.C., who in turn were replaced by the Greeks, Romans, and Byzantines. It was the Arabs who introduced Islam and the Arabic language in the 7th century and who ruled for the next six centuries. A local military caste, the Mamluks took control about 1250 and continued to govern after the conquest of Egypt by the Ottoman Turks in 1517. Following the completion of the Suez Canal in 1869, Egypt became an important world transportation hub, but also fell heavily into debt. Ostensibly to protect its investments, Britain seized control of Egypt's government in 1882, but nominal allegiance to the Ottoman Empire continued until 1914. Partially independent from the UK in 1922, Egypt acquired full sovereignty following World War II. The completion of the Aswan High Dam in 1971 and the resultant Lake Nasser have altered the time-honored place of the Nile River in the agriculture and ecology of Egypt. A rapidly growing population (the largest in the Arab world), limited arable land, and dependence on the Nile all continue to overtax resources and stress society. The government has struggled to ready the economy for the new millennium through economic reform and massive investment in communications and physical infrastructure.

As a result, Egypt managed to tame inflation, slash budget deficits, and attract more foreign investment. In the past four years, however, the pace of reform has slackened, and excessive spending on national infrastructure projects has widened budget deficits again. Lower foreign exchange earnings since 1998 resulted in pressure on the Egyptian pound and periodic dollar shortages. Monetary pressures have increased since 11 September 2001 because of declines in tourism and Suez Canal tolls, and Egypt has devalued the pound several times in the past year. The development of a gas export market is a major bright spot for future growth prospects. In the short term, regional tensions will continue to affect tourism and hold back prospects for economic expansion.

The rate of funding has declined as locally generated government revenues have grown. The key tourist industry employs about 50% of the work force and accounts for roughly one-fourth of GDP. Japanese tourists predominate. Annual tourist entries have exceeded one-half million in recent years, but financial difficulties in Japan have caused a temporary slowdown. The agricultural sector is made up of cattle ranches and small farms producing coconuts, breadfruit, tomatoes, and melons. Garment production is by far the most important industry with employment of 17,500 mostly Chinese workers and sizable shipments to the US under duty and quota exemptions.

GX016-04-7199871	DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY  Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms T.D. ATF-393        Removal of Restrictions on Importation of Defense Articles From Specified New Independent States of the Former Soviet Union and Yugoslavia and To Amend the Term ``Military Firearms and Ammunition''    AGENCY : Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF), Department of  the Treasury.   ACTION:  Final rule (Treasury decision).         SUMMARY:  This final rule removes the following States of the former Soviet Union from the list of countries from which the import of  defense articles into the United States is proscribed: Georgia, Kazakstan, Kyrgyzstan, Moldova, Russian Federation, Turkmenistan, Ukraine, and Uzbekistan. The rule also restricts the importation of certain firearms and ammunition located or manufactured in any of the above countries or previously manufactured in the Soviet Union to conform to limitations contained in an agreement between the United States and the Russian Federation and in accordance with advice from the Department of State. The final rule specifies the firearms that are allowed to be imported from these countries as well as ammunition that may not be imported from these countries. The final rule also revises  the list of proscribed countries to reflect the lifting of the embargo on importation of defense articles and defense services from the states of the former Yugoslavia, except for Serbia and Montenegro. Finally, the regulations are being revised to require applications to import parts of military firearms or ammunition of United States manufacture to be submitted with statements certifying that the parts were not furnished to a foreign government under a foreign assistance or sales program of the United States.     [[Page 61233]]   DATES:  The amendments to 27 CFR 47.52 are effective November 17, 1997.   The amendment to 27 CFR 47.52(c) was effective December 20, 1996. Applicability dates. Removal of the Russian Federation from the list of proscribed countries was applicable April 5, 1996. Removal of Georgia, Kazakstan, Kyrgyzstan, Moldova, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan  was applicable August 12, 1996. Removal of Ukraine was applicable September 10, 1996. Lifting of the embargo on importation of defense articles, other than heavy weapons, ammunition therefor, mines, military aircraft and helicopters from a number of the states of the country formerly known as Yugoslavia was applicable March 14, 1996.   Lifting of restrictions on the importation of the remainder of defense articles and defense services from a number of the states of the former Yugoslavia was applicable July 12, 1996.      FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:  Scott Mendoza, Specialist, Firearms and Explosives Imports Branch, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms,  650 Massachusetts Avenue NW., Washington, DC 20226, (202) 927-8320.      SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:  The Arms Export Control Act of 1976 (AECA), 22 U.S.C. 2778, gives the President of the United States the authority to control the import and export of defense articles and defense services.   Executive Order 11958 of January 18, 1977, as amended (42 FR 4311), delegated the authority to control exports of defense articles and defense services to the Secretary of State. The Executive Order also delegated to the Secretary of the Treasury the authority to control the import of such articles and services. However, as stated in 27 CFR 47.55, ATF is guided by the views of the Departments of State and Defense on matters affecting world peace and the external security and foreign policy of the United States.   New Independent States of the Former Soviet Union   By letter dated April 5, 1996, the Secretary of State advised the Director, ATF, that, under the authority of Section 38 of the AECA it is no longer the policy of the United States to deny licenses, other approvals, exports and imports of defense articles and defense services destined for or originating in the Russian Federation (Russia). The State Department requested that the Director implement this decision immediately with respect to his authority over imports under Section 38 of the AECA and amend the regulation at 27 CFR 47.52(a) to reflect this change in foreign policy. On April 29, 1996, ATF published in the Federal Register a Statement of Policy announcing this change in foreign policy (Notice No. 821, 61 FR 18678).   The April 5, 1996, letter also informed ATF that an agreement between the United States and the Russian Federation on exports of firearms and ammunition from the Russian Federation to the United States (the Agreement) was signed on April 3, 1996, and entered into force on that date. The letter stated that carrying out such an agreement and keeping out unacceptable types of munitions from the United States are United States foreign policy concerns. On this basis, the State Department advised the Department of the Treasury to exercise its authority under the AECA by denying applications to import firearms and ammunition located or manufactured in Russia or previously manufactured in the Soviet Union that would be inconsistent with the Agreement. The State Department advised Treasury that the foregoing did not apply to conditional imports of firearms and ammunition that would serve as samples for purposes of determining whether the items are of a type authorized for importation under the Agreement. The Agreement provides that Russia shall not allow the exportation to the United States of firearms other than those specified in Annex A to the Agreement and will prohibit exportation to the United States of ammunition specified in Annex B to the Agreement. The Agreement also provides that new types of firearms and ammunition manufactured after February 9, 1996, may not be exported by Russia under the Agreement unless the parties agree in writing to amend the Agreement accordingly.   The Agreement, including Annexes A and B, was published in its entirety in Notice No. 821.   By letter dated June 24, 1996, the Secretary of State requested that ATF deny applications to import firearms located or manufactured in the non-Russian newly independent states of the former Soviet Union (NIS) that are not listed in Annex A to the Agreement, once those countries have been removed from the proscribed countries list. The letter further requested that ATF deny applications to import ammunition located or manufactured in the non-Russian NIS that is listed in Annex B to the Agreement, once those countries have been removed from the proscribed countries list. The letter stated that, for purposes of this request, the non-Russian NIS should be considered as Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Georgia, Kazakstan, Kyrgyzstan, Moldova, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Ukraine and Uzbekistan. The letter advised that the State Department would notify ATF when a decision had been made to remove from the list of proscribed countries any of the NIS listed above.   By letter dated August 12, 1996, the Secretary of State notified the Director, ATF, that the State Department had removed Georgia, Kazakstan, Kyrgyzstan, Moldova, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan from the list of proscribed countries in 22 CFR Part 126. The letter stated that it is no longer the policy of the United States to deny licenses or other approvals for exports and imports of defense articles and defense services destined for or originating in these countries, except as  provided in the June 24, 1996, letter. Consistent with ATF's authority over the importation of defense articles and defense services, the Secretary of State requested that ATF amend the list of proscribed countries in 27 CFR Part 47 to reflect this change in foreign policy. By letter dated September 10, 1996, the Secretary of State advised the Director, ATF, that the Department of State had removed Ukraine from the list of proscribed countries in 22 CFR Part 126. The letter stated that it is no longer the policy of the United States to deny licenses or other approvals for exports and imports of defense articles and defense services destined for or originating in Ukraine, except as provided in the June 24, 1996, letter. The letter requested that ATF exercise its authority over the importation of defense articles and defense services and amend 27 CFR Part 47 to reflect this change in foreign policy.   The regulations in 27 CFR 47.52 have been amended to remove all the above NIS from the list of countries from which defense articles and defense services may not be imported. The regulations have also been amended to indicate that firearms may be imported from these countries only if they are listed in Annex A to the Agreement and that ammunition may be imported only if it is not listed in Annex B to the Agreement.   The regulations also provide that firearms and ammunition manufactured in the NIS may not be imported from any location unless they are listed in Annex A, in the case of firearms, or not listed in Annex B, in the case of ammunition.   [[Page 61234]]   Importation of Defense Articles and Defense Services From States of the Former Yugoslavia The States of Bosnia and Herzegovena, Croatia, Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro), Macedonia, and Slovenia were created with the dissolution of Yugoslavia.   Effective March 14, 1996, the Department of State announced a partial lifting of the suspension of licenses and approvals to export or otherwise transfer defense articles and defense services to the states of the former Yugoslavia, except Serbia and Montenegro, pursuant to section 38 of the AECA. The Department of State advised ATF that the suspension remained in place for all states of the former Yugoslavia with regard to importation of heavy weapons, ammunition therefor, mines, military aircraft and helicopters.   The Department of State subsequently advised ATF that, effective July 12, 1996, the remainder of the restrictions on importation of defense articles and defense services from the states of the former Yugoslavia, except Serbia and Montenegro, had been lifted (See 61 FR 36625, July 12, 1996). The State Department amended its regulations concerning exports of defense articles and defense services and requested that ATF amend the regulations in 27 CFR Part 47 to reflect this change in foreign policy.   The list of proscribed countries in 27 CFR 47.52(a) is being revised to replace the listing of Yugoslavia with the names of the former states still subject to import restrictions, i.e., the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro). Accordingly, ATF will approve applications to import defense articles from Bosnia and Herzegovena, Croatia, Macedonia, and Slovenia.   Importation of Parts of Military Firearms or Ammunition of United States Manufacture   By letter dated December 20, 1996, the Department of State requested that ATF amend the regulations in 27 CFR 47.57(c) to require that applications to import parts of military firearms or ammunition of United States manufacture include statements certifying that the parts were not furnished to a foreign government under a foreign assistance or sales program of the United States. The letter advised ATF that the Department of State believes that the importation of such parts must be subject to their review to be consistent with the law and Department of State policy.   The regulations in 27 CFR 47.57(c) are being revised to delete the current exemption for component parts of firearms and ammunition.   Executive Order 12866   Because the amendments to 27 CFR Part 47 involve a foreign affairs  function of the United States, Executive Order 12866 does not apply.   Administrative Procedure Act   Under 27 CFR 47.54, amendments made to 27 CFR Part 47 are excluded from the rulemaking provisions of 5 U.S.C. 553 because this Part involves a foreign affairs function of the United States. Accordingly, it is not necessary to issue this Treasury Decision with notice and public procedure thereon under 5 U.S.C. 553(b) or subject to the effective date limitations in 5 U.S.C. 553(d).     Regulatory Flexibility Act   The provisions of the Regulatory Flexibility Act relating to an initial and final regulatory flexibility analysis are not applicable to this final rule because the agency was not required to publish a general notice of proposed rulemaking under 5 U.S.C. 553 or any other law.   Paperwork Reduction Act      The provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, Public Law.  104-13, 44 U.S.C. Chapter 35, and its implementing regulations, 5 CFR Part 1320, do not apply to this final rule because no requirement to collect information is imposed.   Compliance With 5 U.S.C. Chapter 8   In accordance with 5 U.S.C. 808(2), ATF has found that, consistent  with guidance from the Department of State and for reasons of the foreign policy of the United States, notice and public procedure under 5 U.S.C. 801 are unnecessary, impracticable, and contrary to the public interest.

Authority and Issuance   Accordingly, 27 CFR Part 47 is amended as follows:   PART 47--IMPORTATION OF ARMS, AMMUNITION AND IMPLEMENTS OF WAR    Paragraph 1. The authority citation for Part 47 continues to read as follows:   Authority: 22 U.S.C. 2778.   Par. 2. Section 47.52 is amended by revising paragraph (a); by redesignating paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) as paragraphs (d), (e), and  (f); by removing ``paragraph (c)'' in the first sentence of redesignated paragraph (f) and adding in its place ``paragraph (e)''; and by adding new paragraphs (b) and (c) to read as follows:   Sec. 47.52 Import restrictions applicable to certain countries.   (a) It is the policy of the United States to deny licenses and other approvals with respect to defense articles and defense services originating in certain countries or areas. This policy applies to Cuba, Iran, Iraq, Libya, Mongolia, North Korea, Sudan, Syria, Vietnam, and some of the states that comprised the former Soviet Union (Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, and Tajikistan). This policy applies to countries or areas with respect to which the United States maintains an arms embargo (e.g., Burma, China, the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro), Haiti, Liberia, Rwanda, Somalia, Sudan, UNITA (Angola), and Zaire). It also applies when an import would not be in furtherance of world peace and the security and foreign policy of the United States.   Note: Changes in foreign policy may result in additions to and deletions from the above list of countries. The ATF will publish changes to this list in the Federal Register.

Gen. Gnassingbe EYADEMA, installed as military ruler in 1967, is Africa's longest-serving head of state. Despite the facade of multiparty elections instituted in the early 1990s, the government continues to be dominated by President EYADEMA, whose Rally of the Togolese People (RPT) party has maintained power almost continually since 1967. In addition, Togo has come under fire from international organizations for human rights abuses and is plagued by political unrest. Most bilateral and multilateral aid to Togo remains frozen.

Some basic foodstuffs must still be imported. Cocoa, coffee, and cotton generate about 40% of export earnings, with cotton being the most important cash crop. Togo is the world's fourth-largest producer of phosphate, but production fell an estimated 22% in 2002 due to power shortages and the cost of developing new deposits. The government's decade-long effort, supported by the World Bank and the IMF, to implement economic reform measures, encourage foreign investment, and bring revenues in line with expenditures has moved slowly. Progress depends on following through on privatization, increased openness in government financial operations, progress toward legislative elections, and continued support from foreign donors.

This bipartisan legislation includes the Africa Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA) and the U.S.-Caribbean Basin Trade Partnership Act (CBTPA), and other important provisions.  This package advances U.S. economic and security interests by strengthening our relationship with regions of the world that are making significant strides in terms of economic development and political reform.  It will expand two-way trade and create incentives for the countries of sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) and the Caribbean Basin to continue reforming their economies and increase their participation in the benefits of the global economy.   And, it will contribute to the continuation of our own strong economic performance by encouraging the opening of markets and the reduction of poverty in countries with hundreds of millions of potential consumers of American exports.    STRENGTHENING OUR PARTNERSHIP WITH AFRICA THROUGH THE AFRICAN GROWTH AND OPPORTUNITY ACT.   This Act promises to deepen our economic partnership with Africa and expand two-way trade to the benefit of both partners.  It will also encourage SSA countries to undertake economic reforms and engage in the world economy. As reform spurs growth in Africa, it will create new and bigger markets for U.S. exports, as the following statistics indicate:   The 48 countries of sub-Saharan Africa constitute a market of more than 700 million people.    Our exports to Africa, amounting to more than $6.5 billion in 1998, are more than 45 percent greater than those to all the countries of the former Soviet Union combined.    Although our exports to Africa grew more than eight percent in 1998, our trade with Africa accounts for only 1 percent of our total trade.  The United States accounted for only 6.1 percent of the African market -- while Asian exports have captured 28 percent.     AGOA lies in America’s interest because it promotes the types of reforms in Africa that will make sub-Saharan nations better allies and better trading partners. It has the support of virtually all African governments, including that of South Africa.   The Act’s specific provisions will:  Establish, as U.S. policy, a framework of incentives to encourage greater economic growth and self-reliance through enhanced international trade and investment in Africa.  Expand the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) program by providing duty-free treatment to virtually all products from sub-Saharan Africa.  The GSP program provides preferential tariff treatment for imports of developing countries that satisfy certain eligibility requirements. · Extend duty-free, quota-free benefits to apparel made in Africa from U.s. yarn and U.S. fabric or from yarns not available in the U.S.  Grant duty-free, quota-free benefits to apparel made in Africa from African fabric u to a limit that grows over time.  The escalating cap starts at 1.5 percent of U.S. imports of all apparels and rises over eight years to 3.5 percent.   Africa’s current share is only 1.1 percent of the U.S. apparel market.  Provide four years of special incentives for apparel industry investments in least developed countries.  Protect African workers and U.S. jobs by requiring tough safeguards against trans-shipment (i.e., shipping an item through a beneficiary country that was actually manufactured in a third country not eligible for the bill’s preferential tariff treatment) and respect for internationally recognized worker rights and human rights.  Institutionalize annual high-level discussions to promote trade, investment and development through creation of a U.S.-Africa Trade and Economic Cooperation Forum.  Develop a plan to establish a free trade agreement with SSA countries.  Provide additional technical assistance to help Africans take maximum advantage of the opportunities available in the expanding global trading system.  Encourage the American private sector to take a more active role in combating AIDS/HIV in Africa and establish eradication of AIDS as a top priority of the U.S. government.  AGOA is the first trade bill to address the challenge of AIDS/HIV directly.  Other provisions of the Act include: creation of an Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC) Infrastructure Fund to encourage investment in crucial transportation, power, and other infrastructure projects; and expansion of trade financing through the U.S. Export-Import Bank.     STRENGTHENING OUR TIES TO THE CARIBBEAN THROUGH THE U.S.-CARIBBEAN BASIN TRADE PARTNERSHIP ACT.   In recent years, the countries of the Caribbean Basin have formed an increasingly important export market for our goods, as the following figures illustrate:  The 23 independent countries of the Caribbean Basin together formed the sixth largest export market for U.S. goods in 1999.    Since the enactment of the Caribbean Basin Economic Recovery Act (CBERA) in 1984, U.S. exports to the region have more than tripled to $19 billion in 1999.  The Caribbean Basin countries absorbed 2.7% of total U.S. exports in 1999.    But Hurricanes Mitch and Georges of 1998 took a terrible toll -- $12 billion in damages, by some estimates -- on the nations of the Caribbean Basin.  Forming a complement to the disaster relief the U.S. has already provided, CBTPA will help CBI countries get back on their feet and grow over the long-term.  That will help not only U.S. exports; it will create the conditions in which healthy democracies can thrive.   Specifically, CBTPA will:    Offer temporary trade benefits to Caribbean Basin countries to facilitate their economic development and reconstruction after 1998’s devastating hurricanes, place them on a more equal competitive basis with Mexico in the U.S. market, and reinforce the region’s trend toward more openness in the conduct of economic policy.  Encourage development of trade and investment policies that will facilitate their ultimate participation in the Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA).  Expand the CBI program to extend preferential tariff treatment to certain textile and apparel products assembled from U.S. fabric that have been excluded from the program.  This will encourage additional U.S. exports of cotton and yarn and U.S. investment in the region and strengthen the international competitive position of the U.S. textile industry.  Extend preferential tariff treatment to textile handicrafts and all non-textile products currently excluded from such treatment under the existing Caribbean Basin Initiative.  Reduce duty rates for textiles covered by the agreement by up to 100 percent, and such products would be free of quantitative restrictions.  For other products, the tariff rate would be reduced up to 100 percent of the difference between the current rate and the rate applicable to Mexican goods under the NAFTA.   Provide safeguard provisions on covered textile products.  Tariff benefits could be modified under the same conditions as in the NAFTA in the event of disruptive import surges.    Conditions countries’ eligibility for these expanded trade benefits on fulfillment of WTO obligations pertaining to fair trade, cooperation in counter-narcotics efforts, and respect for core labor standards.     OTHER PROVISIONS OF THE TRADE AND DEVELOPMENT ACT OF 2000.   The Act also:  Improves enforcement of fair trade rules by requiring periodic changes in foreign products subject to U.S. retaliation when a foreign government persists in its failure to comply with a WTO decision.   Expands the list of worker rights criteria countries must meet to be eligible for trade preference programs like GSP, CBI, and AGOA to include implementation of the recent International Labor Organization Convention banning the worst forms of child labor.   Provides relief from high tariffs on wool fabric that has hurt competitiveness of the U.S. wool suit manufacturing industry.  Promotes economic growth and democracy in other developing countries.  The Act determines that the emigration laws and practices of Albania, Kyrgyzstan, and other countries are in compliance with the Jackson-Vanik amendment of the 1974 Trade Act, and thus are now eligible for normal trade relations status with the United States.  That means that the U.S. will grant these countries the same trading rights we grant to other WTO members when these nations join that organization in the near future.  Increased trade will lead to a better relationship with the U.S. and a surer path to democracy for these newly independent nations.     BENEFITS OF FREER TRADE.  Since the creation of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade in 1948, Democratic and Republican Administrations, working in partnership with Congress, have concluded eight negotiating Rounds, signed hundreds of bilateral trade agreements, and opened markets for American goods.  All this has helped to:  increase global trade 15-fold;  boost real production in the United States 5-fold; and  augment real average American per capita income 3-fold.    Since the conclusion of the Uruguay Round in 1994, a more open world economy has helped American exports rise by over $200 billion (51 percent).  Export expansion accounted for more than one-quarter of U.S. economic growth between 1992 and 1998.  Average real wages have grown 6.3 percent under President Clinton, with export-related jobs paying 15 percent more on average than non-export-related jobs.

Independent for over 300 years, Iceland was subsequently ruled by Norway and Denmark. Fallout from the Askja volcano of 1875 devastated the Icelandic economy and caused widespread famine. Over the next quarter century, 20% of the island's population emigrated, mostly to Canada and the US. Limited home rule from Denmark was granted in 1874 and complete independence attained in 1944. Literacy, longevity, income, and social cohesion are first-rate by world standards.                                                                        Geography                  Iceland                                             Top of Page                                                              Location:                                                     Northern Europe, island between the Greenland Sea and the North Atlantic Ocean, northwest of the UK                               Geographic coordinates:                                                                65 00 N, 18 00 W                               Map references:                                                                    Arctic Region                                 Area:                                                                                               total:  103,000 sq km      land:  100,250 sq km      water:  2,750 sq km                               Area - comparative:                                                                slightly smaller than Kentucky                               Land boundaries:                                                                0 km                               Coastline:                                                                4,988 km                               Maritime claims:                                                                       continental shelf:  200 NM or to the edge of the continental margin      exclusive economic zone:  200 NM      territorial sea:  12 NM                               Climate:                                                                temperate; moderated by North Atlantic Current; mild, windy winters; damp, cool summers                               Terrain:                                                                mostly plateau interspersed with mountain peaks, icefields; coast deeply indented by bays and fiords                               Elevation extremes:                                                                       lowest point:  Atlantic Ocean 0 m      highest point:  Hvannadalshnukur 2,119 m (at Vatnajokull glacier)                               Natural resources:                                                                fish, hydropower, geothermal power, diatomite                               Land use:                                                                       arable land:  1%      other:  70% (2001 est.)      forest and woodlands:  1%      permanent crops:  0%      permanent pastures:  28%                               Irrigated land:                                                                NA sq km                               Natural hazards:                                                                earthquakes and volcanic activity                               Environment - current issues:                                                                water pollution from fertilizer runoff; inadequate wastewater treatment                               Environment - international agreements:                                                                       party to:  Air Pollution, Biodiversity, Climate Change, Desertification, Endangered Species, Environmental Modification, Environmental Protection through Criminal Law, Hazardous Wastes, Kyoto Protocol, Law of the Sea, Marine Dumping, Nuclear Test Ban, Oil Pollution, Ozone Layer Protection, Persistent Organic Pollutants, Ship Pollution, Transboundary Air Pollution, Wetlands      signed, but not ratified:  Air Pollution-Persistent Organic Pollutants, Environmental Modification, Marine Life Conservation                               Geography - note:                                                                strategic location between Greenland and Europe; westernmost European country; Reykjavik is the northernmost national capital in the world; more land covered by glaciers than in all of continental Europe                                                                People                  Iceland                                             Top of Page                                                              Population:                                                                         280,798 (July 2003 est.)

In the absence of other natural resources (except for abundant hydrothermal and geothermal power), the economy depends heavily on the fishing industry, which provides 70% of export earnings and employs 12% of the work force. The economy remains sensitive to declining fish stocks as well as to fluctuations in world prices for its main exports: fish and fish products, aluminum, and ferrosilicon. Government policies include reducing the budget and current account deficits, limiting foreign borrowing, containing inflation, revising agricultural and fishing policies, diversifying the economy, and privatizing state-owned industries. The government remains opposed to EU membership, primarily because of Icelanders' concern about losing control over their fishing resources. Iceland's economy has been diversifying into manufacturing and service industries in the last decade, and new developments in software production, biotechnology, and financial services are taking place. The tourism sector is also expanding, with the recent trends in ecotourism and whale watching. Growth had been remarkably steady in 1996-2001 at 3%-5%, but could not be sustained in 2002 in an environment of global recession. Growth resumed in 2003, and inflation dropped back from 5% to 2%.

From the 17th to the 19th centuries, French immigration, supplemented by influxes of Africans, Chinese, Malays, and Malabar Indians, gave the island its ethnic mix. The opening of the Suez Canal in 1869 cost the island its importance as a stopover on the East Indies trade route.

Sugarcane has been the primary crop for more than a century, and in some years it accounts for 85% of exports. The government has been pushing the development of a tourist industry to relieve high unemployment, which amounts to one-third of the labor force. The gap in Reunion between the well-off and the poor is extraordinary and accounts for the persistent social tensions. The white and Indian communities are substantially better off than other segments of the population, often approaching European standards, whereas minority groups suffer the poverty and unemployment typical of the poorer nations of the African continent. The outbreak of severe rioting in February 1991 illustrates the seriousness of socioeconomic tensions. The economic well-being of Reunion depends heavily on continued financial assistance from France.

The island of Anguilla rebelled and was allowed to secede in 1971. Saint Kitts and Nevis achieved independence in 1983. In 1998, a vote in Nevis on a referendum to separate from Saint Kitts fell short of the two-thirds majority needed.

Although the crop still dominates the agricultural sector, activities such as tourism, export-oriented manufacturing, and offshore banking have assumed larger roles in the economy. As tourism revenues are now the chief source of the islands' foreign exchange, a decline in stopover tourist arrivals following the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks has eroded government finances. The opening of a 1,000+ bed Marriott hotel in February 2003 is expected to bring in much-needed revenue.

The president faces the daunting task of rebuilding a petroleum-based economy, whose revenues have been squandered through corruption and mismanagement, and institutionalizing democracy. In addition, the OBASANJO administration must defuse longstanding ethnic and religious tensions, if it is to build a sound foundation for economic growth and political stability. Despite some irregularities the April 2003 elections marked the first civilian transfer of power in Nigeria's history.

Nigeria's former military rulers failed to diversify the economy away from overdependence on the capital-intensive oil sector, which provides 20% of GDP, 95% of foreign exchange earnings, and about 65% of budgetary revenues. The largely subsistence agricultural sector has failed to keep up with rapid population growth, and Nigeria, once a large net exporter of food, now must import food. Following the signing of an IMF stand-by agreement in August 2000, Nigeria received a debt-restructuring deal from the Paris Club and a $1 billion credit from the IMF, both contingent on economic reforms. The agreement was allowed to expire by the IMF in November 2001, however, and Nigeria apparently received much less multilateral assistance than expected in 2002. Nonetheless, increases in foreign oil investment and oil production kept growth at 3% in 2002. The government lacks the strength to implement the market-oriented reforms urged by the IMF, such as modernization of the banking system; to curb inflation by blocking excessive wage demands; and to resolve regional disputes over the distribution of earnings from the oil industry. When the uncertainties in the global economy are added in, estimates of Nigeria's prospects for 2003 must have a wide margin of error.

But in the 19th and early 20th centuries, China was beset by civil unrest, major famines, military defeats, and foreign occupation. After World War II, the Communists under MAO Zedong established a dictatorship that, while ensuring China's sovereignty, imposed strict controls over everyday life and cost the lives of tens of millions of people. After 1978, his successor DENG Xiaoping gradually introduced market-oriented reforms and decentralized economic decision-making. Output quadrupled by 2000. Political controls remain tight while economic controls continue to be relaxed.

Whereas the system operates within a political framework of strict Communist control, the economic influence of non-state organizations and individual citizens has been steadily increasing. The authorities switched to a system of household and village responsibility in agriculture in place of the old collectivization, increased the authority of local officials and plant managers in industry, permitted a wide variety of small-scale enterprises in services and light manufacturing, and opened the economy to increased foreign trade and investment. The result has been a quadrupling of GDP since 1978. In 2003, with its 1.3 billion people but a GDP of just $5,000 per capita, China stood as the second-largest economy in the world after the US (measured on a purchasing power parity basis). Agriculture and industry have posted major gains, especially in coastal areas near Hong Kong and opposite Taiwan, where foreign investment has helped spur output of both domestic and export goods. The leadership, however, often has experienced - as a result of its hybrid system - the worst results of socialism (bureaucracy and lassitude) and of capitalism (windfall gains and growing income disparities). China thus has periodically backtracked, retightening central controls at intervals. The government has struggled to (a) collect revenues due from provinces, businesses, and individuals; (b) reduce corruption and other economic crimes; and (c) keep afloat the large state-owned enterprises, many of which had been shielded from competition by subsidies and had been losing the ability to pay full wages and pensions. From 80 to 120 million surplus rural workers are adrift between the villages and the cities, many subsisting through part-time low-paying jobs. Popular resistance, changes in central policy, and loss of authority by rural cadres have weakened China's population control program, which is essential to maintaining long-term growth in living standards. Another long-term threat to growth is the deterioration in the environment, notably air pollution, soil erosion, and the steady fall of the water table especially in the north. China continues to lose arable land because of erosion and economic development. Beijing says it will intensify efforts to stimulate growth through spending on infrastructure - such as water control and power grids - and poverty relief and through rural tax reform aimed at eliminating arbitrary local levies on farmers. Accession to the World Trade Organization helps strengthen China's ability to maintain strong growth rates but at the same time puts additional pressure on the hybrid system of strong political controls and growing market influences. China has benefited from a huge expansion in computer internet use. Foreign investment remains a strong element in China's remarkable economic growth.

Since World War II, the impressive growth of the manufacturing, mining, and service sectors has transformed the nation from a largely rural economy into one primarily industrial and urban. The 1989 US-Canada Free Trade Agreement (FTA) and the 1994 North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) (which includes Mexico) touched off a dramatic increase in trade and economic integration with the US. As a result of the close cross-border relationship, the economic sluggishness in the United States in 2001-02 had a negative impact on the Canadian economy. Real growth averaged nearly 3% during 1993-2000, but declined in 2001, with moderate recovery in 2002. Unemployment is up, with contraction in the manufacturing and natural resource sectors. Nevertheless, given its great natural resources, skilled labor force, and modern capital plant Canada enjoys solid economic prospects. Two shadows loom, the first being the continuing constitutional impasse between English- and French-speaking areas, which has been raising the specter of a split in the federation. Another long-term concern is the flow south to the US of professionals lured by higher pay, lower taxes, and the immense high-tech infrastructure. A key strength in the economy is the substantial trade surplus.

Although half of GDP is generated through the service sector, nearly two-thirds of Bangladeshis are employed in the agriculture sector, with rice as the single-most-important product. Major impediments to growth include frequent cyclones and floods, inefficient state-owned enterprises, inadequate port facilities, a rapidly growing labor force that cannot be absorbed by agriculture, delays in exploiting energy resources (natural gas), insufficient power supplies, and slow implementation of economic reforms. Economic reform is stalled in many instances by political infighting and corruption at all levels of government. Progress also has been blocked by opposition from the bureaucracy, public sector unions, and other vested interest groups. The BNP government, led by Prime Minister Khaleda ZIA, has the parliamentary strength to push through needed reforms, but the party's political will to do so has been lacking in key areas.

A catastrophic eruption in June 1997 closed the airports and seaports, causing further economic and social dislocation. Two-thirds of the 12,000 inhabitants fled the island. Some began to return in 1998, but lack of housing limited the number. The agriculture sector continued to be affected by the lack of suitable land for farming and the destruction of crops. Prospects for the economy depend largely on developments in relation to the volcano and on public sector construction activity. The UK has launched a three-year $122.8 million aid program to help reconstruct the economy. Half of the island is expected to remain uninhabitable for another decade.

Tourism to the island to escape North American winters first developed in Victorian times. Tourism continues to be important to the island's economy, although international business has overtaken it in recent years. Bermuda has developed into a highly successful offshore financial center. A referendum on independence was soundly defeated in 1995.

The effects of 11 September 2001 have had both positive and negative ramifications for Bermuda. On the positive side, a number of new reinsurance companies have located on the island, contributing to the expansion of an already robust international business sector. On the negative side, Bermuda's tourism industry - which derives over 80% of its visitors from the US - has been severely hit as American tourists have chosen not to travel. Tourism rebounded somewhat in 2002, but remains below the pre-11 September level. Most capital equipment and food must be imported. Bermuda's industrial sector is small, although construction continues to be important. Agriculture is limited, only 6% of the land being arable.

GX023-45-1966943	OMB COST ESTIMATE  FOR PAY-AS-YOU-GO    CALCULATIONS        Report No:  507   Date:  06/08/2000         1. LAW NUMBER: P.L.106-200 (H.R. 434)     2. BILL TITLE: Trade and Development Act of 2000             3. BILL PURPOSE:  Authorizes expanded trade benefits     to eligible sub-Saharan African and Caribbean Basin countries, authorizes permanent     normal trade relations status for Albania and Kyrgyzstan, and includes other     changes to U.S. trade laws.           4. OMB ESTIMATE:  P.L. 106-200 expands tariff preferences     to 48 sub-Saharan African and 27 Caribbean Basin countries. In addition, the     Act reduces tariffs for certain worsted wool fabric. OMB estimates that, in     total, these changes will reduce revenues by $505 million in 2001, and $3 billion     over the period 2001 through 2005. The Act also accelerates the rum excise tax     cover over payments to Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, which were delayed     in Public Law 106-170. This shifts $32 million in payments from 2001 to 2000.     Several other provisions also have small pay-as-you-go effects on outlays.

The island staunchly supported the UK through both World Wars and remained in the Commonwealth when it became independent in 1964. A decade later Malta became a republic. Since about the mid-1980s, the island has become a freight transshipment point, financial center, and tourist destination. It is an official candidate for EU membership.

Malta produces only about 20% of its food needs, has limited fresh water supplies, and has no domestic energy sources. The economy is dependent on foreign trade, manufacturing (especially electronics and textiles), and tourism. Malta is privatizing state-controlled firms and liberalizing markets in order to prepare for membership in the European Union. The island remains divided politically, however, over the question of joining the EU. Continued sluggishness in the global economy is holding back exports, tourism, and overall growth.

The planet's population continues to explode: from 1 billion in 1820, to 2 billion in 1930, 3 billion in 1960, 4 billion in 1974, 5 billion in 1988, and 6 billion in 2000. For the 21st century, the continued exponential growth in science and technology raises both hopes (e.g., advances in medicine) and fears (e.g., development of even more lethal weapons of war).

The causes: sluggishness in the US economy (21% of GWP) and in the 15 EU economies (19% of GWP); continued stagnation in the Japanese economy (7.2% of GWP); and spillover effects in the less developed regions of the world. China, the second-largest economy in the world (12% of GWP), proved an exception, continuing its rapid annual growth, officially announced as 8% but estimated by many observers as perhaps two percentage points lower. Russia (2.6% of GWP), with 4% growth, continued to make uneven progress, its GDP per capita still only one-third that of the leading industrial nations. The other 14 successor nations of the USSR and the other old Warsaw Pact nations again experienced widely divergent growth rates; the three Baltic nations continued as strong performers, in the 5% range of growth. The developing nations also varied in their growth results, with many countries facing population increases that erode gains in output. Externally, the nation-state, as a bedrock economic-political institution, is steadily losing control over international flows of people, goods, funds, and technology. Internally, the central government often finds its control over resources slipping as separatist regional movements - typically based on ethnicity - gain momentum, e.g., in many of the successor states of the former Soviet Union, in the former Yugoslavia, in India, in Indonesia, and in Canada. Externally, the central government is losing decision-making powers to international bodies. In Western Europe, governments face the difficult political problem of channeling resources away from welfare programs in order to increase investment and strengthen incentives to seek employment. The addition of 80 million people each year to an already overcrowded globe is exacerbating the problems of pollution, desertification, underemployment, epidemics, and famine. Because of their own internal problems and priorities, the industrialized countries devote insufficient resources to deal effectively with the poorer areas of the world, which, at least from the economic point of view, are becoming further marginalized. The introduction of the euro as the common currency of much of Western Europe in January 1999, while paving the way for an integrated economic powerhouse, poses economic risks because of varying levels of income and cultural and political differences among the participating nations. The terrorist attacks on the US on 11 September 2001 accentuate a further growing risk to global prosperity, illustrated, for example, by the reallocation of resources away from investment to anti-terrorist programs. The opening of war in March 2003 between a US-led coalition and Iraq added new uncertainties to global economic prospects.

Maritime states have claimed limits and have so far established over 130 maritime boundaries and joint development zones to allocate ocean resources and to provide for their national security at sea. On land, ethnicity, culture, race, religion, and language have divided states into separate political entities as much as history, physical terrain, political fiat, or conquest, resulting in sometimes arbitrary and imposed boundaries. All of these factors have contributed to a wide array of boundary, borderland, and territorial disagreements that vary in intensity from unresolved or dormant to outright war. Territorial disputes may evolve from historical and/or cultural animosities, or they may be brought on by resource competition. Ethnic clashes continue to be responsible for territorial fragmentation around the world. Undemarcated, indefinite, porous, and unmanaged boundaries encourage illegal cross-border activities, uncontrolled migration, and political confrontation over boundary allocations. Other sources of contention include the use of water and mineral (especially petroleum) resources, fisheries, dams, and nuclear power plants. Many islands or island groups are also disputed, including those at sea and in streams. Nonetheless, many nations are actively cooperating to clarify, delineate, and demarcate their international borders. The tragic aspect of international discord is the impact on the sustenance and welfare of populations caught in the conflict. It is frequently left to members of the world community to cope with enormous refugee situations, and the resultant hunger, disease, and impoverishment that they create.

In 1935, a short-lived attempt at colonization was begun on this island - as well as on nearby Howland Island - but was disrupted by World War II and thereafter abandoned.

The laying of the trans-Pacific cable, which passed through the islands, brought the first residents in 1903. Between 1935 and 1947, Midway was used as a refueling stop for trans-Pacific flights. The US naval victory over a Japanese fleet off Midway in 1942 was one of the turning points of World War II. The islands continued to serve as a naval station until closed in 1993. Today the islands are a national wildlife refuge. From 1996 to 2001 the refuge was open to the public. It is now temporarily closed.                                                                        Geography                  Midway Islands                                             Top of Page                                                              Location:                                                     Oceania, atoll in the North Pacific Ocean, about one-third of the way from Honolulu to Tokyo                               Geographic coordinates:                                                                28 13 N, 177 22 W                               Map references:                                                                    Oceania                                 Area:                                                                                               total:  6.2 sq km      note:  includes Eastern Island, Sand Island, and Spit Island      water:  0 sq km      land:  6.2 sq km                               Area - comparative:                                                                about nine times the size of The Mall in Washington, DC                               Land boundaries:                                                                0 km                               Coastline:                                                                15 km                               Maritime claims:                                                                       exclusive economic zone:  200 NM      territorial sea:  12 NM                               Climate:                                                                subtropical, but moderated by prevailing easterly winds                               Terrain:                                                                low, nearly level                               Elevation extremes:                                                                       lowest point:  Pacific Ocean 0 m      highest point:  unnamed location 13 m                               Natural resources:                                                                wildlife, terrestrial and aquatic                               Land use:                                                                       arable land:  0%      permanent crops:  0%      other:  100% (1998 est.)

An estimated 350,000 tourists, mainly from the US, visited the islands in 1998. Tourism suffered in 2002 because of the lackluster US economy. In the mid-1980s, the government began offering offshore registration to companies wishing to incorporate in the islands, and incorporation fees now generate substantial revenues. Roughly 400,000 companies were on the offshore registry by yearend 2000. The adoption of a comprehensive insurance law in late 1994, which provides a blanket of confidentiality with regulated statutory gateways for investigation of criminal offenses, is expected to make the British Virgin Islands even more attractive to international business. Livestock raising is the most important agricultural activity; poor soils limit the islands' ability to meet domestic food requirements. Because of traditionally close links with the US Virgin Islands, the British Virgin Islands has used the dollar as its currency since 1959.

Deteriorating economic conditions during the 1970s led to recurrent violence and a dropoff in tourism. Elections in 1980 saw the democratic socialists voted out of office. Subsequent governments have been open market oriented. Political violence marred elections during the 1990s.                                                                        Geography                  Jamaica                                             Top of Page                                                              Location:                                                     Caribbean, island in the Caribbean Sea, south of Cuba                               Geographic coordinates:                                                                18 15 N, 77 30 W                               Map references:                                                                    Central America and the Caribbean                                 Area:                                                                                               total:  10,991 sq km      land:  10,831 sq km      water:  160 sq km                               Area - comparative:                                                                slightly smaller than Connecticut                               Land boundaries:                                                                0 km                               Coastline:                                                                1,022 km                               Maritime claims:                                                                measured from claimed archipelagic baselines      exclusive economic zone:  200 NM      territorial sea:  12 NM      continental shelf:  200 NM or to edge of the continental margin      contiguous zone:  24 NM                               Climate:                                                                tropical; hot, humid; temperate interior                               Terrain:                                                                mostly mountains, with narrow, discontinuous coastal plain                               Elevation extremes:                                                                       lowest point:  Caribbean Sea 0 m      highest point:  Blue Mountain Peak 2,256 m                               Natural resources:                                                                bauxite, gypsum, limestone                               Land use:                                                                       arable land:  16.07%      permanent crops:  9.23%      other:  74.7% (1998 est.)

After five years of recession, the economy inched ahead, by 0.8% in 2000, 1.7% in 2001, and 0.8% in 2002; the global economic slowdown, particularly in the United States after the 11 September 2001 terrorist attacks, has stunted the economic recovery. Serious problems include: high interest rates; increased foreign competition; a pressured, sometimes sliding, exchange rate; a widening merchandise trade deficit; and a growing internal debt, the result of government bailouts to various ailing sectors of the economy, particularly the financial sector. Depressed economic conditions have led to increased civil unrest, including serious violent crime. Jamaica's medium-term prospects will depend upon encouraging investment and tourism, maintaining a competitive exchange rate, selling off reacquired firms, and implementing proper fiscal and monetary policies.

The president faces the daunting task of rebuilding a petroleum-based economy, whose revenues have been squandered through corruption and mismanagement, and institutionalizing democracy. In addition, the OBASANJO administration must defuse longstanding ethnic and religious tensions, if it is to build a sound foundation for economic growth and political stability.

Nigeria's former military rulers failed to diversify the economy away from overdependence on the capital-intensive oil sector, which provides 20% of GDP, 95% of foreign exchange earnings, and about 65% of budgetary revenues. The largely subsistence agricultural sector has failed to keep up with rapid population growth, and Nigeria, once a large net exporter of food, now must import food. Following the signing of an IMF stand-by agreement in August 2000, Nigeria received a debt-restructuring deal from the Paris Club and a $1 billion credit from the IMF, both contingent on economic reforms. The agreement was allowed to expire by the IMF in November 2001, however, and Nigeria apparently received much less multilateral assistance than expected in 2002. Nonetheless, increases in foreign oil investment and oil production kept growth at 3% in 2002. The government lacks the strength to implement the market-oriented reforms urged by the IMF, such as modernization of the banking system; to curb inflation by blocking excessive wage demands; and to resolve regional disputes over the distribution of earnings from the oil industry. When the uncertainties in the global economy are added in, estimates of Nigeria's prospects for 2003 must have a wide margin of error.

Although half of GDP is generated through the service sector, nearly two-thirds of Bangladeshis are employed in the agriculture sector, with rice as the single-most-important product. Major impediments to growth include frequent cyclones and floods, inefficient state-owned enterprises, inadequate port facilities, a rapidly growing labor force that cannot be absorbed by agriculture, delays in exploiting energy resources (natural gas), insufficient power supplies, and slow implementation of economic reforms. Economic reform is stalled in many instances by political infighting and corruption at all levels of government. Progress also has been blocked by opposition from the bureaucracy, public sector unions, and other vested interest groups. The BNP government, led by Prime Minister Khaleda ZIA, has the parliamentary strength to push through needed reforms, but the party's political will to do so has been lacking in key areas.

The economy is predominately agricultural, with about 90% of the population living in rural areas. Agriculture accounted for nearly 40% of GDP and 88% of export revenues in 2001. The economy depends on substantial inflows of economic assistance from the IMF, the World Bank, and individual donor nations. In late 2000, Malawi was approved for relief under the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) program. In November 2002 the World Bank approved a $50 million drought recovery package, which is to be used for famine relief. The government faces strong challenges, e.g., to fully develop a market economy, to improve educational facilities, to face up to environmental problems, to deal with the rapidly growing problem of HIV/AIDS, and to satisfy foreign donors that fiscal discipline is being tightened. The performance of the tobacco sector is key to short-term growth as tobacco accounts for over 50% of exports.
