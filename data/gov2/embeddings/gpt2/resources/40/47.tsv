(a) By no later                  than October 1, 2000, Federal agencies shall implement                  a transportation fringe benefit program that offers                  qualified Federal employees the option to exclude from                  taxable wages and compensation, consistent with section                  132 of title 26, United States Code, employee commuting                  costs incurred through the use of mass transportation                  and vanpools, not to exceed the maximum level allowed                  by law (26 U.S.C. 132 (f)(2)). These agency programs                  shall comply with the requirements of Internal Revenue                  Service regulations for qualified transportation fringe                  benefits under section 1.132-9 of title 26, Code of                  Federal Regulations, and other guidance.                      (b) Federal agencies are encouraged to use any                  nonmonetary incentive that the agencies may otherwise                  offer under any other provision of law or other                  authority to encourage mass transportation and vanpool                  use, as provided for in section 7905(b)(2)(C) of title                  5, United States Code.                  Sec. 2. Federal Agencies in the National Capital                  Region. Federal agencies in the National Capital Region                  shall implement a ``transit pass'' transportation                  fringe benefit program for their qualified Federal                  employees by no later than October 1, 2000. Under this                  program, agencies shall provide their qualified Federal                  employees, in addition to current compensation, transit                  passes as defined in section 132(f)(5) of title 26,                  United States Code, in amounts approximately equal to                  employee commuting costs, not to exceed the maximum                  level allowed by law (26 U.S.C. 132(f)(2)). The                  National Capital Region is defined as the District of                  Columbia; Montgomery, Prince George's, and Frederick                  Counties in Maryland; Arlington, Fairfax, Loudon, and                  Prince William Counties in Virginia; and all cities now                  or hereafter existing in Maryland or Virginia within                  the geographic area bounded by the outer boundaries of                  the combined area of said counties.                  Sec. 3. Nationwide Pilot Program. The Department of                  Transportation, the Environmental Protection Agency,                  and the Department of Energy shall implement a                  ``transit pass'' transportation fringe benefit program,                  as described in section 2 of this order, for all of                  their qualified Federal employees as a 3 year pilot                  program by no later than October 1, 2000. Before                  determining whether the program should be extended to                  other Federal employees nationwide, it shall be                  analyzed by an entity determined by the agencies                  identified in section 4 of this order to ascertain,                  among other things, if it is effective in reducing                  single occupancy vehicle travel and local area traffic                  congestion.                  Sec. 4. Guidance. Federal agencies shall develop plans                  to implement this order in consultation with the                  Department of the Treasury, the Department of                  Transportation, the Environmental Protection Agency,                  the Office of Personnel Management, the General                  Services Administration, and the Office of Management                  and Budget. Federal agencies that currently have more                  generous programs or benefits in place may continue to                  offer those programs  [[Page 24614]]                  or benefits. Agencies shall absorb the costs of                  implementing this order within the sums received                  pursuant to the President's FY 2001 budget request to                  the Congress.                  Sec. 5. Judicial Review. This order is not intended to                  and does not create any right or benefit, substantive                  or procedural, enforceable at law by any party against                  the United States, its agencies or instrumentalities,                  its officers or employees, or any other person.

Joseph Callan /s/ Executive Director for Operations        SUBJECT:   CHANGES TO THE FINANCIAL PROTECTION REQUIREMENTS FOR PERMANENTLY SHUTDOWN NUCLEAR POWER REACTORS, 10 CFR 50.54(w) AND 10 CFR 140.11     PURPOSE:   To request Commission approval to issue a proposed rule that would amend financial protection requirements for permanently shutdown nuclear power reactors.    CATEGORY:    This paper covers a major policy question requiring Commission consideration.    BACKGROUND:    This proposed rulemaking is consistent with an SRM dated January 28, 1997, in which the Commission approved a staff recommendation in SECY-96-256 to implement Option 2 for making changes to the financial protection requirements in 10 CFR 50.54(w) and 10 CFR 140.11 for permanently shutdown nuclear power reactors.    DISCUSSION:    The proposed rule would specify appropriate levels of liability coverage that would be required of licensees that meet specified reactor configurations during permanent shutdown. This would allow nuclear reactor licensees a reduction in onsite and offsite liability coverage during permanent shutdown without resorting to the exemption process.    The proposed rule does not address the financial protection requirements for Independent Spent Fuel Storage Installations (ISFSIs). This subject will be addressed after efforts dealing with technical and licensing issues for ISFSIs are resolved in areas of safeguards requirements, emergency planning, and potential fuel storage handling activities.    COORDINATION:    The Office of the General Counsel has no legal objection to the proposed rulemaking. The Office of the Chief Financial Officer has no resource-related objection to this rulemaking. The Office of the Chief Information Officer concurs that there will be no information technology impacts.    RECOMMENDATION:    That the Commission:    1. Approve for publication in the Federal Register the proposed amendments    to 10 CFR Part 50.54(w) and 10 CFR 140.11 on financial protection requirements    for permanently shutdown nuclear power reactors ( Attachment 1 ).    2. Note:    a. That the proposed amendments will be published in the Federal Register allowing 75 days for public comment.    b. That the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business Administration will be informed of the certification and the reasons for it, as required by the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 605(b).    c. That a regulatory analysis has been prepared for this rulemaking ( Attachment 2 ).    d. That an Environmental Assessment has been prepared for this rulemaking ( Attachment    3 ).    e. The appropriate Congressional committees will be informed of this action    ( Attachment 4 ).    f. That a public announcement will be issued by the Office of Public Affairs    when the proposed rulemaking is filed with the Office of the Federal Register    ( Attachment 5 ).    g. That resources to complete and implement this rulemaking are included in the current budget.    L. Joseph Callan  Executive Director   for Operations    Attachments: As stated (5)      [7590-01-P]    NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION    10 CFR Parts 50 and 140    RIN 3150-AF79    Financial Protection Requirements for    Permanently Shutdown Nuclear Power Reactors          AGENCY:   Nuclear Regulatory Commission.        ACTION:   Proposed rule.        SUMMARY: The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is proposing to amend its regulations to allow nuclear reactor licensees to reduce onsite and offsite liability coverage during permanent shutdown of the reactors if they meet specified reactor configurations. This proposed amendment would reduce the level of insurance coverage commensurate with the risk reduction after the appropriate spent fuel cooling period following permanent shutdown of the reactor.    DATES: The comment period expires (75 days after publication).

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:    Background    The current regulations governing insurance coverage for nuclear power reactors are contained in 10 CFR 50.54(w) and 10 CFR 140.11. These regulations do not take into consideration the reduced risk associated with permanently shutdown plants. The exemption process allows reduced insurance coverage for these plants.    Consideration of whether financial protection coverage should be reduced for permanently shutdown plants must take into account the preservation of the solvency of the organization responsible for maintaining and decommissioning these facilities in the unlikely event of a nuclear incident. In addition, consideration would be given to timely payment for valid damage claims by members of the public and minimization of the likelihood that Federal Government indemnity would be exercised for satisfaction of claims for damages.    The regulations in 10 CFR 140.11 require that the licensees of facilities designed to produce substantial amounts of electricity, a rated capacity of 100,000 kWe or more, must have and maintain a primary insurance coverage of $200 million from private sources to protect against offsite liability. In addition, licensees must maintain secondary financial protection in the form of private liability insurance available under an industry retrospective rating plan. The current maximum obligation for secondary financial protection for a licensee in this plan is $75.5 million with respect to any nuclear incident. Thus, the total financial protection for offsite liability for any incident would be the primary layer of $200 million, plus the secondary layer of $75.5 million multiplied by the number of licensed power reactors with a rated capacity of 100,000 kWe or higher.    Under 10 CFR 50.54(w), power reactor licensees must obtain insurance coverage from private sources to provide protection against onsite damage in the event of an accident. These monies would allow the licensee to stabilize and decontaminate the reactor and reactor station site in the event of an accident. The minimum amount of insurance coverage is the lesser of $1.06 billion or the maximum amount of insurance generally available from private sources.    This proposed rule is part of the NRC effort to eliminate unnecessary regulatory burdens for power reactor facilities that are permanently shutdown and in the process of decommissioning. This would complement other amendments for decommissioning, such as the final rule that was published in the Federal Register (61 FR 39278) on July 29, 1996, which clarified the procedures leading to permanent shutdown and, eventually, to the termination of an operating license for nuclear power reactors.    This proposed rule would also address a petition for rulemaking (PRM-50-57) submitted by the North Carolina Public Staff Utilities Commission. The petition requested reduction or, preferably, elimination of the $1.06 billion of insurance for onsite reactor stabilization and accident decontamination that is required by 10 CFR 50.54(w) when all nuclear fuel has been removed from the site. The petitioner also requested that the offsite primary and secondary liability coverages required under 10 CFR 140.11(a)(4) be reduced or, preferably, eliminated for shutdown reactors when no nuclear fuel is on the reactor site.    The proposed rule does not address the financial protection requirements for Independent Spent Fuel Storage Installations (ISFSIs). This subject will be addressed after efforts dealing with technical and licensing issues for ISFSIs are resolved in areas of safeguards requirements, emergency planning, and potential fuel storage handling activities.    Discussion    Several different configurations for permanently shutdown reactors are being established that encompass anticipated spent fuel characteristics and storage modes during the period between permanent shutdown and termination of the license. They are as follows:    Reactor Configuration 1: The reactor is defueled, permanently shutdown, and spent fuel in the spent fuel pool is susceptible to a zircaloy cladding fire if the spent fuel pool is drained accidentally. This configuration encompasses the period from immediately after the core is offloaded to just before the decay heat of the hottest assemblies is low enough that no rapid zircaloy oxidation will take place, and the fuel cladding will remain intact with no gap release if water in the spent fuel pool is lost.    Reactor Configuration 2: The reactor is defueled, permanently shutdown, and spent fuel is in the spent fuel pool but is not susceptible to a zircaloy cladding fire or gap release caused by an incipient fuel cladding failure in the event the spent fuel pool is drained accidentally. In this configuration, the spent fuel can be stored long-term in the spent fuel pool without the possibility of initiating a zircaloy fire or significant fuel cladding failure. In addition, the site may contain a radioactive inventory of liquid radwaste, activated reactor components, and contaminated structural materials. The radioactive inventory during this configuration may change depending on the licensee's proposed shutdown activities and schedule.    Reactor Configuration 3: The reactor is permanently shutdown and no spent fuel is in the reactor or the spent fuel pool. All spent fuel has been removed to an offsite or onsite dry storage independent spent fuel storage installation (ISFSI) or to a DOE high-level repository. The remaining radioactive inventory depends on the decommissioning status and may include liquid radwaste, activated reactor components, and contaminated structural materials.    Reactor Configuration 4: Same as reactor configuration 3, except the reactor site has no significant mobile sources of radioactivity such as contaminated liquids (less than 1000 gallons).    There are potential onsite and offsite radiological consequences that could be associated with the onsite storage of the spent fuel in the spent fuel pool for some time after permanent shutdown. In Reactor Configuration 1, in the event of a complete loss of spent fuel pool coolant inventory such as from a beyond-design-basis earthquake scenario, there is a potential for overheating the fuel by decay heat. This sequence could result in a zircaloy cladding fire that may have significant onsite and offsite consequences.    To prevent fuel rod cladding failure leading to a zircaloy-cladding fire if all spent fuel pool water is lost, the rod cladding temperature must not exceed 565 0 C. The rod cladding temperature is an important factor that must be considered in modifying the financial protection requirements for permanently shutdown reactors.    In Reactor Configuration 2, the spent fuel has decay heat sufficiently low that the cladding will remain intact even if all spent fuel pool water is lost. However, if there are significant sources of radioactive material stored onsite, it would be appropriate to maintain an adequate level of onsite insurance coverage. Although the offsite consequences are negligible in the Reactor Configuration 2 , because the spent fuel pool is operational and an inventory of radioactive materials exists onsite, an appropriate level of offsite financial protection is required to account for the potential for significant judgments or settlements from litigation that might be instituted and to protect the Federal government from indemnity claims.    In Reactor Configuration 3, when spent fuel is no longer stored in the spent fuel pool, the potential for a radiological incident is primarily in mobile sources of radioactivity onsite at permanently shutdown nuclear reactors. The offsite cleanup costs were found to be negligible for Reactor Configuration 3, but as was noted in Reactor Configuration 2, an appropriate level of offsite financial protection is still required to account for the potential for significant judgments or settlements from litigation that might be instituted and also to protect the Federal government from indemnity claims. Because the level of risk has decreased vis-a-vis the Reactor Configuration 2 by having no spent fuel in the spent fuel pool, the level of offsite financial protection required is being reduced by taking into account only the mobile radioactive inventory onsite.    In the Reactor Configuration 4, with no significant amount of mobile sources of radioactivity such as contaminated liquids onsite, there is no need to maintain the same level of insurance coverage for onsite or offsite financial protection as in Reactor Configuration 3. The basis for the transition from Reactor Configuration 3 to Reactor Configuration 4 is the point at which there is less than 1000 gallons of liquid radwaste stored onsite. A limiting value of 1000 gallons has been considered because it constitutes approximately a factor of 500 reduction in volume from the large volume tank used as the basis for the Reactor Configuration 3 limiting event.    In Reactor Configuration 4, if the licensee has cleaned the site to unrestricted release levels and is awaiting a confirmatory survey for terminating the license, the necessary level of onsite insurance coverage at this stage would be less than when 1000 gallons of liquid radwaste were stored onsite. Under these circumstances, the onsite coverage could be further reduced or eliminated to account for negligible onsite consequences. However, for offsite financial protection requirements, although the offsite consequences are negligible, some level of public liability financial protection must be maintained as long as there remains in effect a nuclear reactor license issued pursuant to 10 CFR Part 50 under the authority of Section 103 or 104 of the Atomic Energy Act (42 U.S.C. 2133, 2134). See Section 170a of that Act (42 U.S.C. 2210a). Section 170 is commonly referred to as the ""Price-Anderson Act.""    Proposed Regulatory Action    The proposed amendments would adjust the onsite insurance coverage requirements and the offsite financial protection requirements for permanently shutdown reactors based on limiting the spent fuel cladding temperatures for accidents involving loss of spent fuel pool water and the amount of onsite radioactive inventory such as liquid radwaste in post shutdown modes. The insurance amounts are based on the estimated cost of recovery from limiting hypothetical events for specific reactor configurations.    The proposed amendments would also address ""rated capacity"" in 10 CFR 140.11 as used in Section 170a of the Atomic Energy Act to indicate that a permanently shutdown nuclear reactor has a ""rated capacity"" of zero.    The proposed financial protection requirements are as follows.    Reactor Configuration 1 - Fuel in spent fuel pool not sufficiently cool.        The requirements for onsite insurance coverage and offsite financial protection remain as presently specified in 10 CFR 50.54(w) and 10 CFR 140.11, respectively.      Reactor Configuration 2 - Fuel could tolerate a complete loss of water in the spent fuel pool.        The onsite insurance coverage requirement is $50 million. The amount of $50 million is to recover from a postulated accident in the spent fuel pool.          The offsite financial protection requirement is $100 million, based on the potential for significant judgments or settlements resulting from litigation despite negligible offsite consequences.      Reactor Configuration 3 - No fuel in spent fuel pool, risk dependent on radioactive inventory at plant site in decommissioning status.        The onsite insurance coverage requirement is $50 million. The amount of $50 million is the estimated amount needed to recover from a postulated onsite event of a rupture of a large slightly contaminated liquid storage tank.          The offsite financial protection requirement is $50 million, based on the potential for significant judgments or settlements resulting from litigation that might still be instituted despite negligible offsite consequences; however the liability risk is considered less than in Reactor Configuration 2.      Reactor Configuration 4 - No fuel in the spent fuel pool and no significant source of mobile radioactive material.        The onsite insurance coverage requirements is either $25 million or is eliminated. The amount of $25 million is based on the possibility of having to clean up onsite contamination from an accidental rupture of a less-than-1000-gallon contaminated liquid storage tank during shutdown activities. Elimination of onsite insurance coverage would be warranted when a licensee is awaiting a confirmatory survey for license termination.          The offsite financial protection requirement is $25 million, based on the potential for claims arising from asserted offsite consequences. This would minimize the possibility that Federal Government indemnification would be required. As noted above, the Atomic Energy Act does not allow a 10 CFR Part 50 licensee to drop this coverage entirely, only to reduce it.      Discussion    This proposed rule would allow power reactor licensees to reduce their onsite insurance coverage and offsite financial protection requirements during permanent shutdown without resorting to the exemption process. The level of financial protection would be determined for permanently shutdown reactors at a level that coincides with their actual configuration stage.    During Reactor Configuration 1, licensees would be required to maintain onsite insurance coverage and offsite financial protection at the levels currently required by 10 CFR 50.54(w) and 10 CFR 140.11, respectively. This is because the radiological consequences during this stage of permanent shutdown approximate the magnitude of a severe core damage accident.    After allowing the spent fuel to cool down to the point that the maximum spent fuel cladding temperature will not exceed 565 0 C in the event of a loss of water in the spent fuel pool (Reactor Configuration 2), power reactor licensees would be allowed under 10 CFR 50.54(w) to reduce their onsite insurance coverage from $1.06 billion to $50 million. The reason for this reduction in insurance coverage is that the rapid clad oxidation event of Reactor Configuration 1 is not possible. Insurance coverage requirements for Reactor Configuration 2 are based on the fact that there is a possibility for a fuel handling accident in the spent fuel pool, and significant amounts of mobile radioactive sources remain onsite that have a potential for release during this period. The $50 million coverage would be adequate to clean up the site in the event of a fuel handling accident, an accidental release of cooling water from the spent fuel pool, or a rupture of a large slightly contaminated liquid storage tank.    The proposed insurance coverage requirement for Reactor Configuration 2 does not take into account the reduction in radioactive decay of the spent fuel assemblies with the passage of time during that period. The insurance coverage requirements are based on the conservative assumption of a fuel handling accident shortly after the transition to Reactor Configuration 2. Adjusting insurance requirements during Reactor Configuration 2 based on the decay level of the spent fuel would be burdensome from a regulatory standpoint, as opposed to selecting a bounding figure to encompass any unexpected events concerning the spent fuel pool.    In Reactor Configuration 2, the offsite financial protection requirements set forth in 10 CFR 140.11 would be reduced from $200 million to $100 million for the primary liability coverage, and the licensee would be allowed to withdraw from the secondary liability coverage under Price-Anderson.    In Reactor Configuration 3, when all the spent fuel has been removed to an onsite or offsite dry storage ISFSI or to a DOE high-level repository and the onsite radioactive inventory is greater than 1000 gallons, the onsite insurance coverage requirements would be $50 million under the proposed 10 CFR 50.54(w). This amount is based on the fact that there are still mobile radioactive sources onsite that have the potential to contaminate the site. The maximum cleanup costs associated with Reactor Configuration 3 are estimated at approximately $50 million. The conservative limiting event is the rupture of a large contaminated liquid storage tank that causes soil contamination and the potential to contaminate groundwater. The offsite financial protection requirements under the proposed Section 140.11 would be reduced from $100 million to $50 million, and the licensee would not be required to maintain secondary liability coverage under the Price-Anderson Act for Reactor Configuration 3. With no spent fuel in the spent fuel pool, the risks of offsite contamination have been reduced considerably for this configuration.    In Reactor Configuration 4, there are no significant mobile sources of radioactivity, such as liquid contaminants, onsite. Thus, the potential for onsite and offsite radiological impacts is limited. In this situation, onsite insurance coverage requirements either would be $25 million or would be completely eliminated under the proposed 10 CFR 50.54(w). The amount in each case would be based on information provided by the licensee and evaluated by the staff for the particular circumstances of the shutdown reactor. The $25 million onsite insurance coverage would be required if liquid radwaste remained stored onsite, usually 1,000 gallons or less of radwaste, that may be susceptible to an accidental spill and the consequent need for cleanup of the contaminated site. Elimination of required onsite insurance coverage would be based on the licensee's submittal of its terminal radiation survey to the NRC stating that the site has been cleaned to unrestricted release levels and is awaiting a confirmatory survey for termination of the license. In either case, the onsite and offsite consequences would be negligible.    In Reactor Configuration 4, the required offsite financial protection would be reduced to $25 million to account for the continuing potential for claims based on asserted offsite consequences. A minimum of $25 million in coverage would minimize the possibility that Federal Government indemnification would be required and would be consistent with the requirements of Section 170 of the Atomic Energy Act that power reactor licensees maintain some level of public liability financial protection. The licensee would not be required to maintain secondary liability coverage under Price-Anderson for Reactor Configuration 4.    In addition, ""rated capacity"" would be addressed in 10 CFR Part 140 to indicate that permanently shutdown nuclear power plants have ""zero"" rated capacity. The effect of this amendment would be to allow the NRC to permit reduction of the primary liability coverage and elimination of the requirement for participation in the secondary liability coverage for nuclear power plants that had made the certifications under 10 CFR 50.82(a)(1)(i) and (ii). However, for reasons stated above, the NRC does not propose to permit this reduction and withdrawal until a reactor has entered the Reactor Configuration 2. At that point the NRC proposes that the reactor no longer be subject to the requirements to maintain primary financial protection in the ""maximum amount available at reasonable cost and on reasonable terms from private sources"" or to participate in the secondary financial protection public liability system under Section 170 of the Atomic Energy Act. The Commission has already approved, in response to site-specific requests, these adjustments in the primary and secondary public liability insurance regime, and this clarification in Part 140, as requested by the Commission, places into the Commission's regulations a statement that a permanently shutdown nuclear power plant is no longer considered to have any ""rated capacity.""    The petition for rulemaking submitted by the North Carolina Public Staff Utilities Commission would be substantially granted in that the insurance requirements would be significantly reduced, as requested. However, the petition could not be been fully granted because of the Price-Anderson statutory provisions that do not allow licensees who continue to hold 10 CFR Part 50 licenses to drop the offsite public liability coverage entirely.    Finding of No Significant Environmental Impact: Availability    The Commission has determined under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, as amended, and the Commission's regulations in Subpart A of 10 CFR Part 51, that this rule, if adopted, would not be a major Federal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment, and therefore, an environmental impact statement is not required. The proposed rule change would allow licensees to seek reductions in onsite and offsite insurance coverage following permanent shutdown if they meet specified reactor configurations because of the reduced risk associated with permanently shutdown reactors. The proposed rule change would require no changes in hardware, procedures, organization, or operation of nuclear power reactors. It would not affect the safety requirements for nuclear power reactors because of the significantly reduced risks to the public health and safety in Reactor Configurations 2, 3, and 4 and it would not affect the likelihood, magnitude, or consequences of accidents at the permanently shutdown nuclear power reactors. Although the proposed rule change would reduce the level of financial protection available to pay for environmental or other consequences that may result from accidents at permanently shutdown nuclear power reactors, the Commission considers the reduced required insurance and financial protection coverage to be fully adequate and commensurate with the reduced consequences of potential accidents at permanently shutdown nuclear reactors and that the environment will not be negatively affected. Accordingly, the Commission has determined that the proposed rulemaking would have no significant impacts on the quality of the environment.    The environmental assessment and finding of no significant impact on which this determination is based are available for inspection at the NRC Public Document Room, 2120 L Street NW. (Lower Level), Washington, DC. Single copies of the environmental assessment and the finding of no significant impact are available from George Mencinsky, Office of Nuclear Regulatory Research, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555-0001, telephone (301) 415-6206.    Paperwork Reduction Act Statement    This proposed rule does not contain a new or amended information collection requirement subject to the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.). Existing requirements were approved by the Office of Management and Budget, approval numbers 3150-0011.    Public Protection Notification    The NRC may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required to respond to, an information collection unless it displays a currently valid OMB control number.    Regulatory Analysis    The Commission has prepared a draft regulatory analysis on this proposed regulation. The analysis examines the costs and benefits of the alternatives considered by the Commission. The draft analysis is available for inspection in the NRC Public Document Room, 2120 L Street NW. (Lower Level), Washington, DC. Single copies of the draft analysis may be obtained from George Mencinsky, Office of Nuclear Regulatory Research, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555-0001, telephone (301) 415-6206.    The Commission requests public comment on the draft regulatory analysis. Comments on the draft analysis may be submitted to the NRC as indicated under the ADDRESSES heading.    Regulatory Flexibility Certification    As required by the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (5 U.S.C. 605(b)), the Commission certifies that this rule, if adopted, will not have a significant economic impact upon a substantial number of small entities. The proposed rule only affects NRC power reactor licensees, which are not ""small entities.""    Backfit Analysis    The NRC has determined that the backfit rule, 10 CFR 50.109, does not apply to this proposed rule because the backfit rule is limited in scope to construction and operation of nuclear reactors. This rule would only apply to reactors that have permanently ceased operations. Therefore, a backfit analysis is not required because these amendments do not involve any provisions that would impose backfits as defined in 10 CFR 50.109(a)(1).

Regulatory Analysis for Rulemaking    on    Financial Protection Requirements for    Permanently Shutdown Nuclear Power Reactors    1. INTRODUCTION    NRC has issued a Rulemaking Plan for amending its current financial protection requirements for permanently shutdown (PSD) nuclear power reactors. (1)  This Plan complements other amendments for decommissioning, published in the  Federal Register  (61  FR  39278) on July 29, 1996, clarifying the procedures that lead to permanent shutdown and eventually to the termination of an operating license for nuclear power reactors. Under that rule, ""permanent shutdown"" would become a codified status of a reactor when a licensee has certified that all fuel has been removed from the reactor core and that it has permanently ceased power operations.    NRC's Rulemaking Plan responds to NRC's experience in implementing the current financial protection requirements for PSD reactors. To date, five PSD reactor licensees have requested and been granted exemptions reducing their coverage under these requirements. The staff believes that the factors supporting these five exemptions including, in particular, the reduced risk associated with PSD reactors, are applicable to PSD reactors on a more generic basis. (2)    With regard to the issue of financial protection requirements for PSD nuclear power reactors, NRC is currently studying several regulatory options. This document presents NRC's Regulatory Analysis of these options.    1.1 Statement of the Problem and Objective of the Rulemaking    NRC has determined that there is a need to modify its existing regulations for insurance coverage and financial protection requirements for nuclear power reactors. These regulations currently specify the same on-site and off-site financial protection requirements regardless of whether a power reactor is permanently shutdown or operating, and thus do not take into consideration the reduced risk associated with PSD plants. Rather, reduced insurance coverage for these plants has traditionally been allowed on a case-by-case basis through the exemption process. In addition, the existing requirements for off-site financial protection apply to power reactors with a specified ""rated capacity"" in terms of electrical kilowatts but do not account for the fact that PSD reactors no longer operate at any rated capacity.    The primary objective of the current rulemaking is to eliminate unnecessary regulatory burdens for power reactor facilities that are permanently shutdown and in the process of decommissioning. To accomplish this objective, NRC is proposing to allow licensees to reduce the level of required on-site and off-site liability coverage, without resorting to the exemption process, based on several different reactor configurations that encompass spent fuel characteristics and storage modes following permanent shutdown. NRC is also proposing to modify use of the term ""rated capacity"" to address indemnity for permanently shutdown plants.    1.2 Current Financial Protection Requirements for Permanently Shutdown Nuclear Power Reactors    NRC's current requirements pertaining to financial protection for PSD nuclear power reactors are contained in 10 CFR 50.54(w) and 10 CFR 140.11. Under 10 CFR 50.54(w), power reactor licensees must obtain insurance coverage from private sources to provide protection against  on-site  damage in the event of an accident. Specifically, licensees must obtain insurance having    "". . . a minimum coverage limit for each reactor station site of either $1.06 billion or whatever amount of insurance is generally available from private sources, whichever is less.""    In the event of an accident, the proceeds from this insurance must be used first to stabilize the reactor and then to decontaminate the reactor and reactor station site.    According to 10 CFR 140.11, licensees of facilities designed to produce substantial amounts of electricity (i.e., those with a rated capacity of 100,000 kWe or more) must have and maintain two levels of financial protection against off-site liability:    (1)  Primary insurance coverage  of $200 million from private sources; and    (2)  Secondary financial protection  in the form of private liability insurance available under an industry retrospective rating plan.    The current maximum obligation for secondary financial protection for a licensee in the industry retrospective rating plan is $75.5 million with respect to any nuclear incident. In total, the financial protection for off-site liability for any incident equals the primary layer of $200 million plus the secondary layer of $75.5 million multiplied by the number of licensed power reactors with a rated capacity of 100,000 kWe or higher. This coverage currently amounts to approximately $8 billion.    2. IDENTIFICATION AND PRELIMINARY ANALYSIS OF ALTERNATIVE APPROACHES    The Rulemaking Plan for this rulemaking identified two specific options, in addition to a no-action alternative, to address the issues discussed in Section 1.1. These options are discussed below.    2.1 Option 1    Under Option 1, the no-action alternative, NRC would maintain on-site insurance coverage requirements and off-site financial protection requirements for permanently shutdown (PSD) nuclear power reactors as prescribed by 10 CFR 50.54(w) and 10 CFR 140.11. Power reactor licensees would continue to be required to maintain coverage at the levels specified in the regulations during permanent shutdown. For each power reactor, this would require  on-site  insurance coverage in the amount of $1.06 billion or, if that level of coverage is not available, the maximum amount that is generally available from private sources, and  off-site  liability coverage consisting of (1) a primary layer of $200 million and (2) a secondary layer of $75.5 million times the total number of licensed power reactors with a rated capacity at or above 100,000 kWe.    Under Option 1, PSD power reactor licensees would have the opportunity to request an exemption from the above requirements on a case-by-case basis if they believe that the above amount of financial coverage required of licensees would be more than necessary based on the level of perceived risk. A number of licensees already have used this process to obtain regulatory relief (see Table 2-1 below). While exemptions could continue to provide regulatory relief in the future, NRC believes that Option 1 would do so with less regulatory certainty than Options 2 and 3 discussed below. In addition, NRC believes that Option 1 may result in inconsistencies among licensees and would result in higher costs to both the licensee population and NRC because of the cost inefficiencies of dealing with the exemption issue on an individual plant basis.    Table 2-1 - Financial Protection Exemptions Currently in Effect at PSD Plants       Plant   On-Site Insurance Coverage ($million)   Primary Off-Site Financial Protection ($million)   Secondary Off-Site Financial Protection ($million)       Rancho Seco   50   100   0       LaCrosse   180   30.6   0       Yankee-Rowe   5   100   0       Humboldt Bay   63.2   50   0       Trojan   5   100   0        2.2 Option 2    Under this option, NRC would adjust the on-site insurance coverage requirements and the off-site financial protection requirements on a generic basis for PSD reactors. Adjusted coverage levels would be based on the spent fuel cladding temperatures that would result from accidents involving the loss of spent fuel pool water and the amount of liquid radioactive waste stored onsite in post-shutdown modes. Option 2 would allow power reactor licensees to reduce their insurance coverage and financial protection requirements during permanent shutdown without resorting to the exemption process. The insurance coverage requirements proposed under Option 2 are based on the estimated costs resulting from hypothetical events for four different reactor configurations (described below). These costs may include on-site costs of recovery (i.e., stabilization and decontamination) and claims by members of the public for off-site consequences from nuclear energy hazards. (3)    Option 2 would also modify 10 CFR 140.11 to indicate that a PSD nuclear power reactor has a rated capacity of zero. The effect of this modification would be that, once a shutdown reactor's spent fuel has cooled to the point where the spent fuel cladding temperature would not exceed 565C in the event of a loss of water from the spent fuel pool, the licensee would be allowed to (1) reduce its primary off-site financial protection level and (2) cease its participation in the secondary financial protection system under 10 CFR 140.11(a)(4). This rule change would not require licensees to carry the full primary and secondary insurance once the certification under §50.82 has been made for permanent cessation of operations and permanent removal of fuel from the reactor vessel.    As noted above, several different configurations for PSD reactors have been established that encompass anticipated spent fuel characteristics and storage modes following permanent shutdown. These configurations are discussed in the following sections, along with the levels of on-site and off-site coverage that Option 2 would require for each configuration. A key distinction between NRC's existing coverage levels and the coverage levels proposed under Option 2 (as well as Option 3) is that, whereas the existing requirements apply on a  per-site  basis, the proposed requirements would apply on a  per-reactor  basis.    2.2.1 Reactor Configuration 1    In reactor Configuration 1, the reactor is defueled and permanently shutdown, but spent fuel in the spent fuel pool is susceptible to a zircaloy cladding fire if the water in the pool is lost. This configuration encompasses the period commencing immediately after the offload of the core and ending just prior to when the decay heat of the hottest assemblies is low enough so that no rapid zircaloy oxidation would take place and the fuel cladding would remain intact in the event of loss of water from the spent fuel pool. NRC's preliminary analysis indicates that, in order to prevent fuel rod cladding failure leading to a zircaloy cladding fire given the loss of all spent fuel pool water, the resulting rod cladding temperature must not exceed 565C. NRC's analysis also estimates that, for typical reactors, the spent fuel would be sufficiently cool so as to prevent the cladding temperature from exceeding 565C in the event of a loss of all spent fuel pool water after a decay period of approximately 7 months for BWRs and approximately 17 months for PWRs. Once a sufficient cooling period for the spent fuel has elapsed after reactor shutdown, the potential zircaloy cladding fire sequence would no longer be a concern because, in an emergency situation, air would cool the spent fuel sufficiently to avoid zircaloy cladding combustion.    During reactor Configuration 1, licensees would be required to maintain on-site insurance coverage and off-site financial protection at the levels currently required by 10 CFR 50.54(w) and 10 CFR 140.11, respectively. This is because the radiological consequences during this stage of permanent shutdown approximate the magnitude of a severe core damage accident.    2.2.2 Reactor Configuration 2    In reactor Configuration 2, the reactor is defueled and permanently shutdown, and spent fuel is in the spent fuel pool but is not susceptible to a zircaloy cladding fire or gap release caused by an incipient fuel cladding failure in the event the pool is drained accidentally. In this configuration, the spent fuel can be stored on a long-term basis in the spent fuel pool without the possibility of initiating a zircaloy fire or significant fuel cladding failure. However, the possibility exists for a fuel handling accident in the spent fuel pool, and the site may contain a significantly large inventory of liquid radioactive waste, activated reactor components, and contaminated structural materials. The radioactive inventory during this configuration may change depending on the licensee's proposed shutdown activities and schedule.    During reactor Configuration 2, licensees would be allowed to reduce both their on-site and off-site financial protection coverage as long as there are no operating reactors on the site. Specifically, for a reactor in Configuration 2, licensees would be allowed to reduce their on-site insurance coverage to the minimum amount of $50 million to recover from a fuel handling accident or a release of cooling water from the spent fuel pool. Licensees would also be allowed to reduce their off-site financial protection to the amount of $100 million, based on the potential for significant judgments or settlements resulting from litigation and to protect the Federal government from indemnity claims. However, licensees would be allowed to withdraw from the secondary financial protection layer provided under the Price-Anderson Act.    The proposed insurance coverage requirements for reactor Configuration 2 do not allow for periodic adjustments to account for the reduction in radioactive decay of the spent fuel assemblies with the passage of time. Rather, the insurance coverage requirements are based on the conservative assumption of a fuel handling accident shortly after the transition from reactor Configuration 1 to reactor Configuration 2. NRC believes that adjusting the insurance requirements during reactor Configuration 2 based on the decay level of the spent fuel would be burdensome from a regulatory standpoint in comparison to selecting a bounding figure to encompass any unexpected events concerning the spent fuel pool.    2.2.3 Reactor Configuration 3    In reactor Configuration 3, the reactor is permanently shutdown and no spent fuel is in the reactor or the spent fuel pool. All spent fuel has been removed to an off-site or on-site dry storage ISFSI or to a DOE high-level repository. The remaining radioactive inventory depends on the decommissioning status and will include liquid radioactive waste, activated reactor components, and contaminated structural materials. For this configuration, the potential for a radiological incident is primarily focused on mobile sources of radioactivity onsite at permanently shutdown nuclear reactors.    For a reactor in Configuration 3, licensees would be allowed to reduce their on-site insurance coverage to the minimum amount of $50 million (the same level as in reactor Configuration 2), if there are no operating reactors on the site, to account for a rupture of a large (i.e., greater than 1,000 gallons), slightly-contaminated-liquid storage tank. Licensees would also be allowed to reduce their off-site financial protection to the amount of $50 million, based on the potential for significant judgments or settlements resulting from litigation and to protect the Federal government from indemnity claims. The off-site requirement is reduced from that required in reactor Configuration 2 because the liability risk is considered to be less in reactor Configuration 3. As in reactor Configuration 2, the secondary financial protection layer would no longer be required.    2.2.4 Reactor Configuration 4    In reactor Configuration 4, the reactor is permanently shutdown and no spent fuel is in the reactor or the spent fuel pool. All spent fuel has been removed to an off-site or on-site dry storage ISFSI or to a DOE high-level repository. Unlike reactor Configuration 3, however, the reactor site has only a small amount (i.e., less than 1,000 gallons) of mobile sources of radioactivity (e.g., contaminated liquids) onsite. Finally, reactor Configuration 4 also covers the period during which the licensee has cleaned the reactor site to unrestricted release levels and is awaiting a confirmatory survey for termination of the license.    For a reactor in Configuration 4, licensees would be allowed to reduce their on-site insurance coverage to the minimum amount of $25 million, if there are no operating reactors on the site, to account for a rupture of a less-than-1,000-gallon, slightly-contaminated-liquid storage tank. This on-site coverage for the reactor may be eliminated, however, when the licensee is awaiting a confirmatory survey for license termination. Licensees would also be allowed to reduce their off-site financial protection to the amount of $25 million, based on the potential for claims based upon asserted off-site consequences and to minimize the possibility that Federal indemnification would be required. As in reactor Configurations 2 and 3, however, the secondary financial protection layer would no longer be required.    2.3 Option 3    Under Option 3, licensees would be required to meet the same on-site insurance coverage requirements specified in Option 2 but would be allowed to reduce further their off-site financial protection requirements during permanent shutdown without resorting to the exemption process. Specifically, Option 3 sets a de minimis level of liability insurance for off-site coverage on the order of $5 million to $10 million for reactor Configurations 2, 3, and 4, as long as there are no operating reactors on the site. Although this de minimis level reflects the fact that off-site radiological consequences are likely to be small, it would provide the Federal government with a minimal threshold of protection to financial risk from public indemnity claims from actual or perceived consequences.    Option 3 essentially endorses eliminating off-site financial protection requirements for permanently shutdown reactors in reactor Configurations 2, 3, and 4, but maintains some required coverage to satisfy the legal requirements of the Price-Anderson Act. The Price-Anderson Act requires all Part 50 licensees to maintain some level of public liability financial protection coverage and requires the Federal government to assume responsibility for the liability claims that exceed that level of coverage. By reducing the off-site financial protection coverage under reactor Configurations 2, 3, and 4 to the $5 to $10 million range, licensees' insurance premiums would most likely be reduced, yielding a cost savings to licensees. However, on an expected value basis, Option 3 increases the likelihood that the Federal government would have to bear some of the financial risk associated with accidents. Furthermore, lowering the liability of licensees in the event of an accident could be problematic in terms of the public's perception.    3. ANALYSIS OF VALUES AND IMPACTS    This section examines the values and impacts expected to result from NRC's rulemaking, and is presented in three subsections. Section 3.1 identifies attributes that are expected to be affected by the rulemaking. Section 3.2 describes the analytical model used to quantify values and impacts. Finally, the proposal's effects on values and impacts are presented in Section 3.3.    3.1 Identification of Affected Attributes    This section identifies and describes the factors within the public and private sectors that the regulatory alternatives (discussed in Section 2) are expected to affect. These factors were classified as ""attributes,"" using the list of potential attributes provided by NRC in Chapter 5 of its  Regulatory Analysis Technical Evaluation Handbook . (4)  Each attribute listed in Chapter 5 was evaluated, and the basis for selecting those attributes expected to be affected by the proposed action is presented in the balance of this section.    The proposed rule would revise the insurance coverage and financial protection requirements that support requirements for facility operation/shutdown and license termination. The insurance coverage and financial protection requirements are designed to provide financial protection both onsite and offsite in the event of an accident at a reactor. They do not create or define the operation/shutdown and termination activities themselves. Therefore, some of the following attributes either are not consequences of the proposed action or are potential secondary consequences properly attributable not to the insurance coverage and financial protection requirements but to the facility operation/shutdown and license termination requirements that the protection requirements support. The attributes in this group include the following:    Public Health (Accident) -- No changes to radiation exposures to the public within 50 miles of a facility are expected due to changes in accident frequencies or accident consequences associated with the proposed action because the action is not designed or expected to address accident frequency or consequences.    Public Health (Routine) -- No changes to radiation exposures to the public during normal facility operations are expected to be associated with the proposed action because the action does not affect routine facility operations in any manner that could result in radiation exposures to the public.    Occupational Health (Accident) -- No changes to health effects, both immediate and long-term, associated with site workers as a result of changes in accident frequency or accident mitigation are expected to be associated with the proposed action because the action is not designed or expected to affect accident frequency or consequences.    Occupational Health (Routine) -- No changes to radiological exposures to workers during normal facility operations are expected to be associated with the proposed action because the action is not designed or expected to affect routine facility operations in any manner that could result in radiation exposures to workers.    Off-site Property -- No changes to monetary effects on off-site property, either through changes in accident frequency and consequences or in other direct or indirect forms, are expected to be associated with the proposed action. The action is not designed or expected to affect accident frequency or consequences. Effects on off-site property resulting from operation/shutdown and license termination are considered an attribute of the operation/shutdown and license termination requirements and not of the financial protection requirements.    On-site Property -- No changes to monetary effects on on-site property, either through changes in accident frequency and consequences or in other direct or indirect forms, are expected to be associated with the proposed action. The action is not designed or expected to affect the need for replacement power, decontamination, or refurbishment costs. Effects on on-site property resulting from operation/shutdown and license termination are considered an attribute of the operation/shutdown and license termination requirements and not of the financial protection requirements.    Industry Implementation -- The proposed action would require licensees to alter the coverages of existing insurance policies in order to achieve the operational savings discussed below. However, the effort required to alter insurance coverages is not believed to be of any significance.    NRC Implementation -- The proposed action is not expected to have any effect on NRC implementation, assuming that no Regulatory Guides will have to be proposed or revised.    Antitrust Considerations -- The proposed action is not expected to have any antitrust effects.    Safeguards and Security Considerations -- The proposed action is not expected to have any effect on the existing level of safeguards and security.    Environmental Considerations -- The proposed action is not expected to have any effect on the existing level of protection of environmental considerations.    The proposed regulatory actions are expected to involve the following attributes:    Industry Operation -- Relative to the no-action option (Option 1), the proposed rule changes in Option 2 and Option 3 would result in industry operation savings for licensees. Specifically, under either Option 2 or Option 3, licensees attempting to obtain exemptions from the current insurance coverage and financial protection requirements following plant shutdown would avoid the costs of preparing and submitting exemption packages to NRC. In addition, licensees potentially would realize annual savings in the form of reduced insurance premiums.    NRC Operation -- Relative to the no-action option (Option 1), the proposed rule changes in Option 2 and Option 3 would result in industry operation savings for NRC. Specifically, under either Option 2 or Option 3, NRC would avoid the costs of reviewing and evaluating submissions from licensees attempting to obtain exemptions from the current insurance coverage and financial protection requirements.    Other Government -- Relative to the no-action option (Option 1), Option 2 and Option 3 would result in impacts to the Federal government in that they would increase the government's indemnity risk associated with accidents at PSD reactor facilities. This risk, which is believed to be insignificant for Option 2 and significant for Option 3, has not been quantified in this analysis.    Regulatory Efficiency -- Relative to the no-action option (Option 1), Option 2 and Option 3 would result in enhanced regulatory efficiency, particularly by eliminating the need for preparation, submission, and review of individual plant exemption requests. In addition, Option 2 and Option 3 would provide greater regulatory certainty than the no-action option, would ensure consistent treatment among all power reactor licensees, and would eliminate the potential for costly delays in effecting regulatory exemptions. These values, while believed to be significant, have not been quantified in this analysis.    3.2 Model Design    This section describes the general methods used to structure the analysis and calculate results. The quantifiable results of the analysis (see Section 3.3) are based primarily on modeled effects of the proposed rule on (1) the costs of preparing, submitting, and reviewing exemption requests and (2) insurance premium data for nuclear power reactor licensees. Although the rulemaking would also result in significantly enhanced regulatory efficiency (see Section 3.1), these values have not been quantified.    The discussion in this section is divided into three parts. Section 3.2.1 summarizes the development of the database used in the analysis. Section 3.2.2 describes the methodology that was used to model the regulatory options under consideration. Finally, Section 3.2.3 discusses key assumptions that were used in the analysis.    3.2.1 Development of the Database    To help quantify the effects of the proposed rule, a database was developed containing a variety of data on nuclear power reactors and the licensees that own and operate these reactors. These data were obtained from the following two sources:    Nuclear Regulatory Commission Information Digest . (5)  The  Information Digest  provided reactor-specific information including licensee, unit name and type, location, operating status, operating license expiration date, licensed MWt, and decommissioning method (for shutdown reactors).    Annual Survey of Nuclear Decommissioning Cost Estimates and Funding Policies, Public Utility Survey . (6)  The  Annual Survey  provided reactor-specific information on license expiration dates and the expected timing and method of decommissioning.    The database includes information on a total of 74 reactor station sites, at which there are 109 operating reactors and 12 shutdown reactors. Of the 74 sites, 35 sites have only one reactor (whether operating or shutdown), 31 sites have two reactors, and 8 sites have three reactors. The database excludes reactors that (1) are not of the PWR or BWR type, (2) have been fully decommissioned, or (3) are not yet operational. However, the database does include NRC-regulated reactors that have already shutdown but have not been fully decommissioned.    3.2.2 Modeling of Regulatory Options    This section describes how each of the regulatory options under consideration has been modeled to quantify values and impacts associated with the options' insurance coverage and financial protection requirements. Option 1 is the no-action alternative and, as such, would have no values or impacts to be estimated. As a result, this discussion will focus on the modeling of Options 2 and 3. Under Options 2 and 3, NRC would allow power reactor licensees to modify their on-site and off-site liability coverage, without resorting to the exemption process, based on four different reactor configurations that follow permanent shutdown. In addition, NRC would clarify the definition of ""rated capacity"" to indicate that a PSD nuclear power reactor has a rated capacity of zero.    The requirements envisioned in Options 2 and 3 are deregulatory in nature and would affect licensees in two ways. First, because licensees would be able to reduce their financial protection coverage without resorting to the exemption process, licensees would avoid the costs of preparing and submitting exemption packages to NRC to obtain exemptions from the current insurance coverage and financial protection requirements. (7)  Second, licensees potentially would realize savings over time in the form of reduced annual insurance premiums associated with the modified insurance coverage and financial protection requirements. The proposed requirements in Options 2 and 3 also would benefit NRC in that NRC would avoid the costs of reviewing and evaluating exemption packages submitted by licensees.    The proposed rule changes under Options 2 and 3 would also result in values and impacts that are not quantified in this analysis. In particular, the proposed requirements would result in enhanced regulatory efficiency because they would provide greater regulatory certainty than the no-action option, would ensure consistent treatment among all power reactor licensees, and would eliminate the potential for costly delays in effecting regulatory exemptions. On the other hand, relative to both the no-action option and Option 2, Option 3 significantly increases the likelihood that the Federal government would have to bear some of the financial risk associated with accidents at nuclear power reactor facilities.    As noted above, both licensees and NRC would realize cost savings under Options 2 and 3 because the proposed rulemaking would eliminate the need for licensees to resort to the exemption process in order to reduce their insurance coverage and financial protection requirements following permanent shutdown. For licensees, these cost savings are calculated by multiplying the time required to prepare and submit exemption packages (in hours) for each reactor station site by the hourly wage rate for licensee staff. For NRC, these cost savings are calculated by multiplying the time required to review and evaluate exemption packages (in hours) by the hourly wage rate for NRC staff.    In addition, Options 2 and 3 potentially would generate cost savings to licensees due to reduced insurance premiums from the beginning of reactor Configuration 2 through the end of decommissioning. These potential cost savings are modeled in four general steps:    Step 1: The present value of the insurance premiums that licensees would have paid under the existing insurance coverage and financial protection requirements is calculated. (8)    Step 2: For each of the reactor configurations during which licensees would be able to reduce their insurance coverage (i.e., reactor Configurations 2, 3, and 4), the present value of the premiums that licensees would pay under the proposed rule is calculated.    Step 3: The premiums that licensees would pay under reactor Configurations 2, 3, and 4 (calculated in Step 2) are added to yield the total premiums paid by licensees under the proposed rule.    Step 4: The sum from Step 3 is subtracted from the total calculated in Step 1 to yield the total discounted cost savings to licensees from the proposed rule.    A critical variable in the methodology described above is the insurance premium paid by licensees for on-site and off-site coverage. For this analysis, data on insurance premiums were obtained from two sources. The first source, an article by Kurland (1993), provides 1992 data on the annual premiums charged by three different nuclear insurers -- American Nuclear Insurers, Nuclear Material Limited, and Nuclear Electric Insurance Limited. (9)  Data are provided for various amounts of both on-site and off-site coverage and, in some cases, are broken out into premiums for single-reactor sites and multiple-reactor sites. The second source used to obtain data on insurance premiums, SECY-96-256, provides data on the annual insurance premiums that would apply to various levels of off-site liability coverage. (10)    The insurance premium figures used in this analysis were derived by fitting quadratic regression curves to the data from the two sources listed above. A total of four curves were developed, three for on-site coverage and one for off-site coverage. (11)  Quadratic, rather than linear, regressions were chosen to reflect that insurance premiums tend to increase at a decreasing rate as the level of coverage increases.    3.2.3 Assumptions    Several assumptions were used in conducting the analysis described above. Key assumptions include the following:        The analysis assumes that the proposed rule would become effective in April 1998. Based on this assumption, all future costs and cost savings are discounted back to April 1998, using a 7 percent discount rate. (12)  All dollar amounts in the analysis are stated in 1997 dollars. (13)     NRC's Rulemaking Plan indicates that, under Option 3, the off-site financial protection requirement for reactor Configurations 2, 3, and 4 would be on the order of $5 million to $10 million. For simplicity, the analysis assumes that the required level of off-site coverage under Option 3 for these three configurations is $7.5 million.     Because the proposed insurance coverage and financial protection requirements under Options 2 and 3 apply on a per-reactor basis, the analysis treats each reactor on a multiple-reactor site as an independent unit, with its own spent fuel pool and its own insurance policies. In addition, the analysis assumes that the 1,000-gallon on-site radioactive-liquid-inventory threshold that governs the transition from reactor Configuration 3 to reactor Configuration 4 is applicable to each reactor on a multiple-reactor site (as opposed to the entire site as a whole).     Information provided in the  Information Digest  or the  Annual Survey  indicates that, for eight of the 39 sites with multiple reactors, one or more reactors at the site is/are being or will be decommissioned using the SAFSTOR method while the remaining reactor(s) will be decommissioned using the DECON method. In six of these eight cases, the sources indicate that the reactors using SAFSTOR will be kept in safe storage until the reactors using DECON have ceased operations and are ready for decommissioning. This analysis assumes that the same situation would apply in the remaining two cases.     The DECON or SAFSTOR process for a given power reactor is assumed to begin at the time the reactor ceases operation (i.e., the operating license expiration date). Also, the analysis assumes that no licenses will be renewed at expiration.     Based on NRC's decommissioning analysis for BWRs, (14)  the analysis assumes that the DECON and SAFSTOR methods of decommissioning for BWRs last 6.3 years and 60 years, respectively, following power reactor shutdown. For each of these methods, spent fuel is stored in the cooling pools for a period of 4.6 years.     Based on NRC's decommissioning analysis for PWRs, (15)  the analysis assumes that the DECON and SAFSTOR methods of decommissioning for PWRs last 8.62 years and 60 years, respectively, following power reactor shutdown. For each of these methods, spent fuel is stored in the cooling pools for a period of 6.92 years.     Based on NRC's preliminary analysis, reactor Configuration 1 (i.e., the period between operating license expiration and the time at which the spent fuel has cooled to the point where the spent fuel cladding temperature would not exceed 565C in the event of a loss of water from the spent fuel pool) is assumed to last 0.58 years (or 7 months) for BWRs and 1.42 years (or 17 months) for PWRs.     Reactor Configuration 2 (i.e., the period between the end of reactor Configuration 1 and the time at which the spent fuel is removed from the cooling pools) is assumed to last 4.02 years for BWRs and 5.5 years for PWRs. (16)     For reactors using DECON, reactor Configuration 3 (i.e., the time between the end of reactor Configuration 2 and the time at which the on-site radioactive liquid inventory falls to below 1,000 gallons) is assumed to cover 75 percent of the period between the end of the pool storage period and the end of decommissioning. For reactors using SAFSTOR, reactor Configuration 3 is assumed to cover the entire extended safe storage period plus 75 percent of the remaining decommissioning period.     For reactors using DECON or SAFSTOR, reactor Configuration 4 (i.e., the period between the end of reactor Configuration 3 and the end of decommissioning) is divided into two parts. For the first 80 percent of the Configuration 4 period, the on-site radioactive liquid inventory is assumed to be between 0 and 1,000 gallons. For the final 20 percent of the Configuration 4 period, the analysis assumes that there are no radioactive liquids onsite, and the licensee is merely awaiting/undergoing a confirmatory survey.     Based on information provided in SECY-96-256, the analysis assumes that 90 percent of licensees at sites without exemptions from the current financial protection requirements would seek exemptions in the absence of the proposed rule. For sites with active reactors, the analysis assumes that these exemptions would be submitted immediately following shutdown of the last reactor on the site. For sites with shutdown reactors only (excluding the five sites that already have exemptions), the analysis assumes that exemptions would be submitted at the time the proposed rule becomes effective (i.e., April 1998). For purposes of sensitivity analysis, the model also calculates results assuming that 100 percent of licensees would seek exemptions in the absence of the rule.     Based on the on-site and off-site coverage levels that currently apply to the five reactor sites that have already been through the exemption process (see Table 2-1), the analysis assumes on-site and off-site coverage levels of $75 million and $100 million, respectively, for sites obtaining exemptions. As a sensitivity on this assumption, the analysis also considers on-site and off-site exemption levels of $50 million and $75 million, respectively, and $25 million and $50 million, respectively.     The wage rates applicable to NRC staff and licensee staff are assumed to be $68.28 per hour and $73.56 per hour, respectively. These rates were calculated from 1996 wage rates developed by NRC for use in regulatory analyses of $67.50 per hour for NRC staff and $72.72 for licensee staff. The 1996 wage rates were converted to 1997 dollars to be compatible with the use of 1997 dollars in the balance of the analysis.     Based on information provided in SECY-96-256, the level of effort required by a licensee to prepare and submit an exemption request for a particular site is assumed to be 160 hours. The level of effort required by NRC to review and evaluate an exemption request for a particular site is assumed to be 120 hours.      3.3 Results    The results of the analysis for each of the affected attributes identified in Section 3.1 are shown below in Exhibit 3-1, including (1) the qualitative results for Regulatory Efficiency (i.e., greater regulatory certainty, more consistent treatment of licensees, and elimination of delays associated with the exemption process) and Other Government (i.e., increased indemnity risk) and (2) the quantitative results for Industry Operation (i.e., exemption cost savings and potential insurance premium savings) and NRC Operation (i.e., exemption cost savings). As shown in the exhibit, there are no values or impacts associated with Option 1 (the no-action alternative). Rather, during the shutdown period, licensees would continue to maintain on-site and off-site financial protection coverage in the amounts prescribed by 10 CFR 50.54(w) and 10 CFR 140.11, and would need to resort to the exemption process in order to reduce this coverage.    Option 2 would result in increases in regulatory efficiency relative to the no-action option. In particular, Option 2 would provide greater regulatory certainty than the no-action option, would ensure consistent treatment among all power reactor licensees, and would eliminate the potential for costly delays in effecting regulatory exemptions. These increases in regulatory efficiency have not been quantified but are believed to be significant. Under Option 2, elimination of the need for licensees to resort to the exemption process to reduce their financial protection coverage levels is expected to save licensees $202,000 in preparation and submission costs and to save NRC $141,000 in review and evaluation costs. In addition, the proposed changes to the insurance coverage and financial protection requirements for PSD reactors potentially could save licensees on the order of $48 million in insurance premiums over the period from shutdown through the end of decommissioning. It is important to note, however, that this $48 million savings assumes that 10 percent of licensees at sites without exemptions would not seek exemptions following shutdown, even though seeking exemptions would likely reduce their costs. To the extent that all licensees would pursue exemptions from the current coverage requirements, savings from Option 2 would fall by 75 percent to $12 million. Also, the amount of potential savings is sensitive to the assumption regarding the on-site and off-site coverage levels that would apply under exemptions from the current requirements. (17)  Finally, due to the reduced coverage levels that would be allowed under Option 2, the indemnity risk to the Federal government would increase. This increase in risk has not been quantified but is believed to be insignificant because the coverage levels established under Option 2 represent NRC's best estimate of the on-site and off-site consequences that could result from accidents during each of the four reactor configurations following shutdown.    Option 3, like Option 2, would result in increases in regulatory efficiency relative to the no-action option in that it would provide greater regulatory certainty, would ensure consistent treatment among all power reactor licensees, and would eliminate the potential for costly delays in effecting regulatory exemptions. These increases in regulatory efficiency have not been quantified but are believed to be significant. Option 3 would also eliminate the need for licensees to resort to the exemption process to reduce their coverage levels, thereby generating an expected savings to licensees of $202,000 in preparation and submission costs, and savings to NRC of $141,000 in review and evaluation costs (i.e., the same as in Option 2). In addition, the proposed rule changes in Option 3 potentially could save licensees approximately $98 million in insurance premiums over the period from shutdown through the end of decommissioning. Several points concerning this $98 million savings are worth noting. First, as with the insurance premium savings estimates for Option 2, this $98 million savings is based on the assumption that 10 percent of licensees at sites without exemptions would not seek exemptions following shutdown. To the extent that all licensees would pursue exemptions from the current coverage requirements, approximately 37 percent of these savings would not be realized. Second, as in Option 2, the amount of potential savings is sensitive to the assumption regarding the on-site and off-site coverage levels that would apply under exemptions from the current requirements. Finally, even though Option 3 potentially could result in an additional $50 million in insurance premium savings to licensees relative to Option 2 (due to the fact that the off-site financial protection requirements under Option 3 are significantly lower than in Option 2), these additional savings would be at the expense of increased impacts to the Federal government. This is because the reduced coverage levels under Option 3 increase the likelihood that the Federal government would have to bear some of the financial risk associated with accidents at nuclear power reactor facilities. This increase in risk has not been quantified but is believed to be significant.

BACKFIT ANALYSIS    The NRC has determined that the backfit rule, 10 CFR 50.109, does not apply to this proposed rule, and therefore, that a backfit analysis is not required for this proposed rule, because these amendments do not involve any provisions which would impose backfits as defined in 10 CFR 50.109(a)(1), nor do they impose more stringent safety requirements on 10 CFR Part 50 licensees.    5. DECISION RATIONALE    1. Option 1, the no-action alternative, would retain the existing requirements for on-site and off-site financial protection for PSD reactors. Both Option 2 and Option 3 would allow power reactor licensees to reduce their on-site and off-site liability coverage, without resorting to the exemption process, based on four different reactor configurations that are anticipated following permanent shutdown. In addition, both options would clarify the definition of ""rated capacity"" to indicate that a PSD nuclear power reactor has a rated capacity of zero. Both Option 2 and Option 3 are expected to result in cost savings for licensees and NRC. First, the proposed requirements under Options 2 and 3 would result in enhanced regulatory efficiency because they would provide greater regulatory certainty than Option 1 (the no-action alternative), would ensure consistent treatment among all power reactor licensees, and would eliminate the potential for costly delays in effecting regulatory exemptions. Second, because licensees would be able to reduce their financial protection coverage without resorting to the exemption process, licensees wishing to reduce their current financial protection requirements would avoid the costs of preparing and submitting exemption packages to NRC, which could amount to approximately $202,000 (present value). This would benefit NRC in that NRC would avoid costs of approximately $141,000 (present value) for reviewing and evaluating exemption packages submitted by licensees. Finally, licensees potentially would realize savings over time in the form of reduced annual insurance premiums associated with the modified coverage levels that would be required under the proposed rule. The present value of these savings could amount to between $48 million (for Option 2) and $98 million (for Option 3), assuming that 90 percent of licensees would seek exemptions from the current requirements following shutdown. If, on the other hand, all licensees obtained exemptions following shutdown, these savings would be significantly smaller ($12 million and $62 million for Options 2 and 3, respectively). Insurance premium savings could also be smaller depending on the on-site and off-site coverage levels that would apply under exemptions from the current requirements.    2. The only distinction between Option 2 and Option 3 is that Option 3 would allow licensees to reduce their off-site financial protection requirements to levels significantly lower than those allowed under Option 2. However, this option significantly increases the financial risk associated with accidents that the Federal government would have to bear. NRC believes that the coverage levels established under Option 2 represent NRC's best estimate of the on-site and off-site consequences that could result from accidents during each of the four reactor configurations following shutdown. As a result, NRC believes that the further reduction in off-site coverage levels under Option 3 jeopardizes the financial protection requirements, despite the potential for an additional insurance premium savings to licensees of approximately $50 million (i.e., $98 million minus $48 million). Finally, NRC believes that a further reduction of the liability of licensees in the event of an accident could be problematic in terms of the public's perception.    3. For the reasons stated in (1) and (2) above, Option 2 is superior to Option 1 (the no-action alternative) and Option 3.    6. IMPLEMENTATION    This action would be enacted through a Proposed Rule Notice and public comment and a Final Rule, with promulgation of the Final Rule expected by April 1998. Implementation can begin immediately following the enactment of the final rulemaking. No impediments to implementation of the recommended alternative have been identified. In addition, no Regulatory Guides for licensees are expected to be needed.      Draft Environmental Assessment    and Finding of No Significant Environmental Impact    Proposed Rule: Financial Protection Requirements for Permanently Shutdown Nuclear Power Reactors    This document fulfills NRC's obligation under 10 CFR Part 51 to examine the environmental impacts of its regulatory actions, in this case in regard to a rulemaking addressing NRC's current insurance coverage and financial protection requirements for nuclear power reactors. NRC is proposing to modify these requirements, which are contained in 10 CFR 50.54(w) and 10 CFR 140.11, on a generic basis for permanently shutdown (PSD) reactors to account for the reduced risk associated with these reactors.    NRC's regulations for implementing Section 102(2) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA), as amended, are contained in Subpart A of 10 CFR Part 51. These regulations require that an environmental impact statement or an environmental assessment be prepared for all licensing and regulatory actions that are not classified as ""categorical exclusions"" under 10 CFR 51.22(c) and are not identified in 10 CFR 51.22(d) as other actions not requiring environmental review.    NRC has determined that, under Section 102(2) of NEPA, as amended, and NRC's regulations in Subpart A of 10 CFR Part 51, that the proposed rule modifying the insurance coverage and financial protection requirements for nuclear power reactors is not a major federal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment and, therefore, that an environmental impact statement is not required. NRC has also determined that the proposed rule does not qualify as a categorical exclusion or other action not requiring environmental review. Consequently, NRC has determined that an environmental assessment is required. This document presents the results of NRC's environmental assessment of the proposed rule.    Background    Under 10 CFR 50.54(w), nuclear power reactor licensees must obtain insurance coverage in the amount of $1.06 billion (or, if that level of coverage is not available, the maximum amount that is generally available from private sources) to provide protection against  on-site  damage in the event of an accident at a reactor. In the event of an accident, the proceeds from this insurance must be used first to stabilize the reactor and then to decontaminate the reactor and reactor station site. Under 10 CFR 140.11, licensees of facilities designed to produce substantial amounts of electricity (i.e., those with a rated capacity of 100,000 kWe or more) must have and maintain two levels of financial protection against  off-site  liability: (1) primary insurance coverage of $200 million from private sources, and (2) secondary financial protection in the form of private liability insurance available under an industry retrospective rating plan. (18)    In a staff requirements memorandum (SRM) dated July 13, 1993, the Commission approved staff recommendations to (1) allow licensees that have permanently shutdown to withdraw from the secondary financial protection layer under the Price-Anderson Act (section 170 of the Atomic Energy Act, as amended), (2) reduce the required primary financial protection coverage under the Price-Anderson Act, through exemption, to $100 million after an appropriate spent fuel cooling period, and (3) proceed with a rulemaking to determine appropriate further reductions in the level of insurance coverage after the appropriate spent fuel cooling period. The Commission also requested that the staff determine whether there is a need for financial protection for ISFSIs and requested clarification of the term ""rated capacity,"" as applied to PSD reactors. In addition, the North Carolina Public Staff Utilities Commission submitted a petition requesting a reduction in or elimination of the $1.06 billion in insurance for on-site reactor stabilization and accident decontamination, currently required by 10 CFR 50.54(w), in instances when all nuclear fuel has been removed from the site. The petitioner also requested that the requirement for off-site primary and secondary liability coverages required under 10 CFR 140.11(a)(4) be reduced or eliminated for shutdown reactors when no nuclear fuel is on the reactor site.    In response to item 3 of the SRM (19)  and the petition from the North Carolina Public Staff Utilities Commission, the staff issued a Rulemaking Plan for amending NRC's current insurance coverage and financial protection requirements for PSD nuclear power reactors. (20)  This Plan complements other amendments for decommissioning, published in the  Federal Register  (61  FR  39278) on July 29, 1996, clarifying the procedures that lead to permanent shutdown and, eventually, to the termination of an operating license for nuclear power reactors. Under that rule, ""permanent shutdown"" would become a codified status of a reactor when a licensee has certified that all fuel has been removed from the reactor core and that it has permanently ceased power operations.    The Rulemaking Plan also responds to NRC's experience in implementing the current financial insurance coverage and protection requirements for PSD reactors. To date, five PSD reactor licensees have requested and been granted exemptions reducing their coverage under these requirements. The staff believes that the factors supporting these five exemptions including, in particular, the reduced risk associated with PSD reactors, are applicable to PSD reactors on a more generic basis.    Discussion    NRC's Rulemaking Plan is part of a broad effort to eliminate unnecessary regulatory burdens for power reactor facilities that are permanently shutdown and in the process of decommissioning. NRC has determined that there is a need to modify its existing insurance coverage and financial protection regulations for nuclear power reactors because these regulations currently specify the same on-site and off-site requirements regardless of whether a power reactor is permanently shutdown or operating, and thus do not take into consideration the reduced risk associated with PSD plants. Rather, reduced insurance coverage for these plants has traditionally been allowed on a case-by-case basis through the exemption process. In addition, the existing requirements for off-site financial protection apply to power reactors with a specified ""rated capacity"" in terms of electrical kilowatts but do not account for the fact that PSD reactors no longer operate at any rated capacity.    NRC is proposing to adjust the on-site insurance coverage requirements under 10 CFR 50.54(w) and the off-site financial protection requirements under 10 CFR 140.11 on a generic basis for PSD reactors. Specifically, NRC is proposing to allow power reactor licensees to reduce their on-site and off-site liability coverage, without resorting to the exemption process, based on several different reactor configurations that encompass spent fuel characteristics and storage modes following permanent shutdown. (21)  These configurations and the associated coverage levels are described below:        Reactor Configuration 1: In this configuration, the reactor is defueled and permanently shutdown, but spent fuel in the spent fuel pool is susceptible to a zircaloy cladding fire if the water in the pool is lost. This configuration encompasses the period commencing immediately after the offload of the core and ending just prior to when the decay heat of the hottest assemblies is low enough so that no rapid zircaloy oxidation would take place and the fuel cladding would remain intact in the event of loss of water from the spent fuel pool. NRC's preliminary analysis indicates that, in order to prevent fuel rod cladding failure leading to a zircaloy cladding fire given the loss of all spent fuel pool water, the resulting rod cladding temperature must not exceed 565C. NRC's analysis also estimates that, for typical reactors, the spent fuel would be sufficiently cool so as to prevent the cladding temperature from exceeding 565C in the event of a loss of all spent fuel pool water after a decay period of approximately 7 months for BWRs and approximately 17 months for PWRs. Once a sufficient cooling period for the spent fuel has elapsed after reactor shutdown, the potential zircaloy cladding fire sequence would no longer be a concern because, in an emergency situation, air would cool the spent fuel sufficiently to avoid zircaloy cladding combustion.      During reactor Configuration 1, licensees would be required to maintain on-site insurance coverage and off-site financial protection at the levels currently required by 10 CFR 50.54(w) and 10 CFR 140.11, respectively. This is because the radiological consequences during this stage of permanent shutdown approximate the magnitude of a severe core damage accident.        Reactor Configuration 2: In this configuration, the reactor is defueled and permanently shutdown, and spent fuel is in the spent fuel pool but is not susceptible to a zircaloy cladding fire or gap release caused by an incipient fuel cladding failure in the event the pool is drained accidentally. In reactor Configuration 2, the spent fuel can be stored on a long term basis in the spent fuel pool without the possibility of initiating a zircaloy fire or significant fuel cladding failure. However, the possibility exists for a fuel handling accident in the spent fuel pool, and the site may contain a significantly large inventory of liquid radioactive waste, activated reactor components, and contaminated structural materials. The radioactive inventory during this configuration may change depending on the licensee's proposed shutdown activities and schedule.      During reactor Configuration 2, licensees would be allowed to reduce both their on-site and off-site financial protection coverage as long as there are no operating reactors on the site. Specifically, for a reactor in Configuration 2, licensees would be allowed to reduce their on-site insurance coverage to a minimum amount of $50 million to recover from a fuel handling accident or a release of cooling water from the spent fuel pool. Licensees would also be allowed to reduce their off-site financial protection to the amount of $100 million, based on the potential for significant judgments or settlements resulting from litigation and to protect the Federal government from indemnity claims. However, licensees would be allowed to withdraw from the secondary financial protection layer provided under the Price-Anderson Act.        Reactor Configuration 3: In this configuration, the reactor is permanently shutdown and no spent fuel is in the reactor or the spent fuel pool. All spent fuel has been removed to an off-site or on-site dry storage ISFSI or to a DOE high level repository. The remaining radioactive inventory depends on the decommissioning status and will include liquid radioactive waste, activated reactor components, and contaminated structural materials. For this configuration, the potential for a radiological incident is primarily focused on mobile sources of radioactivity onsite at permanently shutdown nuclear reactors.      For a reactor in Configuration 3, licensees would be allowed to reduce their on-site insurance coverage to a minimum amount of $50 million (to the same minimum level permitted under reactor Configuration 2), if there are no operating reactors on the site, to account for a rupture of a large (i.e., greater than 1,000 gallons), slightly-contaminated-liquid storage tank. Licensees would also be allowed to further reduce their off-site financial protection to the amount of $50 million, based on the potential for significant judgments or settlements resulting from litigation and to protect the Federal government from indemnity claims. The off-site requirement is reduced from that required in reactor Configuration 2 because the liability risk is considered to be less in reactor Configuration 3. As in reactor Configuration 2, the secondary financial protection layer would no longer be required.        Reactor Configuration 4: In this configuration, the reactor is permanently shutdown and no spent fuel is in the reactor or the spent fuel pool. All spent fuel has been removed to an off-site or on-site dry storage ISFSI or to a DOE high level repository. Unlike reactor Configuration 3, however, the reactor site has only a small amount (i.e., less than 1,000 gallons) of mobile sources of radioactivity (e.g., contaminated liquids) onsite. Finally, this configuration also covers the period during which the licensee has cleaned the reactor site to unrestricted release levels and is awaiting a confirmatory survey for termination of the license.      For a reactor in Configuration 4, licensees would be allowed to reduce their on-site insurance coverage to a minimum amount of $25 million, if there are no operating reactors on the site, to account for a rupture of a less-than-1,000-gallon, slightly-contaminated-liquid storage tank. This on-site coverage for the reactor may be eliminated, however, when the licensee has cleaned the site to unrestricted release levels and is awaiting a confirmatory survey for license termination. The Commission has issued a proposed License Termination Rule. If that rule becomes final it would prescribe the requirements that apply to establishment of funds that may be required at license termination. Licensees would also be allowed to further reduce their off-site financial protection to the amount of $25 million based on the continued potential for claims from asserted off-site consequences and to minimize the possibility that Federal indemnification would be required. As in reactor Configurations 2 and 3, the secondary financial protection layer would no longer be required.    NRC is also proposing to modify 10 CFR 140.11 to indicate that a PSD nuclear power reactor has a rated capacity of zero. The effect of this modification would be that, once a shutdown reactor's spent fuel has cooled to the point where the spent fuel cladding temperature would not exceed 565C in the event of a loss of water from the spent fuel pool, the licensee would be allowed to (1) reduce its primary off-site financial protection level and (2) cease its participation in the secondary financial protection system under 10 CFR 140.11(a)(4).    Environmental Considerations    The proposed rule, if implemented by NRC, would reduce the burden of existing requirements on nuclear power reactor licensees by allowing them to reduce their on-site and off-site liability coverage, without resorting to the exemption process, based on several different reactor configurations that encompass spent fuel characteristics and storage modes following permanent shutdown. The proposed rule would also clarify that a PSD nuclear power reactor has a rated capacity of zero.    The proposed regulatory changes, which apply only to nuclear power reactors that have permanently ceased operations, would require no changes in hardware, procedures, organization, or operation of nuclear power reactors. The proposed requirements would not affect the safety provided by NRC's requirements for nuclear power reactor operation/shutdown and license termination because of the significantly reduced risks to the public health and safety in reactor Configurations 2, 3, and 4. In addition, the proposed modifications would not affect the likelihood, magnitude, or consequences of accidents at nuclear power reactor facilities. While the modifications would reduce the levels of financial protection available under the regulations to pay for environmental or other consequences that may result from accidents at PSD reactors, NRC believes the reduced coverage levels are fully adequate and commensurate with the reduced consequences of potential accidents at PSD reactors and, therefore, that the environment will not be negatively affected. Based on these factors, NRC has determined that the proposed rulemaking would have no significant impacts on the quality of the environment.      The Honorable James M. Inhofe, Chairman  Subcommittee on Clean Air, Wetlands, Private Property and Nuclear Safety  Committee on Environment and Public Works  United States Senate  Washington, DC 20510    Dear Mr. Chairman:    The NRC has sent to the Office of the Federal Register for publication and comment the enclosed proposed amendments to the Commission's rules in    10 CFR Part 50 and 10 CFR Part 140. The amendments, if adopted, would specify levels of liability coverage that would be required of licensees that meet specified reactor configurations during permanent shutdown of nuclear power reactors. This would allow nuclear reactor licensees a reduction in onsite and offsite liability coverage during permanent shutdown without resorting to the exemption process.    The proposed rule would amend 10 CFR 50.54(w) to allow nuclear reactor licensees to lower the onsite insurance requirements based on several different configurations that encompass spent fuel characteristics and storage modes following permanent shutdown. In parallel, offsite financial protection requirements as specified in 10 CFR 140.11 would also be adjusted to allow licensees to lower their primary insurance coverage and be able to withdraw from the industry retrospective rating plan, based on satisfying the requirements specified for the same configurations during permanent shutdown. In addition, the proposed offsite insurance requirements would continue to provide the Federal Government protection from indemnity claims even though the NRC staff considers that such events would be rare and would have negligible offsite consequences.

The amendment is being proposed because of the reduced risks associated with a permanently shut down plant, after an appropriate spent fuel cooling period. Currently, licensees at permanently shut down facilities must request an exemption from the regulations in order to obtain a reduced level of insurance coverage. The proposed rule would eliminate the need for such an exemption.    Currently, licensees must obtain approximately $1 billion of insurance for each power reactor site to stabilize and decontaminate a reactor, and to provide coverage for onsite damage in the event of an accident. They are also required, under the Price-Anderson Act, to obtain a minimum of $200 million for financial protection and to participate in a secondary financial protection system against damages and injuries which could occur offsite.    Under the proposed rule, the amount of insurance coverage required onsite would be reduced downwards to $50 million or less, and the amount of coverage required offsite would be reduced to $100 million or less. These amounts would be based on certain configurations of the reactor and the spent fuel stored onsite. For instance, reactors with spent fuel in the storage pool and fuel that is still above a certain temperature would require more insurance than reactors that have no spent fuel in the pool because of the possibility of a fuel cladding fire if the pool is accidentally drained. In addition, sites with an inventory of liquid radioactive waste, radioactive reactor components, or contaminated structural material, may require higher insurance coverage than sites without such materials. The proposed rule does not address the financial protection reqirements for Independent Spent Fuel Storage Installations (ISFSIs). That subject will be addressed after efforts dealing with technical and licensing issues for ISFSIs.    The proposed rule will be published for comment shortly in the Federal Register.

The petitioner also requested that the requirement for off-site primary and secondary liability coverages required under 10 CFR 140.11(a)(4) be reduced or eliminated for shutdown reactors when no nuclear fuel is on the reactor site.      3  Experience from the accident at TMI-2 has shown that significant settlements can be involved even though the off-site consequences may be negligible.      4   Regulatory Analysis Technical Evaluation Handbook, Final Report , NUREG/BR-0184, Office of Nuclear Regulatory Research, January 1997.      5   Nuclear Regulatory Commission Information Digest , NUREG-1350, Volume 7, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Office of the Comptroller, March 1995.      6   Annual Survey of Nuclear Decommissioning Cost Estimates and Funding Policies, Public Utility Survey , Goldman Sachs, August 1995, Table 32. (A more recent version of this survey is not currently available.)      7  While these cost savings can be quantified, these values actually are attributable to the proposed options only indirectly because licensees are not currently required to obtain exemptions for their PSD reactors.      8  The insurance premiums that would be paid by licensees under the current rule reflect the assumption that 90 percent (and, for sensitivity analysis purposes, 100 percent) of licensees at sites without exemptions would obtain exemptions following shutdown. In addition, for the five PSD reactors that have already been through the exemption process (i.e., Humboldt Bay 3, LaCrosse, Rancho Seco, Trojan, Yankee-Rowe), the combined on-site and off-site insurance coverage limits applicable to those reactors are assumed to either stay the same or decline depending on whether the combined on-site and off-site insurance coverage limits in the proposed rule are higher or lower than those currently in effect for those reactors.      9  Kurland, Orin M., ""Who the nuclear insurers are,""  Risk Management , vol. 40, no. 6, June 1993, p. 44.      10  SECY-96-256, ""Changes to the Financial Protection Requirements for Permanently Shutdown Nuclear Power Reactors, 10 CFR 50.54(w) and 10 CFR 140.11,"" December 17, 1996.      11  The three curves for on-site coverage were used to derive insurance premium estimates for sites with one reactor, two reactors, and three reactors, respectively. Only one curve was developed for off-site coverage because the data on premiums for this type of coverage did not reflect variation based on the number of reactors at a site.      12  A discount rate of 7 percent was used in accordance with NRC's  Regulatory Analysis Technical Evaluation Handbook,  January 1997, page B-2.      13  To convert dollar figures to 1997 dollars, the analysis uses inflation adjustment factors that are based on GDP implicit price deflators as reported in  Economic Indicators , U.S. Government Printing Office, Washington, D.C., April 1997.      14  NUREG/CR-6174, ""Revised Analyses of Decommissioning for the Reference Boiling Water Reactor Power Station: Effects of Current Regulatory and Other Considerations on the Financial Assurance Requirements of the Decommissioning Rule and on Estimates of Occupational Radiation Exposure,"" PNL-9975, Vol. 1, Main Report, Final Report, July 1996, pp. 3.2 and 4.5.      15  NUREG/CR-5884, ""Revised Analyses of Decommissioning for the Reference Pressurized Water Reactor Power Station: Effects of Current Regulatory and Other Considerations on the Financial Assurance Requirements of the Decommissioning Rule and on Estimates of Occupational Radiation Exposure,"" PNL-8742, Vol. 1, Main Report, Final Report, November 1995, pp. 3.2 and 4.4.      16  The duration of reactor Configuration 2 is calculated as the difference between the length of the pool storage period and the length of reactor Configuration 1.      17  As noted in Section 3.2.3, the $48 million savings estimate assumes that sites obtaining exemptions would be required to maintain $75 million in on-site coverage and $100 million in off-site coverage. If the on-site and off-site exemption levels were set at $50 million and $75 million, respectively, the potential savings to licensees would fall to $30 million. If the on-site and off-site exemption levels were set at $25 million and $50 million, respectively, the potential savings would fall to $11 million.      18  The current maximum obligation for secondary financial protection for a licensee in the industry retrospective rating plan is $75.5 million with respect to any nuclear incident. In total, the financial protection for off-site liability for any incident equals the primary layer of $200 million plus the secondary layer of $75.5 million multiplied by the number of licensed power reactors with a rated capacity of 100,000 kWe or higher. This coverage currently amounts to approximately $8 billion.      19  Items 1 and 2 of the SRM were addressed previously in a memorandum dated August 4, 1993, from the EDO to the Commission.      20  SECY-96-256, ""Changes to the Financial Protection Requirements for Permanently Shutdown Nuclear Power Reactors, 10 CFR 50.54(w) and 10 CFR 140.11,"" December 17, 1996. The staff's recommended course of action was approved by the Commission by an SRM dated January 28, 1997.      21  A key distinction between NRC's existing    coverage levels and the coverage levels in the proposed rule is that, whereas    the existing coverage levels apply on a per-site basis, the proposed coverage    levels would apply on a per-reactor basis."

ACTION: Notice.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  SUMMARY: The Department of Transportation is seeking public advice in  implementing the Jobs Access and Reverse Commute Program authorized in  Section 3037 of the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century  (TEA-21). This notice also includes questions regarding the  implementation of the Job Access/Reverse Commute Program. Responses to  the questions posed are invited. DATES: Comments must be submitted by September 18, 1998.  ADDRESS: Comments should be sent to the Department of Transportation,  Docket # FTA-98-4343, Central Docket Office, PL-401, 400 Seventh  Street, SW., Washington, DC 20590.  FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Douglas Birnie, Program Manager, (202)  366-9157.  SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:  Program Preparation      The U.S. Department of Transportion (DOT) intends to complete a  program solicitation and guidelines by October 1, when FY 1999 funding  becomes available. Funding availability in early FY 1999 will ensure  that assistance provided pursuant to Section 3037 of TEA-21 may be  applied in a timely fashion to support regional programs creating Job  Access and Reverse Commute services. Limited funding, particularly in  the initial years of the program, may affect funding availability for  some applications.     Although implementing guidelines for the Job Access & Reverse  Commute program are being developed, prospective applicants should  review the legislative criteria as a guide to the preparation of  programs for funding. Please note that the Job Access & Reverse Commute  funding is predicated on the development of local partnerships. A  collaborative transportation/human services planning process must be  established to develop Job Access programs. This process should involve  agencies implementing welfare and work force development programs, non- profit community based and faith-based organizations, stakeholder  representatives, employers and a variety of existing transportation  providers and agencies. In larger urban areas, Metropolitan Planning  Organizations (MPO) will select applicants and in smaller urbanized and  rural areas, states will select applicants. The programs that are  developed are to be regional in nature, although portions of the  program can be targeted to specific areas within the region. An area  may have one designated recipient for funds, but these funds may be  passed to any number of subrecipients. An operating partnership  involving consultation and use of existing public, private and non- profit transportation providers, including the area transit agency, is  expected. Using the existing transportation infrastructure reduces  start-up costs and enhances service sustainability. Finally, a  financial partnership is encouraged among the stakeholders. The Job  Access and Reverse Commute program requires a 50/50 match. This program  is considered catalytic funding upon which to assemble additional human  service, transportation and private resources to meet job access  transportation needs.     Funding from other Federal programs may be used as match dollars.  These include Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) and  Community Services Block grants through the U.S. Department of Health  and Human Services (HHS) and Welfare to Work (WtW) grants through the  U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) as well as the U.S. Department of  Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Community Development Block Grant  and HOPE VI Grants. TANF and WtW grants, when used as match, may be  used only for new and expanded transportation services and cannot be  used for construction or to subsidized current transportation operating  expenses. Such funds also must supplement rather than supplant other  State expenditures on transportation. Other transportation funds  allocated to transportation agencies by DOT may also be used to address  these transportation needs.  Public Consultation      DOT in conjunction with its other Federal partners desires to  develop a Job Access & Reverse Commute program that is responsive to  the needs of the stakeholders who are implementing welfare reform and  transportation activities. We are seeking your advice on the questions  listed below and other issues related to the implementation of the  program. Although we will not be able to respond directly to individual  comments, we will address collectively the comments received when we  issue the national program solicitation and guidelines. For the  convenience of those individuals and organizations with computer access  to the internet, you may submit your written comments to FTA home page  web site, which may be reached at--http://www.fta.dot.gov/wtw/japc.     Additionally, any public interest organization seeking to elaborate  upon its views with Departmental officials may request a meeting.  Please contact Ms. Corine Hegland, U.S. Department of Transportation at  (202) 366-8850.  Program Purpose      The Jobs Access and Reverse Commute Program provides competitive  grants to local governments and non-profit organizations to develop  transportation services to connect welfare recipients and low-income  persons from their residence to employment and support services.  Program Features      Section 3037 of TEA-21 authorizes a Job Access and Reverse Commute  program. Job Access projects provides transportation services to  connect welfare recipients and low-income persons to jobs and  activities related to employment. Reverse Commute projects provides the  public transportation services to the general public that provide  connections to suburban employment centers from urban centers, rural  areas and other suburban locations.     <bullet> Criteria for selection include indication of the need for  additional services as identified in the transportation plan and  explanation of the extent to which services will address these needs.  Funding Features      <bullet> Split funded from both the Mass Transit Account and  General Funds.     <bullet> Guaranteed funding (Mass Transit Account & general  revenues) increases from $50 million in 1999 to $150 million in 2003.     <bullet> Not more than $10 million per year may be used for reverse  commute activities.     <bullet> Provides 50% Federal share.     <bullet> Other Federal transportation-eligible funds could be used  to meet the local match, including TANF and WtW funding for Access to  Jobs projects.

Job Access and Reverse Commute Program Implementation Questions  Funding Distribution & Program Focus      1. In FY 1999, funding for the Job Access/Reverse Commute Program  may be limited to $50 million. In light of funding constraints, what  grant award strategy should be pursued? Should there be maximum or  minimum grant sizes? Should grants vary by the size of the region,  e.g., major areas with populations over one million, areas between  200,000 and one million, areas between 50,000 and 200,000, non- urbanized rural areas?     2. Should grants to support local Job Access programs be made on an  annual basis or on a multi-year basis covering several years worth of  local activity? Annual multi-year financial grant commitments must be  made subject to the availability of congressional appropriations.     3. Should Job Access and Reverse Commute funding be considered as  one program where applicants can elect to reserve a percentage of their  funds for reverse commute services--not tied to welfare recipients or  low income person? Or, should the two components be treated as separate  programs operating independently?     4. What steps should FTA take to encourage a broad range of groups,  not limited to its normal mass transit partners, to participate in this  program?  Eligibility Criteria      1. The legislation requires that all grants be subject to the terms  and conditions of FTA's Formula (Section 5307) Program such as the  Americans with Disabilities Act requirements, labor protections and  others. In light of these requirements, what obstacles does this  present for non-traditional grant recipients? What actions, e.g.,  receiving funding as grantee subrecipients, are possible to ensure the  participation of non-traditional recipients in the program?     2. The legislation allows FTA to fund capital and operating costs  and clearly is directed to the development of new and expanded Job  Access and Reverse Commute services. In addition, one of the factors  for consideration in grant award criteria is the need for additional  services.     What activities and services should be included as eligible? Should  any activities or services be specifically excluded?     Welfare block grants (TANF & WtW) and other DOT funds can be used  to purchase transit passes for welfare recipients and low income  persons on existing transit routes and services. Should Job Access and  Reverse Commute also be available to fund transit passes?     3. What criteria should be used for screening candidates? The  legislation spells out eight (8) factors that must be considered in  awarding grants (see program description). Do these factors need  additional definition? How should they be weighted in the rating  process? Are there other criteria that should be addressed? Certain  populations suffer disproportionate unemployment rates. How should  these ``hard-to-serve'' populations be treated in the Job Access and  Reverse Commute Program?  Planning and Evaluation      1. The Job Access and Reverse Commute Program provides funding for  initiating programs whose long-term viability will depend upon  coordinating services and programming traditional sources of funding.  This will necessitate coordinating and integrating the Job Access and  Reverse Commute Program with existing DOT, DHHS, DOL and HUD funding  programs. What issues arise in achieving the blending of resources from  several Federal programs? What incentives and assurances could be  provided to facilitate this?     2. The legislation requires that MPOs select applicants within  urbanized areas with populations over 200,000 and that states select  applicants for urbanized areas with populations at or below 200,000, as  well as rural areas. How should this selection process by MPOs and  states take place and what documentation of participation should be  required to ensure that all stakeholders are involved in project  selection and development? In particular, how should low income  community representatives be involved in developing plans? Should sign- offs be required?     3. The legislation has a number of planning requirements for the  Job Access/Reverse Commute Program. For example, applicants must  document a regional transportation plan and any project must be  developed by a coordinated Transportation/Human Services planning  process.     Should applicants address each requirement separately or together?  What evidence of a collaborative decisionmaking process at the local  level among transportation, employment and other human service  organizations would satisfy these requirements?  [[Page 45928]]      4. The legislation has a number of coordination requirements.  Applicants must coordinate with the state agency that administers the  state welfare program. Applicants also must coordinate with affected  transit grant recipients and receive approval of such grant recipients.  What guidance should be given? How should this be documented?     5. The General Accounting Office must evaluate the effectiveness of  this program every six months, while DOT must prepare an evaluation  report within two years. What specific performance measures should DOT  use in assessing the effectiveness of this program? How could such data  be obtained and reported?  [Examples might include the number of additional jobs that became  accessible with reasonable commute times, the number of new riders or  new services, or some combination of the two, and area coverage by time  period]     6. What other comments or suggestions can you provide to ensure a  successful Job Access/Reverse Commute Program?      Issued: August 25, 1998. Gordon J. Linton, Administrator.

Marine insurance, which is considered a delivery service, is covered in ADS 322.5.1. (See ADS 322.5.1)  314.3  Responsibility 1. Geographic bureaus are responsible for ensuring that assistance instruments reflect USAID's policies on the financing of delivery services. 2. The Bureau for Management, Office of Procurement, Transportation and Commodities Division, Transportation Branch (M/OP/TC/TRANS) is responsible for coordinating commodity transportation activities for USAID, including authorizing waivers, determining when ocean carriers are unavailable, and approving charters, and responsible for administering USAID policies and essential procedures with respect to delivery services.  314.4  Definitions (See ADS GLOSSARY) AIR WAYBILL BOOKING NOTE/BOOKING AGREEMENT CARGO PREFERENCE CHARTER/CHARTER PARTY  3   Last Revised 05/03/2000  DELIVERY SERVICES DESPATCH DEMURRAGE DETENTION INTERMODAL TRANSPORTATION LINER SHIPMENT U.S. FLAG AIR CARRIER 314.5 POLICY The statements contained within the .5 section of this ADS chapter are the official Agency policies and corresponding essential procedures. 314.5.1 OCEAN SHIPMENT OF GOODS USAID shall follow the ocean transportation policies set forth in 22 CFR 228.21 regarding eligibility of ocean transportation service providers. The following sub-policies and essential procedures of 314.5.1 contain additional policies applicable only to ocean shipment of goods. (See Mandatory Reference, 22 CFR 228.21) E314.5.1 314.5.1a Ocean Shipment of Goods - N/A WAIVER REQUIREMENTS USAID shall follow the policies set forth in 22 CFR 228.55 and 228.56, when waiving ocean transportation eligibility requirements. Officials in the field who have authority to waive source requirements of commodities also have a limited amount of authority to waive the flag eligibility requirements of 22 CFR 228.21. (See ADS 103 for applicable redelegations) They may waive only for shipment of commodities for which they, or someone acting in that position, approved a commodity source waiver. (See Mandatory References, 22 CFR 228.55, 228.56, and 228.21) E314.5.1a Waiver Requirements USAID Missions must send a copy of each field-approved transportation waiver to the Bureau for Management, Office of Procurement, Transportation and Commodities Division, Transportation Branch (M/OP/TC/TRANS). 314.5.1b FREIGHT DIFFERENTIAL Section 640C of the FAA authorizes the use of grant funds to pay host countries for all or part of the differential between generally higher freight costs for U.S. flag vessels and lower cost, foreign flag vessels. USAID  4   Last Revised 05/03/2000  does not receive additional appropriations for this purpose; thus Assistant Administrators must decide when and to what extent USAID shall finance U.S. flag differential with funds available to the Bureau. E314.5.1b Freight Differential The following essential procedures must be followed in order to pay freight differential. 1) When the responsible Assistant Administrator decides to use funds to compensate recipients for all or part of the differential between freight costs for U.S. and foreign flag vessels, the geographic Bureau must ensure that adequate funds are available and reserved for that purpose. 2) The Department of Transportation, Maritime Administration (MARAD), determines a fair and reasonable differential between the proposed U.S. flag rate and the foreign flag rate. M/OP/TC/TRANS submits the request for differential determination to MARAD. 3) If U.S.-owned, excess local currency is available, M/OP/TC/TRANS determines if the carrier will accept the part of its payment corresponding to the differential in such currency. 314.5.1c DESPATCH, DEMURRAGE AND DETENTION It is USAID policy that the host country or the supplier must refund to USAID all despatch earned at the port of unloading on cost, insurance, and freight (C.I.F.) and cost and freight (C&F) shipments. When USAID finances the transportation costs for free on board (F.O.B.) or free alongside (F.A.S.) shipments, despatch earned at either the port of loading or unloading must be refunded to the extent that despatch exceeds demurrage incurred on the same voyage. Demurrage and detention costs are otherwise ineligible for USAID financing. E314.5.1c 314.5.1d Despatch, Demurrage and Detention - N/A DEAD FREIGHT USAID shall not finance the costs of dead freight. Dead freight is claimed by a vessel operator for booked or chartered space unoccupied or for cargo weight short-shipped according to the terms of the charter. E314.5.1d Dead Freight - N/A  5   Last Revised 05/03/2000  314.5.2  AIR TRAVEL AND TRANSPORTATION USAID shall follow the air transportation policies and essential procedures set forth in 22 CFR 228.22 regarding eligibility of ocean transportation service providers. (See Mandatory Reference 22 CFR 228.22)  E314.5.2  Air Travel and Transportation Suppliers, contractors, or grantees who claim payment for use of a nonU.S. flag air carrier must certify in writing with the claim for payment that United States flag air carriers were unavailable and state the reason.  314.5.2a  TRANS-SHIPMENT USAID shall finance costs incurred on air carriers under the flag registry of any free world country if: 1) Shipment is made on an air waybill issued by a U.S. flag air carrier covering shipment to the final destination; 2) The costs are part of the total cost paid to the U.S. flag air carrier; and 3) The first international portion of the flight is on the U.S. flag carrier.  E314.5.2a 314.5.3  Trans-shipment - N/A GENERAL TRANSPORTATION REQUIREMENTS The policies and essential procedures relating to charters, inland transportation, and delivery service charges apply to both ocean and air transport.  E314.5.3 314.5.3a  General Transportation - N/A CHARTERS USAID shall not finance the cost of any ocean or air charter covering full or part cargo if M/OP/TC/TRANS has not approved the charter prior to shipment. This includes charter parties, booking notes, and booking agreements when those forms of freight contracts incorporate provisions which are in addition to, or which deviate from, the terms of the carrier's standard bill of lading and tariff. If approval for a charter was not requested prior to shipment, M/OP/TC/TRANS may determine that retroactive approval is justified in a particular case such as when it was  6   Last Revised 05/03/2000  not known at the time of shipment that the transaction would be financed by USAID. Commodities shall be made ineligible for USAID financing if shipped under any ocean or air charter which has not received prior approval of M/OP/TC/TRANS. (See ADS 312.5.5) E314.5.3a Charters M/OP/TC/TRANS determines whether the proposed charter is eligible for USAID financing, the rate is fair and reasonable, and the proposed charter conforms to cargo preference requirements, if applicable. M/OP/TC/TRANS provides approval of the charter, subject to subsequent receipt of a copy of the charter, signed by both parties. Charterers must submit the following information concerning proposed charters to M/OP/TC/TRANS in order to obtain approval: 1) 2) 3) 4) 5) 6) 7) The name of vessel or air carrier; Flag; Commodity; Date of shipment; Ports of loading/discharge; Rate; and Demurrage/despatch provisions.  Suppliers who ship goods via charters must include a copy of the approved charter with the payment documentation submitted to USAID. 314.5.3b INLAND TRANSPORTATION USAID shall finance inland transportation beyond the point of entry in a cooperating country only when: 1) Intermodal transportation services covering the carriage of cargo from point of origin to destination is used with a through bill of lading; or 2) A waiver is authorized on the basis that the policy is clearly inconsistent with the purposes of the program. Among the considerations which may be cited in granting such a waiver are:  7   Last Revised 05/03/2000  a. An offset in the host country contribution to the project; b. Inability of the host country entity to budget for inland freight; and c. E314.5.3b 314.5.3c Enhanced security and timeliness of delivery.  Inland Transportation - N/A DELIVERY SERVICE CHARGES The price charged for delivery services, including ocean freight, must not exceed the prevailing price or the price paid by the supplier under similar circumstances to other customers. Ocean freight charges shall not exceed the established rate on file at the Federal Maritime Commission of the U.S, if any, for comparable shipments.  E314.5.3c 314.5.4  Delivery Service Charges - N/A VOLUNTARY AGENCIES - OCEAN TRANSPORTATION COSTS USAID has the authority to reimburse the American National Red Cross and registered U.S. private voluntary organizations for ocean transportation costs of goods, which have been donated to the organizations or purchased by them without USAID financing. a) Such shipments of donated or non-USAID financed goods which are not required to be on U.S. flag vessels by virtue of cargo preference requirements shall be eligible for financing on vessels under flag registry of any country in the free world. (See ADS 315) (Air shipments are covered by the policies in 314.5.2) b) USAID may reimburse transportation charges to points of entry, rather than ports of entry when: 1. The destination country is landlocked;  2. Ports cannot be used effectively because of natural or other disasters; 3. Carriers to a specific country are unavailable; or  8   Last Revised 05/03/2000  4. A substantial savings in cost or time can be achieved by the utilization of points of entry other than ports.

GX007-48-11139961	The  Federal Maritime Commission  (FMC)  was established in 1961 as an independent government agency, responsible for the regulation of shipping in the foreign trades of the United States. The Commission's five members are appointed by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate. The FMC is headquartered at  800 North Capitol Street, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20573 , with five  Area Representatives  around the nation.    The Federal Maritime Commission        Protects shippers,     carriers and others  engaged in the foreign commerce of the U.S.from restrictive rules     and regulations of foreign governments and from the practices of foreign-flag carriers     that have an adverse effect on shipping in U.S. trades;          Investigates , upon its     own motion or upon filing of a  complaint , discriminatory,     unfair, or unreasonable rates, charges, classifications, and practices of ocean common     carriers, terminal operators, and freight forwarders operating in the foreign commerce of     the U.S.;          Receives  agreements      among ocean common carriers or marine terminal operators and monitors them to assure that     they are not substantially anticompetitive or otherwise violative of the Shipping Act of     1984;          Receives, reviews, and maintains electronic  tariff filings  which contain the rates,     charges and rules established by water carriers operating between the United States and     another country;          Regulates rates, charges, classifications, rules, and regulations     contained in  tariffs of carriers controlled by     foreign governments  and operating in U.S. trades to ensure that such matters are just     and reasonable;          Licenses U.S.-based international ocean  freight forwarders ;          Requires bonds of  non-vessel     operating common carriers  (NVOCCs); and          Issues  passenger vessel     certificates  showing evidence of financial responsibility of vessel owners or     charterers to pay judgments for personal injury or death or to repay fares for the     nonperformance of a voyage or cruise.      The FMC's jurisdiction encompasses many facets of the maritime industry. However, it has no jurisdiction over vessel operations, navigation, vessel construction, vessel documentation, vessel inspection, licensing of seafaring personnel, maintenance of navigational aids or dredging. These activities are handled by other federal, state and local agencies.     The principal shipping statutes administered by the FMC are the Shipping Act of 1984 (46 USC app. 1710 et seq), the Foreign Shipping Practices Act of 1988 (46 USC app. 1701 et seq), and section 19 of the Merchant Marine Act, 1920 (46 USC app. 876). The FMC's regulations are published in  46 CFR 500  et seq.

Background      The Job Access and Reverse Commute Program has two major goals: to  provide transportation services in urban, suburban and rural areas to  assist welfare recipients and other low-income individuals in accessing  employment opportunities, and to increase collaboration among the  regional transportation providers, human service agencies and related  service providers, employers, metropolitan planning organizations  (MPOs), states, and affected communities and individuals.     The Job Access and Reverse Commute grant program is intended to  establish a regional approach to job access challenges through the  establishment of an area-wide Job Access and Reverse Commute  Transportation Plan. This plan is to be developed through a coordinated  transportation/human services planning process. Projects derived from  this plan support the implementation of a variety of transportation  services that may be needed to connect welfare recipients and other  low-income individuals to jobs and related employment activities. All  projects funded under the Job Access and Reverse Commute grant program  must be derived from such an area-wide plan.     While the projects must be planned in coordination with traditional  transit authorities, Metropolitan Planning Organizations and State  Departments of Transportation, other interested organizations could  take the lead in establishing the collaborative planning process or in  submitting a project application.     The Job Access and Reverse Commute grant program will support  projects that are implemented by a wide range of transportation  providers, but projects should be integrated within or coordinated with  the existing transportation system and make efficient and effective use  of existing transportation providers.     FTA is placing special emphasis on consultation with the community  to be served, including welfare recipients and low-income individuals,  individuals with disabilities, migrant workers, Native Americans and  community-based, faith-based and other organizations addressing the  interests of such individuals.     A Job Access project is designed to transport welfare recipients  and low-income individuals in urban, suburban, or rural areas to and  from jobs and activities related to their employment. Job Access  projects implement new transportation services or extend existing  services to fill the gaps that exist in many areas between where  welfare recipients and low-income persons live and employment  opportunities. Job Access and Reverse Commute grants funded under this  program may not be used for planning or coordinating activities and  cannot supplant existing sources of funding. Only new or expanded  services are eligible for funding.     Funding for Job Access and Reverse Commute grants is authorized at  $150 million annually. The Transportation Equity Act for the 21st  Century (TEA-21) provided guaranteed funding starting at $50 million in  fiscal year (FY) 1999, increasing by $25 million a year, and reaching  the full authorized $150 million in FY 2003. Funding above the  guaranteed level depends on congressional appropriations. No more than  $10 million annually can be used for grants designated as Reverse  Commute projects.     Program funding is divided in the following manner: sixty percent  (60%) for areas with populations 200,000 and above, twenty percent  (20%) for areas between 50,000-200,000 population, and twenty percent  (20%) for areas below 50,000 population.     Congress has appropriated $75 million for the Job Access and  Reverse Commute grants in FY 2000. Of this amount, Congress has  allocated $49.57 million for specific states and localities.  [[Page 13211]]  The remaining $25.4 million plus $4.2 million in unobligated FY 1999  funding is available for competitive award. The following chart  provides information on the amounts available for competitive projects  in each funding category, as well as the amounts reserved for specific  areas by each funding category.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                                       Approximate amounts for projects in areas                                                                        with population--(funding in millions)                                                                    ---------------------------------------------                                                                                                       Totals for                                                                      >200,000     50-      >50,000    all areas --------------------------------------------------------------------------------200,000------------------------- FY 2000 Funds Available...........................................      $45.0      $15.0      $15.0        $75.0 Amounts Reserved for Specific Projects............................       30.2        9.0       10.4         49.6     FY 2000 Funds Available for Competitive Award.................       14.8        6.0        4.6         25.4 FY 1999 Funds Not Allocated.......................................        1.0        2.8         .4          4.2                                                                    ---------------------------------------------     Total Funds Available for Competitive Award...................       15.8        8.8        5.0         29.6 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------      A 50 percent non-DOT match is required. Other Federal funds that  are eligible to be used for transportation costs can be used as part of  the match. Applicants should submit projects that can be started within  six months, but no later than within one year.  II. Changes in the Fiscal Year 2000 Solicitation  A. Area-Wide Job Access and Reverse Commute Transportation Plan      In FY 1999, it was not clear to some what the difference was  between the Regional Job Access and Reverse Commute Plan and the  Regional Transportation Plan developed by Metropolitan Planning  Organizations in urbanized areas as required by the FHWA/FTA Joint  Planning regulations. The plans required for the Job Access and Reverse  Commute program are short-term, operational service plans that are  meant to address gaps in current transit service that impede welfare  recipients and low-income persons from reaching jobs and employment  support services. The Regional Transportation Plan is a long-range plan  that identifies area transportation needs in light of projected growth  patterns and broadly charts major capital investments for  transportation system development to meet these projected needs. To  avoid confusion, we have renamed job access plans as Area-Wide Job  Access and Reverse Commute Transportation Plans.  B. Persons With Disabilities      Because of high employment experienced by persons with disabilities  and their more dispersed residential patterns, the Job Access and  Reverse Commute Plans are now required to identify projects which  address the mobility needs of this population in reaching employment  sites and support activities. Applicants also must submit with their  proposals a certification that the requirements of the Americans with  Disabilities Act (ADA) will be met. (See Appendix E)  C. Multi-Year Commitments      In FY 1999, a number of applicants sought multi-year commitments  from FTA. Because of limited funding available, recipients of FY 1999  Job Access and Reverse Commute funding seeking second year funding must  compete with other applicants. They will be evaluated based on  demonstrated progress in meeting the goals of their project, as well as  on the general evaluation criteria. A full application must be  submitted, including the transmittal memo, the proposal narrative and  plan and any relevant updates, and documentation of demonstrated  progress towards meeting project goals.  D. One-Step Application Process      In fiscal year 1999, FTA required applications to be submitted in  two stages: The project proposal, including the Job Access and Reverse  Transportation Plan, to be submitted first, and for applications  approved for funding, the supplementary documentation necessary to meet  the requirements of FTA's Section 5307 program. Some applicants wished  to have a one-step instead of a two-step application process. This  year, applicants may submit the entire application simultaneously,  including project proposal and the supplementary documentation, if they  choose to. (See Sections II and III) Those wishing to submit a single  application should work closely with the appropriate FTA regional  office. (See Appendix A for Regional Contacts)  E. Projects for Congressionally-Designated Areas      Applicants for projects supporting the development of local  transportation services and related promotional activities in  congressionally-selected areas must submit applications responding to  the same program selection criteria as applications for competitive  selection. Such applications shall demonstrate conformity with the  requirements of the Job Access and Reverse Commute program and will  provide information to demonstrate sound project management.  III. General Program Information  A. Authority      Section 3037 of the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century  (TEA-21).  B. Background      While two-thirds of all new jobs are in the suburbs, three-quarters  of welfare recipients live in rural areas or in central cities. In  metropolitan areas with extensive transit systems, studies have shown  that less than half of the jobs are accessible by transit. Even fewer  jobs are accessible by transit in areas with limited transit systems.  Many entry-level workers have difficulty reaching jobs during evening  or weekend shifts when transit services are frequently diminished or  non-existent. Work trips can also be complex, involving several  destinations including childcare providers. The problems can be more  challenging in rural areas where approximately 40 percent of rural  counties lack public transit systems and commuting distances generally  are longer than in urban areas.     Auto ownership among welfare recipients and low-income persons is  low. Most welfare recipients do not own cars and nearly 40 percent of  workers with annual incomes below $10,000 do not commute by car. In  1991, the median price of a new car was equivalent to 25 weeks of  salary for the average worker and considerably more for the low-income  worker.     Transportation is clearly a key barrier to those moving from  welfare to work. Providing a variety of new or expanded transportation  options for low-income workers, especially those who are receiving or  who have recently received welfare benefits, will increase the  [[Page 13212]]  likelihood that those workers will get and retain jobs.     In FY 1999, $75 million was appropriated and FTA awarded  approximately $71 million, $67.5 million for job access projects and  $3.4 million for reverse commute projects. Successful applicants in the  first round were announced on May 13, 1999 and included a variety of  services ranging from extended bus routes and specialized van services  reaching new employment sites to guaranteed ride home programs and late  night and weekend service providing additional hours of service.  Project descriptions can be found on the FTA website at  (www.fta.dot.gov/wtw). The remaining uncommitted funds are added to the  FY 2000 appropriation.  C. Scope      Improving mobility and advancing economic development are key  strategic goals of the U.S. Department of Transportation. Job Access  funds help improve mobility and economic opportunity for welfare  recipients and other low-income people through implementing new or  expanded transportation activities. Reverse Commute funds help improve  mobility to suburban employment opportunities for the general public,  as well as for welfare recipients and low-income people.  D. Eligible Applicants      Consistent with Section 3037 (b)(4)(A) & (B), local agencies and  authorities, non-profit organizations and designated recipients under  other FTA programs (usually a state entity or a regional transit  authority) are eligible applicants for Job Access and Reverse Commute  grant program funds. Local agencies and authorities include states,  local governments, metropolitan planning organizations (MPOs), public  transit agencies and tribal governments.     In urbanized areas with 200,000 population or more, MPOs select the  applicant(s). FTA urges MPOs to designate a single recipient to submit  a consolidated application in urbanized areas with such populations.     In small urbanized areas under 200,000 population and in non- urbanized, rural areas, states select the applicant. For areas between  50,000-200,000 population, applications forwarded to the state for  selection must be endorsed by the area MPO as projects that the MPO  would be willing to program in the Transportation Improvement Program  if the projects were selected for funding States are urged to serve as  the designated recipient for grants to small urbanized and non- urbanized areas. The selected grant recipient can sub-allocate funds to  other project participants.     Tribal governments must go through the state selection process but,  once selected, can choose to be sub-recipients of the state or, as  sovereign governments, can apply directly to FTA. States are encouraged  to work closely and expeditiously with tribal applicants. FTA regional  offices are available to facilitate this process.  E. Eligible Projects  1. In General     Job Access or Reverse Commute projects derived from an Area-Wide  Job Access and Reverse Commute Transportation Plan are eligible. Please  note that grants awarded under the Job Access and Reverse Commute  program may not be used for planning or coordinating activities.  (Section 3037(e)) However, metropolitan and statewide planning funds  made available under the FTA Section 5303 and 5313(b) programs and  FHWA/FTA Joint Planning, Section 49 CFR part 613, Section 23 CFR part  420, and state planning and research funds (SPR) can be used to fund  welfare to work transportation planning activities at a 100 percent  Federal share. Other funds, including the U.S. Department of Health and  Human Services' Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) and the  Department of Labor's Welfare-to-Work (WtW) administrative funds, can  also be used for transportation planning activities consistent with the  allowable uses of those resources. Lead applicants submitting  consolidated applications on behalf of a number of subrecipients may  apply for administrative costs up to ten percent of the grant request. 2. Job Access Project     A Job Access project is directed at implementing new or expanded  transportation services. These services are targeted at filling  transportation gaps and designed to transport welfare recipients and  low-income individuals to and from jobs and other employment-related  support services such as childcare and job readiness, training and  retention services. The Job Access Grant Program funds the capital and  operating costs of new or expanded transportation services.     Localities have wide flexibility in selecting service strategies  that are appropriate for their areas, including, but not limited to:     (a) Adding late night and weekend service;     (b) Providing a guaranteed ride home service;     (c) Initiating shuttle service;     (d) Extending fixed route mass transit service;     (e) Providing demand responsive van service;     (f) Sponsoring ridesharing and carpooling activities; and     (g) Encouraging bicycling.     To improve customer service and operating efficiency, localities  are encouraged to:     (a) Establish regional mobility managers or transportation  brokerage activities;     (b) Apply Geographic Information System (GIS) tools;     (c) Implement Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), including  customer trip information technologies;     (d) Integrate automated regional public transit and human service  transportation, including health services, information, scheduling and  dispatch functions; and     (e) Deploy vehicle position monitoring systems.     Job Access and Reverse Commute grants also may be used for  promoting the use of:     (a) Transit by workers with non-traditional work schedules,     (b) The purchase of transit vouchers by appropriate agencies for  welfare recipients and eligible low-income individuals;     (c) The development of employer-provided transportation such as  shuttles, ridesharing, carpooling; or     (d) The use of transit pass programs and benefits under Section 132  of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.     Marketing and advertising are examples of promotional activities  that could be undertaken to increase awareness of these transportation  options and their benefit to welfare recipients and low-income  individuals. Other locality-specific actions, strategies and linkages  that further the program goals also may be eligible.     While the marketing and promotion of transit pass programs are  eligible expenses under the Job Access and Reverse Commute Program, the  funding of individual transit passes is not an eligible expense.  Additionally, the construction of child care centers and other  employment support facilities at transit hubs are not eligible for Job  Access grants. Transit-oriented construction activities are eligible  under FTA's Section 5307, 5309 and 5311 Formula Grant programs. Transit  passes are eligible expenses under Temporary Assistance for Needy  Families (TANF) and Welfare-to-Work (WtW) programs.     Programs for private automobile ownership and repair are not  legally eligible under this grant funding  [[Page 13213]]  program. However, programs supporting carpooling and other forms of  mass transportation and shared-ride use, such as jitneys or special  paratransit service, are eligible. In cases where vehicle acquisition  is part of the program, vehicles must remain under the continuing  control of the agency receiving the grant. 3. Reverse Commute Project     A Reverse Commute project facilitates the provision of new or  expanded public mass transportation services for the general public  from urban areas, suburban and rural areas to suburban work places.  Reverse Commute services include, but are not limited to:     (a) Bus, train, car and van pooling services, van routes, and     (b) The purchase or lease by a nonprofit organization or public  agency of a van or bus dedicated to shuttling employees from their  residences and transit transfer points to a suburban work place and  back again.  F. Cost Sharing      The Job Access and Reverse Commute grant program is intended to  fill gaps in existing services and leverage other Federal, state and  local transportation-related funding to address the unmet needs of  individuals moving from welfare to work and other low-income  populations. Neither funds awarded under this grant program, nor funds  used to match the grants, can be used to replace any existing source of  funds.     The maximum DOT share of a grant under the Job Access and Reverse  Commute program may not exceed 50 percent of the total project cost.  The non-DOT share shall be provided in cash. If funds are matched from  other Federal programs, the funds must be applied directly to project  expenses. Revenues from service agreements are an eligible match, but  revenues from individual fares cannot be used as a match.     Transportation-eligible funding from Federal programs other than  the Department of Transportation may be used to match DOT funds. These  funds include but are not limited to:     a. Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF);     b. Community Services Block Grants (CSBG) and Social Services Block  Grants (SSBG) administered by the U.S. Department of Health and Human  Services;     c. Welfare-to-Work (WtW) formula and competitive grants  administered by the U.S. Department of Labor; and     d. Community Development Block grants (CDBG) and HOPE VI grants  administered by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development.     The prohibitions on the use of WtW funds for matching requirements  under section 403(a)(5)(C)(ii) of the Social Security Act do not apply  to Federal or state funds that provide transportation services. TANF  and WtW grants, when used as a match, may be expended only for new or  expanded transportation services and cannot be used for construction or  to subsidize current transit operating expenses. Such funds also must  supplement rather than supplant other state expenditures on  transportation.     Under the TANF Final Rule, investment in transportation services  for families who are employed, including the purchase of transit  vouchers, and investments used as match for the Job Access and Reverse  Commute program, do not constitute ``assistance'' and, therefore, do  not trigger the 60-month lifetime limit on receipt of Federal benefits  nor the reporting requirements of families receiving ``assistance.''  The Secretaries of Transportation, Labor, and Health and Human Services  released revised joint guidance on the use of WtW and TANF funds on  December 23, 1998, which is currently being updated to reflect the  changes in the final TANF rule. Guidance on TANF funds, including  specific examples of eligible transportation investments, is available  on the web at [http://www.acf.dhhs.gov/programs/ofa/funds2.htm].  (``Child Support Performance and Incentives Act of 1998,'' Pub.L. 105- 200, Sec. 403, ``Limitations on Use of TANF Funds for Matching Under  Certain Federal Transportation Programs.'').     More extensive guidance on the use of TANF and WtW funds for  transportation can be found on the FTA web site---- http:// www.fta.dot.gov/wtw.  G. Planning  1. Coordinated Transportation/Human Services Planning Process     Proposed Job Access and Reverse Commute projects must be derived  from an Area-Wide Job Access and Reverse Commute Transportation Plan  (see below) which results from a coordinated public transit and human  services transportation planning process. Any interested stakeholder  group in the area may initiate the planning process. FTA encourages  MPOs to serve as the regional forum in urbanized areas.     The planning process must include transportation planning officials  from state and metropolitan transportation planning organizations;  representatives from local transit agencies and other existing human  service, private, non-profit transportation operators; the agencies  administering TANF and WtW formula and competitive grants, and the  community to be served. Stakeholders within the community to be served  include welfare recipients and low-income residents as well as,  community and faith-based organizations, disability groups, farm and  migrant worker organizations and other groups representing the  interests of low-income persons.     The planning process also should include other stakeholders  organized transit labor representatives; employment, human service, and  child care support service providers; a variety of local and state  workforce development organizations including One-Stop Career Center;  public and assisted housing providers and community development  agencies; economic development agencies; employers and employer groups  (such as transportation management organizations and Chambers of  Commerce); elected representatives including tribal officials, and  state officials including mayors, county supervisors, state  legislators, governors and other state and local officials or their  designates, and other interested public citizens. 2. Area-Wide Job Access and Reverse Commute Transportation Plan     The purpose of collaboration is to develop a comprehensive area- wide approach to providing transportation services to welfare  recipients and low-income persons regardless of jurisdictional  boundaries. In general, the Job Access and Reverse Commute program  should be viewed as a catalyst to provide long-term mobility and access  to jobs for welfare recipients and low-income individuals. Any project  proposed for funding should be identified in the Area-Wide Job Access  Transportation Plan resulting from the above process. The Plan is not  meant to supersede, but to build upon existing area welfare-to-work  transportation planning activities. The Area Wide Job Access and  Reverse Commute Transportation Plan must:     a. Identify the geographic distributions of welfare recipients and  low-income people in the region;     b. Identify the geographic distributions of employment centers and  employment-related activities in the region;     c. Identify existing public, private, non-profit and human service  transportation services in the region;     d. Identify transportation gaps between the geographic  distributions of  [[Page 13214]]  people, as specified in section ``a,'' and employment, as specified in  section ``b,'' which are not currently served by the transportation  services, as specified in section ``c,''     e. Identify projects to address the gaps identified in section  ``d.'' Each project identification must include:     (1) the goals and objectives of the project     (2) the cost of the project;     (3) An explanation of how the project will maximize use of existing  transportation service providers and what mechanisms will be used to  integrate or coordinate the project services with the existing  transportation network; and     (4) Identification of any employer-provided or employer-assisted  transportation service strategies incorporated in the project.     Prioritize the project(s) identified in section ``e'' for funding  and implementation. This is a requirement.     The Area-Wide Job Access and Reverse Commute Transportation Plan  should build on and incorporate existing welfare to work transportation  planning activities.     In addition, since low-income persons with disabilities tend to be  more disbursed throughout the community than other low-income groups  that are geographically more concentrated, the Plan should include  specific identification of projects that will address the employment- related needs of this population. 3. The Role of Metropolitan Planning Organizations     MPOs are comprised of elected officials representing local  governments and transportation service providers within the  metropolitan area. They are responsible for adopting transportation  plans and improvement programs to address a region's unique  transportation needs and working with states to include these  priorities in statewide plans.     In regions with populations of more than 200,000, MPOs are  responsible for selecting applicants to be considered for Federal Job  Access and Reverse Commute grants. In regions with populations between  50,000 and 200,000, MPOs will recommend projects to the state, which  will select the applicants to be considered for Federal Job Access and  Reverse Commute grants.     This means that MPOs are responsible for the following:     (a) Determining that Job Access and Reverse Commute projects are  consistent with the regional long-range transportation plan.     (b) Ensuring that the submitted application contains prioritized  projects based on local need. Local priorities can be ascertained  through the collaborative human services/transportation planning  process and through consultation with the affected stakeholders.     (c) Endorsing and subsequently programming Job Access and Reverse  Commute projects into the area Transportation Improvement Program in  urbanized areas of over 50,000 population.     (d) Conducting the locally-developed public participation process  as required by Joint FHWA/FTA Planning Rule (23 CFR part 450, 49 CFR  part 613).     In all regions with MPOs, individual Job Access and Reverse Commute  projects must be adopted into the MPO's Transportation Improvement  Program (TIP) prior to receiving a grant. Because this entails a formal  review and project approval by the MPO Policy Board, FTA strongly urges  the partners developing the Area-Wide Job Access and Reverse Commute  Transportation Plan to communicate with the MPO at an early stage.  Further, as financial sustainability of a project is one of the  evaluation criteria, coordination with the agencies participating in  the MPO forum could be a critical factor in ensuring long-term support  for Job Access and Reverse Commute activities. 4. Statewide Transportation Planning Requirements     In all regions with populations of less than 200,000, the state is  responsible for selecting applicants, based on the recommendation of  the MPO in areas between 50,000-200,000 population. In addition, Job  Access and Reverse Commute projects selected for funding must be  endorsed by the state and incorporated into the statewide  transportation improvement program (STIP). Because this requires state  approval, FTA strongly urges the partners to communicate with state  officials, including the state DOT, at an early stage. In selecting  projects in rural areas, states should give priority to projects  providing service to places that are not currently served or are  underserved by public transit systems. States must prioritize the  projects for funding based on their analysis of local needs and service  effectiveness, as well as the collaboration achieved among  stakeholders. Given the sovereign nature of tribal governments, tribal  projects need not be included in the state's prioritization of  projects, though they must be included in the State Transportation  Improvement Program (STIP). 5. Improved Transportation Planning     The statewide and metropolitan transportation planning processes  mandated by TEA-21 promote ongoing, cooperative, and active involvement  of public transportation providers; the public; and state, metropolitan  and local government agencies in the development of state-wide and  metropolitan transportation plans and improvement programs. DOT expects  that the Job Access and Reverse Commute grant program will be a  catalyst for broadening the transportation planning process to better  integrate employment and social equity considerations.  J. General Grant Requirements      In addition to the project proposal based on the program-specific  requirements outlined in this notice, the applicant will be required to  submit appropriate certifications, assurances, and other documentation  necessary to meet the requirements of FTA's Urbanized Area Formula  Grant Program (Section 5307 program under Title 49, United States  Code). These include planning, environmental, school bus, charter,  procurement, labor protections and civil rights requirements, including  the Americans with Disabilities Act, Title VI, Environmental Justice  and Disadvantaged Business Enterprise, and drug and alcohol testing  requirements.     Applicants are encouraged to coordinate with affected transit labor  unions and to gather all information required by the U.S. Department of  Labor for labor certification as soon as possible to avoid delay in the  certification process upon grant selection. (See Appendix F for a  description of required information). Applicants must have the  financial, legal, and technical capacity to apply for and administer  projects. Copies of the Section 5307 program guidance (circular FTA  9030.1B ``Urbanized Area Formula Program: Grant Application  Instructions,'' Oct. 10, 1996) can be obtained from any FTA Regional  Office or electronically through the FTA website. (See Appendix D for  summary list.)  K. Performance Monitoring      FTA requires grant recipients to monitor the performance of their  Job Access and Reverse Commute services and to cooperate with the FTA  and General Accounting Office (GAO) national evaluations mandated by  law. Performance measures on: (1) Increasing access between welfare  recipients and low-income populations and employment sites; and (2) job  access/  [[Page 13215]]  reverse commute service effectiveness and efficiency will be sought.  The required performance measures for FY 1999 grants may be found on  FTA's web site (www.fta.dot.gov/wtw). Similar measures will be required  for FY 2000 grantees. Performance monitoring primarily will take place  through FTA standard project quarterly progress reports. Quarterly  reports and other information must be reported in accordance with FTA's  standard reporting requirements which are: (1) For projects in non- urbanized areas, reporting requirements for the 5311 Program (FTA C  9040.1E, page VI-6) annual status reports, annual financial status  reports, and annual Disadvantaged Business Enterprise (DBE) reports;  (2) for projects in urbanized areas, reporting requirements for the  5307 Program, Transit Database Reporting, annual audits and triennial  review.  IV. Guidelines for Preparing Grant Application      FTA is conducting a national solicitation for applications under  the Job Access and Reverse Commute Program. Grant awards will be made  on a competitive basis. FTA encourages both traditional transportation  recipients and a variety of new program entrants non-traditional  grantees in urban, suburban, and rural areas to participate in the  development of projects. To assist new program applicants in  particular, a two-step application process is available. Applicants  must submit a proposal that describes the proposed project for which  funding is sought and responds to the requirements outlined in this  Notice. If selected, the applicant must then document compliance with  the standard FTA requirements listed in Appendix D as well as complete  the securement of the financial match for the grant. Applicants may  elect to submit a single application containing both the proposal and  documentation of FTA standard requirements. Contact the appropriate FTA  regional office for guidance on meeting standard FTA program  requirements.  A. Grant Funding Amounts      Suggested grant sizes are identified below. (Applicants may request  smaller amounts from FTA.)     1. For urbanized areas with populations of over one million, FTA  expects to make grants of no more than $1 million. (Places with  populations of above 5 million may request funding above $1 million.)     2. For urbanized areas with populations greater than 200,000 and  less than one million, FTA expects to make grants of no more than  $500,000.     3. For urbanized areas with populations between 50,000 and 200,000,  FTA expects to make grants of no more than $200,000. States should not  submit applications that collectively exceed $1 million for this  category.     4. For rural areas (areas with populations of less than 50,000),  individual area grant applications generally should not exceed  $150,000. Collective grant applications by states for rural areas  should not exceed $1 million. Tribal applications may be considered  separately from the state funding limitation.  B. Project Scope      Proposed projects must be drawn from an Area-Wide Job Access and  Reverse Commute Transportation Plan and focus on new or expanded  transportation services. Applicants should focus on projects that can  be started  within six months, but no later than within one year of  grant award.  V. Application Development and Submission      To promote collaboration and reduce administrative paperwork, FTA  strongly encourages the submission of a consolidated application by a  single entity in urbanized areas and the submission of a consolidated  application by the state for rural areas. In both cases, funds may be  passed on to sub-recipients. Tribal governments submitting projects  that are selected by the state may choose to allow the state to include  their project(s) in the state's application or, as sovereign  governments, may apply directly to FTA. Since existing FTA grantees may  have already met or have on file information that will satisfy many of  the FTA requirements that apply to this program, FTA encourages states  and local transit agencies to serve as the single entity by submitting  applications on behalf of other entities.     Applicants must submit an original and two paper copies of the  application proposal to the appropriate FTA regional office.  Additionally, the application proposal is to be submitted via e-mail to  the FTA at: (JobAccess@fta.dot.gov). If an applicant is unable to  submit the application electronically via e-mail, the proposal should  be submitted on a 3.5 formatted disk for use on a personal computer  (PC). Documents should be submitted in Word or Rich Text Format (RTF).  Tables should be submitted in an Excel, or Tab Delimited Format.  Submissions must be postmarked by, as well as electronically sent,  where feasible, to FTA by May 9, 2000.     Applicants with access to TEAM, FTA's electronic grant making and  management system, should enter standard grant information into TEAM  once projects have been selected. For those applicants with access to  TEAM that choose the one-step application process and submit a single  comprehensive application (application proposal and standard section  5307 requirements), all standard grant requirement information also  should be entered into TEAM.     The application proposal should provide detailed information on  each project for which FY 2000 funds are being requested. The  application should include the following elements:  A. Transmittal Memo      Include the following information:     1. The Name of Applicant(s) and the Type of Agency (See Appendix G  for list of agency types).     2. A List of Sub Recipients and the Types of Agencies (See Appendix  G).     3. Name, Address and Telephone Number of a Person to be Contacted  for Additional Information.     4. Name, Title, and Complete Address of Person to be Notified if  Grant is Awarded.     5. Area(s) to be Served: Cities, Counties, Tribal Lands and States.     6. Project Summary. Two paragraphs to be used for press purposes  should the application be selected for funding. The summary should  contain: a brief description and list of the planning partners; a brief  overview of the transportation challenges in the area; a brief  description of the services to be funded; the intended project  beneficiaries and the identification of any employment support services  (e.g., training, child care, or housing) that will be coordinated with  the proposed transportation services.     7. A Brief Description of the Applicant's Organizational Capability  to Carry Out the Project.     8. Identification of the Area as a Designated Empowerment Zone,  Enterprise Community, or Champion Community, if applicable.     9.

C. Project Budget      Provide a project budget for each project. (see Appendix C).  VI. Grant Review Process      Applications for competitive funding are to be submitted to the  appropriate FTA Regional Office by the close of business TBD. FTA will  screen all applications to determine whether all required eligibility  elements, as  [[Page 13217]]  described in the following checklist, are present. FTA will select  projects based on what is most advantageous to the government,  considering, in addition to the award criteria, the time frame in which  projects can be implemented, Empowerment Zone or Enterprise Community  status, use of innovative approaches, such as transportation mobility  management/brokerage institutional arrangements and the application of  Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and Intelligent Transportation  Systems (ITS ) technologies, and geographic distribution of project  funding.  A. Project Eligibility Checklist--include the following:      This checklist is provided for the applicant to use to ensure that  the required documentation has been provided in the application.  Failure to provide the documentation listed below will make an  applicant's proposal non-responsive and it will not be evaluated  further.

Some of these items  are covered in the application, in which case you will not need to  submit information twice.  Approval Prerequisites  (On file with FTA, or to be submitted with application and updates  as appropriate) Opinion of Counsel Authorizing Resolution Current annual Certification and Assurances Civil rights submissions up-to-date     Title VI     Annual DBE Goal     DBE Program     EEO Program     ADA National Transit Database reports up-to-date Any outstanding oversight findings resolved or resolution plan and  schedule set  Additional Information  Project Budget Project Description Project Justification/Supporting Information as necessary Project Milestone Schedule Labor Union Description(s) (See Appendix F for a description of  required information) Environmental Review     Date of FTA's signing of FONSI (Finding of No Significant  Impact), or     Date of FTA's signing of ROD (Record of Decision) closing out  the EIS process, or     Grant applicant's Categorical Exclusion recommendation if  neither (a) nor (b) above applies Air Quality     Date of project level conformity determination by FTA, or     Applicant's recommendation concerning list of exemptions in the  conformity regulation (40 CFR Part 51) STIP--Date of Approval by FTA Request for copy of Master Agreement (If applicant does not have  latest one on file)  Appendix E: ADA Certification  Assurance of Nondiscrimination on the Basis of Disability      As required by U.S. DOT regulations, ``Nondiscrimination on the  Basis of Handicap in Programs and Activities Receiving or Benefiting  from Federal Financial Assistance,'' at 49 CFR part 27, implementing  the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended, and the Americans with  Disabilities Act of 1990, as amended, the Applicant assures that, as  a condition to the approval or extension of any Federal assistance  awarded by FTA to construct any facility, obtain any rolling stock  or other equipment, undertake studies, conduct research, or to  participate in or obtain any benefit from any program administered  by FTA, no otherwise qualified person with a disability shall be,  solely by reason of that disability, excluded from participation in,  denied the benefits of, or otherwise subjected to discrimination in  any program or activity receiving or benefiting from Federal  assistance administered by the FTA or any entity within U.S. DOT.  The Applicant assures that project implementation and operations so  assisted will comply with all applicable requirements of U.S. DOT 29  U.S.C. 794, and the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, as  amended, 42 U.S.C. 12101 et seq. At 49 CFR parts 27, 37, and 38, and  any applicable regulations and directives issued by other Federal  departments or agencies.  Appendix F: Information Required by the U.S. Department of Labor for  Labor Certification  I. Background      Federal Transit law requires that fair and equitable  arrangements must be made, as determined by the U.S. Department of  Labor (DOL), to protect the interests of employees affected by Job  Access and Reverse Commute grants. These interests include the  preservation of rights, privileges, and benefits under existing  collective bargaining agreements, the continuation of collective  bargaining rights, the protection of individual employees against a  worsening of their positions related to employment, assurances of  employment to employees of acquired mass transportation systems,  priority of reemployment, and paid training or retraining.     DOL processes the employee protection certifications required  under section 5333(b) in accordance with procedural Guidelines  published at 29 CFR 215.3 (July 28, 1999 Federal Register). The DOL  will process Job Access grants serving populations of 200,000 or  more by referring a copy of the grant application to labor  organizations representing affected employees and seeking the views  of organized labor and the grant recipients on proposed  certification terms. For grants serving populations under 200,000,  DOL will issue its certification without seeking the views of the  parties. In either case, the certification terms will be based on  existing protective arrangements used for prior FTA grants, if any,  or standard operating and/or capital arrangements developed by the  DOL where there are no existing arrangements. (Such existing  arrangements do not include the Special Section 13(c) Warranty that  is used for projects funded under the Section 5311 program.)     It is essential where there are questions regarding the DOL  certification process and/or information needed by DOL to obtain a  labor certification that the applicant contact the appropriate  Regional Office immediately. Where information lacks specificity, is  unclear or is missing, DOL will place the grant application in an  ``incomplete'' status until the necessary information is received.  Conceptual terms such as ``collaborative effort'' or ``working in  conjunction with * * *'' or ``services will be provided to assist *  * *'' do not provide the specificity necessary for DOL to process a  grant.     Upon receipt of a grant application, DOL will determine whether  there is sufficient information to process the grant application.  Because it is DOL's responsibility to address the protections  afforded employees through the certification of appropriate  protections, it must examine the activities of each subrecipient  under the grant in order to frame a protective arrangement  appropriate to the activity funded. The following information is  needed by DOL to process all Job Access and Reverse Commute grant  [[Page 13220]]  applications (including those areas under 200,000).  II. Description of Required Information      DOL needs the following information to process a grant  application for labor certification.     a. Project Description (Brief). This section should contain a  brief, succinct description of what is in the project. This  generally would cover the major budget line items.     b. Project Description (Detail). This section should provide a  complete description of each activity to be undertaken. It should  include funding information, what the project application is for,  how and where line items will be used whether the project is new  service, and a description of the operating service area of the  recipient or subrecipient. If there is more than one subrecipient  under a grant, this information must be developed for each  subrecipient's portion of the project.     c. Grantee Contact Person. This information is not contained in  the TEAM application. Under ``Project Details'' please enter the  name of a contact person for the grantee. In addition, if the grant  will ``pass through'' funding to one or more subrecipients or other  public entities, enter the full name of the subrecipient or other  public entity, a contact name, mailing address, telephone number and  facsimile number for each of these.     d. Union Information. This information is not contained in the  TEAM application. Under ``Project Details'' please (1) identify all  the labor organizations that represent transit employees of the  recipient and each subrecipient, and (2) identify any other  transportation providers which operate in the service area of the  recipient and the subrecipients and all labor organizations that  represent employees of these other transportation providers. Because  employee protections are not limited to the employees of the grant  recipient, other service area providers must be identified. Please  note that a useful reference for obtaining labor union information  is contained in Directory of U.S. Labor Organizations, 1999 edition.  This may be purchased from the Bureau of National Affairs Books,  P.O. Box 7814, Edison, N.J. 08810-7814. Telephone orders: 1-(800)- 960-1220.     For each local of a nationally affiliated union, the applicant  must provide the name of the national organization and the number or  other designation of the local union. (For example, Amalgamated  Transit Union Local 1258.) Since DOL makes its referral to the  national union's headquarters, there is no need to provide a local  contact in these situations.     However, for each independent labor organization (i.e., a union  that is not affiliated with a national or international  organization) the local contact information will be necessary (name  of organization, contact person, mailing address, telephone number,  facsimile number).     e. Extended Budget Descriptions. This must provide a project  description and project justification for most line items. There are  few line items that need no additional description and/or  justification. If there are subreceipients under a grant, indicate  which subrecipient will receive funds under each budget description.     If you have any questions, please contact the U.S. Department of  Labor, Division of Statutory Programs, at (202) 693-0126   Appendix G: Agency Classifications   State Government     State DOT     State Human Services     State Labor/Employment     Other State Agencies Indian Tribe Transportation Providers     Public Transportation Providers     Regional Public Transit Authority     State Transit Agency     City Transit Agency     County Transit Agency     Private for Profit Companies     Bus     Taxi     Specialized Service (e.g., Medicaid Operator)     Other     Non-Profit Organizations     Human Services Transportation Provider     Community-Based Organization     Other Transportation Planning Organizations     MPO     Council of Governments     Other Local governments--General Purpose     County Government     City Government Human Sevice Agencies     Local County/City Public Human Svcs Agency     Local County/City Welfare Agency     Local County/City Workforce Development Agency     Local Public Housing Agency     Non-Profit Service Providers     Human Support Services (e.g., Child Care, Substance Abuse)      Employment (e.g., Job Training,   Job Placement) Economic Development Agencies     Local/County Government     Non-Profit Corporations Private Nonprofit Agencies     Community Action Agencies & Organizations     Community-Based Organizations     Faith-Based Organizations     Other private nonprofit organizations Business Organizations     Chamber of Commerce     Transportation Management Organization Other Organizations  [FR Doc. 00-5810 Filed 3-9-00; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 4910-57-U

Wes Baysinger, Director Materials Management CS/mm Attach  Copy to:  Clerk of the Board John Werbach, Library District Harry Courtright, Library District Vickie Terbovich, Library District Carmen Ledesma, Materials Management   SERIAL 02073-RFP  SMART CARD FOR LIBRARY DISTRICT 1.0 INTENT: The Maricopa County Library District is seeking proposals which serve the library marketplace for a single product that performs the following functions while utilizing a stored value smart card: 1) Print Management -- including print cost recovery, 2) Public Computer Time Management, 3) Public Computer Reservation System, 4) Public Computer Session Personalization. MARICOPA COUNTY LIBRARY DISTRICT The Maricopa County Library District (MCLD) provides library services to residents of Maricopa County, Arizona and operates twelve (12) facilities in the county compose of: two (2) regional libraries and ten (10) community libraries. The Library District also provides outreach/bookmobile services. A third regional library is estimated for opening sometime in late October of 2002. Maricopa County Library District has more than 235,000 registered borrowers and a service population that reaches more than 600,000 people, in an area that covers more than 9,226 square miles. MCLD provides the public with access to more than 300 computers district wide that are capable of accessing the Internet as well as access to many other software applications loaded locally. Public PC access allows end users to print to various shared printers and allows MCLD to recover the costs associated with the printing process. MCLD estimates that a single medium sized branch library with 40 public Internet access PCs is generating an average of approximately 850 print transactions monthly or $406.00 per month. Based on County estimates, four (4) similar sized branches can generate nearly 40,000 print transactions or approximately $20,000. The focus of MCLD is the unincorporated areas of the county as well as other municipalities who contract with the County to provide library services. MCLD does not operate a ""main library"" but does operate regional service centers that are typically housed in larger facilities containing a greater number of public access computers for Internet access. Several of MCLD's community libraries are located in Hispanic communities where the majority of residents speak Spanish only and represent a wide-range of educational and economic levels. The various MCLD library locations are: North Central Regional (NE Phoenix), Southeast Regional (Gilbert), Aguila, El Mirage, Fountain Hills, Gila Bend, Guadalupe, Laveen, Litchfield Park, Queen Creek, Sun Lakes, Surprise. Access to MCLD's web site can be obtained through the following url: http://mcld.maricopa.gov The Library District currently uses DRA (Data Research Associates) Classic Automation system and corresponding modules, plus Internet Explorer version 5.5 (SP2) on all computer work stations with Internet access.  2.0  SCOPE OF WORK: 2.1 TAX: No tax shall be levied against labor. Bid pricing to include all labor, overhead, tools and equipment used, profit, and any taxes that may be levied. It is the responsibility of the bidder to determine any and all taxes and include the same in bid price. 2.2 GENERAL REQUIREMENTS: The software and hardware solution desired must utilize a smart card technology which includes an encrypted token that completely interfaces with the current and future library automated system 2   SERIAL 02073-RFP software currently used by MCLD and future systems which may be chosen by the MCLD. This means that the product must interface with SIP I & SIP II protocols in addition to NISO/XML interface protocol when it will be adopted by MCLD. SIP and NISO/XML protocols are mechanisms that connect the customer transaction database from the library's automated system to the software that manages the three-fold system outlined in this request for proposal. Such software must treat each branch of the Maricopa County Library District as a separate, yet integrated facility, while at the same time allowing flexibility related to the number of individual public computer workstations housed in that branch facility. The proposed solution should support both on-line transactions (e.g. printing, fines) and off-line transactions (e.g. photocopies, microfiche printers) using the stored value on the library smart card. The stored value of the library smart card should have hardware security mechanisms in place to avoid `buffering', and the on-chip purse should contain the data required to provide server account reconciliation. The library district may elect to purchase other equipment such as offline controllers, specialized keyboards with dedicated smart card readers, which must be compatible with the stored value purse of a library smart card. All transaction related software modules should run on computers utilizing Windows98, Windows NT, Windows 2000 and Windows XP operating systems. 2.2.1 Operating System Platforms Supported and Integration with Existing Computer Environment: The software application provided for the end-user/customer/public access computers must successfully operate on Windows NT, Windows NT (Gates Foundation Configuration), and Windows 2000 Professional operating systems. The software application provided for the end-user/customer/public access computers should also successfully operate in legacy Windows 98 operating system, and the potential provider should anticipate customer deployment of other advanced operating systems such as Windows XP Professional operating system and plan functionality in this system environment as well. The software application provided for end-user/customer/public access computers must successfully operate with the existing security applications  Fortress, Full Control, Library Centurion Guard, Deep-Freeze and other like security applications used in typical library public access computing environments. The software application provided for end-user/customer/public access computers must integrate with Maricopa County Library District's existing and future library automation systems using the SIP-I or SIP-II interface. The software solution should provide the SIPII functionality to interact with the SIP-I or SIP-II functionality on the library's automation system. Further, the software application must be scalable to interface and operate with the NISO/XML interface protocol or similar protocol associated with library automated system software in the marketplace. The operating system environment for server side management of the anticipated system shall be Windows NT Server, Windows 2000 Server or Windows XP Server running SQL Server 7.0 or SQL Server 2000 to manage the customer database interface environment. The networking and communications protocols for Maricopa County Library District are primarily Microsoft TCP/IP and VMS or Unix versions of TCP/IP Protocols. The system shall run on a server containing an Intel based Pentium III or IV processor containing not less than 512 MB of RAM, containing 18-36 Gigabytes of disk space while running Windows 2000 Server or Windows NT Server or similar operating system. DBMS Standard  Microsoft SQL Server 2000 or SQL Server 7.0 Since an RDBMS is required, it should be a standardized product such as already being used at the Library District 3   SERIAL 02073-RFP The solution proposed must successfully be installed in at least three (3) customer sites that contain 10 or more branches or have a similar population served and have been operational for at least one (1) year. Product must demonstrate installations within public library sites of similar size and scope as customer reference sites are desirable. 2.2.2 Smart Card Specifications: The preferred system must employ an Integrated Circuit Contact Smart Card and twofactored secure patron log-on and log-off in addition, the Smart Card must have the ability to include other technologies including Bar-Code, Magnetic Stripe, RF Proximity Antenna. The proposed system must have the ability to migrate from password / PIN log on protection to Biometric log-on and the Smart Card solution must have the ability to contain a stored cash value that can be used in both on-line and off-line payment schemes. 2.2.2.1 Other Smart Card Requirements        Must have the method to register the Smart Card to a database that will enable rules to be applied to the patron session. The library must have the ability to select from various Smart Card readers that can fit a wide range of needs. The Smart Card must remain in the PCs reader for the entire session. The system must recognize in real time when a smart card is inserted or removed. When the Smart Card is removed, the preferred system must prompt the user for instructions on whether the patron is pausing the session or is logging off. If the customer does not respond to the ""pause / log-off"" prompt, the PC must automatically recycle to the library's preferred session starting point without displaying the patron's open screens. MCLD must have the ability to dynamically set the amount of time the system must wait until it recycles between the removal of the smart card and failure to respond to the ""pause: log-off"" prompt.  2.2.3  Print Management: The proposed solution shall support printers connected directly to the client machine, connected via networked to the client machine and connected to a spooling station for later release by the customer. All print management related software modules must support Windows 98, Windows NT, Windows 2000 Professional and Windows XP operating systems, even when PostScript print drivers are used. Print management software must allow customers to name a print job and provide an optional coversheet for each print job to support customer privacy. System must allow for the purchase of print ""guest"" cards that may charge diffe rent prices per copy than those prices assessed from library smart card holders.  2.2.4  Print Pricing: The proposed solution shall should allow for printing to multiple printers, and allow for different rates to be assigned to different printers. The proposed solution must support different printing rates for different types of documents. As an example, a higher rate may be charged for color laser documents than is assessed for black and white laser printed 4   SERIAL 02073-RFP documents. Another example might be specific costs for larger prints such as poster sizes. The proposed solution must support both a price per page and a price per complete document. . e.g. price per ""packet"" of documents. The proposed solution must provide staff with a reporting mechanism in both paper and electronic version formats in order to obtain information about revenue collected per print job, per hour, per day, week, month or year. The proposed solution shall allow staff intervention for release of individual customer print jobs when necessary for customers that may be experiencing problems with their cards. 2.2.5 Spooling Station for Customer Print Release: (Optional Feature) The proposed solution should support an optional spooling station where library customers can release and pay for print jobs when they are ready to pick up the printouts. The release station must confirm the cost of each job, and it must allow library users to confirm the release or deletion of each print job. The spooling station must hold un-printed print jobs for a period defined by the library before deleting the files. When an end-user/patron inserts their smart card into the car reader at the spooling station, the print jobs for that user and only that user must display. If the user is an administrator/librarian, the administrator must be presented with the option to display all un-printed jobs on the spooling station. 2.2.6 PC and Resource Management: The proposed software shall provide Maricopa County Library District customers the ability to schedule individual public access computer resources. Such software must also provide library staff with the ability to schedule groups of public access computer resources. Thus allowing library cardholders to use library resources ""just in time"", while providing staff with flexibility to schedule training sessions as necessary. 2.2.7 Scheduling of Library Public Access Computers: The proposed software solution must allow machines to be grouped into logical sets, or queues for the purposes of scheduling and must provide a web-based interface that must allow end-user/library customers to reserve the use of a PC from inside the library or from another computer outside the library from the library public web site. This interface provided shall provide a selection of the desired group of computers, a listing of the currently waiting users in anonymous form, and an estimated average waiting time for the next to get a next available reservation. The sign-up page for the web interface described above should only require the enduser/patron to specify a unique identifier, a screen name, and the desired group of computers on which to be scheduled. The web-based schedule sign-up page must allow machine schedule requests to be requested as the next available machine or as a specific machine at a specific date and time. 5   SERIAL 02073-RFP The web-based schedule sign-up page should provide a calendar function to allow patrons library customers to select a date from 365 days a year, seven (7) days per week, or days per week that individual library branch has open hours on upon which to reserve a machine. In addition, the scheduling function must not accept reservations for dates and times on which all available machines have been scheduled or for days when specific branches may not be typically open. The software solution must also provide a Windows-based interface that must allow endusers/patrons to reserve a PC. This interface must provide a selection of the desired group of computers, a listing of the currently waiting users in anonymous form, and an estimated average waiting time for the next to get a next available reservation. The sign-up page for the Windows interface described above must require the enduser/customer to provide their library smart card identification number, a screen name, and a selection from the desired group of computers on which to be scheduled. The Windows-based schedule sign-up page must allow machine schedule requests to be requested as the next available machine or as a specific machine at a specific date and time. The Windows-based schedule sign-up page must provide a calendar function to allow patrons to select a date on which to reserve a machine. In addition, the scheduling function should not accept reservations for dates and times on which all available machines have been scheduled. The software solution must provide a listing of the current status of the user wait list for each group of computers and this list must update automatically to provide current wait list information to the end-users/patrons. The software solution should provide alternative means to displaying the wait list status to patrons that can be seen from at least forty (40) feet by a person with good eyesight. When a machine becomes available, the software solu tion must assign the machine to the next user in the queue and when a machine is assigned to a customer, only the assigned customer must be able to log on to the machine for a period of time to be defined by the administrator/librarian for each computer group. If an end-user/patron does not sign on within this reservation hold period, the machine must be released and assigned to the next user in the queue. If a machine is available with no one currently using the machine, an end-user/patron must be able to sit at the machine and sign on without signing up for a machine reservation. The software solution's scheduling function must recognize this valid log on and not assign this machine to another customer during this customer's session. 2.2.8 Reservation Assignment: When a machine becomes available, the software solution must assign the machine to the next user in the queue and when a machine is assigned to a user, only the assigned user must be able to log on to the machine for a period of time to be defined by the administrator/librarian for each computer group. 6   SERIAL 02073-RFP If an end-user/patron does not sign on within this reservation hold period, the machine must be released and assigned to the next user in the queue. If a machine is available with no one currently using the machine, an end-user/customer must be able to sit at the machine and sign on without signing up for a machine reservation. The software solution's scheduling function must recognize this valid log on and not assign this machine to another user during this user's session. 2.2.9 Abnormal Ending of User Session When a user's session abnormally terminates due to a power failure or other system failure, the software solution must assign the user to the next available machine so that they may complete their session. The software solution must recognize when no one is waiting to use a computer in a scheduling group. If no one is waiting to use a computer in a scheduling group, existing users should be automatically offered extended time. When a user is given automatic extended time, they should notified that they are in extended time mode, and the text of this message must be definable by the administrator/librarian for each group of computers. The administrator/librarian must have the ability to enable/disable automatic extended time on a computer group basis. 2.2.10 Block Scheduling: The software solution must allow an administrator/librarian to schedule a block of specific computers for a specific date and time. When a reservation for a block of computers is assigned to the reserved machines, the computers must be locked to prevent unscheduled users from logging on to the machines. Inserting an administrator's card and entering an appropriate password must release the machine for sign-on by the next user. This must allow a trainer to release machines for use in a class when the students are assembled. 2.2.11 PC Time Management: The software solution must control how much time an end-user may use a machine per day and control how much time an end-user may use a machine per session. If no one is waiting, the software solution must allow end-user/customer to work in extended mode. System software must supply at least two warning messages to alert customers that they have reached the extent of allotted time on the public computer if others are waiting to use existing computer workstations. An administrator/librarian must be able to determine the text of the messages that will appear for the session time out warnings. As described the software solu tion must allow machines to be grouped into logical sets, or queues, and session limits, warning messages, and warning times must have the ability to be set independently for each group of computers. When an end-user/patron session time expires, the software solution must end the user's session and reset the computer to standard settings for that organization. 2.2.12 Session Pause Features: When an end-user/customer ends a session by removing the smart card, the software solution must prompt the customer with an option to pause the session. This option must be provided to the customer upon the removal of the card from the keyboard card reader 7   SERIAL 02073-RFP through an automatic dialog prompt. A dialog prompt should be displayed for a customizable pre-determined period of time. If the user chooses to pause their session, the machine screen must be covered with a pause message for a period of time to be determined by the library. If the user chooses not to pause the session, the session is immediately terminated, and the machine is reset. During a paused session, the user's session clock must continue to run so as not to allow unwarranted session extension. Upon returning to a paused session, the user needs only to re-insert their smart card to resume the session. No other user can use this particular computer during the paused session. The system must reset itself if customer does not return to the specific computer after a pre-specified period of time. The pause message that covers the screen of a paused ses sion must have a field to allow an administrator's/librarian's password to be entered. When an administrator inserts their card and enters an appropriate password, the software solution should unlock the paused machine and end the session making it ready for the next library customer. 2.2.13 PC Reset: When an end-user/patron removes their smart card from the reader, and the user chooses not to pause a session as described above, the system must immediately reset the machines and end the session. Upon the session ending, the software solution must immediately reset the machine by closing all browser windows, clearing the browser cache and clearing the browser history. All open browser windows should close, and the default environment, including cookies, favorites, and browser history should be reloaded on the computer. If the library has a default home page, the software solution must open a browser in preparation for the next user. In addition to closing and resetting all browser windows, the software solution must close all applications, except those applications which may have been defined in an exception list. The software solution must provide an exception list of applications that are not reset and closed upon session reset. 2.2.14 Access Controls: The software solution should provide for an administrator or library-defined set of access control levels. Any number of access control lists can be defined. The access control levels are defined by a categorized list of uniform resource locators (URLs) and with a user defined list (UDL). The UDL in the software must provide GRANT/DENY override rules to the categorized list. The access level can be customized for an individual user, for everyone in an access level, and for everyone in a library or not as the library computer use policy designates. The software solution must provide a set of exception sites to which users can browse without a smart card or authentication. Customers may elect to browse only the library 8   SERIAL 02073-RFP catalog website as an example and might elect not to use other Internet or electronic resources provided by the library. The access control rules can be applied to all Internet communications regardless of the browsing application used, including Microsoft Word, Windows Explorer, and Windows Recycle Bin. The application of the access control rules must not require additional network hardware, such as a Proxy server, to act as a costly gateway or bottleneck to network performance. The application of the access control rules should be Internet Service Provider independent, meaning that access to a particular Internet Service Provider or network subnet addressing must not be required. The software solution should be capable of restricting access to computers based on a library customer's access level. The software must, as defined by the library system administrator change a customer's access to an alternative access level or prevent customers of selected access levels from using the machines. (This can allow the library to grant privileges to a parent or guardian as an example for temporarily restricting access to specific resources, if the library were to provide for such options within a computer acceptable use policy.) 2.2.15 Strong Authentication: The software solution must provide strong two-factor authentication of users and administrators. The secure authentication must use smart card technology to assure the integrity of authentication and provide security of customer information. The authentication process must use a `card present' strategy that immediately indicates that a user has left a machine when the card is removed. The software solution should provide two modes of authentication. In browseauthentication, the software must provide time management and authentication of the user session when the user tries to access an Internet site that is not on the library's exception list. Also, the software solution must apply the user's access level rules and the machine's access level overrides to the user's attempts to browse Internet sites. The software solution must provide a second mode of authentication for authenticate always. In authenticate always mode, the software solution must provide time management and authentication for any application use, unless the application is on an application exception list outlined by the library. The software solution must provide the library with the ability to build an exception list of applications, which can also be accessed without authentication by the end-user/patron.  2.2.16  Reporting Mechanisms: The software solution must provide extensive on-line reports, including but not limited to, financial summaries, financial detail by date, customer financial detail by date, session data by machine by date, and session use by access level by date. Financial reports must provide the option to run the report with customer barcode identification number, customer name or other configuration as determined by data fields available at the discretion of the library. 9   SERIAL 02073-RFP The financial reports must be available for a predefined set of dates and for any custom range of dates. Online financial summary reports must be provided that show the types of transactions, the subtotal amount of each transaction type, and a total of all transactions for the reported time period. From an online financial summary report, an administrator/librarian must be able to select dates or transaction types to get to an online financial detail for the date or transaction type. From the online financial detail, the administrator/librarian must be able to select a detail report for a specific transaction, including transaction date, transaction amount, and user name (if enabled). 2.2.17 Personalization of Customer Services Interface: When customer has securely authenticated, the proposed solution must be able to recognize whether the end-user/patron has opted to enable personalization. Personalization is defined as the ability of a customer at a public computer within the library environment to save individual preferences such as bookmarks or favorite browsing sites on the Internet. If end-user/patron has not opted to enable personalization, the proposed solution should load the default personal profile as defined by the library. If the end-user/patron has opted to enable personalization, the proposed solution should load the users individualized profile. The personal profile must include cookies, favorites, and history for the browser, which has been standardized upon for use by the library. Personal profile functionality should be supported on Microsoft Internet Explorer Version 5.0 and higher and Netscape Version 4.7 and higher. Support of other browsers such as Opera should also be supported.  3.0  SPECIAL TERMS & CONDITIONS: 3.1 CONTRACT LENGTH: This Request for Proposals is for awarding a firm fixed price contract to cover a two (2) year period. 3.2 OPTION TO EXTEND: The County may, at their option and with the approval of the Contractor, extend the period of this agreement up to a maximum of three (3), one (1) year options. The Contractor shall be notified in writing by the Materials Management Department of the County's intention to extend the contract period at least thirty (30) calendar days prior to the expiration of the original contract period. 3.3 INDEMNIFICATION AND INSURANCE 3.3.1 INDEMNIFICATION To the fullest extent permitted by law, the CONTRACTOR shall defend, indemnify, and hold harmless the COUNTY, its agents, representatives, officers, directors, officials, and employees from and against all claims, damages, losses and expenses, including but not limited to attorney fees, court costs, expert witness fees, and the cost of appellate proceedings, relating to, arising out of, or alleged to have resulted from the acts, errors, omissions or mistakes relating to the performance of this Contract. CONTRACTOR'S 10   SERIAL 02073-RFP duty to defend, indemnify and hold harmless the COUNTY, its agents, representatives, officers, directors, officials, and employees shall arise in connection with any claim, damage, loss or expense that is attributable to bodily injury, sickness, disease, death, or injury to, impairment, or destruction of property, including loss of use resulting therefrom, caused by any acts, errors, omissions or mistakes in the performance of this Contract including any person for whose acts, errors, omissions or mistakes, the CONTRACTOR may be legally liable.

The COUNTY reserves the right to request and to receive, within 10 working days, certified copies of any or all of the herein required insurance policies and/or endorsements. The COUNTY shall not be obligated, however, to review such policies and/or endorsements or to advise CONTRACTOR of any deficiencies in such policies and endorsements, and such receipt shall not relieve CONTRACTOR from, or be deemed a waiver of the COUNTY'S right to insist on strict fulfillment of CONTRACTOR'S obligations under this Contract. The insurance policies required by this Contract, except Workers' Compensation, shall name the COUNTY, its agents, representatives, officers, directors, officials and employees as Additional Insureds. The policies required hereunder, except Workers' Compensation, shall contain a waiver of transfer of rights of recovery (subrogation) against the COUNTY, its agents, representatives, officers, directors, officials and employees for any claims arising out of CONTRACTOR'S work or service. 3.4.1 Commercial General Liability.

ACTION: Notice of availability of funds; solicitation for grant  proposals.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  [[Page 16791]]  SUMMARY: The U.S. Department of Transportation's (DOT) Federal Transit  Administration (FTA) announces the solicitation of grant proposals for  Fiscal Years (FY) 2002 and 2003 funding provided under the Job Access  and Reverse Commute (JARC) grant program, as authorized under Section  3037 of the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century (TEA-21).  The FY 2002 DOT Appropriations Act provides $125 million for the JARC  Program, the guaranteed funding level under TEA-21. In the FY 2002  Conference Report the appropriators indicated their desire for  $109,339,000 of this amount to be awarded to specified States and  localities. These congressionally-specified areas were included in  FTA's 2002 Annual Apportionment Notice, published in the Federal  Register on January 2, 2002. That notice can be found at:   http://www.fta.dot.gov/library/legal/federalregister/2002/fr1202a.pdf . States,  localities, and private nonprofit agencies listed in the report, along  with States, localities, and private nonprofit agencies not so listed,  must follow the application procedures provided in this notice to apply  for JARC funding. The guaranteed funding level for the JARC program is  $150 million for fiscal year 2003, the final year of the program under  FTA's current authorizing legislation. This announcement describes the  conditions under which proposals will be received for the FY 2002 and  FY 2003 JARC competitive grant program and the criteria that FTA will  apply in evaluating project proposals. It includes all of the  information needed to apply for JARC competitive grants.     This announcement is available on the U.S. Department of  Transportation's FTA website at:   http://www.fta.dot.gov/wtw .  DATES: All proposal applications for funding of continuation projects  must be submitted to the appropriate FTA regional office (see Appendix  B) and be received no later than June 7, 2002. Proposal applications  for new projects must be submitted no later than July 8, 2002, but  applicants must notify the appropriate regional office of their intent  to apply for funding no later than June 7, 2002. The 60-day deadline  will allow FTA to inform Congress of demands for FY 2003 funds before  deliberation on FTA's fiscal year 2003 budget. The selection of  projects to be funded will be announced upon completion of the  evaluation process.  FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: the appropriate FTA Regional  Administrator (see Appendix B) for proposal-specific information and  issues. For general program information, contact Sue Masselink, Office  of Program Management, (202) 366-2053, email  sue.masselink@fta.dot.gov .  A TDD is available at 1-800-877-8339 (TDD/FIRS).

Fiscal Years 2002 and 2003 Program Highlights  A. Projects for Congressionally-Designated Areas      Applicants for JARC projects in congressionally-designated areas  must submit applications responding to the program selection criteria  and will be evaluated, scored, and ranked against all other applicants.  Consistent with statutory requirements for competitive selection of  projects, funds will be allocated among all projects, including those  in congressionally-designated areas, based upon their ranking in the  competitive evaluation process and other factors as set forth in this  notice.  B. Multi-Year Funding      Because recipients of JARC funds have expressed the need for multi- year funding through the early stages of project implementation and  because FY 2003 is the last year of the authorization period for the  JARC program, FTA will consider multi-year funding. To give effect to  this new policy, FTA will give priority to funding continuation of  previously selected projects. FTA is soliciting applications for  funding from those applicants previously funded under the JARC program,  as well as from new JARC applicants. Grantees may apply for up to two  additional years of continuation funding beyond that previously  approved. Continuation does not include expansion of services beyond  those previously funded. Expanded services will be treated as new  projects. Applicants for all new projects, both existing JARC  recipients and eligible applicants that have not previously been  awarded JARC funds, are encouraged to apply for a level of funding that  will allow them to sustain new service for at least two years.  C. New Freedom Initiative Principles      The President and the Federal Departments are moving to implement a  ``New Freedom'' Initiative, the intent of which is to tear down the  barriers to equality for persons with disabilities that remain after  the implementation of the Americans with Disabilities Act. As part of  that initiative, the President is proposing funding in FY 2003 to  support additional transportation services to assist persons with  disabilities to reach jobs. The major goal of the JARC program is to  increase access to jobs for welfare recipients and other low-income  individuals, and persons with disabilities are disproportionately  represented among low-income groups. The unemployment rate for  Americans with disabilities hovers at around 70 percent. The lack of  adequate transportation is a primary barrier to work for people with  disabilities; one-third of people with disabilities report that  transportation is a significant problem.     Accordingly, area-wide JARC Transportation Plans must address the  mobility needs of persons with disabilities, among others, in reaching  employment sites and support activities. Plans previously developed  that did not address the mobility needs of persons with disabilities  must be revised to include this information. Projects addressing the  needs of persons with disabilities will also be eligible for New  Freedom Initiative funding being proposed by the Department of  Transportation in FY 2003, subject to these funds being made available  by Congress.  D. Automobile Programs      While direct funding to individuals for private automobile  ownership and repair is not eligible under the program, funds may be  used for local programs that assist individuals in acquiring and  maintaining vehicles, such as loan programs that help low-income  [[Page 16792]]  individuals purchase vehicles. Agencies that receive funding for such  projects must ensure that title to the vehicles remains with the funded  agency, that the vehicles are used for shared rides, and that the  vehicles are used for intended purposes.  E. Pre-Award Authority      FTA is providing pre-award spending authority for this program  which permits successful applicants to incur costs on eligible projects  without prejudice to possible Federal participation in the cost of the  project(s). However, in exercising pre-award authority, successful  applicants must comply with all Federal requirements. Failure to do so  will render a project ineligible for FTA financial assistance.  Successful applicants must consult the appropriate FTA regional office  regarding the eligibility of the project for future FTA funds or the  applicability of the conditions and Federal requirements. Pre-award  spending authority is provided to projects selected and announced in  response to this notice effective December 18, 2001, the date on which  the Department of Transportation (DOT) and Related Agencies  Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 2002 was signed into law by  President Bush.  F. Electronic Application      An electronic application for FY 2002/2003 proposals is posted on  the FTA website at:  http://www.fta.dot.gov/wtw/ftagpa.html . Applicants  may input information directly without downloading the application.  II. General Program Information  A. Authority.      This program is authorized under Section 3037 of the Transportation  Equity Act for the 21st Century (TEA-21).  B. Scope      Improving mobility and advancing economic development are key  strategic goals of the US DOT. Job Access funds help improve mobility  and economic opportunity for welfare recipients and other low-income  people through the provision of new or expanded transportation service.  Reverse Commute funds help improve mobility to suburban employment  opportunities for the general public, including welfare recipients and  low-income individuals.  C. Eligible Applicants      Local agencies and authorities and private non-profit organizations  are eligible to apply for JARC Program funds. Local agencies and  authorities include states, local governments, metropolitan planning  organizations, public transit agencies and tribal organizations.     In urbanized areas with populations of 200,000 or more, MPOs select  the applicant(s). FTA urges MPOs to designate a single recipient to  submit a consolidated application in these urbanized areas.     In areas with populations under 200,000, states select the  applicants. For areas with populations between 50,000 and 200,000,  applications forwarded to the state for selection must be endorsed by  the area MPO as a project the MPO would be willing to include in the  Transportation Improvement Program if the projects were selected for  funding. States are urged to serve as the designated recipients for  grants to small urban and nonurbanized areas. The selected grant  recipient can suballocate funds to other project participants.  D. Eligible Projects      Job Access and Reverse Commute Projects. A Job Access project is  one that provides new or expanded transportation service designed to  fill gaps that exist for welfare recipients and other low-income  individuals to and from jobs and other employment-related services. A  Reverse Commute project facilitates the provision of new or expanded  public mass transportation services for the general public from urban,  suburban, and rural areas to suburban work sites. Capital and operating  costs for such projects are eligible. Localities have wide flexibility  in selecting service strategies that are appropriate to their areas,  including but not limited to:     (a) Late-night and weekend service;     (b) guaranteed ride home service;     (c) shuttle service;     (d) expanding fixed-route mass transit routes;     (e) demand-responsive van service;     (f) ridesharing and carpooling activities;     (g) bicycling; and     (h) local car loan programs that assist individuals in purchasing  and maintaining vehicles for shared-rides     Lead applicants submitting consolidated applications on behalf of a  number of subrecipients may apply for program administration costs of  up to 10 percent of the grant request.     JARC Program funds may also be used for promoting, through  marketing efforts, the:     (a) use of transit by workers with non-traditional work schedules;     (b) the use of transit voucher programs by appropriate agencies for  welfare recipients and other low-income individuals;     (c) development of employer-provided transportation such as  shuttles, ridesharing, carpooling; or     (d) use of transit pass programs and benefits under Section 13 of  the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.     In order to improve customer service and operating efficiency,  localities are encouraged to:     (a) establish regional mobility managers or transportation  brokerage activities;     (b) apply Geographic Information System (GIS) tools;     (c) implement Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), including  customer trip information technology;     (d) integrate automated regional public transit and human service  transportation information, scheduling and dispatch functions; and     (e) deploy vehicle position-monitoring systems.  E. Ineligible Costs      1. JARC funds may not be used for planning or coordination  activities. Metropolitan and Statewide Planning funds made available  under the FTA Sections 5303 and 5313(b) programs, FHWA Metropolitan  Planning Program (PL) (23 U.S.C. Section 134) and FHWA State Planning  and Research Program (SPR) (23 U.S.C. Section 505) funds can be used to  fund welfare to work transportation planning activities at a 100  percent Federal share. Other funds, including the U.S. Department of  Health and Human Services' Temporary Assistance to Needy Families  (TANF) and the U.S. Department of Labor's Welfare-to-Work (WtW)  administrative funds can also be used for transportation planning  activities consistent with the allowable uses of those resources.     2. While the marketing and promotion of transit pass programs are  eligible expenses under the JARC Program, funding individual transit  passes is not an eligible expense. Transit passes are eligible expenses  under Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) and Welfare-to- Work programs.     3. Additionally, the construction of child care centers and other  employment support facilities at transit hubs are not eligible for JARC  Program grants. Transit-oriented construction activities are eligible  under FTA's Section 5307, Section 5309, and Section 5311 grant  programs.  F. Cost Sharing      The JARC grant program is intended to fill gaps in existing  services and leverage other Federal, state and local transportation  funding to address the unmet needs of individuals moving  [[Page 16793]]  from welfare to work and other low-income individuals. Neither funds  awarded under this grant program, nor funds used to match the grants,  can be used to replace any existing source of funds.     The maximum US DOT share of a grant under the JARC Program may not  exceed 50 percent of the total project cost. The non-US DOT share shall  be provided in cash or in the form of in-kind services that have a  discernable cash value that is directly attributable to the service to  be provided. If funds are matched from other Federal programs, the  funds must be applied directly to project expenses. Revenues from  service agreements are an eligible match, but revenues from individual  fares cannot be used as matching funds.     Transportation--eligible funding from Federal programs other than  the Department of Transportation may be used to match US DOT funds.  These funds include, but are not limited to:     a. Temporary Assistance for Needy Families administered by the U.S.  Department of Health and Human Services;     b. Community Services Block Grants (CSBG) and Social Services Block  Grants (SSBG) administered by the U.S. Department of Health and Human  Services;     c. Workforce Investment and Welfare-to-Work (WtW) formula and  competitive grants administered by the U.S. Department of Labor; and     d. Community Development Block Grants (CDBG) and HOPE VI grants  administered by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development.     The prohibition on the use of WtW funds for matching requirements  under section 403(a)(5)(C)(ii) of the Social Security Act does not  apply to Federal or state funds that provide transportation services.  TANF and WtW grants, when used as a match, may be expended only for new  or expanded transportation services and cannot be used for construction  or to subsidize current transit operating expenses. Such funds also  must supplement rather than supplant other state expenditures on  transportation.     Under the TANF Final Rule, investment in transportation services  for families who are employed, including the purchase of transit  vouchers, and investments used as match for the JARC program, do not  constitute ``assistance'' and, therefore, do not trigger the 60-month  lifetime limit on receipt of Federal benefits nor the reporting  requirements of families receiving ``assistance.'' The Secretaries of  Transportation, Labor, and Health and Human Services released revised  joint guidance on the use of WtW and TANF funds on June 1, 2000, which  reflects changes in the final TANF rule. The joint guidance is at:   http://www.fta.dot.gov/wtw/uoft.html .  G. Planning  1. Coordinated Transportation/Human Services Planning Process     The statewide and metropolitan transportation planning processes  mandated by TEA-21 promote ongoing, cooperative, and active involvement  of public transportation providers, the public, and state, metropolitan  and local government agencies in the development of statewide and  metropolitan transportation plans and improvement programs. DOT expects  that the JARC grant program will be a catalyst for broadening the  transportation planning process to better integrate employment and  social equity considerations.     Proposed JARC projects must be derived from an Area-wide JARC  Transportation Plan (see below) developed through a coordinated public  transit and human services transportation planning process. Any  interested stakeholder group in the area may initiate the planning  process. FTA encourages MPOs to serve as the regional forum in  urbanized areas.     The planning process must include transportation planning officials  from state and metropolitan transportation planning organizations;  representatives of existing transportation service providers (local  transit agencies and private nonprofit and for-profit transportation  operators, such as human service transportation providers and taxi  companies); the agencies administering TANF and WtW formula and  competitive grants; and the community to be served. Stakeholders within  the community to be served include welfare recipients and low-income  residents, as well as community and faith-based organizations,  disability groups, farm and migrant worker organizations and other  groups representing the interests of low-income persons.     The planning process also should include other stakeholders such as  organized transit labor representatives; employment, human service, and  child care support service providers; a variety of local and state  workforce development organizations including One-stop Career Centers;  public and assisted housing providers and community development  agencies; economic development agencies; employers and employer groups  (such as transportation management organizations and Chambers of  Commerce); elected representatives including tribal officials; local  government officials including mayors, and county supervisors; and  state officials, such as state legislators, governors and others; and  interested citizens. Participants in the planning process should  provide written endorsement or sign-off of the Area-wide JARC  Transportation Plan. 2. Area-Wide JARC Transportation Plan     The purpose of collaboration is to develop a comprehensive area- wide approach to providing transportation services to welfare  recipients and low-income persons regardless of jurisdictional  boundaries. In general, the JARC Program should be viewed as a catalyst  to provide long-term mobility and access to jobs for welfare recipients  and low-income individuals. Any project proposed for funding should be  identified in the Area-wide Job Access Transportation Plan resulting  from the above process. The Plan is not meant to supersede, but to  build upon, existing area welfare-to-work transportation planning  activities. The Plan must:     a. Identify the geographic distribution of welfare recipients and  low-income people in the region;     b. Identify the geographic distributions of employment centers and  employment-related activities in the region;     c. Identify existing public, private, non-profit and human services  transportation providers in the region;     d. Identify transportation gaps between the geographic  distributions of people, as specified in section ``a,'' and employment,  as specified in section ``b,'' which are not currently served by the  transportation services, as specified in section ``c;''     e. Identify, in order of funding priority, projects to address the  gaps identified in section ``d.'' Each project identification must  include:     (1) The goals and objectives of the project;     (2) the cost of the project;     (3) an explanation of how the project will maximize use of existing  transportation service providers and what mechanisms will be used to  integrate or coordinate the project services with the existing  transportation network;     (4) an explanation of how the project will meet the mobility needs  of persons with disabilities in reaching employment sites and support  activities; and     (5) identification of any employer-provided or employer-assisted  transportation service strategies incorporated in the project.  [[Page 16794]]      The area-wide JARC Transportation Plan should build on and  incorporate existing welfare-to-work transportation planning  activities. As noted in the Fiscal Years 2002 and 2003 Program  Highlights, Section I.C. above, if a previously adopted plan did not  address the mobility needs of persons with disabilities, it must be  revised to include this information. 1. MPO Planning Requirements     In regions with populations of more than 200,000, MPOs are  responsible for selecting applicants to be considered for Federal JARC  grants. In regions with populations between 50,000 and 200,000, MPOs  will recommend projects to the state, which will select the applicants  to be considered for Federal JARC grants.     This means that MPOs are responsible for the following:     (a) Determining that JARC projects are consistent with the regional  long-range transportation plan.     (b) Ensuring that the submitted application contains projects  prioritized according to local need.     (c) Endorsing and subsequently programming JARC projects into the  area Transportation Improvement Program in urbanized areas of over  50,000 population.     (d) Conducting the locally-developed public participation process  as required by the Joint FHWA/FTA Planning Rule (23 CFR part 450, 49  CFR part 613).     In all regions with MPOs, individual JARC projects must be adopted  into the MPO's Transportation Improvement Program (TIP) prior to  receiving a grant. Because this entails a formal review and project  approval by the MPO Policy Board, FTA strongly urges the partners  developing the area-wide JARC transportation plan to communicate with  the MPO at an early stage. Further, as financial sustainability of a  project is one of the evaluation criteria, coordination with the  agencies participating in the MPO forum could be a critical factor in  ensuring long-term support for JARC activities. 4. Statewide Transportation Planning Requirements     In all regions with populations of less than 200,000, the state is  responsible for selecting applicants based on the recommendation of the  MPO in areas between 50,000-200,000 population. In addition, JARC  projects selected for funding must be endorsed by the state and  incorporated into the statewide transportation improvement program  (STIP). Because this requires state approval, FTA strongly urges the  partners to communicate with state officials, including the state DOT,  at an early stage. In selecting projects in rural areas, states should  give priority to projects providing service to places that are not  currently served or are underserved by public transit systems. States  must prioritize the projects for funding based on their analysis of  local needs and service effectiveness, as well as the collaboration  achieved among stakeholders. Given the sovereign nature of tribal  governments, tribal projects need not be included in the state's  prioritization of projects, though they must be included in the State  Transportation Improvement Program (STIP).  III. Guidelines for Preparing Grant Proposal Applications      FTA is conducting a national solicitation for application proposals  under the JARC Program for FY 2002 and FY 2003 funding. All grant  awards, including those to congressionally-specified areas, will be  made on a competitive basis. FTA encourages both traditional  transportation recipients and new program entrants in urban, suburban,  and rural areas to participate in the development of projects.  Applicants must submit a proposal that describes the proposed project  for which funding is sought and responds to the requirements outlined  in this Notice. A project for which funding is sought is a service or  set of services targeted to serve welfare recipients and low-income  individuals, including persons with disabilities, living in a specific  and distinguishable geographic locale. Because FY 2003 is the last year  of the program under TEA-21, applicants are encouraged to apply for a  level of funding sufficient to sustain the project for two years. If  selected for funding, the applicant must document compliance with the  standard FTA requirements listed in Appendix E as well as the  availability of the financial match for the grant. Contact the  appropriate FTA regional office for guidance on meeting standard FTA  program requirements.     For continuation projects, applicants must also document  satisfactory progress toward achieving JARC program goals. Current JARC  grantees desiring continuation of funding for a project must document  the continued endorsement of its planning partners, and provide an  update of what has already been accomplished and the level of funding  drawn down to date. Recipients requesting continuation funding may  apply for up to two additional years of funding beyond that previously  approved.  A. Grant Funding Amounts      Suggested grant sizes are identified below:     1. For urbanized areas with populations of over one million, FTA  expects to make grants of no more than $1 million. (Places with  populations of over 5 million may request funding above $1 million.)     2. For urbanized areas with populations greater than 200,000 and  less than one million, FTA expects to make grants of no more than  $500,000.     3. For urbanized areas with populations between 50,000 and 200,000,  FTA expects to make grants of no more than $200,000. States should not  submit applications that collectively exceed $1 million for this  category.     4. For rural areas (areas with populations of less than 50,000),  individual area grant applications generally should not exceed  $150,000. Collective grant applications by states for rural areas  should not exceed $1 million. Tribal applications may be considered  separately from this state funding limitation.  IV. Grant Proposal Application Development and Submission      To promote collaboration and reduce administrative paperwork, FTA  strongly encourages the submission of a consolidated application by a  single entity in urbanized areas and the submission of a consolidated  application by the state for rural areas. In both cases, funds may be  passed on to subrecipients. Tribal governments may choose to allow the  state to include their project(s) in the state's application or, as  sovereign governments, may apply directly to FTA. Since existing FTA  grantees such as states and local transit agencies are familiar with  many of the FTA requirements that apply to this program, FTA encourages  these entities to submit applications on behalf of other entities.     Applicants should submit proposals to the appropriate regional  office electronically according to the instructions included in the  electronic application form, available through FTA's website at:  http://www.fta.dot.gov/wtw/ftagpa.html . If an applicant is unable to submit  the application electronically, the proposal should be submitted on a  3.5 inch formatted disk for use on a personal computer (PC). Documents  should be submitted to the appropriate Regional Office in Word or Rich  Text Format (RTF). Tables should be submitted in an Excel, or Tab  Delimited Format. Submission of proposal applications for continuation  funding must be received  [[Page 16795]]  by FTA no later than 60 days after the date of this notice. Submission  of proposal applications for funding for new projects must be received  by FTA no later than 90 days after the date of this notice, although  these applicants must notify the appropriate regional office of their  intent to submit a proposal application no later than 60 days after the  date of this notice.  V. Grant Proposal Application Review and Evaluation Process      FTA will screen all applications to determine whether all required  eligibility elements are present. In addition to mandated project award  criteria, FTA will select projects based on what is most advantageous  to the government, and may consider the following factors: FTA's  commitment to continue funding JARC projects already funded and  undertaken; the time frame in which projects can be implemented;  Congressional designation of projects for funding; and geographic  distribution of project funds.     FTA will notify applicants of selection decisions. Those selected  must then submit appropriate certifications, assurances, and other  documentation necessary to meet the applicable FTA Section 5307  Urbanized Area Formula Grant Program requirements and be included in  the TIP or STIP as appropriate, if these requirements have not been  met. Technical assistance regarding these requirements is available  from each FTA regional office.     FTA is committed to obligating Job Access and Reverse Commute  funding expeditiously. Therefore, FTA urges applicants to develop  documentation in accordance with the Section 5307 program guidance as  soon as possible. This allows the information necessary for grant  approval to be readily available for submission to FTA when projects  are selected for funding.  VI. General Grant Requirements and Performance Monitoring      In addition to the project proposal based on the program-specific  requirements outlined in this notice, the applicant will be required to  submit appropriate certifications, assurances, and other documentation  necessary to meet the requirements of FTA's Urbanized Area Formula  Grant Program (section 5307 program under Title 49, United States  Code--see Appendix E). Applicants must have the financial, legal, and  technical capacity to apply for and administer projects. Also included  are planning; environmental; school bus; charter; procurement; labor  protections; civil rights requirements, including the Americans with  Disabilities Act, Title VI, Environmental Justice and Disadvantaged  Business Enterprise; and drug and alcohol testing requirements.     Applicants are encouraged to coordinate with affected transit labor  unions and to gather all information required by the U.S. Department of  Labor for labor certification as soon as possible to avoid delay in the  certification process upon grant selection. (See Appendix E for a  description of required information).     FTA requires grant recipients to monitor the performance of their  JARC services and to cooperate with the FTA and General Accounting  Office (GAO) national evaluations mandated by law. Evaluation of JARC  project progress will be a key element in determining continuation of  FTA financial assistance. Performance measures on: (1) Increasing  access between welfare recipients and low-income populations and  employment sites; and (2) job access and reverse commute service  effectiveness and efficiency must be provided. The required performance  measures may be found on FTA's web site ( http://www.fta.dot.gov/wtw ).  Performance monitoring will take place primarily through FTA standard  project progress reports. Information must be reported in accordance  with FTA's standard reporting requirements which are: (1) For projects  in non-urbanized areas, reporting requirements for the 5311 Program  (FTA C 9040.1E, page VI-6): annual program of projects status reports,  annual financial status reports, and annual Disadvantaged Business  Enterprise (DBE) reports; (2) for projects in urbanized areas,  reporting requirements for the 5307 Program: quarterly milestone/ progress and financial status reports, National Transit Database  reporting, annual audits and triennial review.

Appendix C: Definitions      1. Welfare Recipient--An individual who receives or received aid  or assistance under a state program funded under Part A of Title IV  of the Social Security Act (whether in effect before or after the  effective date of the amendments made by Title I of the Personal  Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996  (Public Law 104-193; 110 Stat. 2110)) at any time during the three- year period before the date on which the applicant applies for a  grant.     2. Eligible Low-Income Individual--An individual whose family  income is at or below 150 percent of the poverty line (as that term  is defined in Section 673(2) of the Community Services Block Grant  Act (42 U.S.C. 9902(2)) including any revisions required by that  section for a family of the size involved, as calculated by HHS. The  2001 guidelines were published in the February 16, 2001 (Volume 66,  Number 33) Federal Register, page 10695-10697, and are available on  the web at  http://aspe.hhs.gov/poverty/poverty.htm .     3. Existing Transportation Service Providers--Public  transportation providers including public, private and non-profit  fixed route and paratransit operators, and governmental agencies and  nonprofit organizations that receive assistance from Federal, state,  or local sources for non-emergency transportation services.     4. Human Services Providers--Agencies and organizations involved  in helping welfare recipients and low-income populations to make the  transition to work and providing supportive employment services.  These agencies and organizations include state and local workforce  development organizations, agencies administering TANF and WtW  formula and competitive funds, public and assisted housing providers  and community development agencies, and, where appropriate, faith- based and community-based organizations providing employment support  services.     5. Qualified Entity--(A) With respect to any proposed eligible  project in an urbanized area with a population of at least 200,000,  the applicant(s) selected by the appropriate Metropolitan Planning  Organization that meets the program eligibility requirements,  including planning and coordination requirements, from among local  governmental authorities and agencies and nonprofit organizations  and; (B) With respect to any proposed eligible project in an  urbanized area with a population of greater than 50,000 and less  than 200,000, or an area other than an urbanized area, the  applicant(s) selected by the chief executive officer of the state in  which the area is located that meets the program eligibility  requirements, including the planning and coordination requirements,  from among local governmental authorities and nonprofit  organizations.     6. Transit Capital and Operating Assistance Projects--Projects  to finance acquisition, construction, improvement, and operating  costs of facilities, equipment and associated capital maintenance  items used in mass transportation service, including crime  prevention and security of and for such equipment and facilities.  Direct administrative expenses associated with the provision of job  access and reverse commute services are also eligible operating  expenses.     7. Community to be Served--Neighborhoods and geographic areas  with a disproportionate number of welfare recipients and low-income  residents as compared to the general population, and population  groups such as tribes, migrant workers, and persons with  disabilities who are disproportionately represented among low-income  individuals.     8. Metropolitan Planning Organizations (MPO)--Comprised of  elected officials representing local governments and transportation  service providers within the metropolitan area. They are responsible  for adopting transportation plans and improvement programs to  address a region's unique transportation needs, and working with  states to include these priorities in statewide plans.     9. Project--A service or a set of services aimed at a low-income  population located in a specific geographic area. A project may  cover the entire area outlined in the Area-Wide Transportation Plan,  or it may be aimed at a specific geographic area within that plan.  Projects in areas with a population of over 200,000 frequently  include services directed toward the low-income population segments  of a political jurisdiction within the metropolitan region, but they  may address the entire low-income population throughout the  metropolitan region. Small urban (between 50,000 and 200,000 in  population) and rural areas (populations of below 50,000) can  propose projects that may be directed at low-income populations  located in a specific area, or throughout a small urban area,  county, or even at multi-county populations. State-wide proposals  should be divided into specific locations with specific subregions.  [[Page 16798]]  Appendix D: Program Background Information      While two-thirds of all new jobs are in the suburbs, three- quarters of welfare recipients live in central cities or rural  areas. Studies in some metropolitan areas with extensive transit  systems have shown that less than half of the jobs are accessible by  transit. Even fewer jobs are accessible by transit in areas with  limited transit systems. Many entry-level workers have difficulty  reaching jobs during evening or weekend shifts when transit services  are frequently diminished or non-existent. Work trips can also be  complex, involving several destinations, including childcare  providers. The problems can be more challenging in rural areas,  where approximately 40 percent of rural counties lack public transit  systems and commuting distances generally are longer than in urban  areas.     Auto ownership among welfare recipients and other low-income  persons is low. Most welfare recipients do not own cars and nearly  40 percent of workers with annual incomes below $10,000 do not  commute by car.     Transportation is clearly a key barrier to those moving from  welfare to work. Providing a variety of new or expanded  transportation options for low-income workers, especially those who  are receiving or who have recently received welfare benefits, will  increase the likelihood that those workers will get and retain jobs.     The major goal of the JARC Program is to provide transportation  services in urban, suburban and rural areas to assist welfare  recipients and other low-income individuals in accessing employment  opportunities. Another objective of the program is to increase  collaboration among regional transportation providers, human service  agencies, employers, metropolitan planning organizations (MPOs),  states, and affected communities and individuals.     The JARC Program is intended to establish a regional approach to  job access challenges through the establishment of an Area-wide JARC  Transportation Plan. This plan is to be developed through a  collaborative planning process. Projects derived from this plan  support the implementation of a variety of transportation services  to connect welfare recipients and other low-income individuals to  jobs and related employment activities. All projects funded under  the JARC Program must be derived from such an area-wide plan.     Funding under the JARC Program is available for a wide range of  transportation services, but projects should be developed to make  the most efficient use of existing local transportation providers.  While projects must be planned in coordination with traditional  transit authorities where they exist, other interested  organizations, including MPOs and State DOTs, can take the lead in  establishing the collaborative planning process or submitting a  project application. The collaborative process must include  consultation with the community to be served, including welfare  recipients and other low-income individuals, persons with  disabilities, and faith- and community-based organizations that  represent the interests of such individuals.     A Job Access project provides transportation services designed  to transport welfare recipients and other low-income individuals to  and from jobs and activities related to their employment, such as  child-care and training facilities. A Reverse Commute project  provides transportation services designed to transport residents of  urban, suburban, and rural areas to suburban employment  opportunities. JARC projects implement new transportation services  or extend existing services to fill the gaps that exist in many  areas between where people live and employment sites. JARC projects  also promote the use of transportation services through marketing  efforts and by improving customer service and operating efficiency.  JARC Program funds may not be used for planning or coordinating  activities and cannot supplant existing sources of funds used for  transportation services.     JARC funds will provide for up to 50 percent of the project  cost. A non-US DOT match of at least 50 percent is required. Certain  other Federal funds that are eligible to be used for transportation  costs can be used as part or all of the non-US DOT match.  Appendix E: Summary of FTA'S Section 5307 Requirements      This is the full range of 5307 requirements. Some of these items  are covered in the application, in which case you will not need to  submit information twice.  Approval Prerequisites      On file with FTA, or to be submitted with application and  updates as appropriate: Opinion of Counsel, Authorizing Resolution,  Current annual Certification and Assurances, Civil rights  submissions up-to-date (Title VI, Annual DBE Goal, DBE Program, EEO  Program, ADA), National Transit Database reports up-to-date, any  outstanding oversight findings resolved or resolution plan and  schedule set  Additional Information      Project Budget, Project Description, Project Justification/ Supporting Information as necessary, Project Milestone Schedule,  Labor Union Description(s) (See Appendix F for a description of  required information), STIP--Date of Approval by FTA, Request for  copy of Master Agreement (If applicant does not have latest one on  file)  Appendix F: Information Required by the U.S. Department of Labor  for Labor Certification  I. Background      Federal Transit law requires that fair and equitable  arrangements must be made, as determined by the U.S. Department of  Labor (DOL), to protect the interests of employees affected by Job  Access and Reverse Commute grants. These interests include the  preservation of rights, privileges, and benefits under existing  collective bargaining agreements, the continuation of collective  bargaining rights, the protection of individual employees against a  worsening of their positions related to employment, assurances of  employment to employees of acquired mass transportation systems,  priority of reemployment, and paid training or retraining.     DOL processes the employee protection certifications required  under section 5333(b) in accordance with procedural Guidelines  published at 29 CFR 215.3 (July 28, 1999 Federal Register). The DOL  will process Job Access grants serving populations of 200,000 or  more by referring a copy of the grant application to labor  organizations representing affected employees and seeking the views  of organized labor and the grant recipients on proposed  certification terms. For grants serving populations under 200,000,  DOL will issue its certification without seeking the views of the  parties. In either case, the certification terms will be based on  existing protective arrangements used for prior FTA grants, if any,  or standard operating and/or capital arrangements developed by the  DOL where there are no existing arrangements. (Such existing  arrangements do not include the Special Section 13(c) Warranty that  is used for projects funded under the Section 5311 program.)     It is essential where there are questions regarding the DOL  certification process and/or information needed by DOL to obtain a  labor certification that the applicant contact the appropriate FTA  Regional Office immediately. Where information lacks specificity, is  unclear or is missing, DOL will place the grant application in an  ``incomplete'' status until the necessary information is received.  Conceptual terms such as ``collaborative effort'' or ``working in  conjunction with * * *'' or ``services will be provided to assist *  * *'' do not provide the specificity necessary for DOL to process a  grant.     Upon receipt of a grant application, DOL will determine whether  there is sufficient information to process the grant application.  Because it is DOL's responsibility to address the protections  afforded employees through the certification of appropriate  protections, it must examine the activities of each subrecipient  under the grant in order to frame a protective arrangement  appropriate to the activity funded.  II. Description of Required Information      DOL needs the following information to process a JARC grant  application (including those for areas under 200,000 population) for  labor certification.     a. Project Description (Brief). This section should contain a  brief, succinct description of what is in the project. This  generally would cover the major budget line items.     b. Project Description (Detail). This section should provide a  complete description of each activity to be undertaken. It should  include funding information, what the project application is for,  how and where line items will be used, whether the project is new  service, and a description of the operating service area of the  recipient or subrecipient. If there is more than one subrecipient  under a grant, this information must be developed for each  subrecipient's portion of the project.     c. Grantee Contact Person. This information is not contained in  the TEAM application. Under ``Project Details'' please  [[Page 16799]]  enter the name of a contact person for the grantee. In addition, if  the grant will ``pass through'' funding to one or more subrecipients  or other public entities, enter the full name of the subrecipient or  other public entity, a contact name, mailing address, telephone  number and facsimile number for each of these.     d. Union Information. This information is not contained in the  TEAM application. Under ``Project Details'' please (1) identify all  the labor organizations that represent transit employees of the  recipient and each subrecipient, and (2) identify any other  transportation providers that operate in the service area of the  recipient and the subrecipients, and all labor organizations that  represent employees of these other transportation providers. Because  employee protections are not limited to the employees of the grant  recipient, other service area providers must be identified. Please  note that a useful reference for obtaining labor union information  is contained in Directory of U.S. Labor Organizations, 2001 edition.  This may be purchased from the Bureau of National Affairs Books,  P.O. Box 7814, Edison, N.J. 08810-7814. Telephone orders: 1-(800)- 960-1220.     For each local of a nationally affiliated union, the applicant  must provide the name of the national organization and the number or  other designation of the local union. (For example, Amalgamated  Transit Union Local 1258.) Since DOL makes its referral to the  national union's headquarters, there is no need to provide a local  contact in these situations.     However, for each independent labor organization (i.e., a union  that is not affiliated with a national or international  organization) the local contact information will be necessary (name  of organization, contact person, mailing address, telephone number,  facsimile number).     e. Extended Budget Descriptions. This section must provide a  project description and project justification for most line items.  There are few line items that need no additional description and/or  justification. If there are subreceipients under a grant, indicate  which subrecipient will receive funds under each budget description.     If you have any questions, please contact the U.S. Department of  Labor, Division of Statutory Programs, at (202) 693-0126.

""Cost recovery"" is the process by which ""public and private owners file claims against design and construction management professionals for the costs claimed to be attributable to errors, omissions, or other ""deficient"" or unsatisfactory performance issues (""cost recovery claims""). 1  This report is the latest in a series of cost recovery related reports  that the OIG has released since 1998.2 This report constitutes a referral of potential cost recovery issues to the Massachusetts Turnpike Authority (MTA). These cost recovery issues stem from the failure of the CA/T Project's management consultant, Bechtel/Parsons Brinckerhoff (B/PB), to take certain prudent steps recommended by the OIG to prevent cost increases. The OIG made these recommendations in a series of 13 legislatively mandated reviews of CA/T Project construction contract and design packages. 3  The OIG  completed these 13 mandated construction contract reviews between 1994 and 20034 before construction began on these 13 contracts. The OIG recommendations pertained to eliminating potential causes of cost increases during construction. The OIG found that the 13 construction contracts have increased by $125 million through the issuance of more than 1,600 change orders. The reviews issued by the OIG cautioned the CA/T Project regarding, among other things, contract cost growth from design changes, contractor access restraints, and the need for strong cost containment measures. recommendations. 1  In a number of cases, B/PB failed to use the OIG's  David J. Hatem, ""Errors/Omissions Cost Recovery Claims against Design and Construction Management Professionals."" The CA/T Professional Liability Reporter 1.4 (1996): 1. See Appendix A for a list of cost recovery related reports.  2 3  Statutorily Mandated Reviews of Central Artery/Tunnel Project Building Construction contracts 19971999, December 1999, Statutorily mandated Reviews of Central Artery/Tunnel Project Building Construction contracts: 1994-1996, December 1996.  i   For example, the OIG warned that access restraints for construction contractors could create delay claims that would increase CA/T Project costs. A review of these contracts identified $8.7 million in access delay related cost increases. Through a sample of the change orders that created the $125 million worth of construction contract cost increases, the OIG identified more than $24.8 million in cost increases (nearly 20 percent of the total $125 million increase) that relate directly to specific issues raised by the OIG in previous reviews or reports. The OIG also identified $3.5 million in design contract cost increases during construction. This brings the total cost increase for the contracts the OIG reviewed to almost $130 million. Various cost recovery issues that need to be pursed by the MTA will be discussed. For this report, the OIG revisited these 13 contracts to determine if: 1) the cost of these contracts increased significantly during construction; 2) these cost increases could be attributed to the unheeded warnings issued by the OIG in the 13 mandated reviews; and 3) potential cost recovery issues could be referred to the MTA. As a result of the review of the 13 legislatively mandated CA/T Project contracts, the OIG believes that it is evident that B/PB mismanaged contracts and contract costs. Contract costs increased during construction because B/PB failed to heed warnings issued by the OIG in previous reviews. The MTA should hold B/PB responsible for these cost increases and cost recovery should be pursued against B/PB.  4  See Table One for a listing of the 13 contracts.  ii   Introduction Since 1994, the OIG has completed 13 CA/T Project reviews mandated by the Massachusetts General Court.5 The most recent mandate, Section 56 of Chapter 235 of the Acts of 2000, states in pertinent part: [the Massachusetts Highway Department] shall . . . construct, control, supervise or contract such structures; provided, however, that no such construction or contractual agreement shall begin prior to the review and approval of the inspector general. [Emphasis added.] In 1996, the legislature mandated that before the award, the OIG review and approve CA/T Project contracts. The 13 mandated reviews conducted by the OIG had an original construction value of more than $310 million. In these reviews, the OIG commented on a range of issues including:  scope transfers  facility life-cycle costs  cost containment efforts  compliance with M.G.L. c. 149 bid law requirements  contractor access restraints  unexplained cost increases  excessive design changes  third party mitigation leading to design changes  Before approving these contracts, the OIG sought to verify that the CA/T Project had made a reasonable effort to ensure the completeness of the construction contract package (drawings and specifications) before the CA/T Project put the contract out for bid. The OIG also sought to verify that the CA/T Project had made a reasonable effort to identify and control or reduce contract costs. Under statutory mandate the OIG has revisited the contracts and reviewed the cost growth and explored explanations for this growth. As of December 2003, the combined cost of the 13 contracts had increased by more than $125 million -- nearly 40 percent.  5  The OIG has conducted reviews pursuant to Section 11 of Chapter 102 of the Acts of 1994, Section 115 of Chapter 273 of the Acts of 1994, Section 667 of Chapter 205 of the Acts of 1996 and, Section 56 of Chapter 235 of the Acts of 2000.  1   Table One: Contracts Reviewed by the OIG between 1994 and 2003 (in order of date of award) Contract (1) C24A2 C24F1 C07A5 C15A3 C24A1 (3) C07A1 (4) C17A3 C01B1 C09A3 C19E4 C07C1 C18A2 C19B9 TOTALS COST CHANGE Original Value $7,573,000 $547,500 $6,737,000 $106,972,972 $750,000 $639,344 $72,430,000 $31,097,700 $31,249,006 $15,677,000 $7,344,000 $12,308,120 $16,944,000 $310,269,642 Value as of September 2003 $8,401,934 $565,293 $7,959,162 $158,954,972 $800,000 $657,833 $112,504,604 $39,427,889 $38,847,693 $18,608,766 $18,120,617 $13,520,205 $16,952,357 $435,321,325 $125,051,683 Percent Growth 10.95% 3.25% 18.14% 48.59% 6.67% 2.89% 55.33% 26.79% 24.32% 18.70% 146.74% 9.85% 0.05% 40.30% Date of Award 9/27/94 11/18/94 11/23/94 7/17/95 1/4/94 12/27/95 7/11/96 4/14/99 7/26/99 10/27/99 11/12/99 5/14/01 8/21/02 Status Completed (2) Completed Completed Active Completed Completed Active Active Active Active Active Active Active Number of Change Orders 64 3 52 400 1 1 215 166 238 174 168 95 31 1608  Source: Chart prepared by OIG staff based on CA/T Project data published in November 2003.

The in question dealt with the opined that this change order issued other change orders  2   Findings Finding 1. Total construction costs for the 13 contracts reviewed by the OIG increased by nearly $125 million, or 40 percent.  The OIG has continually expressed concern to the CA/T Project regarding contract cost growth during construction. The OIG informed the CA/T Project on many occasions that work paid for through change orders is invariably more expensive than work paid for after a competitive procurement process. Under its contract with the Commonwealth, B/PB is responsible for design and contract management including the review and negotiation of change orders. The more than $125 million identified by the OIG to date, could have been greatly reduced if B/PB had accepted the OIG's advice and made the necessary changes in the original construction contract bid package. These contract changes might have avoided change orders that led to the large cost increases. Advice to the CA/T Project included more aggressive cost control measures such as value engineering and claims avoidance reviews. The OIG understands that construction contracts may be subject to cost increases from a variety of factors including differing site conditions. However, it is the opinion of the OIG that in the case of these 13 contracts, some cost increases could have been avoided. A review of the change orders for the 13 OIG reviewed contracts identified a sample of change orders that may have been avoided if B/PB heeded the OIG's advice.6 Some examples are as follows: a) In the April 1999 review of the C01B1 contract, the OIG stated: According to CA/T Project staff, the C01B1 construction contract is dependent upon work to be completed under other construction contracts. If the preparatory work is not completed, then this contract may be delayed. The OIG recommends that the CA/T Project ensure that the C01B1 contractor is not issued a Notice to Proceed (NTP) until the construction site is accessible. After the NTP is issued, the Project must make every effort to ensure that the C01B1 contractor is not impeded by other contractors or site access issues. This will prevent costly delay claims and reduce the risk of change orders caused by  6  Reference Table Two for a sample of cost increases identified by the OIG.  3   additional mobilization and other delay related costs incurred by the contractor. The CA/T Project responded: The Project recognizes the need for interface management and close attention to the needs of follow-up contracts. This is the reason that access restraints and interim milestones are carefully developed and included in all contracts ... W ith the proper development of access restraints and interim milestones, the risk of delay claims or additional mobilization is minimized. According to CA/T Project documents, the cost of the C01B1 contract has increased by nearly $8 million. Of this increase, $4.7 million or nearly 60 percent of the increase for access restraints and milestone revisions. B/PB is responsible for the ""the proper The potential for delay  development of access restraints and interim milestones.""  should have been evident and therefore been better managed by B/PB. b) In the August 1999 review of the C09A3 contract, the OIG reiterated from the C01B1 review, concerns about contractor access restraints. Again the CA/T Project stated that they recognized the issues and had dealt with them in ""all contracts."" The cost of the C09A3 contract has increased by $8 million. Of this increase, $4 million or 50 percent of the increase is for access delays. B/PB is responsible for ""the proper development of access restraints and interim milestones"" Commonwealth. In addition to these large increases, C09A3 witnessed small increases as that might have been avoided. For example, one small increase of nearly $10,000 dealt with meeting the requirements of state elevator inspectors. Arguably, B/PB and the designer of record should have known about changes to elevator specifications in the Massachusetts Building Code. c) In both a September 1998 and a November 1999 letter, the OIG expressed concerns about the increasing cost estimates for the East Boston Toll Plaza (C07C1 contract). Between 1993 and 1999 the cost estimate increased from according to its management contract with the  4   $5 million to $10 million. Responding, in part, to the OIG's concerns, the CA/T Project initiated a cost savings re-design effort for the toll plaza. As a result, the CA/T Project lowered the pre-bid construction contract cost estimate to $7.5 million. The CA/T Project awarded the contract to the low bidder at $7.3 million. However, six months after construction began, the CA/T Project issued the first of a multi-part change order that would grow to more than $2 million for design changes and revisions to the toll plaza. The MTA required most of the changes because of a need to ""conform to current technological developments."" The current cost of the contract is nearly $18 million, an increase of $11 million or 147 percent. In a series of letters since 1994, the OIG raised concerns about the CA/T Project continually changing designs before and during the bid process. The OIG also questioned the overall design C07C1 contract cost, which appeared to be excessive. The OIG warned in 1998 that: ""The C07C1 contract has cost more to design and will cost more to construct than necessary."" B/PB should have ensured that all parties agreed to the design and that the designers of record ""conformed"" with technological development during the six-year design effort. B/PB chose to begin design work on the toll plaza -- arguably one of the simplest pieces of the CA/T Project to design -- six-years before the plaza's scheduled construction. B/PB should have ensured adequate toll plaza design without the incumbent redesign costs. In addition, the toll plaza contract increased by $4.6 million because of a scope transfer. A scope transfer is the movement of work from one contract to another. This type of transfer provides the contractor with added work that is usually paid at a rate higher than if the work had been bid. In this case, the CA/T Project added $4.6 million in work during construction and paid a premium for this decision. B/PB's decision to transfer scope from one contract to another may have increased overall CA/T Project costs for the  5   Commonwealth.  The decisions behind this and the many other scope  transfers on the CA/T Project need to be re-examined to ensure that the transfers did not occur to make-up for management errors that may now be subject to cost recovery. Table Two: Sample of Cost Increases Cited by the OIG Reason Design changes during construction Access restraints and milestone revisions Renovations to state-owned building Scope transfer Construction phase services Cost Increase $2 million $8.7 million $6 million $4.6 million $3.5 million  TOTAL  $24.8 million  Source: Chart prepared by OIG staff based on CA/T Project data.  Finding 2.  Design costs increased by nearly $3.5 million during construction of four contracts previously reviewed by the OIG.7  the  Additional construction phase services (work performed by designers during construction) and design changes after the award of the construction contracts caused a $3.5 million increase in design contract costs. There might have been additional design contract increases that the OIG could not identify because of the way the CA/T Project and the designers track and account for these changes. For example, the D015A design contract generated at least three construction packages (C15A1, C15A2, and C15A3). The OIG reviewed the C15A3 contract. A change to the D015A contract might not specify work related either whole or in part to the C15A3 contract. The D015A  6   contract had at least $30 million in change orders for work performed by the designer during construction. Apart from the $3.5 million directly relating to construction phase services for the C15A3 contract, it remains unclear how much of the $30 million is related to the C15A3 contract versus the C15A1 and C15A2 contracts. A number of the OIG's reviews warned specifically of the potential for costly design and other changes during construction. For example, the OIG stated in the April 1999 review of the C01B1 contract: The OIG believes that significant design alteration should not be left until the bid process or beyond. Such changes are not always avoidable, but they should be the exception not common practice. Change orders for design issues that arise during construction do not benefit from a competitive process. The CA/T Project has no assurance that it has received the best price for the work. The OIG also strongly recommended that the CA/T Project make every effort to ensure that change orders are only issued during construction for truly unforeseen conditions or circumstances such as differing site conditions. The OIG recommended that the CA/T Project use value engineering and claims avoidance reviews and that the Project consider delaying contract awards until the resolution of access restraint and contract interface issues. The CA/T Project has argued to this Office that delaying contracts would increase costs but never quantified a cost impact for the specific contracts reviewed by the OIG. This Office contends that proceeding with contracts before all issues are resolved has increased overall CA/T Project costs through access restraint and contract interface issues. The OIG's March 2001 report, A History of Central Artery/Tunnel Project Finance 1994-2001, identified how B/PB intentionally assisted in the underreporting of what has amounted to billions of dollars of CA/T Project costs. Interestingly, of these billions, $118 million8 pertained to design construction phase services. Arguably, B/PB's underreporting of these design costs, including the $3.5 million identified in this report, led to 7 8  The contracts are C01B1, C07C1, C15A3, and C17A3. See Appendix C for a copy of the budget development assumptions for design construction phase services.  7   the MTA paying more for these services through change orders. B/PB breached its responsibilities to create complete cost estimates and efficiently manage design and construction. Finding 3. Change orders increased CA/T Project costs for convenience.  For construction contracts C15A3 and C18A2, the CA/T Project issued change orders with values of at least $3 million for work to be performed at the Project headquarters at 185 Kneeland Street in Boston.9 The building became the primary B/PB office space for the CA/T Project in the early 1990's. In 1998, the CA/T Project merged its staff into 185 Kneeland Street from One South Station. In preparation for this move, Kneeland Street required renovation work and systems upgrading. T he CA/T Project also converted the top floor (10th) of Kneeland Street into an executive floor.10 B/PB retained significant control for this move and the remaining renovations. The Massachusetts Highway Department owned the building at that time. B/PB has since maintained the responsibility for building services and management. According to CA/T Project staff, the Project believed that issuing a change order to a construction contractor procured previously under M.G.L. c.149 (building construction) would be the most expedient course of action. B/PB managed all facets of this work. The OIG had concerns about the appropriateness and legality of these change orders. It is evident that the CA/T Project paid more for this work by using change orders then if the Project bid the work. The OIG warned the CA/T Project that awarding no-bid construction contracts violates Massachusetts' construction law and is an unsound business practice. W ithout competition, there is no assurance that the CA/T Project has received the best value for the contracted work.  9  In addition to construction, B/PB contracted with and the Commonwealth paid for space planners, attorneys, engineers, a moving company, a realtor, and a number of telecommunications contractors. According to CA/T Project documents these costs may have exceeded an additional $3 million. The executive floor had to be gutted so that new ""hardwall"" offices and conference rooms could be created. This floor also received an air-conditioning system upgrade.  10  8   Conclusion For the 13 contracts previously reviewed by the OIG, costs have increased by $125 million or 40 percent. Much of the construction cost increases is attributable to B/PB mismanagement. The OIG advised the CA/T Project that costs could increase for these contracts for a number of reasons, including design changes in the latter stages of design development, construction contractor access restraints after contract award, and insufficient planning. Since B/PB is in charge of design and construction management, the MTA should examine B/PB's responsibility for cost increases identified in the contracts discussed in this report. If B/PB is found responsible, cost recovery should be pursued. The OIG advised that the CA/T Project needed to use more aggressive cost control measures such as value engineering and claims avoidance reviews. The OIG also suggested that the CA/T Project undertake comprehensive life-cycle costing (LCC) 11  for the structures under review. A LCC would have enabled the CA/T Project to  plan for future operations, maintenance costs, and may have helped identify costly design elements. In most cases, the CA/T Project following B/PB's expert advice did not agree with the OIG's recommendations. This report illustrates how, in some cases, OIG analyses proved accurate. Costs may have increased to some degree even if the CA/T Project had accepted the OIG's recommendations. However, taking certain prudent steps might have mitigated some of the larger construction cost increases. For example, the OIG opines that the $8.7 million in access delay related cost increases equate to ""cost minimization"" as expounded by the CA/T Project. be held responsible. Since B/PB mismanaged these contracts which ultimately forced to pay a higher cost for the CA/T Project, B/PB should  11  Life-cycle costing is conducted to identify all costs for acquisition, construction, operations, and maintenance of a facility during its expected useful life.  9   This page intentionally left blank.  10   Appendix A: Cost recovery related reports: 1) Proposal to Pursue Big Dig Cost Recovery: Ceiling Installation in the Ted Williams Tunnel.

Each notice of default, unless cured within the applicable cure period, shall be resolved in accordance herewith. At the written request of either Party, and prior to any other formal dispute resolution proceedings, each Party shall designate an officer-level employee, at no less than the vice president level, to review, meet, and negotiate, in good faith, to resolve the Dispute. The Parties intend that these negotiations be conducted by nonlawyer, business representatives, and the locations, format, frequency, duration, and conclusions of these discussions shall be at the discretion of the representatives.

The discussions and correspondence among the representatives for the purposes of these negotiations shall be treated as Confidential Information developed for purposes of settlement, and shall be exempt from discovery and production, and shall not be admissible in any subsequent arbitration or other proceedings without the concurrence of both of the Parties. If the vice-presidential level representatives have not reached a resolution of the Dispute within thirty (30) calendar days after the matter is referred to them, then either Party may demand that the Dispute be settled by arbitration. Such an arbitration proceeding shall be conducted by a single arbitrator, knowledgeable about the telecommunications industry.

Description (B)1.1 USW Basic Exchange Telecommunications Service, Basic Exchange Features, and IntraLATA Toll originating from USW exchanges will be available for resale from USW pursuant to the Act and will include terms and conditions (except prices) in USW Tariffs, where applicable. W here 1+ IntraLATA toll presubscription is not available, USW will provide IntraLATA Toll service to Computer Business for resale. In states where 1+ IntraLATA Toll presubscription is available Computer Business has the option to arrange for another provider. This Section addresses the provision of certain USW services to Computer Business for resale by Computer Business. Should USW wish to obtain similar services from Computer Business for resale, the terms and conditions of this Agreement shall apply and the Parties will negotiate the rates at which USW may purchase such services. Any dispute in such negotiations shall be resolved in accordance with the Dispute Resolution Section of this Agreement. The Parties agree that certain USW services are not available for resale under this Agreement and certain other USW services are available for resale but not at a discount, as identified in Part H or in individual state Tariffs. The availability of services and applicable discounts identified in Part H or in individual Tariffs are subject to change pursuant to the Rates and Charges sub-section of this Resale section.  (B)1.2  (B)1.3  (B)2. Terms and Conditions (B)2.1 Basic Exchange Telecommunications Service, Basic Exchange Features, and IntraLATA Toll may be resold only for their intended or disclosed use and only to the same class of end user to which USW sells such services (e.g., residence service may not be resold to business end users). Service provided directly to Computer Business for its own use, such as administrative services, must be identified by Computer Business and Computer Business must pay the full retail rates and prices for such services. USW shall provide to Computer Business Telecommunications Services for resale that are substantially similar in quality, subject to the same conditions related to the delivery of Telecommunications Services (including the conditions in USW 's effective Tariffs), within provisioning time intervals that are substantially equal to the intervals USW provides these services to others, including other Resellers and end users, and in accordance with any applicable Commission service quality standards, including standards the Commission may impose pursuant to Section 252 (e)(3) of the Act. In the event that there are existing agreements between Computer Business and USW for resale under USW retail Tariff discounts, Computer Business  (B)2.2  (B)2.3  Phase 2.2/5/10/99/DLH CDS-990520-0006/dlh/5/20/99  Page 31   Part B Resale  may elect to continue to obtain services for resale under the existing agreements and retail Tariff discounts or Computer Business may elect to terminate such existing agreements and obtain such services under this Agreement with the associated wholesale discount specified in Part H of this Agreement. Services obtained for resale are not entitled to both a retail Tariff discount and a wholesale discount. (B)2.4 In accordance with the Act, Computer Business will provide the date it will begin to offer Telecommunications Services to residential and business end users. Computer Business will provide a three year forecast within ninety (90) calendar days of signing this Agreement. During the first year of the term of this Agreement, the forecast shall be updated and provided to USW on a quarterly basis. Thereafter, during the term of this Agreement Computer Business will provide updated forecasts from time to time, as requested by USW . The initial forecast will provide: The date service will be offered (by city and/or state) The type and quantity of service(s) which will be offered Computer Business's anticipated number of service orders Name of Computer Business's key contact personnel The information provided pursuant to this paragraph shall be considered Proprietary Information under the Nondisclosure Section of this Agreement. (B)2.5 Computer Business may not reserve blocks of USW telephone numbers, except as allowed by Tariffs. USW will accept at no charge one primary listing for each main telephone number belonging to Computer Business's end user based on end user information provided to USW by Computer Business. USW will place Computer Business's listings in USW 's directory listing database for directory assistance purposes. Additional terms and conditions with respect to directory listings are described in the Ancillary Services Section of this Agreement. USW shall provide to Computer Business, for Computer Business's end users, E911/911 call routing to the appropriate Public Safety Answering Point (""PSAP""). Computer Business must provide to USW accurate end-user information to ensure appropriate listings in any databases in which USW is required to retain and/or maintain end-user information. USW shall provide and validate Computer Business's end user information to the ALI/DMS. USW shall use its standard process to update and maintain, on the same schedule that it uses for its end users, Computer Business's end user service information in the ALI/DMS (""Automatic Location Identification/Database Management System"") used to support E911/911 services. USW assumes no liability for the accuracy of information provided by Computer Business. If USW provides and Computer Business accepts operator services, directory assistance, and intraLATA long distance as a part of the resold line, it will be offered with standard USW branding.

However, at the request of Computer Business and where technically feasible, USW will rebrand operator services and directory assistance in Computer Business's name, provided the charges associated with such rebranding are paid by Computer Business. (B)2.9 Computer Business shall designate the Primary Interexchange Carrier (PIC) assignments on behalf of its end users for interLATA services and intraLATA services when intraLATA presubscription is implemented. W hen end users switch from USW to Computer Business, or to Computer Business from any other Reseller, such end users shall be permitted to retain their current telephone numbers if they so desire and do not change their service address to an address served by a different central office. USW shall take no action to prevent Computer Business end users from retaining their current telephone numbers. Computer Business is liable for all fraud associated with service to its endusers and accounts. USW takes no responsibility, will not investigate, and will make no adjustments to Computer Business's account in cases of fraud unless such fraud is the result of any intentional act or gross negligence of USW . Notwithstanding the above, if USW becomes aware of potential fraud with respect to Computer Business's accounts, USW will promptly inform Computer Business and, at the direction of Computer Business, take reasonable action to mitigate the fraud where such action is possible. Resold services are available only where facilities currently exist and are capable of providing such services without construction of additional facilities or enhancement of existing facilities unless otherwise required by Montana Law. However, if Computer Business requests that facilities be constructed or enhanced to provide resold services, USW will review such requests on a case-by-case basis and determine if it is economically feasible for USW to build or enhance facilities. If USW decides to build or enhance the requested facilities, USW will develop and provide to Computer Business a price quote for the construction. Construction charges associated with resold services will be applied in the same manner that construction charges apply to USW 's retail end users. If the quote is accepted, Computer Business will be billed the quoted price and construction will commence after receipt of payment. In the event USW terminates the provisioning of any resold services to Computer Business for any reason, including Computer Business's nonpayment of charges, Computer Business shall be responsible for providing any and all necessary notice to its end users of the termination. In no case shall USW be responsible for providing such notice to Computer Business's end users. USW will provide notice to Computer Business of USW 's termination of a resold service on a timely basis consistent with Commission rules and notice requirements.

Telecommunications Services available for resale but excluded from the wholesale pricing arrangement in this Agreement are available at the retail Tariff rates. The Customer Transfer Charges (CTC) as specified in Part H apply when transferring services to Computer Business. A Subscriber Line Charge (SLC), or any subsequent federally mandated charge to end users, will continue to be paid by Computer Business without discount for each local exchange line resold under this Agreement. All federal and state rules and regulations associated with SLC as found in the applicable Tariffs also apply. Computer Business will pay to USW the PIC change charge without discount for Computer Business end user changes of interexchange or intraLATA carriers. Any change in Computer Business's end users' interexchange or intraLATA carrier must be requested by Computer Business on behalf of its end user. Computer Business agrees to pay USW when its end user activates any services or features that are billed on a per use or per activation basis subject to the applicable discount in Part H as such may be amended pursuant to this Section (e.g., continuous redial, last call return, call back calling, call trace, etc.). Product specific non-recurring charges, as set forth in USW 's applicable Tariffs, without a discount, will apply when additional lines, trunks or circuits are added or when the end user adds features or services to existing line or trunks. Miscellaneous charges, if applicable, will be consistent with charges for equivalent services ordered by USW end users. If the Commission orders additional services to be available for resale, the Parties agree that they will revise Part H to incorporate the services added by such order into this Agreement, effective on the date ordered by the Commission. If the Commission indicates those additional services must be available for resale at wholesale discount rates, those additional services will be added to this Agreement at the original Agreement wholesale discount rate. If the Commission, through a cost proceeding, establishes wholesale discount rates and other resale charges to be made generally available to Resellers or establishes a resale Tariff, the Parties agree that they will revise  (B)3.2  (B)3.3  (B)3.4  (B)3.5  (B)3.6  (B)3.7  (B)3.8  Phase 2.2/5/10/99/DLH CDS-990520-0006/dlh/5/20/99  Page 34   Part B Resale  Part H to incorporate the Commission ordered wholesale discount rates and/or other resale charges into this Agreement effective on the date ordered by the Commission.

Reciprocal Traffic Exchange (C)2.1 Description (C)2.1.1 Reciprocal traffic exchange addresses the exchange of traffic between Computer Business's network and USW 's network. If such traffic is Exchange Service (EAS/Local), the provisions of this Agreement shall apply. W here either Party acts as an Exchange Access (IntraLATA Toll) provider, each Party shall bill the other symmetrical rates using USW 's Tariffed Switched Access rates as a surrogate. W here either Party interconnects and delivers traffic to the other from third parties, each Party shall bill such third parties the appropriate charges pursuant to its respective Tariffs or contractual offerings for such third party terminations. Absent a separately negotiated agreement to the contrary, the Parties will directly exchange traffic between their respective networks without the use of third party transit providers. The traffic types to be exchanged under this Agreement include: (C)2.1.2.1 Exchange Service (EAS/Local) traffic as defined in this Agreement. Exchange Access (IntraLATA Toll) traffic as defined in this Agreement. Jointly Provided Switched Access (InterLATA and IntraLATA presubscribed/dial around) traffic as defined in Access Tariffs and referenced in this Section. Transit traffic is any traffic that originates from one Telecommunications Carrier's network, transits another Telecommunications Carrier's network, and terminates to yet another Telecommunications Carrier's network. For the purposes of this Agreement, transit traffic does not include traffic carried by Interexchange Carriers. That traffic is defined as Jointly Provided Switched Access. Transit service is provided by USW , as a local and access tandem provider, to Computer Business to enable the completion of calls originated by or terminated to another Telecommunications Carrier (such as another Co-Provider, an existing LEC, or a  (C)2.1.2  (C)2.1.2.2  (C)2.1.2.3  (C)2.1.2.4  Phase 2.2/5/10/99/DLH CDS-990520-0006/dlh/5/20/99  Page 40   Part C Reciprocal Traffic Exchange  wireless carrier), which is connected to USW 's local or access tandems. To the extent that Computer Business's switch functions as a local or access tandem switch, as defined in this Agreement, Computer Business may also provide transit service to USW .

(C)2.2 Terms and Conditions (C)2.2.1 Transport and Termination of Exchange Service (EAS/Local) Traffic. (C)2.2.1.1 Exchange Service (EAS/Local) traffic will be terminated as Local Interconnection Service (LIS). As negotiated between the Parties, the transport of Exchange Service (EAS/Local) traffic may occur in several ways: (C)2.2.1.2.1 Two-way trunk groups will be established wherever possible; however, either Party may elect to provision its own one-way trunks for delivery of Exchange Service (EAS/Local) traffic to be terminated on the other Party's network based on the exceptions provided in this Section. (C)2.2.1.2.2 The Parties may elect to purchase transport services from each other or from a third party that has leased the Private Line Transport Service facility from USW . Such transport provides a transmission path for the LIS trunk to deliver the originating Party's local traffic to the terminating Party's end office or local tandem for call termination. Transport may be purchased from USW or Computer Business as tandem routed (i.e., tandem switching, tandem transmission and direct trunked  (C)2.2.1.2  Phase 2.2/5/10/99/DLH CDS-990520-0006/dlh/5/20/99  Page 41   Part C Reciprocal Traffic Exchange  transport) or direct routed (i.e., direct trunked transport.) (C)2.2.1.3 Based on forecasted or actual traffic at Computer Business's busy hour in centum call seconds (CCS), where there is a DS1 worth of traffic (512 CCS) between Computer Business's POI and a USW end office, Computer Business will order a dedicated (i.e., direct) trunk group from the Computer Business POI directly to the USW end office. To the extent that Computer Business has established a Collocation arrangement at a USW end office location, and has available capacity, the Parties agree that Computer Business shall provide two-way direct trunk facilities, when required, from that end office to Computer Business's switch. In all other cases, the direct facility may be provisioned by USW or Computer Business or a third party. If both Computer Business and USW desire to provision the facility and cannot otherwise agree, the Parties may agree to resolve the dispute through the submission of competitive bids. LIS ordered to a local tandem will be provided as Direct Trunked Transport between the serving W ire Center of Computer Business's POI and the local tandem. Tandem switching and tandem transmission rates, as specified in Part H of this Agreement, will apply to the transport provided from the local tandem to USW 's end office.

Until that publication is available, they are the same as those used for Feature Group D Switched Access Service, as described in the Parties' applicable Switched Access Tariffs. (C)2.2.5 Switching Options. (C)2.2.5.1 SS7 Out of Band Signaling. SS7 Out of Band Signaling is available for LIS trunks. SS7 Out-of-Band Signaling must be requested on the order for the new LIS trunks. Common Channel Signaling Access Capability Service, as set forth in this Agreement, must be ordered by Computer Business when SS7 Out-ofBand Signaling is requested on LIS trunks. (C)2.2.5.2 Clear Channel Capability. Clear Channel Capability (64CCC) permits 24 DS0-64 Kbps services or 1.536 Mbps of information on the 1.544 Mbps/s line rate. 64CCC is available for LIS trunks equipped with SS7 Out-of-Band Signaling. 64CCC must be requested on the order for the new LIS trunks. Through a W eb site, USW will provide Computer Business with a listing of USW local tandems fully capable of routing 64CCC traffic. (C)2.2.6 Measurement of terminating local Interconnection minutes begins when the terminating LIS entry switch receives answer supervision from the called end user's end office indicating the called end user has answered. The measurement of terminating call usage over LIS trunks ends when the terminating LIS entry switch receives disconnect supervision from either the called end user's end office, indicating the called end user has disconnected, or Computer Business's Point of Interconnection, whichever is recognized first by the entry switch. This is commonly referred to as ""conversation time"". USW will only charge Computer Business for actual minutes of use and/or fractions thereof of completed calls. Minutes of use are aggregated at the end of the billing cycle by end office and rounded to the nearest whole minute. LIS Forecasting (C)2.2.7.1 The Parties will work in good faith to define a mutually agreed upon forecast of LIS trunking.  (C)2.2.7  Phase 2.2/5/10/99/DLH CDS-990520-0006/dlh/5/20/99  Page 44   Part C Reciprocal Traffic Exchange  (C)2.2.7.2  Both Parties shall have the obligation to participate in joint planning meetings at quarterly intervals to establish trunk design and provisioning requirements. The Parties agree to provide mutual trunk forecast information to ensure end user call completion between the Parties' networks. Such forecasts will be for LIS trunking which impacts the switch capacity and facilities of each Party. Switch growth jobs are custom jobs with a minimum six month timeframe from the vendors. To align with the timeframe needed to provide for the capacity including engineering, ordering, installation and make ready activities required by the forecast, the Parties agree to utilize USW standard forecast timelines as defined in the USW LIS Trunk Forecast Form. Each Party will utilize the forecast cycle outlined on the USW LIS Trunk Forecast Form which stipulates that forecasts be submitted on a quarterly basis. The forecast will identify trunking requirements for a three year period. From the quarterly close date as outlined in the forecast cycle, the receiving Party will have one month to determine network needs and place vendor orders which require a six month minimum to complete network build. Seven months after submission of the forecast, the forecasting Party may begin to order against the facilities forecast for that quarter, given no vendor or other unavoidable delays. For ordering information see Section (C)2.4 of this Agreement. Both Parties will follow the forecasting and provisioning requirements of this Agreement for the appropriate sizing of trunks, and use of direct vs. local tandem routing as specified in this Section. In the event of a dispute regarding forecast quantities, the Parties will not refuse the forecast in its entirety. The Parties shall attempt in good faith to resolve the matter informally. If the Parties fail to reach resolution, the Dispute Resolution provision of this Agreement shall apply. Until the Dispute Resolution process is completed, the lower forecast will be used. Joint planning meetings will be used to bring clarity to the process. Each Party will provide adequate information associated with the USW LIS Trunk Forecast Forms in addition to its forecasts. During the joint planning meetings, both Parties shall provide information on major network projects anticipated for  (C)2.2.7.3  (C)2.2.7.4  (C)2.2.7.5  (C)2.2.7.6  (C)2.2.7.7  Phase 2.2/5/10/99/DLH CDS-990520-0006/dlh/5/20/99  Page 45   Part C Reciprocal Traffic Exchange  the following year that may impact the other Party's forecast or Interconnection requirements.

Redundant MF signaling networks will not be provided. Exceptions to this arrangement would be limited to operator services trunking, 911 trunking and any others currently available in the USW network only on MF signaling. W hen the SS7/CCS option becomes available in the USW network for said trunking, the Parties will provision new trunks using SS7. In addition, the Parties will jointly work to convert existing trunking to SS7, as appropriate. Procedures for establishing CCS connectivity can be found in Part E of this Agreement. W hen the Parties interconnect via CCS for Jointly Provided Switched Access (InterLATA and IntraLATA presubscribed/dial around) Service, the tandem provider will provide MF/CCS interworking as required for Interconnection with Interexchange Carriers who use MF signaling. (C)2.2.8.6 The Parties shall terminate Exchange Service (EAS/Local) traffic exclusively on local tandems or end office switches. No Exchange Service (EAS/local) LIS trunk groups shall be terminated on USW 's access tandems. In the complete absence of a local tandem, Exchange Service (EAS/Local) LIS trunk groups will be established directly between Computer Business and USW end office switches. The Parties agree to exchange Exchange Service (EAS/ Local) traffic in the same EAS/Local area as such traffic originated. Alternate Traffic Routing If Computer Business has an LIS arrangement which provides two paths to a USW end office (one route via a local tandem and one direct route), Computer Business may elect to utilize alternate traffic routing. Computer Business traffic will be offered first to the direct trunk group (also referred to as the ""primary high"" route) and then overflow to the local tandem group (also referred to as the ""alternate final"" route) for completion to USW end offices.

W hen the ordering Party requests facilities, routing, or optional features different than those determined to be available, the Parties will work cooperatively in determining an  Phase 2.2/5/10/99/DLH CDS-990520-0006/dlh/5/20/99  Page 54   Part C Reciprocal Traffic Exchange  acceptable configuration, based on available facilities, equipment and routing plans. (C)2.4.2 W hen ordering new NXX codes associated with LIS, Computer Business will provide the CLLI codes of the USW local tandem or end office and POI where the NXX is to be routed. On existing trunk groups, Computer Business will provide the Two-Six Code to which each NXX will be routed. W hen the ordering Party initially requests a DS3 Interconnection facility to a local tandem or local exchange office, or uses the Hub Location POI, the provider will forward the appropriate DS1 facility record information necessary to identify the circuit facility assignment. On subsequent requests utilizing existing DS3 Direct Trunked Transport facilities, the provider will assign the DS1 facility to the DS3 Direct Trunked Transport facility, as directed by the ordering Party. A joint planning meeting will precede Computer Business and USW trunking orders. These meetings will result in the transmittal of Access Service Requests (ASRs) to initiate order activity. A Party requesting local tandem Interconnection will provide its best estimate of the traffic distribution to each end office subtending the local tandem. Trunks will be ordered either to USW 's end offices directly or to USW 's local tandem for local traffic. Separate trunks will be ordered to USW 's access tandem only for IntraLATA Toll and jointly provided Switched Access traffic. Service intervals and due dates for the initial establishment of trunking arrangements at each location of Interconnection between the Parties will be determined on an individual case basis. Service intervals and due dates for the establishment of subsequent trunking arrangements for Interconnection between the Parties, will be in accordance with the guidelines for LIS contained in the Interconnect & Resale Resource Guide, available on USW 's W eb site. Computer Business may cancel an order for LIS at any time prior to notification by USW that service is available for Computer Business's use. If Computer Business is unable to accept LIS within one hundred and twenty (120) calendar days after the original service date, Computer Business has the following options: The order for LIS will be canceled, and charges as set forth above will apply, or Billing for the service will commence.  (C)2.4.3  (C)2.4.4  (C)2.4.5  (C)2.4.6  (C)2.4.7  (C)2.4.8  Phase 2.2/5/10/99/DLH CDS-990520-0006/dlh/5/20/99  Page 55   Part C Reciprocal Traffic Exchange  In such instances, the cancellation date or the date billing is to commence, depending on which option is selected by Computer st Business, will be the 121 calendar day beyond the original service date of the order for LIS.  (C)3. Jointly Provided Switched Access Services (C)3.1 Switched Access Service is defined and governed by the FCC and State Access Tariffs, MECAB and MECOD, and is not modified by any provisions of this Agreement. Both Parties agree to comply with such guidelines. A summary of applicable guidelines is available in the Interconnect & Resale Resource Guide. (C)3.1.1 USW and Computer Business agree to exchange all records necessary for the billing of jointly provided switched access. The records to be exchanged include Category 11-01 and 11-50 access records as defined in the MECAB/MECOD documents.  (C)3.2  USW will agree to function as the Access Service Coordinator (ASC) as defined in the Multiple Exchange Carrier Ordering and Design Guidelines (MECOD) (Technical Reference SR-TAP-000984). USW will provide the operational, technical and administrative support required in the planning, provisioning and maintenance involved in the joint access provisioning process to the IXCs. USW will be unable to fulfill the role of ASC if Computer Business does not fully comply with MECOD requirements, including filing their end offices and BPs (Billed Percentages) in the NECA 4 Tariff. USW and Computer Business will each render a separate bill to the IXC, using the multiple bill, multiple tariff option.

(D)2.1.8.3  (D)2.1.9  If a request for Collocation is denied due to a lack of space in a USW Central Office, Computer Business may request USW to provide a cost quote for the reclamation of space and/or equipment. Quotes will be developed within sixty (60) business days including the estimated time frames for the work that is required in order to satisfy the Collocation request. Computer Business has thirty (30) business days to accept the quote. If Computer Business accepts the quote, work will begin on receipt of 50% of the quoted charges, with the balance due on completion. Reclamation may include the following: Grooming  The moving of circuits from working equipment bays to other equipment bays with similar functionality for the purpose of providing space for Interconnection. Space Reclamation  Administrative space that can be reconditioned, downsized or modified for the placement of telecommunications equipment.  (D)2.1.10  Out of Space Filings USW will file documentation with the specific state Commission whenever a Collocation request is denied due to insufficient space. Additionally, if Computer Business's request is denied, and Computer Business requests the documentation, USW will furnish a marked copy of that Central Office floor plan to Computer Business. Tours of the affected Central Office, when requested, will be arranged through USW channels, including USW Legal Department, State Interconnection Management, and Account Management teams.

USW will designate the POI for network Interconnection for Virtual, Caged Physical or Cageless Physical Collocation arrangements. Computer Business will be allowed access to the POI on nondiscriminatory terms. Computer Business is responsible for providing its own fiber facilities to the POI outside USW 's Central Office. USW will extend the fiber facility from the POI on a USW fiber cable from the POI to a Fiber Distribution Panel (FDP). From the FDP additional fiber, conduit and associated riser structure will then be provided by USW to continue the run to Computer Business's telecommunications equipment or Collocation area. The Collocation entrance facility is assumed to be fiber optic cable and meets industry standards (GR. 20 Core). Metallic sheath cable is not considered a standard Collocation entrance facility. Requests for non-standard entrances will be considered on an individual case basis including an evaluation of the feasibility of the request. All costs and provisioning intervals will be developed on an individual case basis. Dual entry into a USW Central Office will be provided only when two entry points pre-exist and duct space is available. USW will not initiate construction of a second, separate Collocation entrance facility solely for Collocation. If USW requires a Collocation entrance facility for its own use, then the needs of Computer Business will also be taken into consideration. W here Collocation entrance facilities are not available, USW will offer Computer Business USW DS3 or DS1 Private Line Transport Services in accordance with Tariff terms and conditions, in lieu of entrance facilities to be terminated at Computer Business's collocated equipment. USW will review the security requirements and hours of access with Computer Business. This will include issuing keys, ID cards, and explaining the access control processes, including but not limited to the requirement that all Computer Business approved personnel are subject to trespass violations if outside of designated and approved areas or if found to be providing access to unauthorized individuals.

USW shall have no obligation under this Agreement as amended (1) to provide access to any network element which USW has no obligation to unbundle under a final, enforceable FCC rule identifying specific unbundling requirements; (2) not to separate any network elements which USW has no obligation to provide under a final, enforceable FCC rule identifying specific unbundling requirements; (3) not to separate any network elements which USW has no obligation not to separate under a final, enforceable rule regarding combinations of network elements; or (4) to combine or perform the functions necessary to combine any network elements, whether or not they are ordinarily combined in USW 's network. It is expressly understood that, as a result of the Supreme Court's decision to vacate FCC Rule 51.319, AT&T Corp. v. Iowa Utils. Board, 119 S. Ct. 721 (1999), once the Eighth Circuit's mandate is issued, there will be no FCC rule identifying any specific unbundling requirements. USW shall have no obligation to combine or not to separate any network elements, whether or not they are ordinarily combined in USW 's network. To the extent that USW provides Computer Business access to any network element in any manner, USW does so without prejudice to any position USW takes in any forum, including but not limited to USW 's position that the network element does not satisfy the ""necessary"" and ""impair"" access standard of 47 U.S.C.  251(d)(2).

Unbundled Dedicated Interoffice Transport (E)2.1 Description (E)2.1.1 Unbundled Dedicated Interoffice Transport (UDIT) provides Computer Business with a network element of a single transmission path between USW W ire Centers in the same LATA and state. UDIT is a bandwidth-specific interoffice transmission path designed to a DSX panel (or equivalent) in each USW W ire Center. Computer Business must have a presence in the USW Serving W ire Center and have requested termination capacity through the Collocation process. UDIT is available in DS0, DS1, DS3, OC-3, OC-12 where facilities are available. UDIT is distance sensitive and is for the sole use of Computer Business. Computer Business can assign channels and transport its choice of voice or data. UDIT is a point-to-point service and not a self healing product. Specifications, interfaces and parameters are described in Technical Publication 77389B (or C). Unbundled Multiplexer is offered as a stand alone element associated with UDIT. A 3/1 Multiplexer provides Computer Business with the ability to de-multiplex the DS3 44.736 Mbps signal to 28 DS1 1.544 Mbps channels. The 3/1 Multiplexer includes a DS3 terminated at a DS3 ICDF Frame and 28 DS1s terminated at the DS1 ICDF Frame. A 1/0 Multiplexer provides Computer Business with the ability to de-multiplex the DS1 1.544 Mbps signal to 24 DS0 64 Kbps channels. The 1/0 Multiplexer includes a DS1 terminated at a DS1 ICDF Frame and 24 DS0s terminated at the intermediate distribution frame. Extended UDIT (E-UDIT) provides Computer Business with an Unbundled Network Element that is a band-width specific transmission path between a USW W ire Center and the W ire Center of Computer Business or an Interexchange Carrier IXC POP within the same USW Serving W ire Center area. E-UDIT is available in DS1, DS3, OC-3 and OC-12 where USW facilities exist sufficient to carry the desired bandwidth and must be jointengineered with USW . E-UDIT is a dedicated service for the sole use of the Computer Business. The E-UDIT may be used for voice or data traffic but may not be used for bypass of toll or access charges. One end of the E-UDIT must terminate in the local USW Serving W ire Center. This termination will be at the appropriate cross-connect frame. Computer Business must have a presence in the USW Serving W ire Center and have requested termination capacity through the Collocation process. E-UDIT is a point-to-point service and not a self healing product. Associated rates are not distance sensitive. Specifications, interfaces and parameters are  (E) 2.1.2  (E)2.1.3  Phase 2.2/5/10/99/DLH CDS-990520-0006/dlh/5/20/99  Page 79   Part E UNEs  described in Technical Publication 77389C. (E) 2.1.4 Meet Point Unbundled Dedicated Interoffice Transport (UDIT) provides Computer Business with a network element of a single transmission path between a USW W ire Center and a mutually agreed meet point with another ILEC not in USW territory. Computer Business must have a presence in the USW office and have requested termination capacity through the Collocation process. Computer Business orders the UDIT from a local USW W ire Center to another ILEC office not in USW territory. USW provides the interoffice facility up to the meet point and the jumpers to the tie cable at the DSX in the USW W ire Center. It is Computer Business's responsibility to design from the DSX to the ICDF (and on to whatever connection is planned in the W ire Center). Computer Business can assign channels and transport its choice of voice or data. Specifications, interfaces and parameters are described in Technical Publication 77389C. It does not offer metallic-based functions.  (E)2.2 Terms and Conditions (E)2.2.1 Computer Business is responsible for performing cross connections between UDIT, E-UDIT and other UNEs and transmission design work including regeneration requirements for such connections. For the 3/1 Multiplexer, Computer Business must order all multiplexing elements and requirements at the initial installation, including all 28 DS1s and the settings on the multiplexer cards. If options are not selected and identified on the order by Computer Business, the order will be held until options are selected. For the 1/0 Multiplexer, the low side channels may be ordered as needed. For DS-1 E-UDIT, USW may provide facilities to the other carrier's W ire Center to provide a joint-engineered DS1 signal. The E-UDIT handed off to the other carrier will be that ordered by Computer Business. For E-UDIT above DS-1, USW provides an Optical Interface at the location requested by Computer Business. This Interface will be on a FDP provided by USW and placed where approved by the other carrier and building owner. In the case of the IXC E-UDIT, the space must be provided by the IXC carrier. Another E-UDIT option is that USW meets the other carrier at a mutually agreed upon location for the convenience of both carriers, without affecting the rates. Each carrier provides all facilities and equipment on its side of the meeting point. USW and the other carrier will jointly engineer the facility and meet with an agreeable type. The meet point facility may be handed off at the requested rate (e.g.,DS3) or may be a splice depending upon agreement. W here a third carrier is involved, the E-UDIT handed off to Computer Business by USW and/or the other carrier will be that  (E)2.2.2  (E)2.2.3  Phase 2.2/5/10/99/DLH CDS-990520-0006/dlh/5/20/99  Page 80   Part E UNEs  ordered by Computer Business. USW will designate which channel on the facility will carry the E-UDIT. E-UDIT is intended to be transport between the appropriate USW Serving W ire Center and another carrier's W ire Center, distinct from an end user and within USW territory. E-UDIT cannot traverse a USW W ire Center. The location of the other carrier will be considered a carrier W ire Center only if it meets certain criteria: 1) Its location has V&H coordinates, 2) The W ire Center contains a device that switches traffic, or a node leading to such a switch, 3) The switch is registered with a CLLI code listed in the LERG. Computer Business is responsible for design between any DSX and the ICDF (and on to whatever connection is planned) at the USW W ire Center and for design beyond the DSX or equivalent at Computer Business or IXC W ire Center. USW will cooperate with the other carrier to test the E-UDIT circuit, but USW is not responsible for end-to-end testing if E-UDIT is cross-connected to another element. Computer Business places its own equipment and joint engineering applies to all E-UDIT. If facilities do not exist at the time of order, the Computer Business may request an inquiry through an AQCB (Special Assembly) process by the Account Team. AQCB is required for a meet point. The request for construction will be reviewed by the USW funding committee to determine the assignment of costs. Computer Business shall pay USW for all non-reusable construction costs. (E) 2.2.4 Meet Point billing is implemented when the UDIT goes from a USW W ire Center to another ILEC not in USW territory. The arrangement may require new contract negotiations with the ILECs involved. A billing percentage will be applied according to mileage. USW and the other ILEC will determine the manner in which the UDIT signal is transported between offices and the meet point methods. In general, for USW to provide UDIT requires that the interoffice facilities carry traffic at least one step higher.

Unbundled Loops (E)3.1 Description An Unbundled Loop establishes a transmission path between a central office distribution frame (or equivalent) up to, and including, USW 's network interface device (NID) and/or demarcation point. For existing Loops, the inside wire connection to the NID, and/or demarcation point, will remain intact. Unbundled Loops are available in three categories: (i) 2-W ire or 4-W ire Analog, (ii) 2-W ire or 4-W ire Non-Loaded and (iii) Digital Capable - either Basic Rate ISDN or DS1. (E)3.2 Terms and Conditions (E)3.2.1 Analog Unbundled Loops are available as a two-wire or four-wire voice grade, point-to-point configuration suitable for local exchange type services within the analog voice frequency range of 300 to 3000 Hz. For the two-wire configuration, Computer Business must specify the signaling option. The actual Loop facilities may utilize various technologies or combinations of technologies. If USW uses Integrated Digital Loop Carrier (IDLC) systems to provide the local Loop, to the extent possible, USW will make alternate  Phase 2.2/5/10/99/DLH CDS-990520-0006/dlh/5/20/99  Page 87   Part E UNEs  arrangements to permit Computer Business to order a contiguous unbundled local Loop. (E)3.2.2 W hen Computer Business requests a non-loaded Unbundled Loop and there are none available, USW will contact Computer Business to determine if Computer Business wishes to have USW unload a Loop. If the response is affirmative, USW will dispatch a technician to ""condition"" the loop by removing load coils and excess bridge taps (i.e., ""deload"" the Loop) in order to provide Computer Business with a Non-Loaded Loop. Computer Business will be charged the cable unloading and bridge tap removal non-recurring charge in addition to the Unbundled Loop installation nonrecurring charge. Placement of repeaters either in the field or in the Central Office are not included as part of the conditioning charge. Repeater placement is included under Extension Technology. W hen Computer Business requests a Basic Rate ISDN capable Loop, USW will dispatch a technician to provide an Extension Technology that may include the placement of repeaters, either Central Office or in the field, or BRITES cards in both the COT and RT in order to make the Loop ISDN Capable. The ISDN Capable Loop may also require conditioning, (e.g., removal of loads or bridged tap). Computer Business will be charged an Extension Technology recurring charge in addition to the unbundled Loop recurring charge as specified in Part H of this Agreement. W hen Computer Business requests a DS1 Capable Loop, USW will install the electronics at both ends including any intermediate repeaters. The DS1 Capable Loop may also require conditioning, (e.g., removal of loads or bridged tap). If required, Computer Business will be charged a non-recurring charge in addition to the Unbundled Loop recurring charge. USW reserves the right to limit the provisioning of BRI and/or DS1 capable loops in some areas served by Loop facilities and/or transmission equipment that are not compatible with BRI and/or DS1 service. USW reserves the right to make some cables unavailable to Computer Business based on spectrum management considerations. (E)3.2.4 Computer Business has four installation options available when ordering an Unbundled Loop. Depending upon the type of Loop ordered (analog or digital capable), the rates for the installation options will vary. (E)3.2.4.1 Basic Installation Option for Existing Service The Basic Installation option may be ordered for existing (reuse) service only. For an existing USW or other Co-Provider end user changing to  (E)3.2.3  Phase 2.2/5/10/99/DLH CDS-990520-0006/dlh/5/20/99  Page 88   Part E UNEs  Computer Business, the Basic Installation option is a ""lift and lay"" procedure with no associated circuit testing. USW ""lifts"" the Loop from its current termination and ""lays"" it on a new termination connecting to Computer Business. USW will notify Computer Business when the work activity is complete. (E)3.2.4.2 Basic Installation with Performance Testing Option for New Service The Basic Installation with Performance Testing option may be ordered for new service only. For new service that has not previously existed, USW will complete the circuit wiring per the W ORD document and/or the service order. USW will perform the required performance tests to ensure the new circuit meets the required parameter limits. The test results are recorded as benchmarks for future testing purposes. The test results are forwarded to Computer Business by USW . (E)3.2.4.3 Coordinated Installation W ith Cooperative Testing Option The Coordinated Installation with Cooperative Testing option may be ordered for new or existing service. For an existing USW or other Co-Provider end user changing to Computer Business, the Coordinated Installation option is a ""lift and lay"" procedure with cooperative testing. Computer Business has the option of designating a specific appointment time when the order is placed. If no appointment time is specified when the order is initiated, Computer Business will provide such information to USW at least 48 hours prior to the desired appointment time. At the appointment time, USW will ""lift"" the Loop from its current termination and ""lay"" it on its new termination connecting to Computer Business. USW will complete the required performance tests and perform other testing as requested by Computer Business. Testing requested by Computer Business that exceeds testing requirements contained in USW 's Technical Publication 77384 will be billed to Computer Business. Test results will be recorded as benchmarks for future testing and will be forwarded to Computer Business.

For an existing USW or other Co-Provider end user changing to Computer Business, this option remains a ""lift and lay"" procedure, but offers Computer Business the ability to coordinate the conversion activity, allowing Computer Business's end user to pre-plan for minimal service interruption. At Computer Business's designated time, USW will contact Computer Business with notification that the work activity is beginning. If no appointment time is specified when the order is initiated, Computer Business will provide such information to USW at least 48 hours prior to the desired appointment time. At the appointment time, USW ""lifts"" the Loop from its current termination and ""lays"" it on its new termination connecting to Computer Business. Once the work has been completed USW will notify [Co-Provider"" that the ""lift and lay"" procedure has been completed. (E)3.2.5 Multiplexing of the Unbundled Loop. Computer Business may order multiplexing for Unbundled Loops under the same multiplexing provisions and pricing as provided in the UDIT Section of this Part E. Unbundled Loops are provided in accordance with the specifications, interfaces and parameters described in USW 's Technical Publication 77384. USW 's sole obligation is to provide and maintain Unbundled Loops in accordance with such specifications, interfaces and parameters. USW does not warrant that Unbundled Loops are compatible with any specific facilities or equipment or can be used for any particular purpose or service. Transmission characteristics may vary depending on the distance between Computer Business's end user and USW 's end office and may vary due to characteristics inherent in the physical network. USW , in order to properly maintain and modernize the network, may make necessary modifications and changes to the UNEs in its network on an as needed basis. Such changes may result in minor changes to transmission parameters. Changes that affect network interoperability require advance notice pursuant to the Notice of Changes Section of this Agreement. If there is a conflict between an end user (and/or its respective agent) and Computer Business regarding the disconnection or provision of unbundled Loops, USW will honor the latest dated POA  (E)3.2.6  (E)3.2.7  Phase 2.2/5/10/99/DLH CDS-990520-0006/dlh/5/20/99  Page 90   Part E UNEs  designating an agent by the end user or its respective agent. If the end user's service has not been disconnected and unbundled Loop service is not yet established, Computer Business will be responsible to pay the nonrecurring charge as set forth herein. A slamming charge will be billed to Computer Business. (E)3.2.8 Facilities and lines furnished by USW on the premises of Computer Business's end user up to and including the NID or equivalent are the property of USW . USW must have access to all such facilities for network management purposes. USW 's employees and agents may enter said premises at any reasonable hour to test and inspect such facilities and lines in connection with such purposes or upon termination or cancellation of the unbundled Loop service to remove such facilities and lines. Unbundled Loops include the facilities between USW distribution frame up to and including USW 's NID located at Computer Business's end user premises. The connection between the distribution frame and Computer Business facilities is accomplished via a connection placed by Computer Business on the ICDF. The tie cables between Computer Business's Collocation, the ICDF and the USW distribution frame are established in conjunction with Computer Business's facility forecast. Computer Business will be responsible to submit to USW a disconnect order for an Unbundled Loop that is relinquished by the end user due to cessation of service. The Unbundled Loop facility must be returned to USW in the same condition in which it was delivered. In the event of transfer of the end user's service from Computer Business to another Co-Provider, the new Co-Provider will issue a request for transfer of service, resulting in the appropriate disconnection and reconnection of service.  (E)3.2.9  (E)3.2.10  (E)3.3 Rate Elements The following Unbundled Loop rate elements are contained in Part H of this Agreement. (E)3.3.1 Analog - 2 and 4 wire voice grade. Unbundled analog Loops are transmission paths capable of carrying analog voice frequency signals from the network interface (NI) on the end user's premises to a USW Central Office Network Interface (CO-NI). Unbundled analog Loops may be provided using a variety of transmission technologies including but not limited to metallic wire, metallic wire based digital loop carrier and fiber optic fed digital carrier systems. Such technologies are used singularly or in tandem in providing Loops. Direct Current (DC) continuity is not inherent in this service. Non-Loaded - 2 and 4 wire non-loaded loops. Unbundled NonLoaded Loops are transmission paths capable of carrying  (E)3.3.2  Phase 2.2/5/10/99/DLH CDS-990520-0006/dlh/5/20/99  Page 91   Part E UNEs  specifically line coded digital signals from the NI on an end user's premises to a USW CO-NI. Unbundled Non-Loaded Loops use only metallic wire facilities. After these Loops are ordered and the design layout record is reviewed by Computer Business, it is Computer Business's responsibility to determine if the Loop meets the technical parameters set forth by the specific digital service. Charges shall apply for unloading cable pairs in the event that nonloaded Loops are not available. (E)3.3.3 Digital Capable Loops - Basic rate ISDN and DS1 capable Loops. These Loops should only be requested when the 2/4 wire nonloaded Loop is either not available or the non-loaded Loop does not meet the technical parameters of Computer Business's service(s). Unbundled digital Loops are transmission paths capable of carrying specifically formatted and line coded digital signals from the NI on an end user's premises to a USW CO-NI. Unbundled digital Loops may be provided using a variety of transmission technologies including but not limited to metallic wire, metallic wire based digital loop carrier and fiber optic fed digital carrier systems. USW will determine the specific transmission technology by which the Loop will be provided. Such technologies are used singularly or in tandem in providing service. DC continuity is not inherent in this service. Charges shall apply for conditioning of the digital capable loops, as requested by Computer Business, if necessary, as determined by USW .

Interim Number Portability (F)1.1 Description (F)1.1.1 Interim Number Portability (""INP"") service is a service arrangement that can be provided by USW to Computer Business or by Computer Business to USW . For the purposes of this Section, the Party porting traffic to the other Party shall be referred to as the ""INP Provider"" and the Party receiving INP traffic for termination shall be referred to as the ""INP Requestor"". INP applies to those situations where an end user elects to transfer service from the INP Provider to the INP Requestor and such end user also wishes to retain its existing telephone number. INP consists of INP Provider's provision to the INP Requestor the capability to route calls placed to telephone numbers assigned to the INP Provider's switches to the INP Requestor's switches. INP is available only for working telephone numbers assigned to the INP Provider's end users who request to transfer to the INP Requestor's service. Local Interconnect Service (LIS) is required for INP. INP is available as INP-Remote Call Forwarding (""INP-RCF""), Direct Inward Dialing (""DID"") and Directory Number Route Index (""DNRI""). RCF permits a call to an INP Provider's assigned telephone number to be translated to the INP Requestor's dialable local number. Technology limitations do not permit the use of Remote Call Forwarding where Digital Loop Carrier is utilized. INP via RCF also requires office equipment, on a per telephone number basis. Computer Business will provide a forecast of deployment sites and estimated quantities of ported numbers to USW to assist in an assessment of available porting methods. Each request for INP via RCF will be analyzed by the Infrastructure Availability Center (""IAC"") to determine the impact on the donor office to determine if office equipment is available. DID permits incoming calls to be ported to the INP Requestor's switch via a DID trunk configuration. For DID, the INP Provider will deliver the dialed telephone number to the INP Requestor's Central Office. DNRI permits incoming calls to be ported to the INP Requestor's switch via a route index. A permanent route index is assigned to the end user's ported number in the INP Provider's switch. For DNRI, the INP Provider will deliver the dialed seven digit telephone number to the INP Requestor's Central Office. INP Requestor may terminate the call as desired.

(F)1.1.4 INP is subject to the following restrictions: (F)1.1.4.1 An INP telephone number may be assigned by INP Requestor only to the INP Requestor's end users located within the INP Provider's local calling area and toll rating area that is associated with the NXX of the portable number. INP is applicable only if the INP Requestor is engaged in a reciprocal traffic exchange arrangement with the INP Provider. Only the existing, INP Provider assigned end user telephone number may be used as a ported number for INP. An INP telephone number must be active and assigned to accommodate INP. INP services shall not be re-sold, shared or assigned by either Party to another LEC or Co-Provider. INP is not offered for NXX Code 555 and coin telephones, and Service Access Codes (i.e. 500, 700, 8XX, 900). INP is not available for Feature Group A seven-digit numbers, including Foreign Exchange. Furthermore, INP numbers may not be used for mass calling events. The ported telephone number will be returned to the switch which originally had the ported number when the ported service is disconnected. The Party purchasing a ported number may not retain it and reassign it to another end user. The normal intercept announcement will be provided by the INP Provider for the period of time until the telephone number is reassigned by the INP Provider.

(F)1.1.6.1 Non-Coordinated Cuts (F)1.1.6.1.1 Non-Coordinated Cuts allow Computer Business to request a USW  Phase 2.2/5/10/99/DLH CDS-990520-0006/dlh/5/20/99  Page 107   Part F Ancillary Services  FDT of 1:00 a.m., where the actual cut occurs between the hours of 1:00 a.m. and 7:00 a.m. with a cut completion by 7:30 a.m. of that morning (if that morning is a business day, or by 7:30 a.m. of the next business day). (F)1.1.6.1.2 Conversion desk activities and escalation processes for NonCoordinated Out of Hour Cuts are accomplished during the business day prior to the cut. Questions or issues regarding the cut shall be addressed the following business day. Computer Business will not incur additional charges for NonCoordinated Out of Hours Cuts.  (F)1.1.6.1.3  (F)1.1.6.2  Order Process [Co-Provider shall request Out of Hours Cuts by submitting a Local Service Request (LSR) and designating a 1:00 a.m. FDT (due date) which is outside of normal business hours. In the remarks section of the LSR, Computer Business will mark the request as an ""Out of Hours Cut,"" and will identify the type of cut (e.g., Non-Coordinated) in the remarks section of the LSR.  (F)1.2 Terms and Conditions (F)1.2.1 The Parties shall provide Number Portability on a reciprocal basis to each other to the extent technically feasible, and in accordance with rules and regulations as, from time to time, prescribed by the FCC and/or the Commission. Until Local Number Portability is implemented by the industry pursuant to regulations issued by the FCC or the Commission, the Parties agree to provide INP to each other through RCF, DID, DNRI and NXX migration. Local Interconnect Service (LIS) is required for INP.

Each DID Trunk group used for INP is dedicated to carrying DID INP traffic between USW 's End Office and Computer Business's switch. Traffic on these trunks cannot overflow to other trunks. In addition, inter-switch signaling for DID is limited to multi-frequency (MF). This precludes passing Calling Line ID to the Computer Business switch. W ith DID, there is no SS7 capability causing CLASS feature limitations. W here one Party has activated an entire NXX for a single end user, or activated a substantial portion of an NXX for a single end user with the remaining numbers in that NXX either reserved for future use or otherwise unused, if such end user chooses to receive service from the other Party, the first Party shall cooperate with the second Party to have the entire NXX reassigned to an End Office operated by the second Party through the NANP administrator. In addition, both Parties agree to cooperate in arranging necessary updates and industry notification in the LERG (and associated industry databases, routing tables, etc.). Such transfer will be accomplished with appropriate coordination between the Parties and subject to appropriate industry lead-times for movement of NXXs from one switch to another. Other applications of NXX migration will be discussed by the Parties as circumstances arise. Forecasts for INP must be included in the forecasting process detailed in Part C of this Agreement.  (F)1.2.5  (F)1.2.6  (F)1.3 Rate Elements For purposes structure is an Cost recovery approved FCC available. (F)1.3.1 of this Agreement the Parties agree that the following cost acceptable measure of the costs incurred by the INP Provider. guidelines are pending FCC and/or Commission rulings. Final, cost guidelines or Commission imposed rates will apply when  Number Ported - This cost is incurred per number ported, per month per service order. This cost represents a single call path from the INP Provider's end office switch to the INP Requestor for the portable number. Additional Number Ported - This cost is incurred per month, per additional call path added to a particular ported telephone number. Service Establishment - Per Route, Per Switch. This non-recurring cost is incurred for each INP Provider's end office switch that is equipped to provide INP to the INP Requestor. Service Establishment - Per number ported or changes to existing numbers. This non-recurring cost is for every service order issued on INP.

Switched Access Revenues (F)1.3.6.1 USW and Computer Business agree to use the formula contained in Exhibit 1 to this Part F to determine revenue to be passed through to Computer Business as interstate and intrastate Switched Access compensation under INP. Once the end office switch is converted to Permanent Number Portability (PNP), the switch access compensation will not be passed to Computer Business. The Switched Access rate elements are identified in USW 's Switched Access Tariff. USW will use ARMIS data to determine the average Minutes of Use (""MOU"") by jurisdiction. ARMIS data is updated on a yearly basis. The number of lines to be used in the formula will be extracted from the USW corporate data warehouse once each month. This database contains billed information for posted orders.

The pass through amounts will be paid by check and mailed to Computer Business by the end of the month. Disputes will be processed as though this credited amount was a billed amount under this Agreement.  (F)1.3.7. Rates are contained in Part H of this Agreement.  (F)1.4 Ordering (F)1.4.1 The INP Requestor is responsible for all dealings with and on behalf of its end users, including all end user account activity (e.g. end user inquiries and complaints).  Phase 2.2/5/10/99/DLH CDS-990520-0006/dlh/5/20/99  Page 110   Part F Ancillary Services  (F)1.4.2  Each Party is responsible for obtaining a Proof of Authorization from its end users who request a transfer of the end user's telephone number from the other Party. The INP Provider will work cooperatively with the INP Requestor to ensure a smooth end user transition and to avoid unnecessary duplication of other facilities (e.g., Loops). If an end user requests transfer of service from the INP Requestor back to the INP Provider, the INP Provider may rely on that end user request to institute cancellation of the INP service. The INP Provider will provide at least forty-eight (48) hours notice to the INP Requestor of the cancellation of INP service, and will work cooperatively with the INP Requestor to ensure a smooth end user transition and to avoid unnecessary duplication of other facilities (e.g., Loops). Certain features are not available on calls passed through INP service. The INP Requestor's designated INP switch must return answer and disconnect supervision to the INP Provider's switch. The INP Requestor will provide to the E911 database provider network telephone number that the INP Requestor assigned to INP Provider-assigned, ported telephone number. Updates to maintenance of the INP information to the E911 database are responsibility of the INP Requestor. For consistency administration, it is recommended that the INP Requestor enter a separate agreement with the E911 database provider. the the and the in into  (F)1.4.3  (F)1.4.4  (F)1.4.5  (F)1.4.6  (F)1.4.7  (F)1.4.8  The INP Requestor will submit to the INP Provider a disconnect order for each ported number that is relinquished by the INP Requestor's end users. Out of Hours Cuts (F)1.4.9.1 Computer Business shall request Out of Hours cuts by submitting a Local Service Request (LSR) and designating the desired FDT outside of the normal business hours. In the Remarks section of the LSR, Computer Business will specify an Out of Hours Cut and the type of cut (Coordinated or NonCoordinated). The date and time for the cut may need to be negotiated between USW and Computer Business because of system downtime, switch upgrades, and the possibility of other Co-Providers requesting the same FDT in the same switch (switch  (F)1.4.9  (F)1.4.9.2  Phase 2.2/5/10/99/DLH CDS-990520-0006/dlh/5/20/99  Page 111   Part F Ancillary Services  contention). and FDT Confirmation additional tim (F)1.4.9.3  Because of this up-front coordination negotiation efforts, Firm Order (FOC) of the FDT will require e.

ACTION: Semiannual regulatory agenda. SUMMARY: The regulatory agenda is a semiannual summary of all current and projected rulemakings, reviews of existing regulations, and completed actions of the Department. The agenda provides the public with information about the Department of Transportation's regulatory activity. It is expected that this information will enable the public to be more aware of and allow it to more effectively participate in the Department's regulatory activity. The public is also invited to submit comments on any aspect of this agenda. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: General You should direct all comments and inquiries on the agenda in general to Neil R. Eisner, Assistant General Counsel for Regulation and Enforcement, Department of Transportation, 400 7th Street SW., Washington, DC 20590, (202) 366-4723. Specific You should direct all comments and inquiries on particular items in the agenda to the individual listed for the regulation or the general rulemaking contact person for the operating administration in Appendix B. Individuals who use a telecommunications device for the deaf (TDD) may call (202) 755-7687. Table of Contents  Supplementary Information: Background  Background Improvement of our regulations is a prime goal of the Department of Transportation (Department or DOT). There should be no more regulations than necessary and those that are issued should be simpler, more comprehensible, and less burdensome. Regulations should not be issued without appropriate involvement of the public; once issued, they should be periodically reviewed and revised, as needed, to assure that they continue to meet the needs for which they originally were designed. To help the Department achieve these goals and in accordance with Executive Order 12866 ``Regulatory Planning and Review'' (58 FR 51735; October 4, 1993) and the Department's Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979), the Department prepares a semiannual regulatory agenda. It summarizes all current and projected rulemaking, reviews of existing regulations, and completed actions of the Department. These are matters on which action has begun or is projected during the succeeding 12 months or such longer period as may be anticipated or for which action has been completed since the last agenda. The agendas are based on reports submitted by the offices initiating the rulemaking and are reviewed by the Department Regulations Council. The Department's last agenda was published in the Federal Register on May 13, 2002 (67 FR 33368). The next one is scheduled for publication in the Federal Register in April 2003. The Department has created an Internet site that provides general information about its rulemaking responsibilities and activities. It includes hypertext links to numerous  other departmental sites providing helpful information about DOT regulation. The web address for this site is http://regs.dot.gov. Significant/Priority Rulemakings The agenda covers all rules and regulations of the Department. We have classified rules as a DOT agency priority in the agenda if they are, essentially, very costly, controversial, or of substantial public interest under our Regulatory Policies and Procedures. All DOT agency priority rulemaking documents are subject to review by the Secretary of Transportation. If the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) decides a rule is subject to its review under Executive Order 12866, we have classified it as significant in the agenda. Explanation of Information on the Agenda The format for this agenda is required by Office of Management and Budget memorandum of July 15, 2002. First, the agenda is divided by initiating offices. Then, the agenda is divided into five categories: (1) prerule stage, (2) proposed rule stage, (3) final rule stage, (4) long-term actions, and (5) completed actions. For each entry, the agenda provides the following information: (1) its ``significance''; (2) a short descriptive title; (3) its legal basis; (4) the related regulatory citation in the Code of Federal Regulations; (5) any legal deadline and, if so, for what action (e.g., NPRM, final rule); (6) an abstract; (7) a timetable, including the earliest expected date for a decision on whether to take the action; (8) whether the rulemaking will affect small entities and/or levels of government and, if so, which categories; (9) whether a Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) analysis is required (for rules that would have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities); (10) a listing of any analyses an office will prepare or has prepared for the action (With minor exceptions, DOT requires an economic analysis for all its rulemakings.); (11) an agency contact office or official who can provide further information; (12) a Regulation Identifier Number (RIN) assigned to identify an individual rulemaking in the agenda and facilitate tracing further action on the issue; (13) whether the action is subject to the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act; (14) whether the action is subject to the Energy Act; and (15) whether the action is major under  VerDate Nov<20>2002  11:17 Nov 25, 2002  Jkt 000000  PO 00000  Frm 00002  Fmt 1254  Sfmt 1254  D:\UNIFIED\PRESSD~1\UA021014.OUT  apps41  PsN: UA021014   Federal Register / Vol. 67, No. 236 / Monday, December 9, 2002 / Unified Agenda DOT  74801  the congressional review provisions of the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act. If there is information that does not fit in the other categories, it will be included under a separate heading entitled ``Additional Information.'' For nonsignificant regulations issued routinely and frequently as a part of an established body of technical requirements (such as the Federal Aviation Administration's Airspace Rules), to keep those requirements operationally current, we only include the general category of the regulations, the identity of a contact office or official, and an indication of the expected number of regulations; we do not list individual regulations. In the ``Timetable'' column, we use abbreviations to indicate the particular documents being considered. ANPRM stands for Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, SNPRM for Supplemental Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, and NPRM for Notice of Proposed Rulemaking. Listing a future date in this column does not mean we have made a decision to issue a document; it is the earliest date on which we expect to make a decision on whether to issue it. In addition, these dates are based on current schedules. Information received subsequent to the issuance of this agenda could result in a decision not to take regulatory action or in changes to proposed publication dates. For example, the need for further evaluation could result in a later publication date; evidence of a greater need for the regulation could result in an earlier publication date. Finally, a dot () preceding an entry indicates that the entry appears in the agenda for the first time. Request for Comments General Our agenda is intended primarily for the use of the public. Since its inception, we have made modifications and refinements that we believe provide the public with more helpful information, as well as make the agenda easier to use. We would like you, the public, to make suggestions or comments on how the agenda could be further improved. Reviews We also seek your suggestions on which of our existing regulations you believe need to be reviewed to  determine whether they should be revised or revoked. We particularly draw your attention to the Department's review plan in Appendix D. Regulatory Flexibility Act The Department is especially interested in obtaining information on requirements that have a ``significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities'' and, therefore, must be reviewed under the Regulatory Flexibility Act. If you have any suggested regulations, please submit them to us, along with your explanation of why they should be reviewed. In accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act, comments are specifically invited on regulations that we have targeted for review under section 610 of the Act. The phrase (Section 610 Review) appears at the end of the title for these reviews. Please see Appendix D for the Department's section 610 review plans. Federalism Executive Order 13132 requires us to develop an accountable process to ensure ``meaningful and timely input by State and local officials in the development of regulatory policies that have federalism implications.'' ``Policies that have federalism implications'' are defined in the Executive Order to include regulations that have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore, we encourage State and local governments to provide us with information about how the Department's rulemakings impact them. Purpose The Department is publishing this regulatory agenda in the Federal Register to share with interested members of the public the Department's preliminary expectations regarding its future regulatory actions. This should enable the public to be more aware of the Department's regulatory activity and should result in more effective public participation. This publication in the Federal Register does not impose any binding obligation on the Department or any of the offices within the Department with regard to any specific item on the agenda. Regulatory action, in addition to the items listed, is not precluded.  Issued in Washington, DC, on October 15, 2002. Norman Y. Mineta, Secretary of Transportation.

Working Hours: 9-5. Appendix D - Review Plans for Section 610 and Other Requirements Part I - The Plan General The Department of Transportation has long recognized the importance of regularly reviewing its existing regulations to determine whether they need to be revised or revoked. Our 1979 Regulatory Policies and Procedures require such reviews. We also have responsibilities under E.O. 12866 (``Regulatory Planning and Review'') and section 610 of the Regulatory Flexibility Act to conduct such reviews. This will include the use of plain language techniques in new rules and to consider rewriting existing rules when we have the opportunity and resources permit. The Department is currently conducting a number of reviews of existing rules and is engaged in rulemaking actions resulting from these reviews. Section 610 Review Plan Section 610 requires that we conduct reviews of rules that (1) have been published within the last ten years and (2) have a ``significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities'' (SEIOSNOSE). It also requires that we publish in the Federal Register each year a list of any such rules that we will review during the next year. To better comply with section 610, the Department has updated its regulatory review plan published on June 29, 1981, to accomplish a more systematic review of all of its regulations. The Office of the Secretary and each of the Department's Operating Administrations (except for FMCSA) have a 10-year review plan. These reviews are in accordance with section 610 of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. Other Review Plans All elements of the Department, except for the FMCSA and Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), have also elected to use this 10-year plan process to comply with the review requirements of the Department's Regulatory Policies and Procedures, and Executive Order 12866. FMCSA and FAA are using different approaches, which are described in Part II to this Appendix.

For example, to the extent resources permit, the plain language reviews will be conducted more quickly. Other events, such as accidents, may result in the need to conduct earlier reviews of some rules. Other factors may also result in the need to make changes; for example, we may make changes in response to public comment on this plan or in response to a Presidentially mandated review. If there is any change to the review plan, we will note the change in the following Unified Agenda. For any section 610 review, we will provide the required notice prior to the review. Part II - The Review Process The Analysis Generally, the agencies have divided their rules into 10 different groups and plan to analyze one group each year. For purposes of these reviews, a year will coincide with the fall-to-fall schedule for publication of the Agenda. Thus, Year 1 (1998) began in the fall of 1998 and ends in the fall of 1999; Year 2 (1999) begins in the fall of 1999 and ends in the fall of 2000; and so on. We request public comment on the timing of the reviews. For example, is there a reason for scheduling an analysis and review for a particular rule earlier than we have? Any comments concerning the plan or particular analyses can be submitted to the regulatory contacts listed in Appendix B, General Rulemaking Contact Persons. Section 610 Review The agency will analyze each of the rules in a given year's group to determine whether any rule has a SEIOSNOSE and, thus, requires review in accordance with section 610 of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. The level of analysis will, of course, depend on the nature of the rule and its applicability.  Publication of agencies' section 610 analyses list each fall in this Agenda provides the public with notice and an opportunity to comment consistent with the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. We request that public comments be submitted to us early in the analysis year concerning the small entity impact of the rules to help us in making our determinations. In each Fall Agenda, the agency will publish the results of the analyses it has completed during the previous year. For rules that had a negative finding on SEIOSNOSE, we will give a short explanation (e.g., ``these rules only establish petition processes that have no cost impact'' or ``these rules do not apply to any small entities''). For parts, subparts or other discrete sections of rules that do have a SEIOSNOSE, we will announce that we will be conducting a formal section 610 review during the following 12 months. At this stage, we will add an entry to the Agenda in the prerulemaking section describing the review in more detail. We also will seek public comment on how best to lessen the impact of these rules and provide a name or docket to which public comments can be submitted. In some cases, the section 610 review may be part of another unrelated review of the rule. In such a case, we plan to clearly indicate which parts of the review are being conducted under section 610. Other Reviews The agency will also examine the specified rules to determine whether any other reasons exist for revising or revoking the rule or for rewriting the rule in plain language. In each Fall Agenda, the agency will also publish information on the results of the examinations completed during the previous year. FAA The Federal Aviation Administration, in addition to reviewing its rules in  accordance with the schedule below, has established a process by which the public is asked for its comments on which rules need review the most. Any information that the FAA receives in connection with its annual section 610 analyses would, of course, also be reviewed in the spirit of E.O. 12866. In addition, in response to a recommendation of the White House Commission on Aviation Safety and Security, the FAA has completed a review of all its existing regulations to identify those in need of rewriting as performance-based or plain language regulations. The agency also reviewed ongoing regulatory projects and proposals to identify additional candidates for revision. In all, the agency reviewed 68 parts of the CFR, containing 3,884 sections, appendices, and Special Federal Aviation Regulations. In addition to using plain language in its current and future regulations, the FAA intends to revise those regulations identified in its study when it has the opportunity and resources to do so. FMCSA Because of resources needed to conduct a zero-based review of its regulations, the FMCSA has decided to revisit its method of review. The FMCSA will identify their new regulatory review process in the Spring 2003 Semiannual Regulatory Agenda. Part III- List of Pending Section 610 Reviews The Agenda identifies the pending DOT Section 610 Reviews by inserting ``(Section 610 Review)'' after the title for the specific entry. Also, a Governmentwide list of section 610 reviews can be located in an index at the end of the Agenda. For further information on the pending reviews, see the Agenda entries.

While the  FAA's 10-year plan called for completion of these analyses before the Fall 2002, lack of available resources prevented this. In addition, the 10-year plan calls for analysis of 14 CFR parts 91-105 in this coming year; resources  are not available, however, to analyze these parts. Should resources become available during the year, the FAA will announce its intention to analyze some or all of these parts in the Federal Register.

These regulations implement and carry out the provisions of Federal law relating to the administration of Federal aid for highways. The primary law authorizing Federal aid for highways is chapter 1 of  title 23 of the USC. Section 145 of title 23 expressly provides that chapter 1 provides for a federally assisted State program. For this reason, the regulations adopted by the FHWA in title 23 of the CFR primarily relate to requirements that States must meet to receive Federal funds for the construction and other work related to highways.  Because the regulations in title 23 primarily relate to States, which are not defined as small entities under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, the FHWA believes that its regulations in title 23 do not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. The FHWA solicits public comment on this preliminary conclusion.

The requirements apply to ocean-going vessels and to coastal and inland water transportation. Most operators of ocean-going vessels are not small entities. Further, the requirements are consistent with international standards applicable to vessel transportation and, therefore, impose few additional costs of doing business on ocean-going vessels. Vessels operating in domestic transportation are also permitted to utilize international standards in place of these requirements; domestic vessel operators incur only minimal costs incurred as a result of normal business practices. Finally, the requirements have little or no impact on entry to or exit from the industry.  Plain language: As resources permit, RSPA will rewrite regulations using plain language techniques.

The review is designed to harmonize the Department's aviation data systems with current regulatory and statutory needs; improve the quality of the Department's aviation data bases; and eliminate obsolete data reporting and processing systems. The ANPRM was the first step in an outreach program to review aviation data collected by the Department and the measures that should be taken to modernize and improve aviation data reporting and processing systems. The Department solicited public comments from aviation data users on the nature, scope, source, and means for collecting, processing, and distributing airline traffic, fare, and financial data. Specifically, the Department invited comments to determine whether existing aviation data should be amended, supplemented, or replaced; whether selected forms and reports should be retained, modified, or eliminated; whether the Department should require all aviation data to be filed electronically; and how the aviation data system should be reengineered to enhance efficiency and to reduce costs for both the Department and airline industry. The Department has reviewed the comments and reply comments and is in the process of redefining the data elements and restructuring the data reporting requirements to be included in a NPRM. This action is significant due to substantial public and industry interest.

CFR Citation: 49 CFR 2a, subpart G Legal Deadline: Final, Statutory, June 30, 1993. Abstract: In May 1997, the Department issued a supplemental notice of proposed rulemaking (SNPRM) to revise its disadvantaged business enterprise (DBE) regulation. The SNPRM included proposals for revising the airport concessions portion of the DBE program. When the Department, in February 1999, issued a final rule based on the SNPRM, we did not publish a final version of the airport concessions proposal. This SNPRM seeks comments on an airport concessions subpart to part 26 that takes into account comments on the May 1997 SNPRM, adapts provisions of the rest of part 26 to the concessions context, and proposes options for provisions affecting car rental operations at airports. These options are based in part on a recent memorandum of understanding between the American Car Rental Association and the Airport Minority Advisory Council making recommendations to the Department on this aspect of the rulemaking. This SNPRM was inadvertently published under RIN 2105-AB92.

Together, these statutes prohibit discrimination on the basis of race, color, national origin, disability, and age in programs or activities that receive Federal financial assistance. In 1988, the Civil Rights Restoration Act (CRRA) added definitions of ``program or activity'' and ``program'' to Title VI and added a definition of ``program or activity'' to Section 504 and the Age Discrimination Act. The added definitions were designed to clarify the broad scope of coverage of recipients' programs or activities under these statutes. The promulgation of this proposed regulation incorporates the CRRA's definition of ``program or activity'' and ``program'' into Title VI, Section 504, and the Age Discrimination Act regulations.

The NPRM proposed to establish an enforcement policy concerning the rebating of international airline prices, as a policy statement, in the regulations on aviation proceeding. Since publication of the NPRM, many conditions in the airline industry related to rebating have changed. For example, the United States has increasingly negotiated with success for liberal pricing regimes in our bilateral agreements with foreign nations. Therefore, the Department believes that the proposed enforcement policy is no longer necessary and is withdrawing the 1988 NPRM.

The need for action stems from a current situation where not all carriers allow passengers to bring their own oxygen aboard. Issues involve conformance with RSPA and FAA hazardous materials rules and the question of providing oxygen during long layovers. The Department is considering whether to begin a regulatory negotiation.

Alternatively, the Board proposed to declare it to be an unfair and deceptive practice to divert a passenger without arranging and paying for alternate transportation to the destination airport named on the passenger's ticket. The Board considered a final rule but did not decide what action to take.

ACTION: Final rule. AGENCY: SUMMARY: The Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century (TEA21) requires the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) to issue regulations on the manner in which candidate projects for capital investment grants and loans for new fixed guideway systems and extensions to existing systems (``new starts'') will be evaluated and rated. This rule describes the procedures that FTA will use in the project evaluation and rating process. This rule will enable FTA and Congress to identify those new starts projects that should be considered for funding, in part, by the Federal government. DATES: This rule will become effective on February 5, 2001, except for paragraphs (a)(1)(i)(ii) and (d) of Appendix A to Part 611 which will become effective on September 1, 2001. Affected parties do not have to comply with the information collection requirements until FTA publishes in the Federal Register the control numbers assigned by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to these information collection requirements.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:  Electronic Access Electronic access to this and other documents is available through FTA's home page on the World Wide Web, at http://www.fta.dot.gov. Internet users can access all comments received by the U.S. DOT Dockets, Room PL401, via the Docket Management System (DMS) on the DOT home page, at http://dms.dot.gov. The DMS is available 24 hours each day, 365 days each year. Please follow the instructions online for more information and help. An electronic copy of this document may be downloaded using a modem and suitable communications software from the Government Printing Office's (GPO)  I. Background The Federal Transit Administration (FTA) is issuing this rule to carry out the requirements of section 3009(e)(5) of TEA21. This rule defines the process FTA will use to evaluate candidate new starts projects proposed for funding under 49 USC  5309. The Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) for this Rule was issued on April 7, 1999 (64 FR 17062). The period for public comment closed on July 6, 1999, though late-filed comments were accepted through July 19. See docket #FTA995474. These procedures replace those in force since the December 19, 1996 Federal Register Notice (61 FR 67093), and the November 12, 1997 amendments to this Notice (62 FR 60756), which described the measures used by FTA to evaluate candidate projects for discretionary new starts funding under the statutory criteria in effect at that time. This rule, together with the FTA/ Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) planning and environmental regulations at 23 CFR parts 450 and 771, will flesh out the requirements of 49 USC 5309(e) under TEA21. The statute now requires candidate projects to be ``(A) based on the results of an alternatives analysis and preliminary engineering, (B) justified based on a  comprehensive review of its mobility improvements, environmental benefits, cost effectiveness, and operating efficiencies, and (C) supported by an acceptable degree of local financial commitment, including evidence of stable and dependable financing sources to construct, maintain, and operate the system or extension.'' This rule sets forth the approach FTA will use to evaluate candidate projects in terms of their justification and local financial commitment. Consistent with 49 USC 5309(e)(6), as amended by section 3009(e) of TEA21, these procedures will be used to approve candidate projects for entry into preliminary engineering and final design. These procedures will also be used to evaluate projects in order to make recommendations for funding in the annual report to Congress required by 49 USC 5309(o)(1). This rule describes the project evaluation and rating process; it does not define the process by which FTA determines annual project funding recommendations, nor does it define the process by which FTA enters into funding commitments through Full Funding Grant Agreements (FFGAs). These processes are beyond the scope of this rule. The ratings developed under this rule are intended to denote overall project merit, and will form the basis for such funding decisions; however, actual funding decisions will also involve consideration of the amounts of new starts funding available under section 5309 (both annually and over the authorization period), proposed projects' phase of project development, geographical factors, and any outstanding issues that may affect the viability of a proposed project. For purposes of annual budget recommendations to Congress, proposed new starts projects must also be likely to have completed enough of final design that cost estimates are firm and be likely to have in place a fully committed financial plan by the close of the fiscal year for which recommendations for new Full Funding Grant Agreements (FFGAs) are being made. II. History Since the early 1970's, the Federal government has provided a large share of the Nation's capital investment in urban mass transportation, particularly for ``new starts'' (major new fixed guideway transit systems or extensions to existing fixed guideway systems). By the mid-1970's, because of the magnitude of the new start commitments being proposed, the  VerDate 11 2000  20:56 Dec 06, 2000  Jkt 194001  PO 00000  Frm 00002  Fmt 4701  Sfmt 4700  E:\FR\FM\07DER4.SGM  pfrm11  PsN: 07DER4   Federal Register / Vol. 65, No. 236 / Thursday, December 7, 2000 / Rules and Regulations Department found it useful to publish a statement of Federal policy to ensure that the available resources would be used in the most prudent and effective manner. A. The First Policy Statement (1976) The first policy statement was issued in 1976 (41 FR 41512 (September 22, 1976)). It introduced a process-oriented approach with the requirement that new start projects be subjected to an analysis of alternatives, including a Transportation System Management (TSM) alternative that used no-capital and low-capital measures to make the best use of the existing transportation system. The Statement also required projects to be ``cost-effective.'' B. Policy on Rail Transit (1978) The original policy was supplemented in 1978 by a ``Policy on Rail Transit'' (43 FR 9428 (March 7, 1998)). This Statement reiterated the requirement for alternatives analysis, established requirements for local financial commitments to the project, established the concept of a contract providing for a multi-year commitment of Federal funds, with a maximum limit of Federal participation (the Full Funding Grant Agreement--FFGA), and required that local governments undertake supporting local land use actions. This was supplemented by a 1980 policy statement that linked the alternatives analysis requirement to the Environmental Impact Statement development process (45 FR 71986 (October 30, 1980.)) C. Statement of Policy on Major Urban Mass Transportation Capital Investments (1984) These principles were reiterated and refined in a May 18, 1984, Statement of Policy on Major Urban Mass Transportation Capital Investments (49 FR 21284). The major feature of this policy statement was the introduction of an approach for making comparisons between competing projects. To do so, a rating system was established under which projects were evaluated in terms of a cost effectiveness index of forecast incremental cost per incremental rider for the build alternative, compared with the TSM alternative as the base. Further, index threshold values were established which projects had to pass in order to be considered for funding. In addition, the criteria to be used to judge local financial commitment were spelled out. D. Surface Transportation and Uniform Relocation Assistance Act of 1987 (STURAA) The principles of the 1984 policy statement were later incorporated into law with enactment by Congress of the Surface Transportation and Uniform Relocation Assistance Act of 1987 (STURAA) (Pub. L. 10017). This act established in law a set of criteria which new starts projects had to meet in order to be eligible for Federal discretionary grants. Specifically, projects had to be ``cost-effective'' and ``supported by an adequate degree of local financial commitment.'' STURAA also added a requirement for an annual report to Congress laying out the Department's recommendations for discretionary funding for new starts for the subsequent fiscal year. To effectuate the requirements set forth in STURAA, on April 25, 1989 FTA (then the Urban Mass Transportation Administration) issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (54 FR 17878). This Proposed Rule would have codified the requirements of the 1984 Policy Statement and made the ``Cost Per New Rider'' Index and threshold values regulatory. However, in the FY 1990 and FY 1991 Appropriations Acts, Congress directed that this rulemaking not be advanced (See the Department of Transportation and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 1990 (Pub. L. 101 164) and Department of Transportation and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 1991 (Pub. L. 101516)). Consequently, on February 3, 1993, this proposed rulemaking was withdrawn (58 FR 6948). E. Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 (ISTEA) The Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 (ISTEA) made substantial changes to the legislative basis for the criteria used to evaluate candidate projects. Specifically, the original requirement that a project be ``cost-effective'' was expanded; the new requirement specified that projects be ``justified, based on a comprehensive review of its mobility improvements, environmental benefits, cost-effectiveness, and operating efficiencies.'' In addition, certain ``considerations'' and ``guidelines'' were established that were to be taken into account in determining how well a project met the criteria. F. Executive Order 12893 (1994) On January 26, 1994, the President issued Executive Order 12893 (59 FR 4233), describing the principles which Federal agencies are to apply in  76865  determining how to invest in all forms of infrastructure, including transportation. The Executive Order requires a systematic analysis of the costs and benefits of proposed investments, and sets out the parameters for such analysis. It calls for efficient management of infrastructure, including a focus on the operation and maintenance of facilities, as well as the use of pricing to manage demand, and calls for comparison of a comprehensive set of options and consideration of quantifiable and qualitative measures of benefits for all programs. G. Policy Discussion Paper (1994) Thereafter, in September 1994, FTA circulated a ``policy discussion paper'' to the transit industry and other stakeholders for comment. This paper detailed various approaches for evaluating proposed projects under the ISTEA criteria, and requested comment on nine specific issues. Interest was extensive, and a period of public comment, further analysis, additional industry input, and additional analysis ensued. H. The 1996 Statement of Policy On December 19, 1996, FTA issued a Notice in the Federal Register that formally adopted the ISTEA project justification criteria (61 FR 67093). This Notice defined the criteria, established the process, and described the measures that would be used to evaluate candidate projects for discretionary new starts funding. This Notice also established a multiple-measure method of project evaluation, in a manner consistent with Executive Order 12893. This Statement of Policy was amended on November 12, 1997, to incorporate Departmental guidance establishing a Department-wide standard for valuing travel time, and made other technical corrections (62 FR 60756). III. Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century (TEA21) On June 9, 1998, the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century (TEA 21) (Pub. L. 105178) was enacted. TEA21 leaves much of past law and policy regarding new starts intact, including the basic project justification criteria and the multiple-measure method of project evaluation. However, a number of significant changes were introduced. A. Significant Changes  Integration of the Major Investment Study (MIS) requirement into the FTA/ FHWA planning and environmental regulations (23 CFR part 450 and 23  VerDate 11 2000  15:19 Dec 06, 2000  Jkt 194001  PO 00000  Frm 00003  Fmt 4701  Sfmt 4700  E:\FR\FM\07DER4.SGM  pfrm01  PsN: 07DER4   76866  Federal Register / Vol. 65, No. 236 / Thursday, December 7, 2000 / Rules and Regulations improve Federal program effectiveness and public accountability by promoting a new focus on results, service quality, and customer satisfaction. In the NPRM for this rule, FTA indicated an intent to develop performance measures to evaluate our administration of the new starts program, and to measure the performance of Federal new starts investments. Both of these measures would be incorporated into FTA's management of new starts projects. The NPRM invited specific comment on these issues, including recommendations as to which measures and indicators would be appropriate, as well as appropriate timeframes for evaluation. Comment. FTA received a total of three comments on the GPRA issues, from two interest groups and one transit industry trade association. On the subject of FTA's performance in administering the new starts program, two of the commenters recommended that performance be measured according to factors under FTA's control, such as timeliness in responding to grantee inquiries, reporting to Congress, uniformity of guidance, approval actions, and the extent to which funding recommendations are based on project ratings. One commenter saw no benefit to evaluating FTA's performance in this regard. Only two of the three commenters addressed the subject of new starts follow-up evaluations, the industry trade association and one of the two interest groups. Both supported the general concept of follow-up evaluations, but provided little additional comment. The interest group recommended that reviews not occur until at least after the first year of revenue service, and not later than 15 years, suggesting ratings at 2 and 7 years. The trade association recommended that projects be evaluated against objectives set at time of the decision to implement the project; ratings should encompass a 510 year operating period, and should focus on overall performance, not ridership and cost. Response. The wording of the section on GPRA in the preamble to the NPRM may have led to confusion regarding what FTA intends to measure, which may account for the fact that few comments were submitted on this issue. In evaluating FTA's administration of the new starts program, the intent was to establish measures for determining the degree to which projects remain on schedule and on budget once a commitment to fund the project has been made (i.e., an FFGA has been executed), and to measure the success of new starts projects once they are in operation. This rule incorporates a twostep data collection process to meet both of these goals. For those new starts that are put under FFGAs, FTA will combine before-and-after data with planning projections to evaluate the project in terms of four areas of interest: Capital costs, operating costs, system utilization (including ridership levels, service levels, user characteristics, trip purposes, demographics, etc.), and external factors relevant to the project. These data collection activities will be considered an eligible part of the project for funding purposes. Prior to the execution of an FFGA, project sponsors, as part of their final design efforts, will have to submit a complete plan for collection of the ``before'' data to FTA. The actual collection of data by project sponsors will be required before construction begins. The FFGA will contain a requirement for the project sponsors to collect the ``after'' data, two years after the project opens for revenue service. FTA will then compare the ``after'' data with the ``before'' data, as well as with the projections of costs, ridership, and system utilization characteristics made during the project development process, to evaluate the success of the project. Project sponsors will also be asked to report on any external factors that might have influenced the costs, ridership, and utilization factors, such as unexpected increases or decreases in gasoline prices, employment trends, etc. The intent of this evaluation process is to help to develop a greater understanding of the actual benefits of new starts, and support improvements to the forecasting process. FTA recognizes that this evaluation will provide only a short-term ``snapshot'' of the performance of a new fixedguideway system, and that many of the benefits, particularly in terms of land use, are long-term in nature. Project sponsors are of course encouraged to continue their data collection efforts beyond the period two years after opening. However, given the nature of the appropriations and authorization process, there is also a need for shortterm data to provide an initial indication of the benefits of a project. V. Outreach The development of this Rule began with a series of outreach sessions conducted during the months of September and October 1998. Three workshops were held around the country: One in Portland, Oregon, in conjunction with the RailVolution Conference on September 14, 1998; one  CFR part 771), elimination of the MIS as a separate requirement (see section 1308 of TEA21), and required streamlining of the environmental process (see section 1309 of TEA21);  The requirement for FTA to establish overall project ratings of ``highly recommended,'' ``recommended,'' or ``not recommended;''  The requirement for FTA approval for a project to advance to the final design stage of the project development process; and  The requirement that FTA publish regulations on the manner in which proposed projects will be evaluated and rated (the purpose of this rule). B. Other Changes  Several additional statutory ``considerations'' have been added to the project evaluation process, including the cost of sprawl, infrastructure cost savings due to compact land use, population density and current transit ridership in a corridor, and the technical capacity of the grantee to undertake the project.  TEA21 expressly prohibits FTA from considering the dollar value of mobility improvements (see section 3010).  The ISTEA exemptions from the FTA statutory project evaluation process, for proposed projects that require less than one-third of the project funding from 49 U.S.C. 5309 or are part of a State Improvement Plan for air quality, were eliminated. The exemption remains for projects requiring less than $25 million in 49 U.S.C. 5309 funding.  For evaluating local financial commitment, the consideration for local funding beyond the required nonFederal share has been incorporated into statute.  A second annual report to Congress, in addition to the existing Report on Funding Levels and Allocations of Funds, is now required. This new ``Supplemental New Starts Report,'' due each August, will include updated ratings for projects that have completed the alternatives analysis and preliminary engineering stages of development since the date of the last Report on Funding Levels and Allocations of Funds. IV. Government Performance and Results Act of 1993 The Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA) was enacted in 1993 to provide for the establishment of strategic planning and performance measurement in the Federal Government. It is primarily intended to  VerDate 11 2000  15:19 Dec 06, 2000  Jkt 194001  PO 00000  Frm 00004  Fmt 4701  Sfmt 4700  E:\FR\FM\07DER4.SGM  pfrm01  PsN: 07DER4   Federal Register / Vol. 65, No. 236 / Thursday, December 7, 2000 / Rules and Regulations in Washington, DC on September 25, 1998; and one in New York City, in conjunction with the Annual Meeting of the American Public Transit Association (APTA) on October 8, 1998. The purpose of these outreach sessions was to describe the changes made by TEA21 to the new starts program, discuss how we plan to implement them, and solicit general comment on FTA's policies and procedures in managing the new starts program. The comments received during this outreach process were generally supportive of our proposed approach to this rule, including the retention of the basic principles of the 1996 Statement of Policy. The NRPM for this rule was issued on April 7, 1999. The docket was open for public comment through July 6, 1999, though late-filed comments were accepted through July 19, 1999. Comments were received from a total of 41 individuals and organizations. During the comment period, FTA held three additional public outreach workshops to solicit comment on the proposed rule; one in Toronto, Ontario on May 24, 1999, in conjunction with the 1999 American Public Transit Association's Commuter Rail/Rapid Transit Conference; one in Oakland, California on June 3, 1999; and one in Washington, DC on June 8, 1999. Notes from these workshops have been placed in the docket for this rule (#FTA99 547448). VI. Section-by-Section Analysis A. Section 611.1: Purpose and Contents This section states that this rule is issued to meet the statutory requirement of Title 49, United States Code, section 5309(e)(5). This rule establishes the methodology by which FTA will evaluate proposed new starts projects as required by 49 U.S.C. 5309(e). The data collected as part of the planning and project development processes and related regulations, conducted under 23 CFR part 450 and 23 CFR part 771, will provide the basis for this evaluation. Applicants must follow these rules to be considered eligible for capital investment grants and loans for new fixed guideway systems or extensions (``new starts''). The results of this evaluation will be used by FTA to make the findings required by statute for proposed projects to advance into the preliminary engineering and final design stages of project development, and to develop funding recommendations for the President's annual budget request. They will also be used to determine which projects are eligible for funding commitments under Full Funding Grant Agreements. The information collected and ratings developed under this rule will form the basis for the annual Report on Funding Levels and Allocations of Funds, as required under 49 U.S.C. 5309(o)(1), and the ``Supplemental Report on New Starts,'' as required by 49 U.S.C. 5309(o)(2). The NPRM to this Rule proposed cutoff dates for information to be included in these reports; however, FTA has reconsidered the need for dates, as we strive for more real-time information. Thus, the cutoff dates for these reports have been dropped from this rule. B. Section 611.3: Applicability This section states that this rule applies only to the evaluation of projects seeking Federal capital investment funds for new transit fixed guideway and extension projects (``new starts'') under 49 U.S.C. 5309. It also states that proposed projects are exempt from evaluation under this rule if the total amount of funding under 49 U.S.C. 5309 is less than $25,000,000, or if they are specifically exempt by statute. Such projects must still meet the planning requirements under 23 CFR part 450 and environmental review requirements under 23 CFR part 771, as well as the project development process described in this rule. Title 49, U.S.C. 5309(e)(7) requires new starts projects to be carried out through a Full Funding Grant Agreement (FFGA), and also requires FTA to base the decision to issue an FFGA on the results of the evaluations and ratings process. Thus, any proposed project that is not evaluated will not be eligible for an FFGA. Sponsors of proposed projects that they believe to be exempt are therefore strongly urged to submit project evaluation information to FTA. FTA will carefully review projects for which sponsors are claiming exemptions under this rule. Such projects will still be approved for entry into preliminary engineering and final design, based on planning and project development requirements. If the proposed share of project funding from the section 5309 new starts program passes the $25 million level at any time, FTA will expect the project sponsor to develop the information required to be evaluated under this rule, and will require that such a project be funded using an FFGA. This section also notes that projects for which an FFGA has already been executed are not subject to reevaluation under this rule. However, extensions  76867  and/or modifications to projects with existing FFGAs will be subject to evaluation and rating under this rule. Comment. FTA received six comments on the issue of project exemptions, expressing general confusion and opposition to FTA's position on exempt projects. One transportation consultant and one transit operator argued that all exempt projects should be assigned a default rating of ``medium,'' which could be raised by the submission of data for evaluation; the transit operator also expressed the opinion that small projects (i.e., <$25 million in new starts funds) do not generate great benefits, and therefore should not be required to submit data for evaluation. One State DOT recommended that FTA simply set aside $500 million annually for exempt projects. Three commenters also expressed some degree of confusion regarding the treatment of exempt projects. One attendee at the Washington, DC workshop wondered whether project sponsors would attempt to ``cheat'' the process by claiming exemptions and another at the Oakland, CA workshop expressed confusion about continued eligibility of exempt projects for funding. One industry interest group commented that, since TEA21 already contains language exempting projects under existing FFGAs from reevaluation under the revised criteria, including the same language in the Final Rule would be confusing. Response. FTA is not prepared to set aside half (or any amount) of the annual new starts funding authorization for exempt projects, and rejects the assertion that Congress intended such projects to be exempt from the evaluation process because they have no measurable benefits. The Final Rule retains the NPRM language strongly encouraging sponsors of projects they believe to be exempt to submit data for project evaluation. This encouragement does not and is not intended to eliminate the provisions in TEA21 exempting certain projects from the evaluation process, as many of the commenters seem to have surmised. Any proposed project that meets these provisions is still exempt from the evaluation and rating process; however, submitting data will give FTA an empirical basis on which to make funding recommendations to Congress. It will also maintain a proposed project's eligibility for an FFGA. Indeed, 49 U.S.C. 5309(e)(7) requires new starts projects to be carried out through a Full Funding Grant Agreement, and also requires FTA to base the decision to execute an FFGA on the results of the  VerDate 11 2000  19:25 Dec 06, 2000  Jkt 194001  PO 00000  Frm 00005  Fmt 4701  Sfmt 4700  E:\FR\FM\07DER4.SGM  pfrm08  PsN: 07DER4   76868  Federal Register / Vol. 65, No. 236 / Thursday, December 7, 2000 / Rules and Regulations sponsors of proposed projects that they believe to be exempt to nonetheless submit data for evaluation. C. Section 611.5: Definitions This section defines key terms used in this part. Comment. Four commenters to the proposed rule expressed concern that the definition of ``fixed guideway'' was unnecessarily narrow, and may perhaps exclude many bus rapid transit (BRT), ferry boat, commuter rail and light rail systems that would operate along a shared right-of-way. Response. FTA has re-examined the definition used in the NPRM, and agrees that it could be read as excluding some BRT and ferry projects that would otherwise be eligible under the new starts program. The definition used in this rule has been modified to address this uncertainty. Definitions for ``bus rapid transit'' and ``BRT'' have also been added, consistent with the definition used in FTA's Request for Participation in the Bus Rapid Transit Demonstration Program (63 FR 68347 (December 10, 1998)). FTA has also added a definition for ``Transportation System User Benefits'' and removed the definition for the ``Transportation System Management alternative,'' as discussed later in the preamble to this Rule. D. Section 611.7: Relation to Planning and Project Development Processes New start projects, like all transportation investments in metropolitan areas, must emerge from a regional multimodal transportation planning process in order to be eligible for Federal funding. In addition, 49 U.S.C. 5309(e)(1) specifies that discretionary grants or loans for new starts may only be approved if a proposed project is based on the results of alternatives analysis and preliminary engineering, and that certain project justification and financial criteria have been met. As part of the metropolitan planning process, local project sponsors must perform a corridor-level analysis of mode and alignment alternatives in corridors for which projects may be proposed for section 5309 new starts funding. This alternatives analysis will provide information on the benefits, costs, and impacts of alternative strategies, leading to the selection of a locally-preferred alternative to the community's mobility needs. The approach taken in this rule envisions alternatives analysis as a key planning tool to be undertaken within the multimodal metropolitan and statewide planning processes, supplemented by subsequent project development analyses, for determining appropriate solutions to transportation issues. FTA and FHWA are currently modifying their joint planning and environmental regulations to better reflect the planning and project development provisions of TEA21. To the extent possible, the development of these regulations has been coordinated with the development of this final rule on major transit capital investments. However, FTA may amend this rule, if necessary, when the joint planning and environmental Final Rule is issued. Federal financial support for the planning process is derived from a number of sources, including the Metropolitan Planning Program under 49 U.S.C. 5303, the State National Planning and Research Program under 49 U.S.C. 5313, and planning programs administered by the Federal Highway Administration. FTA Urbanized Area Formula funds under 49 U.S.C. 5307 and flexible funds under the Surface Transportation Program (STP) and the Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality (CMAQ) Program may also be used to support certain planning activities. Given the significant demands placed on the new start program, FTA does not support the use of 49 U.S.C. 5309 funds for initial planning activities. Moreover, as amended by TEA21, 49 U.S.C. 5309(m)(2) limits the amount of new starts funding that can be used for purposes other than final design and construction to not more than 8 percent of funds appropriated. In evaluating the local financial commitment to a proposed project, FTA will consider the degree to which initial planning activities are conducted without funding from section 5309. The alternatives analysis study (also known as a major investment study-- MIS--or multimodal corridor analysis) evaluates several modal and alignment options for addressing mobility needs in a given corridor. It is intended to provide information to local officials on the benefits, costs, and impacts of alternative transportation investments. Potential local funding sources for implementing and operating the investment are to be identified and studied, and information in response to the FTA new starts project evaluation criteria is to be developed. Involvement of a wide range of stakeholders-- including the general public--in the alternatives analysis study process is strongly encouraged. At local discretion, the alternatives analysis may include the undertaking of a Draft Environmental Impact Statement (DEIS) or Environmental Assessment (EA). Alternatives analysis is considered  evaluations and ratings process. Thus, any proposed project that is not evaluated will not be eligible for an FFGA. FTA will of course allocate any funds appropriated by Congress for such projects. However, we believe project sponsors will find the more predictable and reliable funding provided through an FFGA to be to their advantage. Therefore, project sponsors are encouraged to submit data for evaluation to retain their eligibility for an FFGA. Finally, FTA acknowledges that there may be a temptation to circumvent the project evaluation process, as noted during the Washington, D.C. workshop. For example, it is conceivable that project sponsors may officially maintain a low level of section 5309 new starts funds throughout a project's development, only to ``discover'' that additional funds will be needed as the development process draws to a close. FTA also recognizes that not all such instances will result from deliberate attempts to manipulate the process; occasionally, further engineering and design will uncover a legitimate need for additional funds during the project development process, or local funding may not materialize as initially proposed. However, due to the fact that project evaluation is a condition of eligibility for an FFGA, and that an FFGA offers more stability in terms of funding than relying on annual Congressional appropriations, FTA believes that deliberate attempts to evade project evaluation will be few and far between. Although projects proposed as ``exempt'' are not subject to evaluation against the new starts project justification and local financial commitment criteria, such projects must still request FTA approval for entrance into preliminary engineering and final design. The decision to approve advancement in the project development process for such projects is based on compliance with basic planning, environmental, project management, and other requirements which apply to all projects pursuing section 5309 new starts funding, regardless of the amount. It is at the preliminary engineering and final design approval points that FTA works with the project sponsor to determine if the proposed ``exempt'' project appears to be at risk for requiring new starts funding at an amount greater that $25 million, and to seek assurances that local or other Federal formula funds will be pursued if a project's cost or funding strategy changes. Once again, in order to preserve maximum funding flexibility, FTA strongly encourages the  VerDate 11 2000  15:19 Dec 06, 2000  Jkt 194001  PO 00000  Frm 00006  Fmt 4701  Sfmt 4700  E:\FR\FM\07DER4.SGM  pfrm01  PsN: 07DER4   Federal Register / Vol. 65, No. 236 / Thursday, December 7, 2000 / Rules and Regulations complete when a locally preferred alternative (LPA) is selected by local and regional decisionmakers and adopted by the metropolitan planning organization (MPO) in its financiallyconstrained metropolitan transportation plan. At this point, the local project sponsor may submit a request to the FTA regional office to initiate the preliminary engineering phase of project development. The request must provide information that demonstrates the readiness of the project to advance into preliminary engineering, including the adoption of the project into the metropolitan transportation plan and the programming of the preliminary engineering study in the Transportation Improvement Plan (TIP), and information demonstrating the technical capability of project sponsors to undertake the preliminary engineering effort. The request must also address the project justification and local financial commitment criteria outlined below. (This information is normally developed as part of an alternatives analysis.) FTA will then evaluate the proposed project as required by 49 U.S.C. 5309(e)(6) and determine whether or not to advance the project into preliminary engineering. FTA approval to initiate preliminary engineering is not a commitment to fund final design or construction. Where the sponsoring agency believes that a proposed project is exempt from evaluation under this rule, submission of project justification and financial commitment information to FTA is not required. However, exempt projects must still meet all planning, environmental, project management, and other requirements which demonstrate their readiness to advance into preliminary engineering. In addition, without information to support the justification of and local financial commitment to a proposed project, FTA will have no basis for decisions on whether to recommend Federal funding commitments. Therefore, sponsors of exempt projects are strongly encouraged to submit information on project justification and financial commitment. During the preliminary engineering phase, local project sponsors refine the design of the proposal, taking into consideration all reasonable design alternatives. Preliminary engineering results in estimates of project costs, benefits and impacts in which there is a much higher degree of confidence. A comprehensive preliminary engineering effort will also address the evaluation criteria described in this rule. In addition, NEPA requirements must be met (for new starts, this usually includes the completion of a Final Environmental Impact Statement), project management plans and fleet management plans are finalized, and local funding sources are committed to the project (if they have not already been committed). Information on project justification and the degree of local financial commitment will be updated and reported as appropriate. As part of their preliminary engineering activities, localities are encouraged to consider policies and actions designed to enhance the benefits of the project and its financial feasibility. Project sponsors should also ensure that safety considerations are weighed during the preliminary engineering phase. With regard to rail projects that will be subject to Federal Railroad (FRA) safety jurisdiction, FTA will notify FRA of pending new starts at the earliest date practicable, as important decisions affecting rail safety must be made at the outset of the planning and grant development process. FRA will forward any recommendations it has to FTA, which will forward them to the project sponsor. Preliminary engineering is typically financed with 49 U.S.C.  5303 and  5307 funds, local revenues, and flexible funds under the STP and CMAQ programs. Preliminary engineering is considered complete when FTA has issued a Record of Decision (ROD) or Finding of No Significant Impact (FONSI), as required by NEPA. Proposed projects that have completed preliminary engineering must request FTA approval to enter the final design phase of development. The request must provide information that demonstrates to FTA the technical capability and financial capacity of the local project sponsor to advance the project into final design. Like the approval to enter into preliminary engineering, this approval is based upon a review and evaluation of the costs, benefits, and impacts under the statutory project evaluation criteria. Final design is the last phase of project development, and includes right-of-way acquisition, utility relocation, and the preparation of final construction plans (including construction management plans), detailed specifications, construction cost estimates, and bid documents. Final design is typically eligible for 49 U.S.C. 5309 new start funds. Comment. In the NPRM to this rule, FTA asked for public comment on the relationship between the alternatives analysis requirement and the planning and project development processes. A total of nine comments addressed this  76869  issue. Two respondents, a transit industry trade association and a large transit operator, objected to the fact that an alternatives analysis is required for transit new starts, but not for highway projects. Another transit operator objected to alternatives analysis as ``outside'' of the ``normal'' corridor study process, topheavy and burdensome, and inconsistent with planning regulations. Response. It is in fact true that Federal highway programs do not require an analysis of alternatives in the same manner as the new starts program. However, this is a fact of law, not Departmental policy. The new starts program is a discretionary funding program; alternatives analyses are required to develop information for decisionmaking purposes. Conversely, the Federal highway program is a formula program; no Federal decisionmaking is required. Neither FTA nor DOT are at liberty to remove the requirement for alternatives analysis from the new starts program, or to impose a similar requirement on the Federal highway program. To do so would require a change in the law by Congress. As for the perceived inconsistency with planning regulations, the joint FTA/FHWA planning regulations are designed to be consistent for both agencies' major capital investment programs; they neither require FHWA-funded projects to undergo alternatives analysis, nor prevent FTA-funded new starts from meeting the statutory requirement that an alternatives analysis be conducted. Comment. One transit operator commented that the issuance of this rule should be delayed until the revisions required by TEA21 to the FTA/FHWA planning and project development regulations have been issued. Response. This rule applies only to FTA's own evaluations of proposed new starts, which does not feed into the planning process; rather, FTA's new starts evaluations rely upon the data and information derived from the planning process. Therefore, FTA is not persuaded that formal implementation of the TEA21 new starts provisions should be delayed further. Should the final planning rule require changes to the new starts project development process, however, this rule will be amended accordingly. Comment. Two commenters expressed confusion regarding the ``demise'' of the Major Investment Study (MIS), and requested clarification. Response. Section 1308 of TEA21 eliminated the separate requirement for an MIS and integrated its basic concepts into the joint planning and  VerDate 11 2000  15:19 Dec 06, 2000  Jkt 194001  PO 00000  Frm 00007  Fmt 4701  Sfmt 4700  E:\FR\FM\07DER4.SGM  pfrm01  PsN: 07DER4   76870  Federal Register / Vol. 65, No. 236 / Thursday, December 7, 2000 / Rules and Regulations which new starts project sponsors make use of the appreciable increases in formula funding for alternatives analysis and preliminary engineering, when evaluating the local financial commitment of proposed new starts. Comment. Twelve comments addressed the issue of the statutory requirement for FTA approval to advance into preliminary engineering and final design. Most expressed some degree of discomfort with the notion of such approvals, and noted a need for more guidance and better definitions of the stages of project development and the development process itself. The strongest objection was expressed by a transit operator who asserted the project development process is separate and distinct from the evaluation process, and that proposed new starts projects should therefore simply be permitted to proceed without FTA approval. Response. In most cases, the ``newness'' of this approval requirement seems to be responsible for much of the confusion. The requirement for FTA approval to enter final design was added to the new starts program by TEA21; this rule simply implements that requirement. FTA is not at liberty to change the law through this or any other rulemaking process. FTA approval has long been required to enter into preliminary engineering, though the role of the project ratings process was not as large. Comment. Four of those commenting on the approval requirement, including a transit industry trade association, requested clarification of what is required to fulfill the requirements for completion of the various stages of development. Response. The language concerning alternatives analysis, preliminary engineering, and final design has been revised in both the text of this rule and the preamble to better describe these activities. In addition, FTA issued guidance in September 1999 which clarifies the project development and approval process. Comment. The industry trade association also suggested that local financial commitment not be considered for approval to enter the next stage, a comment echoed by a transit operator. Another transit operator and the trade association suggested that different requirements be established for approval to enter preliminary engineering than for final design. The apparent fear is that worthy projects may be denied approval to enter preliminary engineering simply because adequate information on costs and benefits is not available with a high level of certainty so early in the development process. Response. Section 5309(e)(6) clearly states that FTA may only approve the advancement of a proposed project to the next stage of development if it meets the statutory project evaluation criteria, and is likely to continue to do so. However, FTA recognizes that the level of information available and the degree of certainty varies according to the stage of project development; the earlier in the process a proposed project is, the less certain the forecasts and estimates. For this reason, FTA sets different standards for high, medium, and low ratings for preliminary engineering than for final design; the further a proposed project is in the process, the higher the standard. In the case of local financial commitment, for example, it may be sufficient to simply demonstrate a reasonable financial plan that identifies proposed sources of local funds needed to construct the project (i.e., to show that the sponsors have considered how they intend to pay for it) when seeking approval to enter preliminary engineering. It is not reasonable to expect ballot measures to have passed and funds to have been programmed at this stage. However, by the time a proposed project is ready to enter final design, most or all of the local funds should be committed, including provisions for cost overruns. It has been a longstanding FTA practice in the management of the new starts program and the project evaluation process to make such distinctions among the stages of project development; this practice has been discussed in the Annual Report on New Starts and its predecessor, the annual Report on Funding Levels and Allocations of Funds, since the May 1991 edition. Further, FTA cannot assign project ratings during alternatives analysis, as there is essentially no project to evaluate until the locallypreferred alternative is selected. Project sponsors need not worry that they will ``fail'' the evaluation process simply because their proposed project is still in the early development stages. Comment. The trade association and three other commenters also requested language clarifying that projects already in preliminary engineering at the time the final rule is issued have met the requirement for alternatives analysis, as have prior Major Investment Studies (MISs). Response. This rule in no way revokes prior FTA approvals for preliminary engineering (or final design). Language to this effect has been added to  611.7, Relation to planning and project development processes.  environmental regulations issued by FTA and FHWA (23 CFR parts 450 and 771). Existing MIS activities will still satisfy the requirement for an alternatives analysis, and project sponsors who wish to follow the principles of the multimodal MIS to conduct new alternatives analyses are encouraged to do so. The joint planning and environmental regulations will more fully describe how the MIS concepts will be integrated into the process. Comment. The NPRM noted that FTA does not support the use of section 5309 new starts funds for initial planning activities, given the demands placed on the program and the availability of funds from other FTA programs for this purpose, and stated that FTA would consider this when evaluating local financial commitment. Six comments were received on this issue. Four commenters objected to what they viewed as ``penalizing'' project sponsors for using new starts funds for planning activities relating to proposed new starts projects; one commenter asked for clarification as to whether such projects would be penalized; and one (a transit operator) supported limiting the use of new starts funds for planning. One transit operator, citing the statutory 8 percent limit on program funding for activities other than final design and construction, noted that Congress ``clearly intended'' for section 5309 funds to be used for alternatives analysis and preliminary engineering. A local government entity claimed that there was no ``statutory basis'' for including the use of section 5309 funds for planning purposes as part of the project evaluation process, and noted that it would be inappropriate to ``penalize'' projects that Congress saw fit to earmark. This same commenter suggested measuring such uses of funds against the 8% limit established in TEA21. Response. The Final Rule retains the principle that FTA will consider the degree to which initial planning activities are conducted without funding from section 5309 as part of our evaluation of the local financial commitment. This is not intended as a ``penalty'' for project sponsors who seek and secure Congressional earmarks for these activities. Rather, it is intended to give a degree of recognition to the efforts of sponsors who make use of existing sources of Federal, State, and local planning funds, such as those noted above. Further, making such considerations is consistent with Congressional direction.

One commenter requested a regulation to define ``major investment studies.'' Response. The discussion of alternatives analysis earlier in the preamble to this rule has been revised to better address this issue. The pending joint FTA/FHWA planning and environmental regulations will more fully describe the integration of the MIS into the planning and environmental process under TEA21. E. Section 611.9: Project Justification Criteria Section 5309(e)(1)(B) requires the Secretary to determine that a proposed new starts project is justified based on a comprehensive review of its mobility improvements, environmental benefits, cost effectiveness, and operating efficiencies. To make this determination, FTA will evaluate information developed through the planning and project development processes. The method used to make these determinations is a multiple measure approach in which the merits of candidate projects will be evaluated against a set of measures. The ratings for each measure will be updated annually for purposes of the annual report on funding levels and allocations of funds required by section 5309(o)(1), the supplemental report required by section 5309(o)(2), and as required for FTA approvals to enter into preliminary engineering, final design, or FFGAs. As a candidate project proceeds through the stages of the project development process, a greater degree of certainty is expected with respect to these measures. Measures have been established for each of the following criteria: 1. Mobility improvements; 2. Environmental benefits; 3. Operating efficiencies; 4. Transportation System User Benefits (Cost Effectiveness); 5. Existing land use, transit supportive land use policies, and future patterns; and 6. Other factors, including: (a) The degree to which the policies and programs (e.g., parking policies, etc.) are in place as assumed in the forecasts; (b) Project management capability; and (c) Additional factors relevant to local and national priorities and relevant to the success of the project. For each proposed project, FTA will assign one of five descriptive ratings (``high,'' ``medium-high,'' ``medium,'' ``low-medium,'' or ``low'') for each of the first five criteria; information on ``other factors'' will be reported as appropriate. The measures for the project evaluation criteria are described in Appendix A to this rule. FTA may amend or modify these measures in response to the results of ongoing research into methods for evaluating the benefits of transit investments. Comment. In the NPRM for this Rule, FTA proposed that in all cases, the proposed new start would be evaluated against both a no-build and Transportation System Management (TSM) alternative. The retention of the TSM was the subject of substantial comment in response to the NPRM. A total of 13 comments were submitted on this issue, all of them opposed. Most of the commenters felt that it was unnecessarily burdensome to maintain a TSM alternative for what they viewed as solely FTA's purposes, noting that certain incremental system improvements will occur whether the new start is constructed or not; i.e., it is no longer appropriate to view the nobuild alternative as a ``do nothing'' scenario. The most common suggestion was that, if the TSM requirement is retained, it should be dropped after alternatives analysis has resulted in the selection of a locally-preferred alternative. Response. FTA accepts the argument that it is no longer appropriate to assume that a no-build alternative presents a ``do nothing'' scenario. The realities of modern urban and suburban planning, transportation, and economic development make it virtually impossible to assume that no improvements will occur if a proposed new start is not implemented. At the same time, however, a consistent baseline is needed to ensure a fair evaluation of proposed new starts projects nationwide. The TSM alternative has served well in this regard. In response to comments submitted on this issue and in recognition of the desire to simplify the new starts process, this Rule eliminates the requirement for separate no-build and TSM alternatives, and instead requires that the proposed new start be evaluated against a single ``baseline alternative.'' The baseline alternative is best described as transit improvements lower in cost than the proposed new start, which result in a better ratio of measures of transit mobility compared to cost than the no build alternative; the ``best you can do'' without the new start investment. The purpose of the baseline comparison is to isolate the costs and benefits of the proposed major transit investment. At a minimum, the baseline  76871  alternative must include in the project corridor all reasonable cost-effective transit improvements short of investment in the new start project. Depending on the circumstances and through prior agreement with FTA, the baseline alternative can be defined appropriately in one of three ways. First, where the adopted financially constrained regional transportation plan includes within the corridor all reasonable cost-effective transit improvements short of the new start project, a the no-build alternative that includes those improvements may serve as the baseline. Second, where additional cost-effective transit improvements can be made beyond those provided by the adopted plan, the baseline will incorporate those costeffective transit improvements as well. Third, where the proposed new start project is part of a multimodal alternative that includes major highway components, the baseline alternative will be the preferred multimodal alternative without the new start project and associated transit services. Prior to submittal of a request to enter preliminary engineering for the new start project, grantees must obtain FTA approval of the definition of the baseline alternative. Consistent with the requirement that differences between the new start project and the baseline alternative measure only the benefits and costs of the project itself, planning factors external to the new start project and its supporting bus service must be the same for both the baseline and new start project alternatives. Consequently, the highway and transit networks defined for the analysis must be the same outside the corridor for which the new start project is proposed. Further, policies affecting travel demand and travel costs, such as land use, transit fares and parking costs, must be applied consistently to both the baseline alternative and the new start project alternative. The Final Rule has been rewritten to substitute ``baseline alternative'' wherever ``no-build and TSM alternatives'' appeared in the NPRM, and a definition for ``baseline alternative'' has been added. ``Existing land use, transit supportive land use policies, and future patterns'' is not listed among the project justification criteria contained in 49 U.S.C. 5309(e)(1)(B), but is listed as one of the ``considerations'' under 49 U.S.C. 5309(e)(3) that FTA must take into account when determining a proposed project's ``justification.'' Consistent with past practice, we have included land use among the project justification  VerDate 11 2000  15:19 Dec 06, 2000  Jkt 194001  PO 00000  Frm 00009  Fmt 4701  Sfmt 4700  E:\FR\FM\07DER4.SGM  pfrm01  PsN: 07DER4   76872  Federal Register / Vol. 65, No. 236 / Thursday, December 7, 2000 / Rules and Regulations further detail on specific information that should be collected and how the criteria should be evaluated. Much of the data required to consider these factors is already developed as part of the existing planning and project development processes, however, as required under 23 CFR part 450 and 23 CFR part 771. FTA believes these considerations are already adequately addressed by the current project justification criteria and measures. When evaluating proposed new starts projects, FTA will apply these criteria to the project as proposed for Federal funding under 49 U.S.C. section 5309. This means that if local project sponsors are seeking new starts funding at this time for a segment of a larger planned transit investment, only that specific segment will be evaluated. Comment. FTA received 24 comments relating to the criteria for mobility improvements. Of these, 15 addressed the issue of mobility for low-income households. Ten commenters recommended revising the low-income mobility measure to include destinations, such as employment areas, within 1/2-mile of boarding points, in addition to the existing measure for households. Two commenters recommended expanding the lowincome household measure to include other populations that tend towards transit-dependence, such as senior citizens, students, and persons with disabilities. One recommended accounting for discretionary riders, and another suggested eliminating the measure for low-income mobility, perceiving that it perpetuated an image of transit as a carrier of poor people that persons of middle-class status would not want to ride. One commenter suggested that low-income mobility be separated from the measure for mobility improvements. Other comments on this measure included two recommendations to incorporate a consideration for congestion, two requests to incorporate a measure for delays and ``incidents'' on the transit system, various calls for ``better measures,'' and recommendations that different measures be applied to different modes of transit (i.e., light rail versus commuter rail). Response. FTA recognizes that a system that is located near low-income households is of little use to residents unless it can also provide access to employment centers and other activity centers. Therefore, a factor for destinations within a 1/2-mile radius of new stations has been added to the measure for mobility improvements. FTA is required by section 5309(e)(3)(D) to ``consider the degree to which the (proposed) project increases the mobility of the mass transportation dependent population, or promotes economic development.'' For a variety of reasons, low-income households were chosen as a surrogate for measuring the transit dependent population. Chief among these is the fact that transit dependence is often a factor of income. Many people rely on transit service for basic mobility--some by necessity, and some by economic choice; many residents of upscale central city neighborhoods simply choose not to own an automobile. There is value in considering all of these people in the measure for basic mobility; however, were transit service suddenly eliminated, those riders with an economic choice would find other alternatives available to them. Further, many of those riders who ride transit by choice do so because it permits them to bypass congestion on highways and city streets. These benefits would already be accounted for in the measure for travel time savings. The focus on low income households provides a clearer--though still imperfect--assessment of how well the proposed project would serve those who do not have the ability to choose; i.e., the mass transit dependent population specified in the statute. The comments calling for better measures to assess the mobility improvements of a proposed project are well taken; unfortunately, no recommendations for new measures or methodologies accompanied those comments. FTA is as interested as the transit industry in advancing the state of the art of transit planning, and is conducting research into better ways to measure the various benefits of transit service, particularly high-quality rail systems. Beginning on September 1, 2001, this Rule employs a revised measure of travel benefits based on a multimodal measure of perceived travel times faced by all users of the transportation system. As new measures and methods become available, FTA may amend or modify this rule. Comment. Ten comments were received on the criterion for environmental benefits; no two were alike. One interest group suggested that impacts on areas where energy is generated (i.e., the location of a remote generating plant) be incorporated into the evaluation, and that energy comparisons be made on a passengermile basis. One transit operator recommended incorporating ``nonscientific `quality of life ''' factors. Two interest groups objected to the use of BTUs, with one suggesting the use of  criteria for a number of reasons. Transitsupportive land use, whether it is a factor of existing patterns, existing local policies, or planned future development which targets development around the Federally-assisted project, has been an important indicator of future project success. Additionally, TEA21 added two new land-use-related considerations to the project evaluation process: The reduction in local infrastructure costs achieved through compact land use development (49 U.S.C. 5309(e)(3)(B)), and the cost of suburban sprawl (49 U.S.C. 5309(e)(3)(C)). This appears to be a clear intent by Congress to give additional attention to this issue. The NPRM for this Rule labeled the land use criteria as ``transit supportive existing land use policies and future patterns.'' This has been changed to ``existing land use, transit supportive land use plans, and future patterns'' in this Rule, to more accurately reflect FTA's practices in evaluating land use issues relating to proposed new starts. The underlying factors described in paragraph (e) of Appendix A to this rule have been revised in response to this change. In making the determination of project justification, 49 U.S.C. 5309(e)(3) requires the FTA to consider a variety of factors, as follows: 1. The direct and indirect costs of relevant alternatives; 2. Factors such as congestion relief, improved mobility, air pollution, noise pollution, energy consumption, and all associated ancillary and mitigation costs necessary to carry out each alternative analyzed; 3. Existing land use, mass transportation-supportive land use policies, future patterns, and the cost of suburban sprawl; 4. The degree to which the project increases the mobility of the mass transportation dependent population or promotes economic development; 5. Population density and current transit ridership in the corridor; 6. The technical capability of the grant recipient to construct the project; 7. Differences in local land, construction, and operating costs; and 8. Other factors that the Secretary determines appropriate. This represents a modest expansion of the ``considerations'' established by ISTEA. Specifically, section 3009(e) of TEA21 added the consideration for the cost of suburban sprawl noted in (3) above; for population density and current transit ridership in the corridor in (5) above; and for the technical capacity of the grantee to carry out the proposed project in (6) above. The ``considerations'' serve to illustrate the project justification criteria, providing  VerDate 11 2000  15:19 Dec 06, 2000  Jkt 194001  PO 00000  Frm 00010  Fmt 4701  Sfmt 4700  E:\FR\FM\07DER4.SGM  pfrm01  PsN: 07DER4   Federal Register / Vol. 65, No. 236 / Thursday, December 7, 2000 / Rules and Regulations vehicle miles traveled (VMT) instead and the other suggesting that if it is retained, the measure should be limited to non-renewable energy sources and should include energy used in construction. Two commented that greater weight should be given to proposed projects in nonattainment areas, and one individual commenter recommended that other benefits should be included, such as reduced parking demand which would reduce parking lot runoff. One local government recommended that the evaluation consider wetlands and endangered species habitats. Response. It should be noted that this evaluation does not represent the only relationship between the new starts process and environmental considerations. All proposed new starts projects must meet NEPA requirements as a condition of eligibility for funding. Thus, factors such as runoff, wetlands, and the habitat of endangered species are already considered. In addition, EPA classifications for attainment/ nonattainment are also considered as part of the evaluation of environmental benefits for all proposed new starts projects. To the extent that ``greater weight'' can be given to proposed projects in nonattainment areas, 49 USC 5309(e)(8)(B) provides expedited procedures for FTA decisionmaking and prohibits any limitations on the simultaneous evaluation of proposed projects in at least two corridors in such cases. This is reflected in paragraph (c) under  611.3 of this rule. It should be noted that previously, these projects were also exempt from evaluation under the new starts criteria; this provision was among those eliminated by TEA 21. Quality of life issues, to the extent that they can be identified and defined for individual projects, are more appropriately addressed in the ``other factors'' criteria than as part of the measures for environmental benefits. BTUs were chosen as the measure for reporting energy consumption because they represent a universal and universally-accepted measure of energy. While it may be possible to evaluate changes in energy consumption in terms of gallons of gasoline, gallons of diesel fuel, barrels of crude oil, kilowatt-hours of electricity, or tons of coal, a universal measure is needed to compare these energy sources to each other and to evaluate the benefits of one project in comparison to others. Comment. Three comments were submitted on the measures for evaluating operating efficiencies. One operator of a major northeastern transit system commented that the change in operating cost per passenger mile would give high marks for crowding and penalize proposed projects that would mitigate crowding, a topic that was raised by others in comments relating to the measure for cost effectiveness. One interest group recommended no changes to the measure, but suggested that the TSM alternative be dropped after entry into preliminary engineering and proposed language for incorporation into the rule. One individual commenter opined that cost per passenger mile is easily manipulated, costs vary across the country, and recommended the establishment of thresholds for number of peak and off-peak passengers, with a pass/fail rating. Response. Concerns regarding the ``ease'' with which information for this measure might be ``manipulated'' are noted, but they are ultimately not relevant to the process. Project sponsors are required to certify to FTA that the information submitted under the project evaluation criteria is developed in compliance with FTA's technical guidance. Any attempt at manipulation of data would likely be discovered during the evaluation and approval process. This measure is but one of the many criteria under which proposed new starts are evaluated, and will not by itself ``make or break'' a project. The other comments are addressed elsewhere in the preamble to this rule. Comment. FTA received a total of 32 comments on the measure for cost effectiveness. The NPRM for this rule solicited comment on the retention of FTA's historical ``cost per new rider'' (or more properly, incremental cost per incremental rider) measure to indicate cost effectiveness, and asked if there were other measurements. Twenty-three comments were submitted in response this request. An additional nine commenters addressed this issue as part of their general comments on the NPRM. All were unanimous in their assertion that the cost effectiveness measure should ``roll up'' additional benefits beyond incremental cost per incremental rider. The consensus was that focusing on new riders alone ignores benefits to other riders, and thus biases the measure against older cities with ``mature'' transit systems where the focus of a proposed new start would be on improving service, not attracting new riders. Most recommended a measure based on ``cost per benefiting rider'' or simply ``cost per rider.'' The most common examples of benefits given in comments were reductions in crowding and travel time savings. A trade group representing the transit industry recommended the formation of a  76873  committee to study the issues. One transit operator recommended a ``fullcost accounting approach'' incorporating the full range of societal impacts, including local policy decisions on land use and parking; another operator recommended a measure based on transit system throughput. Others recommended including cost per new trip, new riders attracted to the existing system by the new start, total annualized cost per rider, travel time savings, and accounting for the conversion of multimodal trips to transit trips, and single-occupant vehicle (SOV) trips to multimodal trips. Response. It is important to note that the measure for cost effectiveness is not intended to be a single, stand-alone indicator of the merits of a proposed new starts project. It is but one part of the multiple measure method that FTA uses to evaluate project justification under the statutory criteria. While cost effectiveness is an important consideration, so are mobility improvements, environmental benefits, and the other factors described both in TEA21 and elsewhere in this rule. However, FTA is aware that the cost effectiveness measure is often interpreted by project sponsors, State and local decisionmakers, and even elsewhere within the Executive and Legislative branches of the Federal government as ``the'' measure that will ``make or break'' a proposed new start. In light of this, and in response to the unanimous call by commenters for a ``better'' measure of cost effectiveness, FTA has developed a measure of ``transportation system user benefits'' to more accurately address the criteria for cost effectiveness. In simple terms, the basic goal of any major transportation investment is to reduce the amount of travel time and out-of-pocket costs that people incur for taking a trip; the cost of mobility. The new Transportation System User Benefits measure of cost effectiveness measures the change in these costs, and accounts for changes to transit, highway, and other modes of travel. This new cost effectiveness measure replaces the current ``dollars per new rider'' figure that can be--and often is-- perceived as ``subsidy per new rider.'' This approach de-emphasizes new riders and measures not only the benefits to people who change modes, but also accounts for benefits within modes (i.e., benefits to existing riders and highway users). The Transportation System User Benefits measure is not new to FTA or to the new starts project evaluation process. A similar combination of cost  VerDate 11 2000  15:19 Dec 06, 2000  Jkt 194001  PO 00000  Frm 00011  Fmt 4701  Sfmt 4700  E:\FR\FM\07DER4.SGM  pfrm01  PsN: 07DER4   76874  Federal Register / Vol. 65, No. 236 / Thursday, December 7, 2000 / Rules and Regulations workshop expressed concern that the measure for land use would bias the new starts process in favor of suburban projects. One transit operator in a southwestern city that does not have zoning ordinances recommended incorporating a consideration for voluntary actions by the community to coordinate station area development, and objected to the elevation of land use considerations to the ``status'' of the other statutory criteria. An operator in another southwestern city in the same State commented that ratings should be based only on factors over which transit operators have control, and noted that similar evaluation criteria should be applied to FHWA funds. In contrast, a council of governments from a city in the Pacific Northwest recommended that FTA give significant weight to regions with a history of containing sprawl. The final common theme among some of the commenters was to question the connection between land use and transportation planning. One commenter noted that the criterion assumes coordination between transportation and planning, and two questioned or flatly rejected any correlation between transportation and land use. Response. This rule does not represent a substantial change from existing FTA policy or practice. Even prior to TEA21, FTA included land use among the primary evaluation criteria. As noted earlier in this preamble, while land use is not one of the project justification criteria specified in Federal transit law, it is included among the factors that FTA is to consider when applying those criteria. Additionally, TEA21 added two new land use considerations to the evaluation process; a clear intent by Congress to give additional attention to this issue. Contrary to those comments that questioned the link between transportation and land use, FTA has found that transit supportive local land use policies have been an important indicator of the future success of Federally-assisted new starts projects. In response to the comment that highway projects should be subject to a similar evaluation of land use, FTA is tempted to agree. However, as noted in response to a similar comment on the alternatives analysis requirement, highway projects are funded under a formula program and are not subject to the same evaluation process as transit new starts, which are funded under a discretionary program, and FTA is not at liberty to change the law or otherwise impose such a requirement. Finally, in terms of flexibility in the application of the land use criteria, FTA finds that the existing process, which will continue under this rule, offers an acceptable balance between the need for comparability among proposed projects and the desire to permit project sponsors in each region to highlight their own successes in linking transit and land use planning. This can and often does include privately-sponsored transit-oriented development. A new starts investment requires a regional commitment by a variety of State and local agencies, as well as the community at large; those who have a stake in the financing and construction of a new start also have a stake in its ultimate success. Thus, it is not unreasonable to expect the same degree of commitment to regional planning as to project funding. Reflecting that same concept of local commitment, this Rule also incorporates an element for pedestrian mobility into the land use measure. Pedestrian mobility has been a component of FTA's land use evaluation, as described in guidance issued each year at the beginning of the data collection process. This Rule formalizes that approach. Pedestrian facilities represent the basic, common link among all modes of transportation; therefore, a regional emphasis on pedestrian facilities and systems as part of land use planning will enhance the mobility of the population and the utility of the planned transit investment. Language has been added to appendix A of this Rule to specify that the land use measure will include consideration of existing and planned pedestrian facilities, which are expected to reflect curb ramp transition plans and milestones as required under 28 CFR 35.150(d)(2). F. Section 611.11: Local Financial Commitment Section 5309(e)(1)(C) requires that proposed projects also be supported by an acceptable degree of local financial commitment, including evidence of stable and dependable financing sources to construct, maintain and operate the system or extension. This proposed rule retains the following measures for evaluation of the local financial commitment to a proposed project: 1. The proposed share of total project costs from sources other than the section 5309 new starts program, including Federal formula and flexible funds, the local match required by Federal law, any additional capital funding (``overmatch''), and the degree to which initial planning activities have  and travel time savings for new and existing riders was identified as a measure for cost effectiveness in the 1984 Statement of Policy on Urban Mass Transportation Major Capital Investments. User benefits are a good measure of the effectiveness of a major transit investment; however, the Transportation System User Benefits measure should not be interpreted as a single measure of all of the expected benefits of a new starts project. Those in search of a single measure that ``rolls up'' the overall benefits expected of a proposed new start should direct their attention towards the overall rating for project justification; the Transportation System User Benefits measure of cost effectiveness is but a single component. This rule has been revised to reflect this new approach. In addition, FTA will publish guidance describing how project sponsors should calculate and report the new cost effectiveness measure for evaluation purposes. The new Transportation System User Benefits measure of cost effectiveness will be phased in over time, becoming effective on September 1, 2001. Comment. FTA received a total of 19 comments relating to the land use criterion. In general, the comments reflected a general concern over how land use will be measured and used as a factor for project evaluation. While there was no clear pattern to the comments, a number of recurring themes were apparent. One of these themes was ``flexibility.'' A transit industry trade association and a new starts interest group supported the measure in general, but noted that its application should be flexible enough to account for regional differences, and that guidance would be essential; one recommended that FTA undertake a study of the ``cost of sprawl'' and suggested alternative language for the final rule. One transit operator submitted comments in support of the trade association. The second theme that arose from the comments concerned the application of the land use measure. Five commenters expressed confusion or concern over a perceived vagueness of the land use criterion, terming it ``nebulous,'' ``vague'' and ``ambiguous.'' Two commenters noted that land use issues would already be captured by other project justification measures or through the modeling process, and two others expressed concerns over a perceived reporting burden. Two more commented that land use would vary greatly by alternative and alignment. One transit operator in a major northeastern city and one commenter at the Oakland, CA  VerDate 11 2000  15:19 Dec 06, 2000  Jkt 194001  PO 00000  Frm 00012  Fmt 4701  Sfmt 4700  E:\FR\FM\07DER4.SGM  pfrm01  PsN: 07DER4   Federal Register / Vol. 65, No. 236 / Thursday, December 7, 2000 / Rules and Regulations been carried out without relying on funds from  5309. Comment. Three commenters expressed confusion over whether ``non5309 funds'' included only local funds, or whether other Federal funds would be counted as part of ``local'' funding. Response. Paragraph (a) under the heading, ``Local Financial Commitment'' in Appendix A to this rule has been revised to specify that the proposed local share of project costs is defined as the percentage of capital costs to be met using funds from sources other than the new starts program under 49 U.S.C. 5309. Thus, the use of flexible funds from other Federal sources will not be considered as part of the ``Federal share'' for purposes of evaluation under this Rule (though for purposes of funding eligibility the statutory ratio of at least 20 percent local funding must still be met using other than Federal funds). 2. The stability and reliability of the proposed capital financing plan (rated ``high,'' ``medium-high,'' ``medium,'' ``low-medium,'' or ``low''). 3. The stability and reliability of the sponsoring agency to fund the operating needs of the entire transit system as planned once the guideway project is built. Ratings of ``high,'' ``mediumhigh,'' ``medium,'' ``low-medium,'' or ``low'' will be used to describe stability and reliability of operating revenue. The measures for these criteria are carried over intact from those used previously, and are more fully explained in Appendix A. The only changes are that ``overmatch'' was added as a statutory consideration by TEA21, and an acknowledgement was added that FTA will consider whether adequate provisions have been made to fund the capital needs of the entire transit system as planned, including key station plans and milestones as required by the Americans with Disabilities Act. Comment. Eleven commenters expressed varying opinions and made numerous recommendations on the local financial commitment criteria, but no clear theme emerged. A transit industry trade group urged FTA to consider not only the strength of the funding plan, but also the degree of commitment, the level of policy commitment to the project and funds already secured, and recommended addressing the level of commitment to the overall capital program. One transit operator from the mid-Atlantic region expressed support for the trade association's position. An industry interest group requested more detailed, prescriptive requirements. One State DOT that is also a Statewide transit operator wrote in support of their trustfund-supported Statewide intermodal system, and stated that projects in such States should not be judged inferior to those that rely on project-specific ballot measures. Response. The existing project evaluation and rating process, already accounts for factors such as the strength of the local commitment, the level of policy commitment to the proposed project, the level of commitment to the overall capital program. This practice would continue under this rule. Contrary to the comment implying that Statewide trust funds would be judged ``inferior'' to other financing plans, such dedicated funding sources offer a distinct advantage in the rating process. It should be noted, however, that the mere existence of a dedicated Statewide funding source is not sufficient to achieve a high rating; as a project proceeds through preliminary engineering and final design, evidence that sufficient funds have been committed and programmed to the project will also be required. The comment that this Rule is not prescriptive enough is puzzling; Federal agencies are more often criticized for being too prescriptive and inflexible. This Rule is intended to strike a balance between the need to apply a consistent standard, and the need to allow for the differences inherent in locally-derived projects. G. Section 611.13: Overall Project Ratings Perhaps the most significant change to this process brought by TEA21 is the requirement that FTA establish summary recommendations for each project, in addition to the ratings for each of the project justification criteria. Section 5309(e)(6) requires FTA to ``evaluate and rate (each) project as `highly recommended,' `recommended,' or `not recommended,' '' based on the results of the project evaluation process. It also requires that ratings be assigned to each of the individual evaluation criteria. FTA will combine the ratings for each of the financial rating factors and project justification criteria into overall ``finance'' and ``justification'' ratings of ``high,'' ``medium-high,'' ``medium,'' ``low-medium,'' or ``low.'' These ratings will then be combined into the single, overall project ratings required by TEA 21. For a proposed project to be rated as ``recommended,'' it must be rated at least ``medium'' in terms of both finance and justification. To be ``highly recommended,'' a proposed project must be rated at least ``medium-high'' for both finance and justification. Proposed projects not rated at least  76875  ``medium'' in both finance and justification will be rated as ``not recommended.'' These ratings will be used both to approve entry into preliminary engineering and final design, as input to recommend proposed projects for Federal funding commitments, and for purposes of the Annual and Supplemental Reports on New Starts under section 5309(o)(1) and (2). A proposed project must receive a rating of at least ``recommended'' in order to be approved for any of these purposes. Comment. A total of 14 comments addressed the overall project ratings. Virtually all of them expressed discomfort with the terms, particularly the term, ``not recommended.'' The most common concern was that a meritorious project would be rated ``not recommended'' simply because it had not been sufficiently developed to be rated. Nine commenters suggested renaming the ``not recommended'' rating or creating a separate rating such as ``not ready for recommendation,'' ``not rated,'' ``not ready,'' ``incomplete,'' or ``not currently recommended.'' One commenter at the Washington, DC workshop noted that proposed projects that ``fail'' should be provided with information explaining the rationale for the ratings. There was also substantial discussion at all three workshops concerning the permanence of the ratings, opportunities to change ratings, and so forth. Response. The terms used for the overall project ratings--``highly recommended,'' ``recommended'' and ``not recommended'' `` are established in law by TEA21, and FTA is not at liberty to change them. We can, however, elaborate. While the names used for the overall ratings will continue to be given as ``highly recommended,'' ``recommended'' and ``not recommended,'' in the case of the ``not recommended'' rating we will indicate the reason for the rating. In order to be rated at least ``recommended,'' a proposed new starts project must be rated at least ``medium'' for both project justification and local financial commitment. In order to be rated at least ``medium'' for local financial commitment, a proposed project must be rated at least ``medium'' in terms of the stability and reliability of operating funds, and the stability and reliability of capital funding. When a proposed project is rated ``not recommended,'' FTA will indicate which of these areas requires improvement: ``J'' for project justification, ``O'' for the operating funding plan, and ``C'' for the capital funding plan. Thus, a proposed new  VerDate 11 2000  15:19 Dec 06, 2000  Jkt 194001  PO 00000  Frm 00013  Fmt 4701  Sfmt 4700  E:\FR\FM\07DER4.SGM  pfrm01  PsN: 07DER4   76876  Federal Register / Vol. 65, No. 236 / Thursday, December 7, 2000 / Rules and Regulations confusion. They are concerned that projects that are ``not ready'' to be rated will be unfairly given a ``not recommended'' rating simply because they are still early in the development process. They therefore suggest that the overall ratings be used only for purposes of FTA's annual funding recommendations to Congress, and not as an indicator of overall merit. Were FTA to adopt this suggestion, however, it would guarantee that all projects for which FTA did not recommend funding in the President's budget request would receive a summary rating of ``not recommended,'' regardless of merit; i.e., it would actually cause the effect the trade association wishes to avoid, and would increase, not decrease, the degree of confusion over these ratings. FTA is convinced that Congress intended for the overall ratings to be used to denote project merit, and that FTA's practice of applying different rating standards at different stages of project development already prevents the difficulties imagined by the trade association. Further, FTA would like to remind the transit industry, Federal, State and local decisionmakers, and the public at large that proposed new starts projects are rerated at least annually for the Annual Report on New Starts, as well as at the time approval is sought for entry into preliminary engineering, final design, and entry into an FFGA. The overall ratings are not permanent judgements of project worth. Comment. One transit operator objected to the statutorily-required approval to enter preliminary engineering and final design, urging that proposed projects be permitted to proceed regardless of funding recommendations. This same operator also objected to the requirement that proposed projects be rated at least ``medium'' for both finance and justification, claiming that one category should be sufficient. Response. This comment also reflects confusion regarding the annual funding recommendations versus a rating of ``recommended.'' Neither FTA's project funding recommendations nor annual appropriations earmarks have any bearing on FTA's approval for a proposed project to enter the next phase of development. FTA is not persuaded by the argument that a rating of at least ``medium'' for either justification or finance is sufficient, and will continue to require both. To do otherwise would be to suggest that enough money can offset a poorly justified project, or that the inability of project sponsors to secure adequate funding would not be a barrier if the proposed project is ``good enough.'' Clearly neither is the case. It takes a worthy project with a sound local financial commitment to ensure a successful new start. VII. Response to Request for Comments on Particular Issues The NPRM specifically solicited comment on four issues: (1) Should FTA establish ``threshold'' or ``pass/fail'' values for evaluating each of the project evaluation criteria, and if so, what values would be appropriate; (2) Are there other means for measuring cost effectiveness than the current ``cost per new rider'' measure; (3) How should FTA evaluate the ``technical capability'' of project sponsors, and what ``other factors'' might be appropriate; and (4) How much relative attention should be given to each of the criteria in establishing the overall project ratings. A total of 31 individuals or organizations submitted comments on one or more of these questions. Question 1: Threshold Values. Consistent with FTA's 1996 Statement of Policy and prior practice, this proposed rule does not establish ``threshold'' values for the statutory project justification criteria. Instead, we rate each project as ``high,'' ``mediumhigh,'' ``medium,'' ``low-medium,'' or ``low'' according to its individual merits under each of the measures. Should FTA establish ``threshold'' or ``pass/fail'' values for evaluating each of these criteria? If so, what thresholds are appropriate for each criterion? Comment. Of the 16 responses received on this issue, 12 opposed the establishment of any type of threshold or pass/fail values for the criteria. One interest group and one local government entity dissented, supporting such requirements. One transit operator supported thresholds, but only on the condition that FTA revise the cost effectiveness measure to account for additional benefits such as travel time savings. One commenter at the Oakland, CA workshop commented that any thresholds would have to account for geographic differences. One operator noted that if thresholds are deemed necessary, they should be based on the mean or lowest value for prior ``recommended'' projects, or ranges should be established. Response. This rule does not establish threshold values for rating purposes. Question 2: Cost Effectiveness. FTA has historically relied on the measure of ``cost per new rider'' (more precisely, incremental cost per incremental rider) to indicate cost effectiveness, an approach retained in this proposed rule. Are there other means for measuring the cost effectiveness of a proposed new starts project?  start that was found to need improvement in the capital plan would be rated ``not recommended (C).'' This will provide project sponsors, State, local, and Federal decisionmakers, and the public at large with a simple means to identify the basis for the project rating. In addition, the Annual and Supplemental Reports on New Starts, as well as all project-specific FTA correspondence, will contain language that discusses the reasoning behind the rating and note that all ratings are subject to change. Comment. Three commenters recommended that the ratings be tied to a proposed project's stage of development; i.e., different standards for preliminary engineering and final design. Response. FTA has historically applied different rating standards for different stages of project development, recognizing that it is not possible to expect the same level of detail or degree of certainty for proposed projects that are in preliminary engineering as for those nearing the end of final design and contemplating FFGAs. Each edition of the Annual Report on New Starts contains tables describing the standards applied for each of the criteria at each stage of development. This Rule does not change FTA's historical approach. It is important to note that a rating of ``recommended'' does not translate directly into a funding recommendation in any given fiscal year. Rather, the overall project ratings are intended to reflect overall project merit. Proposed projects that are rated ``recommended'' or ``highly recommended,'' and have been sufficiently developed for consideration of a Federal funding commitment (i.e., FFGA), will be eligible for funding recommendations in the Administration's proposed budget for a given fiscal year. Comment. A transit industry trade association expressed concern that proposed projects in the early stages of development would be rated ``not recommended'' because sufficient information has not been developed to address the justification criteria, and/or local funding is not in place. This, they advise, would compromise the future of such projects. They therefore suggested that the statutory ratings of ``highly recommended,'' ``recommended,'' and ``not recommended'' be used only in the context of annual funding recommendations to Congress. Response. The distinction between a rating of ``recommended'' and a funding recommendation continues to be the subject of much confusion. The comments submitted by the trade association are most illustrative of this  VerDate 11 2000  15:19 Dec 06, 2000  Jkt 194001  PO 00000  Frm 00014  Fmt 4701  Sfmt 4700  E:\FR\FM\07DER4.SGM  pfrm01  PsN: 07DER4   Federal Register / Vol. 65, No. 236 / Thursday, December 7, 2000 / Rules and Regulations Comment. The 23 comments that specifically addressed this question were unanimous in the assertion that the cost effectiveness measure should ``roll up'' additional benefits beyond incremental cost per incremental rider. The consensus was that focusing on new riders alone ignores benefits to other riders, and thus biases the measure against older cities with ``mature'' transit systems where the focus of a proposed new start would be on improving service, not attracting new riders. Most recommended a measure based on ``cost per `benefiting' rider'' or simply ``cost per rider.'' The most common examples of benefits given in comments were reductions in crowding and travel time savings. A trade group representing the interests of the transit industry recommended the formation of a committee to study the issues. One transit operator recommended a ``fullcost accounting approach'' incorporating the full range of societal impacts, including local policy decisions on land use and parking; another operator recommended a measure based on transit system throughput. Response. In response to the nearuniversal call for a new measure of cost effectiveness, FTA has developed a new Transportation System User Benefits measure. This measure is described more fully in the section of the preamble to this rule that discusses comments to the cost effectiveness measure. It should be repeated, however, that the Transportation System User Benefits Measure will be used to evaluate cost effectiveness; the overall measure for project justification represents the ``roll-up'' of anticipated benefits. Question 3: Technical Capability/ Other Factors. 49 U.S.C. 5309(e)(3) establishes a number of ``factors'' that FTA must consider when evaluating proposed projects under the justification criteria. In particular, 49 U.S.C. 5309(e)(3)(F) directs us to ``consider the technical capability of the grant recipient to construct the project,'' and 49 U.S.C. 5309(e)(3)(H) directs FTA to consider ``other factors'' as ``appropriate.'' How should FTA evaluate the ``technical capability'' of project sponsors? What ``other factors'' might be appropriate? Comment. Of the 18 commenters who responded to this question, 14 recommended that technical capacity be based on factors related to the project sponsor's experience or ``track record'' with prior new starts, the strength of the project's management plan, or some combination of these factors. One interest group and one transit operator noted that most project sponsors lack the technical expertise to implement a new start, which is why they hire contractors; one of these commenters asserted that any technical capacity measure would therefore favor existing systems with their own technical staff. However, seven commenters recommended that the experience of contractors, management teams, and/or other agency resources be considered. Two commenters recommended an evaluation including sponsors' prior success in obtaining local funds. One commenter at the Oakland workshop expressed confusion regarding the difference between a measure for technical capacity and the triennial review process. Response. FTA intends to use the technical capacity factor as an indicator of the ability of the project sponsor(s) to successfully implement a proposed new start, as well as an indicator of project ``readiness.'' To successfully implement a new starts project, the project sponsor(s) must meet the same basic legal, financial, and eligibility requirements for all FTA grants; have an adequate project management plan in place, and have adequate resources available to carry out the project management plan. By ``readiness,'' we mean that there are no outstanding issues that remain to be resolved before a funding commitment can be considered. Such outstanding issues might include unresolved environmental or mitigation issues, outstanding engineering or right-of-way issues, upcoming referenda or board actions that are crucial to the financing plan, and issues relating to other basic requirements including Title IV of the Civil Rights Act; Environmental Justice; key station, fleet accessibility, complimentary paratransit, and other requirements under the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990; and consistency with National Intelligent Transportation Systems Architecture. Comment. Six commenters offered suggestions regarding ``other factors'' that should be considered. Two of these recommended incorporating a factor for ``smart growth'' or ``livable communities,'' with one further recommending that forecasts used for such a measure be grounded in MPO forecasts and that ``extra credit'' be given to projects which support national priorities. One transit industry trade group recommended that ``other factors'' be open-ended. Other recommendations included measures for new ridership, ``willingness to commit funds,'' and advancement of multimodal choice. Response. Many of the suggestions submitted by commenters to the NPRM,  76877  such as smart growth, livable communities, and ``willingness to commit funds,'' are already captured in the primary criteria. FTA intends for the ``other factors'' category to be used as a means of portraying factors about a proposed project that the other evaluation criteria do not adequately address. Each new start is unique, each has its own ``story;'' the ``other factors'' category will permit project sponsors and FTA to consider elements of the proposed project that may otherwise be ignored in the evaluation process. FTA has therefore taken a more ``openended'' approach to the use of ``other factors'' in this Rule, and has not defined specific factors for this category. Question 4: Relative Attention to Criteria. FTA also seeks comment on how much relative attention should be given to each of the project justification criteria (mobility improvements, environmental benefits, operating efficiencies, cost effectiveness, land use and other factors) to establish the overall project ratings. Comment. Of the 16 comments received on this issue, nine supported some kind of weighting of the criteria in general, but few were specific as to which should be weighted more or less, or what those specific weights should be. Two commenters noted that the relative importance of the criteria should vary over time, either over the course of project development or as national priorities change. Three indicated that different weights should apply according to geographic area or local conditions; the citizens' advisory committee from a transit operator in a major northeastern city recommended that cost effectiveness not be considered at all in that city. Only two comments, one from a State DOT and one from an individual member of the public, recommended specific weights for specific criteria. Four comments specifically stated that there should be no weighting at all, with one major northeastern transit operator stating that the ``weights'' already used by FTA, as reported in a recent GAO report, be discontinued. Response. This rule does not establish specific weights for specific project evaluation criteria. VIII. Other Comments Additional comments were submitted to the docket concerning a variety of issues that are not easily categorized. These included issues such as concerns regarding definitions of terms used in the NPRM, to regional concerns, to the relationship with the pending FTA/ FHWA joint planning rule, to objections  VerDate 11 2000  15:19 Dec 06, 2000  Jkt 194001  PO 00000  Frm 00015  Fmt 4701  Sfmt 4700  E:\FR\FM\07DER4.SGM  pfrm01  PsN: 07DER4   76878  Federal Register / Vol. 65, No. 236 / Thursday, December 7, 2000 / Rules and Regulations have been proposed to us for funding. This Rule retains the existing requirement that segments be evaluated as individual projects. Comment. One interest group claimed that alternatives analyses lack independence and objectivity, recommending that the process instead require a vote on options or an independent poll upon circulation of the Draft Environmental Impact Study (DEIS). Response. Alternatives analysis is intended to be a means whereby the local community identifies a transportation problem and evaluates alternative solutions, eventually selecting one that best meets local needs--the locally-preferred alternative. It is incumbent upon the community to ensure that adequate opportunity for public involvement is provided, and to take advantage of those opportunities to be part of the process. Comment. One small transit operator recommended that the final rule include a schedule of deadlines for approval of proposed projects to advance, and a list of FTA contacts. Response. The comment regarding schedules and deadlines for approval assumes that all proposed new starts projects in TEA21 will be implemented, will all be found to be justified and rated as ``recommended'' or higher, and will all proceed at the same rate of progress. FTA understands the desire by one commenter for a list of FTA contacts to be published as a part of this rule. However, to do so would require an amendment to this rule, including issuance of an NPRM and a minimum 60-day period for public comment, for each change in personnel. Project sponsors are instead encouraged to contact the appropriate FTA Regional Office for their area, as follows:  Region 1 (ME, VT, NH, MA, RI, CT): Volpe National Transportation Systems Center, Kendall Square, 55 Broadway, Suite 920, Cambridge, MA 021421093.

An advisory committee to a large northeastern transit operator recommended that the criteria account for ``Congressional funding anomalies.'' Response. ``Congressional funding anomalies,'' such as annual appropriations for new starts projects that do not follow the amounts committed under the FFGA for a particular project in a given year, are only a factor in the case of projects for which FFGAs have already been issued. The execution of an FFGA represents the conclusion of the project rating process. Therefore, appropriations shortfalls do not affect the project rating process. When making annual funding recommendations for new starts, FTA attempts to adjust its funding requests to account for prior year shortfalls, but this requires no changes to the project rating criteria, measures, or process. No change to this rule has been made in response to this comment. IX. Regulatory Evaluation The Federal Transit Administration (FTA) has evaluated the industry-wide costs and benefits of the rule, Major Capital Investment Projects, which is required by section 3009(e) of TEA21. This rule sets forth the process that FTA will use to evaluate and rate major capital investments under the statutory criteria in 49 U.S.C. section 5309(e), which requires FTA to establish overall project ratings of ``highly recommended,'' ``recommended,'' or ``not recommended,'' and to consider new criteria elements. The changes required by TEA21 to FTA's preexisting statutory criteria are relatively minor and affect FTA program management operations more than a recipient's operations. The final regulatory evaluation is available for public inspection in the docket established for this rulemaking.  regarding the differences between FTA and FHWA capital programs. Comment. Four commenters expressed concerns that the FTA new starts process complicates the designbuild or ``turnkey'' approach. Two additional, related comments recommended that FTA approve FFGAs as early as possible in final design, or perhaps late in preliminary engineering. Response. Nothing in this rule prevents project sponsors from proceeding with a new start under a design-build approach. No existing FFGA requirements will be changed or waived to accommodate the designbuild process. FTA will provide guidance to project sponsors to clarify how the design-build process can be integrated with the new starts project development process and the FFGA requirements. Comment. Two transit operators, one large and one small, commented that the approach proposed in the NPRM biases the process against ``established systems in mature cities,'' calling again for more emphasis on benefits to existing riders and ``preservation of high market shares.'' Response. The Transportation System User Benefits measure for cost effectiveness moves away from the perceived emphasis on new riders and takes a much broader view of the benefits of transit. In addition, project sponsors are reminded that the cost effectiveness measure was not and is not intended as a single indicator of project merit. Established systems in mature cities may not be able to claim as many new riders as a brand-new system may expect, for example, but they have a distinct advantage under the land use criteria. Comment. One large operator objected to the evaluation of ``segments'' as separate projects, recommending that segments also be considered in relation to an entire proposed system. Another operator recommended consideration of how well a proposed new start would complement other Federal investments. Response. In many cases, local project sponsors propose an extensive regional fixed guideway transit system that must be implemented in phases over time, as Federal, State, and local funding permits. To ascribe all of the projected benefits of an entire such system to an initial segment overstates the benefits of that segment and prevents equitable comparison with other proposed new starts. Taken to its logical conclusion, it could be argued that measuring the same systemwide benefits for subsequent segments would doublecount those benefits. FTA will continue to evaluate new starts projects as they  VerDate 11 2000  15:19 Dec 06, 2000  Jkt 194001  PO 00000  Frm 00016  Fmt 4701  Sfmt 4700  E:\FR\FM\07DER4.SGM  pfrm01  PsN: 07DER4   Federal Register / Vol. 65, No. 236 / Thursday, December 7, 2000 / Rules and Regulations X. Regulatory Process Matters A. Executive Order 12688 The FTA has evaluated the industry costs and benefits of the major capital investments rule and has determined that it is a significant rule under E.O. 12688 because of the significant policy issues involved in federally funding major capital investments. This rule will not, however, have an impact on the economy of $100 million or more. FTA estimates the costs associated with this Rule to be minimal. This Rule implements specific changes required under TEA21 in the administration of the new starts program under 49 U.S.C. 5309. The following tables show the costs associated with this Rule. The first table indicates the costs associated with the collection, reporting and analysis of data for the project evaluation and  76879  rating process. These costs are associated with activities that are already required as part of the new starts project development process; they do not represent new costs associated with this Rule.

Departmental Significance This rule is a ``significant regulation'' as defined by the Department's Regulatory Policies and Procedures. Because the purpose of this rule is to establish how the Secretary will rate  various major capital investment projects, it concerns an important departmental policy and will likely generate a great deal of public interest.  C. Regulatory Flexibility Act In accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C.  601 et seq., the FTA has evaluated the effects of this rule on small entities. Based on this evaluation, the FTA hereby certifies that  VerDate 11 2000  19:25 Dec 06, 2000  Jkt 194001  PO 00000  Frm 00017  Fmt 4701  Sfmt 4700  E:\FR\FM\07DER4.SGM  pfrm08  PsN: 07DER4   76880  Federal Register / Vol. 65, No. 236 / Thursday, December 7, 2000 / Rules and Regulations List of Subjects in 49 CFR Part 611 Government contracts; Grant programs--Transportation; Mass transportation A new part 611 is added to read as follows: PART 611--MAJOR CAPITAL INVESTMENT PROJECTS Sec. 611.1 Purpose and contents. 611.3 Applicability. 611.5 Definitions. 611.7 Relation to planning and project development processes. 611.9 Project justification criteria for grants and loans for fixed guideway systems. 611.11 Local financial commitment criteria. 611.13 Overall project ratings.

Authority: 49 U.S.C. 5309; 49 CFR 1.51  611.1 Purpose and contents.  this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities because this rule concerns only major capital investments in new fixed-guideway transit systems and extensions, which are not typically undertaken by small entities. D. Paperwork Reduction Act FTA will publish an estimate of the paperwork burden required by this Rule in the Federal Register, providing a sixty-day period for interested parties to submit comments on FTA's proposed information collection methods. Upon completion of the sixty-day period, FTA will submit its summary of the comments received and any resulting change in the information collection methods to OMB. Upon submission to OMB, FTA will provide an additional thirty days to provide comments on FTA's finalized methods to OMB. Once OMB has reviewed this data for compliance with the Paperwork Reduction Act, OMB will provide FTA with a control number authorizing FTA to collect the requested information. Affected parties will not have to comply with the information collection requirements of this Rule until FTA publishes the OMB control number in the Federal Register. E. Executive Order 13132 This action has been analyzed in accordance with the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 13132 and it has been determined that the proposed rule will not have federalism implications that impose substantial direct compliance costs on state and local governments. F. National Environmental Policy Act The agency has determined that this proposed rule, if adopted, will have positive effects on the environment by encouraging the use of mass transit, which may reduce the use of single occupancy vehicles. G. Energy Act Implications This regulation should have a positive effect on energy consumption because, through the Federal investment mass transit projects, it would increase the use of mass transit. H. Unfunded Mandates Reform Act This rule will not result in the expenditure by State, local, and tribal governments, in the aggregate, of $100,000,000 or more in any one year.  (a) This part prescribes the process that applicants must follow to be considered eligible for capital investment grants and loans for new fixed guideway systems or extensions to existing systems (``new starts''). Also, this part prescribes the procedures used by FTA to evaluate proposed new starts projects as required by 49 U.S.C. 5309(e), and the scheduling of project reviews required by 49 U.S.C. 5328(a). (b) This part defines how the results of the evaluation described in paragraph (a) of this section will be used to: (1) Approve entry into preliminary engineering and final design, as required by 49 U.S.C. 309(e)(6); (2) Rate projects as ``highly recommended,'' ``recommended,'' or ``not recommended,'' as required by 49 U.S.C. 5309(e)(6); (3) Assign individual ratings for each of the project justification criteria specified in 49 U.S.C. 5309(e)(1)(B) and (C); (4) Determine project eligibility for Federal funding commitments, in the form of Full Funding Grant Agreements; (5) Support funding recommendations for this program for the Administration's annual budget request; and (6) Fulfill the reporting requirements under 49 U.S.C. 5309(o)(1), Funding Levels and Allocations of Funds, Annual Report, and 5309(o)(2), Supplemental Report on New Starts. (c) The information collected and ratings developed under this part will form the basis for the annual reports to Congress, required by 49 U.S.C. 5309(o)(1) and (2).  611.3 Applicability.  under 49 U.S.C. 5309 for new transit fixed guideway systems and extensions to existing systems. (b) Projects described in paragraph (a) of this section are not subject to evaluation under this part if the total amount of funding from 49 U.S.C. 5309 will be less than $25 million, or if such projects are otherwise exempt from evaluation by statute. (1) Exempt projects must still be rated by FTA for purposes of entering into a Federal funding commitment as required by 49 U.S.C. 5309(e)(7). Sponsors who believe their projects to be exempt are nonetheless strongly encouraged to submit data for project evaluation as described in this part. (2) Such projects are still subject to the requirements of 23 CFR part 450 and 23 CFR part 771. (3) This part does not apply to projects for which a Full Funding Grant Agreement (FFGA) has already been executed. (c) Consistent with 49 U.S.C. 5309(e)(8)(B), FTA will make project approval decisions on proposed projects using expedited procedures as appropriate, for proposed projects that are: (1) Located in a nonattainment area; (2) Transportation control measures as defined by the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7401 et seq.); and (3) Required to carry out a State Implementation Plan.  611.5 Definitions.  (a) This part applies to all proposals for Federal capital investment funds  The definitions established by Titles 12 and 49 of the United States Code, the Council on Environmental Quality's regulation at 40 CFR parts 15001508, and FHWAFTA regulations at 23 CFR parts 450 and 771 are applicable. In addition, the following definitions apply: Alternatives analysis is a corridor level analysis which evaluates all reasonable mode and alignment alternatives for addressing a transportation problem, and results in the adoption of a locally preferred alternative by the appropriate State and local agencies and official boards through a public process. Baseline alternative is the alternative against which the proposed new starts project is compared to develop project justification measures. Relative to the no build alternative, it should include transit improvements lower in cost than the new start which result in a better ratio of measures of transit mobility compared to cost than the no build alternative. BRT means bus rapid transit. Bus Rapid Transit refers to coordinated improvements in a transit  VerDate 11 2000  19:25 Dec 06, 2000  Jkt 194001  PO 00000  Frm 00018  Fmt 4701  Sfmt 4700  E:\FR\FM\07DER4.SGM  pfrm08  PsN: 07DER4   Federal Register / Vol. 65, No. 236 / Thursday, December 7, 2000 / Rules and Regulations system's infrastructure, equipment, operations, and technology that give preferential treatment to buses on fixed guideways and urban roadways. The intention of Bus Rapid Transit is to reduce bus travel time, improve service reliability, increase the convenience of users, and ultimately, increase bus ridership. Extension to existing fixed-guideway system means a project to extend an existing fixed guideway system. FFGA means a Full Funding Grant Agreement. Final Design is the final phase of project development, and includes (but is not limited to) the preparation of final construction plans (including construction management plans), detailed specifications, construction cost estimates, and bid documents. Fixed guideway system means a mass transportation facility which utilizes and occupies a separate right-of-way, or rail line, for the exclusive use of mass transportation and other high occupancy vehicles, or uses a fixed catenary system and a right of way usable by other forms of transportation. This includes, but is not limited to, rapid rail, light rail, commuter rail, automated guideway transit, people movers, ferry boat service, and fixedguideway facilities for buses (such as bus rapid transit) and other high occupancy vehicles. A new fixed guideway system means a newlyconstructed fixed guideway system in a corridor or alignment where no such system exists. FTA means the Federal Transit Administration. Full Funding Grant Agreement means an instrument that defines the scope of a project, the Federal financial contribution, and other terms and conditions. Major transit investment means any project that involves the construction of a new fixed guideway system or extension of an existing fixed guideway system for use by mass transit vehicles. NEPA process means those procedures necessary to meet the requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, as amended (NEPA), at 23 CFR part 771; the NEPA process is completed when a Record of Decision (ROD) or Finding of No Significant Impact (FONSI) is issued. New start means a new fixed guideway system, or an extension to an existing fixed guideway system. Preliminary Engineering is the process by which the scope of the proposed project is finalized, estimates of project costs, benefits and impacts are refined, NEPA requirements are completed, project management plans and fleet management plans are further developed, and local funding commitments are put in place. Secretary means the Secretary of Transportation. TEA21 means the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century.  611.7 Relation to Planning and Project Development Processes  76881  All new start projects proposed for funding assistance under 49 USC 5309 must emerge from the metropolitan and Statewide planning process, consistent with 23 CFR part 450. To be eligible for FTA capital investment funding, a proposed project must be based on the results of alternatives analysis and preliminary engineering. (a) Alternatives Analysis. (1) To be eligible for FTA capital investment funding for a major fixed guideway transit project, local project sponsors must perform an alternatives analysis. (2) The alternatives analysis develops information on the benefits, costs, and impacts of alternative strategies to address a transportation problem in a given corridor, leading to the adoption of a locally preferred alternative. (3) The alternative strategies evaluated in an alternatives analysis must include a no-build alternative, a baseline alternative, and an appropriate number of build alternatives. Where project sponsors believe the no-build alternative fulfills the requirements for a baseline alternative, FTA will determine whether to require a separate baseline alternative on a case-by-case basis. (4) The locally preferred alternative must be selected from among the evaluated alternative strategies and formally adopted and included in the metropolitan planning organization's financially-constrained long-range regional transportation plan. (b) Preliminary Engineering. Consistent with 49 USC 5309(e)(6) and 5328(a)(2), FTA will approve/ disapprove entry of a proposed project into preliminary engineering within 30 days of receipt of a formal request from the project sponsor(s). (1) A proposed project can be considered for advancement into preliminary engineering only if: (i) Alternatives analysis has been completed (ii) The proposed project is adopted as the locally preferred alternative by the Metropolitan Planning Organization into its financially constrained metropolitan transportation plan; (iii) Project sponsors have demonstrated adequate technical capability to carry out preliminary engineering for the proposed project; and  (iv) All other applicable Federal and FTA program requirements have been met. (2) FTA's approval will be based on the results of its evaluation as described in  611.9611.13. (3) At a minimum, a proposed project must receive an overall rating of ``recommended'' to be approved for entry into preliminary engineering. (4) This part does not in any way revoke prior FTA approvals to enter preliminary engineering made prior to February 5, 2001. (5) Projects approved to advance into preliminary engineering receive blanket pre-award authority to incur project costs for preliminary engineering activities prior to grant approval. (i) This pre-award authority does not constitute a commitment by FTA that future Federal funds will be approved for this project. (ii) All Federal requirements must be met prior to incurring costs in order to retain eligibility of the costs for future FTA grant assistance. (c) Final Design. Consistent with 49 USC 5309(e)(6) and 5328(a)(3), FTA will approve/disapprove entry of a proposed project into final design within 120 days of receipt of a formal request from the project sponsor(s). (1) A proposed project can be considered for advancement into final design only if: (i) The NEPA process has been completed; (ii) Project sponsors have demonstrated adequate technical capability to carry out final design for the proposed project; and (iii) All other applicable Federal and FTA program requirements have been met. (2) FTA's approval will be based on the results of its evaluation as described in Parts  611.9611.13 of this Rule. (3) At a minimum, a proposed project must receive an overall rating of ``recommended'' to be approved for entry into final design. (4) Consistent with the Government Performance and Results Act of 1993, project sponsors seeking FFGAs shall submit a complete plan for collection and analysis of information to identify the impacts of the new start project and the accuracy of the forecasts prepared during development of the project. (i) The plan shall provide for: Collection of ``before'' data on the current transit system; documentation of the ``predicted'' scope, service levels, capital costs, operating costs, and ridership of the project; collection of ``after'' data on the transit system two years after opening of the new start project; and analysis of the consistency  VerDate 11 2000  15:19 Dec 06, 2000  Jkt 194001  PO 00000  Frm 00019  Fmt 4701  Sfmt 4700  E:\FR\FM\07DER4.SGM  pfrm01  PsN: 07DER4   76882  Federal Register / Vol. 65, No. 236 / Thursday, December 7, 2000 / Rules and Regulations (i) Are rated as ``recommended'' or ``highly recommended;'' (ii) Have completed the appropriate steps in the project development process; (iii) Meet all applicable Federal and FTA program requirements; and (iv) Are ready to utilize Federal new starts funds, consistent with available program authorization. (4) In any instance in which FTA decides to provide financial assistance under section 5309 for construction of a new start project, FTA will negotiate an FFGA with the grantee during final design of that project. Pursuant to the terms and conditions of the FFGA: (i) A maximum level of Federal financial contribution under the section 5309 new starts program will be fixed; (ii) The grantee will be required to complete construction of the project, as defined, to the point of initiation of revenue operations, and to absorb any additional costs incurred or necessitated; (iii) FTA and the grantee will establish a schedule for anticipating Federal contributions during the final design and construction period; and (iv) Specific annual contributions under the FFGA will be subject to the availability of budget authority and the ability of the grantee to use the funds effectively. (5) The total amount of Federal obligations under Full Funding Grant Agreements and potential obligations under Letters of Intent will not exceed the amount authorized for new starts under 49 U.S.C.  5309. (6) FTA may also make a ``contingent commitment,'' which is subject to future congressional authorizations and appropriations, pursuant to 49 U.S.C. 5309(g), 5338(b), and 5338(h). (7) Consistent with the Government Performance and Results Act of 1993 (GPRA), the FFGA will require implementation of the data collection plan prepared in accordance with  611.7(c)(4): (i) Prior to the beginning of construction activities the grantee shall collect the ``before'' data on the existing system, if such data has not already been collected as part of final design, and document the predicted characteristics and performance of the project. (ii) Two years after the project opens for revenue service, the grantee shall collect the ``after'' data on the transit system and the new start project, determine the impacts of the project, analyze the consistency of the ``predicted'' performance of the project with the ``after'' data, and report the findings and supporting data to FTA. (iii) For funding purposes, collection of the ``before'' data, collection of the ``after'' data, and the development and reporting of findings are eligible parts of the proposed project. (8) This part does not in any way alter, revoke, or require re-evaluation of existing FFGAs that were issued prior to February 5, 2001.  611.9 Project justification criteria for grants and loans for fixed guideway systems  of ``predicted'' project characteristics with the ``after'' data. (ii) The ``before'' data collection shall obtain information on transit service levels and ridership patterns, including origins and destinations, access modes, trip purposes, and rider characteristics. The ``after'' data collection shall obtain analogous information on transit service levels and ridership patterns, plus information on the as-built scope and capital costs of the new start project. (iii) The analysis of this information shall describe the impacts of the new start project on transit services and transit ridership, evaluate the consistency of ``predicted'' and actual project characteristics and performance, and identify sources of differences between ``predicted'' and actual outcomes. (iv) For funding purposes, preparation of the plan for collection and analysis of data is an eligible part of the proposed project. (5) Project sponsors shall collect data on the current system, according to the plan required under  611.7(c)(4) as approved by FTA, prior to the beginning of construction of the proposed new start. Collection of this data is an eligible part of the proposed project for funding purposes. (6) This part does not in any way revoke prior FTA approvals to enter final design that were made prior to February 5, 2001. (7) Projects approved to advance into final design receive blanket pre-award authority to incur project costs for final design activities prior to grant approval. (i) This pre-award authority does not extend to right of way acquisition or construction, nor does it constitute a commitment by FTA that future Federal funds will be approved for this project. (ii) All Federal requirements must be met prior to incurring costs in order to retain eligibility of the costs for future FTA grant assistance. (d) Full funding grant agreements. (1) FTA will determine whether to execute an FFGA based on: (i) The evaluations and ratings established by this rule; (ii) The technical capability of project sponsors to complete the proposed new starts project; and (iii) A determination by FTA that no outstanding issues exist that could interfere with successful implementation of the proposed new starts project. (2) An FFGA shall not be executed for a project that is not authorized for final design and construction by Federal law. (3) FFGAs will be executed only for those projects which:  In order to approve a grant or loan for a proposed new starts project under 49 U.S.C. 5309, and to approve entry into preliminary engineering and final design as required by section 5309(e)(6), FTA must find that the proposed project is justified as described in section 5309(e)(1)(B). (a) To make the statutory evaluations and assign ratings for project justification, FTA will evaluate information developed locally through alternatives analyses and refined through preliminary engineering and final design. (1) The method used to make this determination will be a multiple measure approach in which the merits of candidate projects will be evaluated in terms of each of the criteria specified by this section. (2) The measures for these criteria are specified in Appendix A to this rule. (3) The measures will be applied to the project as it has been proposed to FTA for new starts funding under 49 U.S.C. 5309. (4) The ratings for each of the criteria will be expressed in terms of descriptive indicators, as follows: ``high,'' ``medium-high,'' ``medium,'' ``lowmedium,'' or ``low.'' (b) The criteria are as follows: (1) Mobility Improvements. (2) Environmental Benefits. (3) Operating Efficiencies. (4) Transportation System User Benefits (Cost-Effectiveness). (5) Existing land use, transit supportive land use policies, and future patterns. (6) Other factors. Additional factors, including but not limited to: (i) The degree to which the programs and policies (e.g., parking policies, etc.) are in place as assumed in the forecasts, (ii) Project management capability, including the technical capability of the grant recipient to construct the project, and (iii) Additional factors relevant to local and national priorities and relevant to the success of the project. (c) In evaluating proposed new starts projects under these criteria: (1) As a candidate project proceeds through preliminary engineering and  VerDate 11 2000  19:25 Dec 06, 2000  Jkt 194001  PO 00000  Frm 00020  Fmt 4701  Sfmt 4700  E:\FR\FM\07DER4.SGM  pfrm08  PsN: 07DER4   Federal Register / Vol. 65, No. 236 / Thursday, December 7, 2000 / Rules and Regulations final design, a greater degree of certainty is expected with respect to the scope of the project and a greater level of commitment is expected with respect to land use. (2) For the criteria under  611.9(b)(1)(4), the proposed new start will be compared to the baseline alternative. (d) In evaluating proposed new starts projects under these criteria, the following factors shall be considered: (1) The direct and indirect costs of relevant alternatives; (2) Factors such as congestion relief, improved mobility, air pollution, noise pollution, energy consumption, and all associated ancillary and mitigation costs necessary to carry out each alternative analyzed, and recognize reductions in local infrastructure costs achieved through compact land use development; (3) Existing land use, mass transportation supportive land use policies, and future patterns; (4) The degree to which the project increases the mobility of the mass transportation dependent population or promotes economic development; (5) Population density and current transit ridership in the corridor; (6) The technical capability of the grant recipient to construct the project; (7) Differences in local land, construction, and operating costs; and (8) Other factors as appropriate. (e) FTA may amend the measures for these criteria, pending the results of ongoing studies regarding transit benefit evaluation methods. (f) The individual ratings for each of the criteria described in this section will be combined into a summary rating of ``high,'' ``medium-high,'' ``medium,'' ``low-medium,'' or ``low'' for project justification. ``Other factors'' will be considered as appropriate.  611.11 criteria. Local financial commitment  76883  (b) The stability and reliability of the proposed capital financing plan for the new starts project; and (c) The stability and reliability of the proposed operating financing plan to fund operation of the entire transit system as planned over a 20-year planning horizon. (d) For each proposed project, ratings for paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section will be reported in terms of descriptive indicators, as follows: ``high,'' ``medium-high,'' ``medium,'' ``lowmedium,'' or ``low.'' For paragraph (a) of this section, the percentage of Federal funding sought from 49 U.S.C.  5309 will be reported. (e) The summary ratings for each measure described in this section will be combined into a summary rating of ``high,'' ``medium-high,'' ``medium,'' ``low-medium,'' or ``low'' for local financial commitment.  611.13 Overall project ratings.  summary rating higher than ``medium'' for both local financial commitment and project justification. (3) Projects will be rated as ``not recommended'' if they do not receive a summary rating of at least ``medium'' for both project justification and local financial commitment. Appendix A to Part 611--Description of Measures Used for Project Evaluation. Project Justification FTA will use several measures to evaluate candidate new starts projects according to the criteria established by 49 U.S.C. 5309(e)(1)(B). These measures have been developed according to the considerations identified at 49 U.S.C. 5309(e)(3) (``Project Justification''), consistent with Executive Order 12893. From time to time, FTA has published technical guidance on the application of these measures, and the agency expects it will continue to do so. Moreover, FTA may well choose to amend these measures, pending the results of ongoing studies regarding transit benefit evaluation methods. The first four criteria listed below assess the benefits of a proposed new start project by comparing the project to the baseline alternative. Therefore, the baseline alternative must be defined so that comparisons with the new start project isolate the costs and benefits of the major transit investment. At a minimum, the baseline alternative must include in the project corridor all reasonable cost-effective transit improvements short of investment in the new start project. Depending on the circumstances and through prior agreement with FTA, the baseline alternative can be defined appropriately in one of three ways. First, where the adopted financially constrained regional transportation plan includes within the corridor all reasonable cost-effective transit improvements short of the new start project, a no-build alternative that includes those improvements may serve as the baseline. Second, where additional cost-effective transit improvements can be made beyond those provided by the adopted plan, the baseline will add those costeffective transit improvements. Third, where the proposed new start project is part of a multimodal alternative that includes major highway components, the baseline alternative will be the preferred multimodal alternative without the new start project and associated transit services. Prior to submittal of a request to enter preliminary engineering for the new start project, grantees must obtain FTA approval of the definition of the baseline alternative. Consistent with the requirement that differences between the new start project and the baseline alternative measure only the benefits and costs of the project itself, planning factors external to the new start project and its supporting bus service must be the same for both the baseline and new start project alternatives. Consequently, the highway and transit networks defined for the analysis must be the same outside the corridor for which the new start project is proposed. Further, policies affecting travel demand and travel costs, such as land use, transit fares and parking costs,  In order to approve a grant or loan under 49 U.S.C. 5309, FTA must find that the proposed project is supported by an acceptable degree of local financial commitment, as required by section 5309(e)(1)(C). The local financial commitment to a proposed project will be evaluated according to the following measures: (a) The proposed share of project capital costs to be met using funds from sources other than the section 5309 new starts program, including both the nonFederal match required by Federal law and any additional capital funding (``overmatch''), and the degree to which planning and preliminary engineering activities have been carried out without funding from the section 5309 new starts program;  (a) The summary ratings developed for project justification local financial commitment (  611.9 and 611.11) will form the basis for the overall rating for each project. (b) FTA will assign overall ratings of ``highly recommended,'' ``recommended,'' and ``not recommended,'' as required by 49 U.S.C. 5309(e)(6), to each proposed project. (1) These ratings will indicate the overall merit of a proposed new starts project at the time of evaluation. (2) Ratings for individual projects will be updated annually for purposes of the annual report on funding levels and allocations of funds required by section 5309(o)(1), and as required for FTA approvals to enter into preliminary engineering, final design, or FFGAs. (c) These ratings will be used to: (1) approve advancement of a proposed project into preliminary engineering and final design; (2) Approve projects for FFGAs; (3) Support annual funding recommendations to Congress in the annual report on funding levels and allocations of funds required by 49 U.S.C. 5309(o)(1); and (4) For purposes of the supplemental report on new starts, as required under section 5309(o)(2). (d) FTA will assign overall ratings for proposed new starts projects based on the following conditions: (1) Projects will be rated as ``recommended'' if they receive a summary rating of at least ``medium'' for both project justification ( 611.9) and local financial commitment ( 611.11); (2) Projects will be rated as ``highly recommended'' if they receive a  VerDate 11 2000  19:25 Dec 06, 2000  Jkt 194001  PO 00000  Frm 00021  Fmt 4701  Sfmt 4700  E:\FR\FM\07DER4.SGM  pfrm08  PsN: 07DER4   76884  Federal Register / Vol. 65, No. 236 / Thursday, December 7, 2000 / Rules and Regulations benefits will be calculated as the differences between the proposed new start and the baseline alternative. (2) Until the effective date of the transportation system user benefits measure of cost effectiveness, cost effectiveness will be computed as the incremental costs of the proposed project divided by its incremental transit ridership, as compared to the baseline alternative. (i) Costs include the forecast annualized capital and annual operating costs of the entire transit system. (ii) Ridership includes forecast total annual ridership on the entire transit system, excluding transfers. (e) Existing land use, transit supportive land use policies, and future patterns. Existing land use, transit-supportive land use policies, and future patterns shall be rated by evaluating existing conditions in the corridor and the degree to which local land use policies are likely to foster transit supportive land use, measured in terms of the kinds of policies in place, and the commitment to these policies. The following factors will form the basis for this evaluation: (1) Existing land use; (2) Impact of proposed new starts project on land use; (3) Growth-management policies; (4) Transit-supportive corridor policies; (5) Supportive zoning regulations near transit stations; (6) Tools to implement land use policies; (7) The performance of land use policies; and (8) Existing and planned pedestrian facilities, including access for persons with disabilities. (f) Other factors. Other factors that will be considered when evaluating projects for funding commitments include, but are not limited to: (1) Multimodal emphasis of the locally preferred investment strategy, including the proposed new start as one element; (2) Environmental justice considerations and equity issues, (3) Opportunities for increased access to employment for low income persons, and Welfare-to-Work initiatives; (4) Livable Communities initiatives and local economic activities; (5) Consideration of alternative land use development scenarios in local evaluation and decision making for the locally preferred transit investment decision; (6) Consideration of innovative financing, procurement, and construction techniques, including design-build turnkey applications; and (7) Additional factors relevant to local and national priorities and to the success of the project, such as Empowerment Zones, Brownfields, and FTA's Bus Rapid Transit Demonstration Program. Local Financial Commitment FTA will use the following measures to evaluate the local financial commitment to a proposed project: (a) The proposed share of project capital costs to be met using funds from sources other than the 49 U.S.C. 5309 new starts program, including both the local match required by Federal law and any additional capital funding (``overmatch''). Consideration will be given to: (i) The use of innovative financing techniques, as described in the May 9, 1995, Federal Register notice on FTA's Innovative Financing Initiative (60 FR 24682); (ii) The use of ``flexible funds'' as provided under the CMAQ and STP programs; (iii) The degree to which alternatives analysis and preliminary engineering activities were carried out without funding from the  5309 new starts program; and (iv) The actual percentage of the cost of recently-completed or simultaneously undertaken fixed guideway systems and extensions that are related to the proposed project under review, from sources other than the section 5309 new starts program (FTA's intent is to recognize that a region's local financial commitment to fixed guideway systems and extensions may not be limited to a single project). (b) The stability and reliability of the proposed capital financing plan, according to: (i) The stability, reliability, and level of commitment of each proposed source of local match, including inter-governmental grants, tax sources, and debt obligations, with an emphasis on availability within the project development timetable; (ii) Whether adequate provisions have been made to cover unanticipated cost overruns and funding shortfalls; and (iii) Whether adequate provisions have been made to fund the capital needs of the entire transit system as planned, including key station plans as required under 49 CFR 37.47 and 37.51, over a 20-year planning horizon period. (c) The stability and reliability of the proposed operating financing plan to fund operation of the entire transit system as planned over a 20-year planning horizon. Issued: November 29, 2000.

The fifth criterion, ``existing land use, transit supportive land use policies, and future patterns,'' reflects the importance of transit-supportive local land use and related conditions and policies as an indicator of ultimate project success. (a) Mobility Improvements. (1) The aggregate travel time savings in the forecast year anticipated from the new start project compared to the baseline alternative. This measure sums the travel time savings accruing to travelers projected to use transit in the baseline alternative, travelers projected to shift to transit because of the new start project, and non-transit users in the new start project who would benefit from reduced traffic congestion. (i) After September 1, 2001, FTA will employ a revised measure of travel benefits accruing to travelers. (ii) The revised measure will be based on a multi-modal measure of perceived travel times faced by all users of the transportation system. (2) The absolute number of existing low income households located within 1/2-mile of boarding points associated with the proposed system increment. (3) The absolute number of existing jobs within 1/2-mile of boarding points associated with the proposed system increment. (b) Environmental Benefits. (1) The forecast change in criteria pollutant emissions and in greenhouse gas emissions, ascribable to the proposed new investment, calculated in terms of annual tons for each criteria pollutant or gas (forecast year), compared to the baseline alternative; (2) The forecast net change per year (forecast year) in the regional consumption of energy, ascribable to the proposed new investment, expressed in British Thermal Units (BTU), compared to the baseline alternative; and (3) Current Environmental Protection Agency designations for the region's compliance with National Ambient Air Quality Standards. (c) Operating Efficiencies. The forecast change in operating cost per passenger-mile (forecast year), for the entire transit system. The new start will be compared to the baseline alternative. (d) Transportation System User Benefits (Cost-Effectiveness). (1) The cost effectiveness of a proposed project shall be evaluated according to a measure of transportation system user benefits, based on a multimodal measure of perceived travel times faced by all users of the transportation system, for the forecast year, divided by the incremental cost of the proposed project.

The  Reactor          Licensing Process  Fact Sheet gives an overview of the licensing process.          See also our  Operating Reactors          Licensing  page.         For more information about New Reactor Licensing, see the following:                   Staff Readiness           Preparation                            Early Site Permits               Combined Licenses                                       Staff Readiness         In late 2000, the NRC became aware that some electric companies were          exploring the option of building new nuclear plants in the United States.          Therefore, the Commission directed the staff to (1) assess its readiness          to review license applications and inspect new nuclear power plants and          (2) to examine the regulatory infrastructure for 10 CFR  Part          50  and  Part          52  and other applicable regulations. The staff's response in SECY-01-0188,          ""Future Licensing and Inspection Readiness Assessment"" ( FLIRA            ),          issued October 12, 2001, addresses the following matters:                   Licensing scenarios for future application reviews, the durations            of the reviews, and the resource estimates (in staff, dollars, and technical            assistance) to complete the reviews;                                 Critical skills needed within the agency or through contracts; and                                             Regulatory infrastructure needs to support future licensing reviews            (see  Regulations,            Guidance, and Communications ).                                 The first semiannual update of the FLIRA was issued as  SECY-02-0076             on May 8, 2002.                         Preparation         To prepare for future applications, the staff is assessing activities          needed to prepare for early site permit (ESP) and combined license (COL)          applications.                 Early Site Permits         The NRC can issue an ESP for approval of one or more sites for one or          more nuclear power facilities separate from the filing of an application          for a construction permit or combined license in accordance with  10          CFR Part 52 . An ESP is a partial construction permit and is, therefore,          subject to all procedural requirements in  10          CFR Part 2  that are applicable to construction permits. Applications          for ESPs will be reviewed according to the applicable standards set out          in 10 CFR Parts 50 and 100 as they apply to applications for construction          permits for nuclear power plants. Early site permits are good for 10 to          20 years and can be renewed for an additional 10 to 20 years. ESPs address          site safety issues, environmental protection issues, and plans for coping          with emergencies, independent of the review of a specific nuclear plant          design.         A group of experienced staff is assessing the activities needed to prepare          for ESP applications. Three ESP applications are expected to be submitted          in 2003 from Dominion, Exelon Generation, and Entergy.                 Combined Licenses         A COL authorizes construction and conditional operation of a nuclear          power facility. The requirements and procedures applicable to Commission          issuance of a COL for a nuclear power facility are contained in Subpart          C of  10 CFR          Part 52 . An application for a COL may, but need not, reference a standard          design certification issued under Subpart B of 10 CFR Part 52 or an ESP          issued under Subpart A of 10 CFR Part 52, or both.                           to obtain a COL, the application must include the technically relevant            information required by  10            CFR 50.34  for an operating license;                                 must include the proposed inspections, tests and analyses which the            licensee shall perform and the associated acceptance criteria (ITAAC)            which are necessary and sufficient to provide reasonable assurance that,            if the inspections, tests and analyses are performed and the acceptance            criteria met, the facility has been constructed and will operate in            conformity with—                         (1) the COL,             (2) the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, and             (3) the Commission's regulations (see  10              CFR 52.79(c)) ; and                                 the NRC must also find that the ITAAC have been met before granting            authorization to operate (see  10            CFR 52.103(g) ).                  Important documents related to preparing an application for a COL include—                   SECY-02-0067 ,            ""Inspections, Test, Analyses, and Acceptance Criteria for Operational            Programs (Programmatic ITAAC)"" issued April 15, 2002.                                   SECY-02-0067             - The Staff Requirements Memorandum (SRM), “Inspections, Tests,            Analyses, and Acceptance Criteria (ITAAC) for Operational Programs (Programmatic            ITAAC),” issued September 11, 2002.                  NRC Staff’s Response to SRM SECY-02-0067 and Public Involvement.                    To address the Commissions' September 11, 2002, SRM the staff has developed          a draft proposal that it intends to discuss with its stakeholders. The          staff proposes to use the fire protection review for the AP600 standard          nuclear reactor design and the Callaway Plant as a starting point to develop          guidelines for the level of programmatic information that would be needed          in order to issue a combined license without ITAAC for that program. The          staff chose the AP600 because it represents the most current review for          a standard design that has been certified in accordance with 10 CFR Part          52. The staff chose the Callaway Plant because it represents a plant that          was relatively recently licensed in accordance with 10 CFR Part 50 and          its final safety analysis report (FSAR) contains information for the fire          protection program that is not contained in the AP600 analogous document          (i.e., AP600 design control document). The AP600 design control document          does not contain this information because it identifies many fire protection          program issues as the responsibility of the combined license (COL) applicant.          For detailed proposal and supporting documentation, see  Supporting          Documentation for Combined Licenses .                                                  Privacy Policy  |    Site Disclaimer    Last revised Thursday, October 23, 2003"
GX063-16-14830106	"February 13, 2003       Commodity                      Financing and Purchasing                       Transportation                        PUBLIC LAW 480 SALES       PROGRAM:        A BRIEF EXPLANATION OF TITLE I             Reporting               Overview    Title I of the Agricultural Trade Development and Assistance Act of 1954, as amended, (Public Law 480, 83rd Congress) provides for U.S. government financing of sales of U.S. agricultural commodities to developing countries and private entities (hereafter called ""participants"") on concessional credit terms. Sales are made by private business firms on a bid basis in response to Invitations for Bids or ""IFB's"" issued in the United States by the participant. Sales are made at competitive U.S. market prices. The agreement's concessionality results from its extended credit periods and low rates of interest charged for the financing.    A developing country shall be considered eligible for P.L. 480 Title I financing if it has a shortage of foreign exchange earnings and has difficulty meeting all of its food needs through commercial channels.    All agricultural commodities and products, other than alcoholic beverages, are eligible for consideration in programming unless the Secretary of Agriculture determines that the use of a commodity would reduce the domestic supply lower than that needed to meet domestic requirements and provide an adequate carryover. Commodities will not be made available unless there are adequate storage facilities in the recipient country and the distribution will not interfere with domestic production or marketing.    The Foreign Agricultural Service (FAS) of the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) is the agency responsible for administering agreements made under Title I.     In accordance with the Federal Agriculture Improvement and Reform Act of 1996, a Public Law 480, Title I agreement may now be signed with either a nongovernmental ""private entity"" or with a foreign government.    Negotiation of Agreements    Title I agreements are negotiated with foreign governments or private entities. In most cases, negotiations are conducted overseas by U.S. agricultural counselors or attaches. The Secretary of Agriculture determines the kinds and quantities of commodities to be included in agreements.     An agreement may require the government of the importing country to maintain normal imports of agricultural commodities from commercial sources in the United States and other free world countries. These ""usual marketing requirements"" (UMR's) are required, when applicable, in order to insure that Title I sales will not unduly disrupt world agricultural commodity prices and normal patterns of commercial trade. Agreements prohibit the resale or transshipment of Title I commodities (""export restrictions"") and may prohibit or limit the export of similar commodities (""export limitations"") in order to insure that Title I commodities are not used to increase the commercial exports of the importing country.    The U.S. government consults governments of other countries which export commodities included in the agreement to insure that Title I sales do not unduly disrupt normal world commercial trade.    Eligibility of Commodity Suppliers    U.S. commodity suppliers interested in selling commodities under P.L. 480, Title I, must submit the following information to USDA, which will determine their eligibility:          1. A current financial     statement (preferably audited) of the person or firm wishing     to become eligible, as evidence of financial responsibility.       2. A statement containing     general background information about the firm, with     particular reference to the firm's experience as an exporter     of U.S. agricultural commodities, and any other information     available relating to whether the person or firm is a     responsible party and able to perform its obligations under     the P.L. 480, Title I regulations and the purchase     authorization.      Financing and Purchasing Procedures (Commodity)    After an agreement has been signed, the participant applies to FAS for one or more purchase authorizations (PA's) to be issued by USDA. Each PA includes such details as the particular grade or type of commodity to be purchased, the approximate quantity of the commodity and the maximum dollar amount authorized, the period during which contracts may be entered into, the period during which deliveries must be made, the conditions under which financing will be made available for the commodity sales, and any authorized ocean transportation costs. Normally, the earliest date that contracts may be entered into is seven days after the date the PA is issued. Further purchasing information can usually be obtained from the Washington Embassy of the importing country or its shipping agent.    The purchase authorization provides for commodity financing by the Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC), a U.S. government agency within USDA.    The commodity supplier will present documents to CCC, which will pay the supplier directly after the documents are found to be complete and in good order. CCC will also pay the supplier of ocean transportation directly for the ocean freight differential on U.S.-flag vessels and for any other ocean freight costs which are financed by CCC. However, when CCC pays only the ocean freight differential on a U.S.-flag voyage, the buyer must open a letter of credit for the balance of the ocean freight.    The following is an outline of commodity financing and purchasing procedures:           1. The P.L. 480, Title I     regulations require that all purchases of commodities be made     on the basis of an invitation for bids (IFB) which has been     reviewed and approved by USDA before issuance. The IFB must     be publicly advertised in the United States, and offers must     conform to the terms of the IFB and must be received and     publicly opened in the United States. Suppliers may offer for     any portion of an IFB; also, an IFB may not establish minimum     acceptable quantities. All offers received, regardless of     size, must be considered, and all awards must be made in     conformance with the terms of the IFB.       2. As a prerequisite for CCC     financing, the successful supplier(s) must register the sale     with USDA and obtain approval of the contract terms,     including price. Sales are registered with the P.L. 480     Operations Division, telephone (202) 720-5780.       3. The U.S. supplier delivers     the commodities to the named U.S. port and receives a bill of     lading as a receipt for the commodities loaded on board. The     supplier presents the bill of lading, weight and inspection     certificates, and any other documents required by the     regulations and the IFB, to CCC.        4. CCC examines the documents     and pays the supplier in dollars.       5. The participant then repays     dollars or local currency to CCC, with interest, in     accordance with the repayment terms specified in the     agreement.      Small Business    This program is conducted on a non-discriminatory basis as are all USDA export programs.     In order to insure that small business firms have an equal opportunity to participate, the P.L. 480, Title I financing regulations prohibit buyers from establishing minimum quantities to be offered. All offers, regardless of size, must be considered (Section 17.5(c)(2)(v) of the Title I regulations).    In addition, the invitations for bids issued by importing countries cannot limit the right to submit offers to any specified group or class of suppliers; IFB's must permit submission of offers by any supplier who meets the requirements of the regulations (Section 17.5(c)(2)(iii) of the Title I regulations).    Ocean Transportation    In accordance with the cargo preference provisions of the Merchant Marine Act, 1936, as amended, at least 75 percent of the gross tonnage of commodities exported under Title I, P.L. 480, must be shipped on privately owned U.S. flag commercial vessels to the extent such vessels are available at fair and reasonable rates.    The participants or their appointed agents arrange for the ocean transportation of commodities purchased under Title I. The Director, P.L. 480 Operations Division, will determine the quantity of the commodity to be shipped on U.S.-flag commercial vessels. Open public freight invitations for bids (IFB's) are required for both U.S. and non-U.S. flag vessels when CCC is financing any portion of the ocean freight. Unless otherwise authorized by the USDA, IFB's are also required for non-U.S. flag vessels even though CCC is not financing any portion of the ocean freight.    The pertinent terms of all proposed charters or liner bookings, regardless of whether any portion of ocean freight is financed by CCC, must be sent to USDA for review and approval prior to fixture of the vessels. Approvals are obtained from the Director, P.L. 480 Operations Division, FAS, U.S. Department of Agriculture, Washington, DC 20250-1033.    Under a Title I agreement, CCC responsibility for ocean freight is generally limited to payment of the ocean freight differential, if any, which exists between the cost of U.S. flag and non-U.S. flag shipments. In certain exceptional cases, CCC may also finance on credit terms the balance of freight costs on U.S. flag vessels, as well as foreign flag freight charges to selected countries, when specifically provided for in the applicable agreement and related purchase authorization. Ocean freight differential is determined by the Director, P.L. 480 Operations Division, FAS.     Compliance     Each commodity sales agreement contains specific provisions described under ""Negotiations of Agreements,"" above, as  usual marketing requirements  (UMR's);  export restrictions  on P.L. 480 commodities; and  export limitations  on commodities the same as, or similar to, those imported under P.L. 480.     USDA has established procedures designed to monitor the importing country's compliance with these requirements. If the country fails to comply, agreement signings and purchase authorizations could be withheld; the failure to comply would also be taken into account in considering any future P.L. 480 agreements. The compliance function also addresses arrivals and reconciliation of P.L. 480 shipments, P.L. 480 commodity use, publicity requirements for P.L. 480 sales agreements, deposit and payment requirements for P.L. 480 sales agreements, and development plans associated with agreements.    The Act requires compliance reporting by importing countries. U.S. embassies and agricultural attaches will help the importing countries meet the statutory requirements of the Act. To inquire about compliance reporting, contact the Program Evaluation Branch, CCC Program Support Division, Foreign Agricultural Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture, 1400 Independence Avenue, S.W., Washington, DC 20250-1031.    Reporting Requirements     Commodity suppliers in the P.L. 480, Title I program may have a reporting responsibility under Section 602 of the Agricultural Trade Act of 1978. This is a mandatory program involving the reporting of export sales and exports of the major grains, oilseeds and products, cotton, rice, and cattle hides and skins.     To obtain information on reporting requirements or to inquire about your reporting status, contact the Export Sales Reporting Branch, Foreign Agricultural Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture, Washington, DC 20250-1025. Telephone: (202) 720-3273.    Further Information and Press Releases    All FAS news releases issued each day are available through FAX polling.

At single unit sites, any emergency ac power source(s) in excess of the number required to meet minimum redundancy requirements (i.e., single failure) for safe shutdown (non-DBA) is assumed to be available and may be designated as an alternate power source(s) provided the applicable requirements are met. At multi-unit sites, where the combination of emergency ac power sources exceeds the minimum redundancy requirements for safe shutdown (non-DBA) of all units, the remaining emergency ac power sources may be used as alternate ac power sources provided they meet the applicable requirements. If these criteria are not met, station blackout must be assumed on all the units.    Substantial safety hazard  means, for the purposes of § 50.55(e) of this chapter, a loss of safety function to the extent that there is a major reduction in the degree of protection provided to public health and safety for any facility or activity authorized by the construction permit issued under this part.    Testing facility  means a nuclear reactor which is of a type described in § 50.21(c) of this part and for which an application has been filed for a license authorizing operation at:    (1) A thermal power level in excess of 10 megawatts; or    (2) A thermal power level in excess of 1 megawatt, if the reactor is to contain:    (i) A circulating loop through the core in which the applicant proposes to conduct fuel experiments; or    (ii) A liquid fuel loading; or    (iii) An experimental facility in the core in excess of 16 square inches in cross-section.    Total effective dose equivalent  (TEDE) means the sum of the deep-dose equivalent (for external exposures) and the committed effective dose equivalent (for internal exposures).    Unique purpose  means a project, program, or commercial activity which cannot reasonably be accomplished without the use of HEU fuel, and may include: (1) A specific experiment, program, or commercial activity (typically long-term) that significantly serves the U.S. national interest and cannot be accomplished without the use of HEU fuel; (2) Reactor physics or reactor development based explicitly on the use of HEU fuel; (3) Research projects based on neutron flux levels or spectra attainable only with HEU fuel; or (4) A reactor core of special design that could not perform its intended function without using HEU fuel.    United States , when used in a geographical sense, includes Puerto Rico and all territories and possessions of the United States.    Utilization facility  means any nuclear reactor other than one designed or used primarily for the formation of plutonium or U - 233.          Note: Pursuant to subsections 11v. and 11cc., respectively, of the Act, the          Commission may from time to time add to, or otherwise alter, the foregoing          definitions of production and utilization facility. It may also include          as a facility an important component part especially designed for a facility,          but has not at this time included any component parts in the definitions.

[63 FR 1897, Jan 13, 1998]        § 50.7 Employee protection.     (a) Discrimination by a Commission licensee, an applicant for a Commission license, or a contractor or subcontractor of a Commission licensee or applicant against an employee for engaging in certain protected activities is prohibited. Discrimination includes discharge and other actions that relate to compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment. The protected activities are established in section 211 of the Energy Reorganization Act of 1974, as amended, and in general are related to the administration or enforcement of a requirement imposed under the Atomic Energy Act or the Energy Reorganization Act.    (1) The protected activities include but are not limited to:    (i) Providing the Commission or his or her employer information about alleged violations of either of the statutes named in paragraph (a) introductory text of this section or possible violations of requirements imposed under either of those statutes;    (ii) Refusing to engage in any practice made unlawful under either of the statutes named in paragraph (a) introductory text or under these requirements if the employee has identified the alleged illegality to the employer;    (iii) Requesting the Commission to institute action against his or her employer for the administration or enforcement of these requirements;    (iv) Testifying in any Commission proceeding, or before Congress, or at any Federal or State proceeding regarding any provision (or proposed provision) of either of the statutes named in paragraph (a) introductory text.    (v) Assisting or participating in, or is about to assist or participate in, these activities.    (2) These activities are protected even if no formal proceeding is actually initiated as a result of the employee assistance or participation.    (3) This section has no application to any employee alleging discrimination prohibited by this section who, acting without direction from his or her employer (or the employer's agent), deliberately causes a violation of any requirement of the Energy Reorganization Act of 1974, as amended, or the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended.    (b) Any employee who believes that he or she has been discharged or otherwise discriminated against by any person for engaging in protected activities specified in paragraph (a)(1) of this section may seek a remedy for the discharge or discrimination through an administrative proceeding in the Department of Labor. The administrative proceeding must be initiated within 180 days after an alleged violation occurs. The employee may do this by filing a complaint alleging the violation with the Department of Labor, Employment Standards Administration, Wage and Hour Division. The Department of Labor may order reinstatement, back pay, and compensatory damages.    (c) A violation of paragraph (a), (e), or (f) of this section by a Commission licensee, an applicant for a Commission license, or a contractor or subcontractor of a Commission licensee or applicant may be grounds for --    (1) Denial, revocation, or suspension of the license.    (2) Imposition of a civil penalty on the licensee or applicant.    (3) Other enforcement action.    (d) Actions taken by an employer, or others, which adversely affect an employee may be predicated upon nondiscriminatory grounds. The prohibition applies when the adverse action occurs because the employee has engaged in protected activities. An employee's engagement in protected activities does not automatically render him or her immune from discharge or discipline for legitimate reasons or from adverse action dictated by nonprohibited considerations.    (e)(1) Each licensee and each applicant for a license shall prominently post the revision of NRC Form 3, ""Notice to Employees,"" referenced in 10 CFR 19.11(c). This form must be posted at locations sufficient to permit employees protected by this section to observe a copy on the way to or from their place of work. Premises must be posted not later than 30 days after an application is docketed and remain posted while the application is pending before the Commission, during the term of the license, and for 30 days following license termination.

(a) Information provided to the Commission by an applicant for a license or by a licensee or information required by statute or by the Commission's regulations, orders, or license conditions to be maintained by the applicant or the licensee shall be complete and accurate in all material respects.    (b) Each applicant or licensee shall notify the Commission of information identified by the applicant or licensee as having for the regulated activity a significant implication for public health and safety or common defense and security. An applicant or licensee violates this paragraph only if the applicant or licensee fails to notify the Commission of information that the applicant or licensee has identified as having a significant implication for public health and safety or common defense and security. Notification shall be provided to the Administrator of the appropriate Regional Office within two working days of identifying the information. This requirement is not applicable to information which is already required to be provided to the Commission by other reporting or updating requirements.    [52 FR 49372, Dec. 31, 1987]        Requirement of License, Exceptions          § 50.10 License required.    (a) Except as provided in § 50.11, no person within the United States shall transfer or receive in interstate commerce, manufacture, produce, transfer, acquire, possess, or use any production or utilization facility except as authorized by a license issued by the Commission.    (b) No person shall begin the construction of a production or utilization facility on a site on which the facility is to be operated until a construction permit has been issued. As used in this paragraph, the term ""construction"" shall be deemed to include pouring the foundation for, or the installation of, any portion of the permanent facility on the site, but does not include:    (1) Site exploration, site excavation, preparation of the site for construction of the facility, including the driving of piles, and construction of roadways, railroad spurs, and transmission lines;    (2) Procurement or manufacture of components of the facility;    (3) Construction of non-nuclear facilities (such as turbogenerators and turbine buildings) and temporary buildings (such as construction equipment storage sheds) for use in connection with the construction of the facility; and    (4) With respect to production or utilization facilities, other than testing facilities, required to be licensed pursuant to section 104a or section 104c of the Act, the construction of buildings which will be used for activities other than operation of a facility and which may also be used to house a facility. (For example, the construction of a college laboratory building with space for installation of a training reactor is not affected by this paragraph. This paragraph does not apply to production or utilization facilities subject to paragraph (c) of this section.    (c) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (b) of this section, and subject to paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section, no person shall effect commencement of construction of a production or utilization facility subject to the provisions of § 51.20(b) of this chapter on a site on which the facility is to be operated until a construction permit has been issued. As used in this paragraph, the term ""commencement of construction"" means any clearing of land, excavation or other substantial action that would adversely affect the environment of a site, but does not mean:    (1) Changes desirable for the temporary use of the land for public recreational uses, necessary borings to determine foundation conditions or other preconstruction monitoring to establish background information related to the suitability of the site or to the protection of environmental values;    (2) Procurement or manufacture of components of the facility; and    (3) With respect to production or utilization facilities, other than testing facilities, required to be licensed pursuant to section 104a or section 104c of the Act, the construction of buildings which will be used for activities other than operation of a facility and which may also be used to house a facility. (For example, the construction of a college laboratory building with space for installation of a training reactor is not affected by this paragraph.)    (d)(1) Each person subject to the provisions of paragraph (c) of this section, who is, on March 21, 1972, conducting activities permitted pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section in effect prior to March 21, 1972, may furnish to the Commission within 30 days after March 21, 1972 or such later date as may be approved by the Commission upon good cause shown, a written statement of any reasons, with supporting factual submission, why, with reference to the factors stated in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, the activities should be continued, pending the issuance of a construction permit, notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (c) of this section. If such written statement has been submitted, within the time specified, such activities may continue to be conducted pending Commission action pursuant to paragraph (d)(2) of this section.    (2) Upon submission of a statement of reasons pursuant to paragraph (d)(1) of this section the Commission may authorize the continued conduct of activities permitted by paragraph (b) of this section in effect prior to March 21, 1972, upon consideration and balancing of the following factors:    (i) Whether continuation of the activities will give rise to a significant adverse impact on the environment and the nature and extent of such impact, if any;    (ii) Whether redress of any adverse environmental impact from continuation of the activities can reasonably be effected should such redress be necessary;    (iii) Whether continuation of the activities would foreclose subsequent adoption of alternatives; and    (iv) The effect of delay in conducting such activities on the public interest, including the power needs to be served by the proposed facility, the availability of alternative sources, if any, to meet those needs on a timely basis, and delay costs to the applicant and to consumers.    (3) Activities permitted to be continued pursuant to this paragraph (d) shall be conducted in such a manner as will minimize or reduce their environmental impact.    (e)(1) The Director of Nuclear Reactor Regulation may authorize an applicant for a construction permit for a utilization facility which is subject to § 51.20(b) of this chapter, and is of the type specified in § 50.21(b) (2) or (3) or § 50.22 or is a testing facility to conduct the following activities: (i) Preparation of the site for construction of the facility (including such activities as clearing, grading, construction of temporary access roads and borrow areas); (ii) installation of temporary construction support facilities (including such items as warehouse and shop facilities, utilities, concrete mixing plants, docking and unloading facilities, and construction support buildings); (iii) excavation for facility structures; (iv) construction of service facilities (including such facilities as roadways, paving, railroad spurs, fencing, exterior utility and lighting systems, transmission lines, and sanitary sewerage treatment facilities); and (v) the construction of structures, systems and components which do not prevent or mitigate the consequences of postulated accidents that could cause undue risk to the health and safety of the public. No such authorization shall be granted unless the staff has completed a final environmental impact statement on the issuance of the construction permit as required by subpart A of part 51 of this chapter.    (2) Such an authorization shall be granted only after the presiding officer in the proceeding on the construction permit application (i) has made all the findings required by §§ 51.104(b) and 51.105 of this chapter to be made prior to issuance of the construction permit for the facility, and (ii) has determined that, based upon the available information and review to date, there is reasonable assurance that the proposed site is a suitable location for a reactor of the general size and type proposed from the standpoint of radiological health and safety considerations under the Act and rules and regulations promulgated by the Commission pursuant thereto.    (3)(i) The Director of Nuclear Reactor Regulation may authorize an applicant for a construction permit for a utilization facility which is subject to § 51.20(b) of this chapter, and is of the type specified in § 50.21(b) (2) or (3) or § 50.22 or is a testing facility to conduct, in addition to the activities described in paragraph (e)(1) of this section, the installation of structural foundations, including any necessary subsurface preparation, for structures, systems and components which prevent or mitigate the consequences of postulated accidents that could cause undue risk to the health and safety of the public.    (ii) Such an authorization, which may be combined with the authorization described in paragraph (e)(1) of this section, or may be granted at a later time, shall be granted only after the presiding officer in the proceeding on the construction permit application has, in addition to making the findings and determinations required by paragraph (e)(2) of this section, determined that there are no unresolved safety issues relating to the additional activities that may be authorized pursuant to this paragraph that would constitute good cause for withholding authorization.

The assessment must contain an analysis and evaluation of the major structures, systems and components of the facility which bear significantly on the acceptability of the site under the site evaluation factors identified in part 100 of this chapter, assuming that the facility will be operated at the ultimate power level which is contemplated by the applicant. With respect to operation at the projected initial power level, the applicant is required to submit information prescribed in paragraphs (a)(2) through (a)(8) of this section, as well as the information required by this paragraph, in support of the application for a construction permit, or a design approval.    (ii) A description and safety assessment of the site and a safety assessment of the facility. It is expected that reactors will reflect through their design, construction and operation an extremely low probability for accidents that could result in the release of significant quantities of radioactive fission products. The following power reactor design characteristics and proposed operation will be taken into consideration by the Commission:    (A) Intended use of the reactor including the proposed maximum power level and the nature and inventory of contained radioactive materials;    (B) The extent to which generally accepted engineering standards are applied to the design of the reactor;    (C) The extent to which the reactor incorporates unique, unusual or enhanced safety features having a significant bearing on the probability or consequences of accidental release of radioactive materials;          (D) The safety features that are to be engineered into the facility and          those barriers that must be breached as a result of an accident before          a release of radioactive material to the environment can occur. Special          attention must be directed to plant design features intended to mitigate          the radiological consequences of accidents. In performing this assessment,          an applicant shall assume a fission product release 6           from the core into the containment assuming that the facility is operated          at the ultimate power level contemplated. The applicant shall perform          an evaluation and analysis of the postulated fission product release,          using the expected demonstrable containment leak rate and any fission          product cleanup systems intended to mitigate the consequences of the accidents,          together with applicable site characteristics, including site meteorology,          to evaluate the offsite radiological consequences. Site characteristics          must comply with part 100 of this chapter. The evaluation must determine          that:          (1) An individual located at any point on the boundary of the exclusion          area for any 2 hour period following the onset of the postulated fission          product release, would not receive a radiation dose in excess of 25 rem 7           total effective dose equivalent (TEDE).    (2) An individual located at any point on the outer boundary of the low population zone, who is exposed to the radioactive cloud resulting from the postulated fission product release (during the entire period of its passage) would not receive a radiation dose in excess of 25 rem total effective dose equivalent (TEDE);    (E) With respect to operation at the projected initial power level, the applicant is required to submit information prescribed in paragraphs (a)(2) through (a)(8) of this section, as well as the information required by this paragraph (a)(1)(i), in support of the application for a construction permit, or a design approval.    (2) A summary description and discussion of the facility, with special attention to design and operating characteristics, unusual or novel design features, and principal safety considerations.

(II.J.3.1)         (g)  Combustible gas control.  All applicants for a reactor construction          permit or operating license under this part, and all applicants for a          reactor design approval, design certification, or license under part 52          of this chapter, whose application was submitted after October 16, 2003,          shall include the analyses, and the descriptions of the equipment and          systems required by § 50.44 as a part of their application.          (h)  Conformance with the Standard Review Plan (SRP).  (1)(i)          Applications for light water cooled nuclear power plant operating licenses          docketed after May 17, 1982 shall include an evaluation of the facility          against the Standard Review Plan (SRP) in effect on May 17, 1982 or the          SRP revision in effect six months prior to the docket date of the application,          whichever is later.    (ii) Applications for light water cooled nuclear power plant construction permits, manufacturing licenses, and preliminary or final design approvals for standard plants docketed after May 17, 1982 shall include an evaluation of the facility against the SRP in effect on May 17, 1982 or the SRP revision in effect six months prior to the docket date of the application, whichever is later.    (2) The evaluation required by this section shall include an identification and description of all differences in design features, analytical techniques, and procedural measures proposed for a facility and those corresponding features, techniques, and measures given in the SRP acceptance criteria. Where such a difference exists, the evaluation shall discuss how the alternative proposed provides an acceptable method of complying with those rules or regulations of Commission, or portions thereof, that underlie the corresponding SRP acceptance criteria.    (3) The SRP was issued to establish criteria that the NRC staff intends to use in evaluating whether an applicant/licensee meets the Commission's regulations. The SRP is not a substitute for the regulations, and compliance is not a requirement. Applicants shall identify differences from the SRP acceptance criteria and evaluate how the proposed alternatives to the SRP criteria provide an acceptable method of complying with the Commission's regulations.          [33 FR 18612, Dec. 17, 1968]         Editorial Note: For Federal Register citations affecting § 50.34, see          the List of CFR Sections  Affected .   5  The applicant may provide information required by this paragraph in the form of a discussion, with specific references, of similarities to and differences from, facilities of similar design for which applications have previously been filed with the Commission.    6  The fission product release assumed for this evaluation should be based upon a major accident, hypothesized for purposes of site analysis or postulated from considerations of possible accidental events. Such accidents have generally been assumed to result in substantial meltdown of the core with subsequent release into the containment of appreciable quantities of fission products.    7  A whole body dose of 25 rem has been stated to correspond numerically to the once in a lifetime accidental or emergency dose for radiation workers which, according to NCRP recommendations at the time could be disregarded in the determination of their radiation exposure status (see NBS Handbook 69 dated June 5, 1959). However, its use is not intended to imply that this number constitutes an acceptable limit for an emergency dose to the public under accident conditions. Rather, this dose value has been set forth in this section as a reference value, which can be used in the evaluation of plant design features with respect to postulated reactor accidents, in order to assure that such designs provide assurance of low risk of public exposure to radiation, in the event of such accidents.    8  General design criteria for chemical processing facilities are being developed.    9  A physical security plan that contains all the information required in both §73.55 and appendix C to part 73 satisfies the requirement for a contingency plan.    10  Alphanumeric designations correspond to the related action plan items in NUREG 0718 and NUREG 0660, ""NRC Action Plan Developed as a Result of the TMI - 2 Accident."" They are provided herein for information only.          11  The fission product release assumed          for these calculations should be based upon a major accident, hypothesized          for purposes of site analysis or postulated from considerations of possible          accidental events, that would result in potential hazards not exceeded          by those from any accident considered credible. Such accidents have generally          been assumed to result in substantial meltdown of the core with subsequent          release of appreciable quantities of fission products.            § 50.34a Design objectives for equipment to control releases of radioactive material in effluents -- nuclear power reactors.     (a) An application for a permit to construct a nuclear power reactor shall include a description of the preliminary design of equipment to be installed to maintain control over radioactive materials in gaseous and liquid effluents produced during normal reactor operations, including expected operational occurrences. In the case of an application filed on or after January 2, 1971, the application shall also identify the design objectives, and the means to be employed, for keeping levels of radioactive material in effluents to unrestricted areas as low as is reasonably achievable. The term ""as low as is reasonably achievable"" as used in this part means as low as is reasonably achievable taking into account the state of technology, and the economics of improvements in relation to benefits to the public health and safety and other societal and socioeconomic considerations, and in relation to the utilization of atomic energy in the public interest. The guides set out in appendix I to this part provide numerical guidance on design objectives for light-water-cooled nuclear power reactors to meet the requirements that radioactive material in effluents released to unrestricted areas be kept as low as is reasonably achievable. These numerical guides for design objectives and limiting conditions for operation are not to be construed as radiation protection standards.    (b) Each application for a permit to construct a nuclear power reactor shall include:    (1) A description of the preliminary design of equipment to be installed pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section;    (2) An estimate of:    (i) The quantity of each of the principal radio-nuclides expected to be released annually to unrestricted areas in liquid effluents produced during normal reactor operations; and    (ii) The quantity of each of the principal radio-nuclides of the gases, halides, and particulates expected to be released annually to unrestricted areas in gaseous effluents produced during normal reactor operations.    (3) A general description of the provisions for packaging, storage, and shipment offsite of solid waste containing radioactive materials resulting from treatment of gaseous and liquid effluents and from other sources.    (c) Each application for a license to operate a nuclear power reactor shall include (1) a description of the equipment and procedures for the control of gaseous and liquid effluents and for the maintenance and use of equipment installed in radioactive waste systems, pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section; an (2) a revised estimate of the information required in paragraph (b)(2) of this section if the expected releases and exposures differ significantly from the estimates submitted in the application for a construction permit.    [35 FR 18387, Dec. 3, 1970, as amended at 40 FR 58847, Dec. 19, 1975; 61 FR 65172, Dec. 11, 1996]        § 50.35 Issuance of construction permits. 1     (a) When an applicant has not supplied initially all of the technical information required to complete the application and support the issuance of a construction permit which approves all proposed design features, the Commission may issue a construction permit if the Commission finds that (1) the applicant has described the proposed design of the facility, including, but not limited to, the principal architectural and engineering criteria for the design, and has identified the major features or components incorporated therein for the protection of the health and safety of the public; (2) such further technical or design information as may be required to complete the safety analysis, and which can reasonably be left for later consideration, will be supplied in the final safety analysis report; (3) safety features or components, if any, which require research and development have been described by the applicant and the applicant has identified, and there will be conducted, a research and development program reasonably designed to resolve any safety questions associated with such features or components; and that (4) on the basis of the foregoing, there is reasonable assurance that, (i) such safety questions will be satisfactorily resolved at or before the latest date stated in the application for completion of construction of the proposed facility, and (ii) taking into consideration the site criteria contained in part 100 of this chapter, the proposed facility can be constructed and operated at the proposed location without undue risk to the health and safety of the public.    Note: When an applicant has supplied initially all of the technical information required to complete the application, including the final design of the facility, the findings required above will be appropriately modified to reflect that fact.    (b) A construction permit will constitute an authorization to the applicant to proceed with construction but will not constitute Commission approval of the safety of any design feature or specification unless the applicant specifically requests such approval and such approval is incorporated in the permit. The applicant, at his option, may request such approvals in the construction permit or, from time to time, by amendment of his construction permit. The Commission may, in its discretion, incorporate in any construction permit provisions requiring the applicant to furnish periodic reports of the progress and results of research and development programs designed to resolve safety questions.    (c) Any construction permit will be subject to the limitation that a license authorizing operation of the facility will not be issued by the Commission until (1) the applicant has submitted to the Commission, by amendment to the application, the complete final safety analysis report, portions of which may be submitted and evaluated from time to time, and (2) the Commission has found that the final design provides reasonable assurance that the health and safety of the public will not be endangered by operation of the facility in accordance with the requirements of the license and the regulations in this chapter.    [27 FR 12915, Dec. 29, 1962, as amended at 31 FR 12780, Sept. 30, 1966; 35 FR 5318, Mar. 31, 1970; 35 FR 6644, Apr. 25, 1970; 35 FR 11461, July 7, 1970]      1  The Commission may issue a provisional construction permit pursuant to the regulations in this part in effect on March 30, 1970, for any facility for which a notice of hearing on an application for a provisional construction permit has been published on or before that date.      § 50.36 Technical specifications.     (a) Each applicant for a license authorizing operation of a production or utilization facility shall include in his application proposed technical specifications in accordance with the requirements of this section. A summary statement of the bases or reasons for such specifications, other than those covering administrative controls, shall also be included in the application, but shall not become part of the technical specifications.    (b) Each license authorizing operation of a production or utilization facility of a type described in § 50.21 or § 50.22 will include technical specifications. The technical specifications will be derived from the analyses and evaluation included in the safety analysis report, and amendments thereto, submitted pursuant to § 50.34. The Commission may include such additional technical specifications as the Commission finds appropriate.    (c) Technical specifications will include items in the following categories:    (1)  Safety limits, limiting safety system settings, and limiting control settings . (i)(A) Safety limits for nuclear reactors are limits upon important process variables that are found to be necessary to reasonably protect the integrity of certain of the physical barriers that guard against the uncontrolled release of radioactivity. If any safety limit is exceeded, the reactor must be shut down. The licensee shall notify the Commission, review the matter, and record the results of the review, including the cause of the condition and the basis for corrective action taken to preclude recurrence. Operation must not be resumed until authorized by the Commission. The licensee shall retain the record of the results of each review until the Commission terminates the license for the reactor, except for nuclear power reactors licensed under § 50.21(b) or § 50.22 of this part. For these reactors, the licensee shall notify the Commission as required by § 50.72 and submit a Licensee Event Report to the Commission as required by § 50.73. Licensees in these cases shall retain the records of the review for a period of three years following issuance of a Licensee Event Report.    (B) Safety limits for fuel reprocessing plants are those bounds within which the process variables must be maintained for adequate control of the operation and that must not be exceeded in order to protect the integrity of the physical system that is designed to guard against the uncontrolled release or radioactivity. If any safety limit for a fuel reprocessing plant is exceeded, corrective action must be taken as stated in the technical specification or the affected part of the process, or the entire process if required, must be shut down, unless this action would further reduce the margin of safety. The licensee shall notify the Commission, review the matter, and record the results of the review, including the cause of the condition and the basis for corrective action taken to preclude recurrence. If a portion of the process or the entire process has been shutdown, operation must not be resumed until authorized by the Commission. The licensee shall retain the record of the results of each review until the Commission terminates the license for the plant.    (ii)(A) Limiting safety system settings for nuclear reactors are settings for automatic protective devices related to those variables having significant safety functions. Where a limiting safety system setting is specified for a variable on which a safety limit has been placed, the setting must be so chosen that automatic protective action will correct the abnormal situation before a safety limit is exceeded. If, during operation, it is determined that the automatic safety system does not function as required, the licensee shall take appropriate action, which may include shutting down the reactor. The licensee shall notify the Commission, review the matter, and record the results of the review, including the cause of the condition and the basis for corrective action taken to preclude recurrence. The licensee shall retain the record of the results of each review until the Commission terminates the license for the reactor except for nuclear power reactors licensed under § 50.21(b) or § 50.22 of this part. For these reactors, the licensee shall notify the Commission as required by § 50.72 and submit a Licensee Event Report to the Commission as required by § 50.73. Licensees in these cases shall retain the records of the review for a period of three years following issuance of a Licensee Event Report.    (B) Limiting control settings for fuel reprocessing plants are settings for automatic alarm or protective devices related to those variables having significant safety functions. Where a limiting control setting is specified for a variable on which a safety limit has been placed, the setting must be so chosen that protective action, either automatic or manual, will correct the abnormal situation before a safety limit is exceeded. If, during operation, the automatic alarm or protective devices do not function as required, the licensee shall take appropriate action to maintain the variables within the limiting control-setting values and to repair promptly the automatic devices or to shut down the affected part of the process and, if required, to shut down the entire process for repair of automatic devices. The licensee shall notify the Commission, review the matter, and record the results of the review, including the cause of the condition and the basis for corrective action taken to preclude recurrence. The licensee shall retain the record of the results of each review until the Commission terminates the license for the plant.    (2)  Limiting conditions for operation . (i) Limiting conditions for operation are the lowest functional capability or performance levels of equipment required for safe operation of the facility. When a limiting condition for operation of a nuclear reactor is not met, the licensee shall shut down the reactor or follow any remedial action permitted by the technical specifications until the condition can be met. When a limiting condition for operation of any process step in the system of a fuel reprocessing plant is not met, the licensee shall shut down that part of the operation or follow any remedial action permitted by the technical specifications until the condition can be met. In the case of a nuclear reactor not licensed under § 50.21(b) or § 50.22 of this part or fuel reprocessing plant, the licensee shall notify the Commission, review the matter, and record the results of the review, including the cause of the condition and the basis for corrective action taken to preclude recurrence. The licensee shall retain the record of the results of each review until the Commission terminates the license for the nuclear reactor or the fuel reprocessing plant. In the case of nuclear power reactors licensed under § 50.21(b) or § 50.22, the licensee shall notify the Commission if required by § 50.72 and shall submit a Licensee Event Report to the Commission as required by § 50.73. In this case, licensees shall retain records associated with preparation of a Licensee Event Report for a period of three years following issuance of the report. For events which do not require a Licensee Event Report, the licensee shall retain each record as required by the technical specifications.    (ii) A technical specification limiting condition for operation of a nuclear reactor must be established for each item meeting one or more of the following criteria:    (A)  Criterion 1 . Installed instrumentation that is used to detect, and indicate in the control room, a significant abnormal degradation of the reactor coolant pressure boundary.    (B)  Criterion 2 . A process variable, design feature, or operating restriction that is an initial condition of a design basis accident or transient analysis that either assumes the failure of or presents a challenge to the integrity of a fission product barrier.    (C)  Criterion 3 . A structure, system, or component that is part of the primary success path and which functions or actuates to mitigate a design basis accident or transient that either assumes the failure of or presents a challenge to the integrity of a fission product barrier.    (D)  Criterion 4 . A structure, system, or component which operating experience or probabilistic risk assessment has shown to be significant to public health and safety.    (iii) A licensee is not required to propose to modify technical specifications that are included in any license issued before August 18, 1995, to satisfy the criteria in paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section.    (3)  Surveillance requirements . Surveillance requirements are requirements relating to test, calibration, or inspection to assure that the necessary quality of systems and components is maintained, that facility operation will be within safety limits, and that the limiting conditions for operation will be met.    (4)  Design features . Design features to be included are those features of the facility such as materials of construction and geometric arrangements, which, if altered or modified, would have a significant effect on safety and are not covered in categories described in paragraphs (c) (1), (2), and (3) of this section.    (5)  Administrative controls . Administrative controls are the provisions relating to organization and management, procedures, recordkeeping, review and audit, and reporting necessary to assure operation of the facility in a safe manner. Each licensee shall submit any reports to the Commission pursuant to approved technical specifications as specified in § 50.4.    (6)  Decommissioning . This paragraph applies only to nuclear power reactor facilities that have submitted the certifications required by § 50.82(a)(1) and to non-power reactor facilities which are not authorized to operate. Technical specifications involving safety limits, limiting safety system settings, and limiting control system settings; limiting conditions for operation; surveillance requirements; design features; and administrative controls will be developed on a case-by-case basis.    (7)  Initial notification . Reports made to the Commission by licensees in response to the requirements of this section must be made as follows:    (i) Licensees that have an installed Emergency Notification System shall make the initial notification to the NRC Operations Center in accordance with §7E7E50.72 of this part.    (ii) All other licensees shall make the initial notification by telephone to the Administrator of the appropriate NRC Regional Office listed in appendix D, part 20, of this chapter.    (8)  Written Reports . Licensees for nuclear power reactors licensed under § 50.21(b) and § 50.22 of this part shall submit written reports to the Commission in accordance with § 50.73 of this part for events described in paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(2) of this section. For all licensees, the Commission may require Special Reports as appropriate.    (d)(1) This section shall not be deemed to modify the technical specifications included in any license issued prior to January 16, 1969. A license in which technical specifications have not been designated shall be deemed to include the entire safety analysis report as technical specifications.    (2) An applicant for a license authorizing operation of a production or utilization facility to whom a construction permit has been issued prior to January 16, 1969, may submit technical specifications in accordance with this section, or in accordance with the requirements of this part in effect prior to January 16, 1969.    (3) At the initiative of the Commission or the licensee, any license may be amended to include technical specifications of the scope and content which would be required if a new license were being issued.    (e) The provisions of this section apply to each nuclear reactor licensee whose authority to operate the reactor has been removed by license amendment, order, or regulation.    [33 FR 18612, Dec. 17, 1968, as amended at 48 FR 33860, July 26, 1983; 51 FR 40308, Nov. 6, 1986; 53 FR 19249, May 27, 1988; 60 FR 36959, July 19, 1995; 61 FR 39299, July 29, 1996]        § 50.36a Technical specifications on effluents from nuclear power reactors.     (a) In order to keep releases of radioactive materials to unrestricted areas during normal conditions, including expected occurrences, as low as is reasonably achievable, each licensee of a nuclear power reactor will include technical specifications that, in addition to requiring compliance with applicable provisions of §20.1301 of this chapter, require that:    (1) Operating procedures developed pursuant to § 50.34a(c) for the control of effluents be established and followed and that the radioactive waste system, pursuant to § 50.34a, be maintained and used. The licensee shall retain the operating procedures in effect as a record until the Commission terminates the license and shall retain each superseded revision of the procedures for 3 years from the date it was superseded.    (2) Each licensee shall submit a report to the Commission annually that specifies the quantity of each of the principal radionuclides released to unrestricted areas in liquid and in gaseous effluents during the previous 12 months, including any other information as may be required by the Commission to estimate maximum potential annual radiation doses to the public resulting from effluent releases. The report must be submitted as specified in § 50.4, and the time between submission of the reports must be no longer than 12 months. If quantities of radioactive materials released during the reporting period are significantly above design objectives, the report must cover this specifically. On the basis of these reports and any additional information the Commission may obtain from the licensee or others, the Commission may require the licensee to take action as the Commission deems appropriate.    (b) In establishing and implementing the operating procedures described in paragraph (a) of this section, the licensee shall be guided by the following considerations: Experience with the design, construction, and operation of nuclear power reactors indicates that compliance with the technical specifications described in this section will keep average annual releases of radioactive material in effluents and their resultant committed effective dose equivalents at small percentages of the dose limits specified in §20.1301 and in the license. At the same time, the licensee is permitted the flexibility of operation, compatible with considerations of health and safety, to assure that the public is provided a dependable source of power even under unusual conditions which may temporarily result in releases higher than such small percentages, but still within the limits specified in §20.1301 of this chapter and in the license. It is expected that in using this flexibility under unusual conditions, the licensee will exert its best efforts to keep levels of radioactive material in effluents as low as is reasonably achievable. The guides set out in appendix I, provide numerical guidance on limiting conditions for operation for light-water cooled nuclear power reactors to meet the requirement that radioactive materials in effluents released to unrestricted areas be kept as low as is reasonably achievable.    [61 FR 39299, July 29, 1996]        § 50.36b Environmental conditions.     Each license authorizing operation of a production or utilization facility, and each license for a nuclear power reactor facility for which the certification of permanent cessation of operations required under § 50.82(a)(1) has been submitted, which is of a type described in § 50.21(b) (2) or (3) or § 50.22 or is a testing facility, may include conditions to protect the environment to be set out in an attachment to the license which is incorporated in and made a part of the license. These conditions will be derived from information contained in the environmental report and the supplement to the environmental report submitted pursuant to §§ 51.50 and 51.53 of this chapter as analyzed and evaluated in the NRC record of decision, and will identify the obligations of the licensee in the environmental area, including, as appropriate, requirements for reporting and keeping records of environmental data, and any conditions and monitoring requirement for the protection of the nonaquatic environment.    [61 FR 39299, July 29, 1996]        § 50.37 Agreement limiting access to Classified Information.     As part of its application and in any event before the receipt of Restricted Data or classified National Security Information or the issuance of a license or construction permit, the applicant shall agree in writing that it will not permit any individual to have access to or any facility to possess Restricted Data or classified National Security Information until the individual and/or facility has been approved for such access under the provisions of 10 CFR Parts 25 and/or 95. The agreement of the applicant in this regard shall be deemed part of the license or construction permit, whether so stated therein or not.    [62 FR 17690, Apr. 11, 1997]        § 50.38 Ineligibility of certain applicants.     Any person who is a citizen, national, or agent of a foreign country, or any corporation, or other entity which the Commission knows or has reason to believe is owned, controlled, or dominated by an alien, a foreign corporation, or a foreign government, shall be ineligible to apply for and obtain a license.    [21 FR 355, Jan. 16, 1956, as amended at 43 FR 6924, Feb. 17, 1978]        § 50.39 Public inspection of applications.     Applications and documents submitted to the Commission in connection with applications may be made available for public inspection in accordance with the provisions of the regulations contained in part 2 of this chapter.        Standards for Licenses and Construction Permits          § 50.40 Common standards.    In determining that a license will be issued to an applicant, the Commission will be guided by the following considerations:    (a) The processes to be performed, the operating procedures, the facility and equipment, the use of the facility, and other technical specifications, or the proposals, in regard to any of the foregoing collectively provide reasonable assurance that the applicant will comply with the regulations in this chapter, including the regulations in part 20, and that the health and safety of the public will not be endangered.    (b) The applicant is technically and financially qualified to engage in the proposed activities in accordance with the regulations in this chapter. However, no consideration of financial qualification is necessary for an electric utility applicant for an operating license for a utilization facility of the type described in § 50.21(b) or § 50.22.    (c) The issuance of a license to the applicant will not, in the opinion of the Commission, be inimical to the common defense and security or to the health and safety of the public.    (d) Any applicable requirements of subpart A of part 51 have been satisfied.

In determining that a class 104 license will be issued to an applicant, the Commission will, in addition to applying the standards set forth in § 50.40 be guided by the following considerations:    (a) The Commission will permit the widest amount of effective medical therapy possible with the amount of special nuclear material available for such purposes.    (b) The Commission will permit the conduct of widespread and diverse research and development.    (c) An application for a class 104 operating license as to which a person who intervened or sought by timely written notice to the Commission to intervene in the construction permit proceeding for the facility to obtain a determination of antitrust considerations or to advance a jurisdictional basis for such determination has requested an antitrust review under section 105 of the Act within 25 days after the date of publication in the Federal Register of notice of filing of the application for an operating license or December 19, 1970, whichever is later, is also subject to the provisions of § 50.42(b).

In determining whether a class 103 license will be issued to an applicant, the Commission will, in addition to applying the standards set forth in § 50.40, be guided by the following considerations:    (a) The proposed activities will serve a useful purpose proportionate to the quantities of special nuclear material or source material to be utilized.    (b) Due account will be taken of the advice provided by the Attorney General, under subsection 105c of the Act, and to any evidence that may be provided during any proceedings in connection with the antitrust aspects of the application for a construction permit or the facility's initial operating license.    (1) For this purpose, the Commission will promptly transmit to the Attorney General a copy of the construction permit application or initial operating license application. The Commission will request any advice as the Attorney General considers appropriate in regard to the finding to be made by the Commission as to whether the proposed license would create or maintain a situation inconsistent with the antitrust laws, as specified in subsection 105a of the Act. This requirement will not apply--    (i) With respect to the types of class 103 licenses which the Commission, with the approval of the Attorney general, may determine would not significantly affect the applicant's activities under the antitrust laws; and    (ii) To an application for an initial license to operate a production or utilization facility for which a class 103 construction permit was issued unless the Commission, after consultation with the Attorney General, determines such review is advisable on the ground that significant changes have occurred subsequent to the previous review by the Attorney General and the Commission.          (2) The Commission will publish any advice it receives from the Attorney          General in the Federal Register. After considering the antitrust aspects          of the application for a construction permit or initial operating license,          the Commission, if it finds that the construction permit or initial operating          license to be issued or continued, would create or maintain a situation          inconsistent with the antitrust laws specified subsection 105a of the          Act, will consider, in determining whether a construction permit or initial          operating license should be issued or continued, other factors the Commission          considers necessary to protect the public interest, including the need          for power in the affected area. 1         [21 FR 355, Jan. 19, 1956, as amended at 35 FR 11461, July 17, 1970;          35 FR 19660, Dec. 29, 1970; 65 FR 44660, July 19, 2000]      1  As permitted by subsection 105c(8) of the Act, with respect to proceedings in which an application for a construction permit was filed prior to Dec. 19, 1970, and proceedings in which a written request for antitrust review of an application for an operating license to be issued under section 104b has been made by a person who intervened or sought by timely written notice to the Atomic Energy Commission to intervene in the construction permit proceeding for the facility to obtain a determination of antitrust considerations or to advance a jurisdictional basis for such determination within 25 days after the date of publication in the Federal Register of notice of filing of the application for an operating license or Dec. 19, 1970, whichever is later, the Commission may issue a construction permit or operating license in advance of consideration of, and findings with respect to the antitrust aspects of the application, provided that the permit or license so issued contains the condition specified in Sec. 50.55b.      § 50.43 Additional standards and provisions affecting class 103 licenses for commercial power.     In addition to applying the standards set forth in §§ 50.40 and 50.42, in the case of a class 103 license for a facility for the generation of commercial power:    (a) The NRC will:    (1) Give notice in writing of each application to the regulatory agency or State as may have jurisdiction over the rates and services incident to the proposed activity;    (2) Publish notice of the application in trade or news publications as it deems appropriate to give reasonable notice to municipalities, private utilities, public bodies, and cooperatives which might have a potential interest in the utilization or production facility; and    (3) Publish notice of the application once each week for 4 consecutive weeks in the Federal Register. No license will be issued by the NRC prior to the giving of these notices and until 4 weeks after the last notice is published in the Federal Register.    (b) If there are conflicting applications for a limited opportunity for such license, the Commission will give preferred consideration in the following order: First, to applications submitted by public or cooperative bodies for facilities to be located in high cost power areas in the United States; second, to applications submitted by others for facilities to be located in such areas; third, to applications submitted by public or cooperative bodies for facilities to be located in other than high cost power areas; and, fourth, to all other applicants.    (c) The licensee who transmits electric energy in interstate commerce, or sells it at wholesale in interstate commerce, shall be subject to the regulatory provisions of the Federal Power Act.    (d) Nothing herein shall preclude any government agency, now or hereafter authorized by law to engage in the production, marketing, or distribution of electric energy, if otherwise qualified, from obtaining a license for the construction and operation of a utilization facility for the primary purpose of producing electric energy for disposition for ultimate public consumption.    [21 FR 355, Jan. 19, 1956, as amended at 35 FR 19660, Dec. 29, 1970; 63 FR 50480, Sept. 22, 1998]        § 50.44 Combustible gas control for nuclear power reactors.           (a)  Definitions.         (1)  Inerted atmosphere  means a containment atmosphere with less          than 4 percent oxygen by volume.         (2)  Mixed atmosphere  means that the concentration of combustible          gases in any part of the containment is below a level that supports combustion          or detonation that could cause loss of containment integrity.         (b)  Requirements for currently-licensed reactors.  Each boiling          or pressurized water nuclear power reactor with an operating license on          October 16, 2003, except for those facilities for which the certifications          required under § 50.82(a)(1) have been submitted, must comply with          the following requirements, as applicable:         (1)  Mixed atmosphere.  All containments must have a capability          for ensuring a mixed atmosphere.         (2)  Combustible gas control.  (i) All boiling water reactors          with Mark I or Mark II type containments must have an inerted atmosphere.         (ii) All boiling water reactors with Mark III type containments and all          pressurized water reactors with ice condenser containments must have the          capability for controlling combustible gas generated from a metal-water          reaction involving 75 percent of the fuel cladding surrounding the active          fuel region (excluding the cladding surrounding the plenum volume) so          that there is no loss of containment structural integrity.         (3)  Equipment Survivability.  All boiling water reactors with          Mark III containments and all pressurized water reactors with ice condenser          containments that do not rely upon an inerted atmosphere inside containment          to control combustible gases must be able to establish and maintain safe          shutdown and containment structural integrity with systems and components          capable of performing their functions during and after exposure to the          environmental conditions created by the burning of hydrogen. Environmental          conditions caused by local detonations of hydrogen must also be included,          unless such detonations can be shown unlikely to occur. The amount of          hydrogen to be considered must be equivalent to that generated from a          metal-water reaction involving 75 percent of the fuel cladding surrounding          the active fuel region (excluding the cladding surrounding the plenum          volume).         (4)  Monitoring.  (i) Equipment must be provided for monitoring          oxygen in containments that use an inerted atmosphere for combustible          gas control. Equipment for monitoring oxygen must be functional, reliable,          and capable of continuously measuring the concentration of oxygen in the          containment atmosphere following a significant beyond design-basis accident          for combustible gas control and accident management, including emergency          planning.         (ii) Equipment must be provided for monitoring hydrogen in the containment.          Equipment for monitoring hydrogen must be functional, reliable, and capable          of continuously measuring the concentration of hydrogen in the containment          atmosphere following a significant beyond design-basis accident for accident          management, including emergency planning.         (5)  Analyses.  Each holder of an operating license for a boiling          water reactor with a Mark III type of containment or for a pressurized          water reactor with an ice condenser type of containment, shall perform          an analysis that:         (i) Provides an evaluation of the consequences of large amounts of hydrogen          generated after the start of an accident (hydrogen resulting from the          metal-water reaction of up to and including 75 percent of the fuel cladding          surrounding the active fuel region, excluding the cladding surrounding          the plenum volume) and include consideration of hydrogen control measures          as appropriate;         (ii) Includes the period of recovery from the degraded condition;         (iii) Uses accident scenarios that are accepted by the NRC staff. These          scenarios must be accompanied by sufficient supporting justification to          show that they describe the behavior of the reactor system during and          following an accident resulting in a degraded core.         (iv) Supports the design of the hydrogen control system selected to meet          the requirements of this section; and,         (v) Demonstrates, for those reactors that do not rely upon an inerted          atmosphere to comply with paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section, that:         (A) Containment structural integrity is maintained. Containment structural          integrity must be demonstrated by use of an analytical technique that          is accepted by the NRC staff in accordance with § 50.90. This demonstration          must include sufficient supporting justification to show that the technique          describes the containment response to the structural loads involved. This          method could include the use of actual material properties with suitable          margins to account for uncertainties in modeling, in material properties,          in construction tolerances, and so on; and         (B) Systems and components necessary to establish and maintain safe shutdown          and to maintain containment integrity will be capable of performing their          functions during and after exposure to the environmental conditions created          by the burning of hydrogen, including local detonations, unless such detonations          can be shown unlikely to occur.         (c)  Requirements for future water-cooled reactor applicants and licensees. 2           The requirements in this paragraph apply to all water-cooled reactor construction          permits or operating licenses under this part, and to all water-cooled          reactor design approvals, design certifications, combined licenses or          manufacturing licenses under part 52 of this chapter, any of which are          issued after October 16, 2003.         (1)  Mixed atmosphere.  All containments must have a capability          for ensuring a mixed atmosphere during design-basis and significant beyond          design-basis accidents.         (2)  Combustible gas control.  All containments must have an inerted          atmosphere, or must limit hydrogen concentrations in containment during          and following an accident that releases an equivalent amount of hydrogen          as would be generated from a 100 percent fuel clad-coolant reaction, uniformly          distributed, to less than 10 percent (by volume) and maintain containment          structural integrity and appropriate accident mitigating features.         (3)  Equipment Survivability.  Containments that do not rely upon          an inerted atmosphere to control combustible gases must be able to establish          and maintain safe shutdown and containment structural integrity with systems          and components capable of performing their functions during and after          exposure to the environmental conditions created by the burning of hydrogen.          Environmental conditions caused by local detonations of hydrogen must          also be included, unless such detonations can be shown unlikely to occur.          The amount of hydrogen to be considered must be equivalent to that generated          from a fuel clad-coolant reaction involving 100 percent of the fuel cladding          surrounding the active fuel region.         (4)  Monitoring.  (i) Equipment must be provided for monitoring          oxygen in containments that use an inerted atmosphere for combustible          gas control. Equipment for monitoring oxygen must be functional, reliable,          and capable of continuously measuring the concentration of oxygen in the          containment atmosphere following a significant beyond design-basis accident          for combustible gas control and accident management, including emergency          planning.         (ii) Equipment must be provided for monitoring hydrogen in the containment.          Equipment for monitoring hydrogen must be functional, reliable, and capable          of continuously measuring the concentration of hydrogen in the containment          atmosphere following a significant beyond design-basis accident for accident          management, including emergency planning.         (5)  Structural analysis.  An applicant must perform an analysis          that demonstrates containment structural integrity. This demonstration          must use an analytical technique that is accepted by the NRC and include          sufficient supporting justification to show that the technique describes          the containment response to the structural loads involved. The analysis          must address an accident that releases hydrogen generated from 100 percent          fuel clad-coolant reaction accompanied by hydrogen burning. Systems necessary          to ensure containment integrity must also be demonstrated to perform their          function under these conditions.         (d)  Requirements for future non water-cooled reactor applicants and          licensees and certain water-cooled reactor applicants and licensees.           The requirements in this paragraph apply to all construction permits and          operating licenses under this part, and to all design approvals, design          certifications, combined licenses, or manufacturing licenses under part          52 of this chapter, for non water-cooled reactors and water-cooled reactors          that do not fall within the description in paragraph (c), footnote 1 of          this section, any of which are issued after October 16, 2003. Applications          subject to this paragraph must include:         (1) Information addressing whether accidents involving combustible gases          are technically relevant for their design, and         (2) If accidents involving combustible gases are found to be technically          relevant, information (including a design-specific probabilistic risk          assessment) demonstrating that the safety impacts of combustible gases          during design-basis and significant beyond design-basis accidents have          been addressed to ensure adequate protection of public health and safety          and common defense and security.                 [43 FR 50163, Oct. 27, 1978, as amended at 46 FR 58486, Dec. 2, 1981;          50 FR 3504, Jan. 25, 1985; 50 FR 5567, Feb. 11, 1985; 51 FR 40308, Nov.          6, 1986; 53 FR 43420, Oct. 27, 1988; 57 FR 39358, Aug. 31, 1992, 61 FR          39299, July 29, 1996; 64 FR 48951, Sept. 9, 1999; 68 FR 54141, Sep. 16,          2003]           2  The requirements of this paragraph apply          only to water-cooled reactor designs with characteristics (e.g., type          and quantity of cladding materials) such that the potential for production          of combustible gases is comparable to light water reactor designs licensed          as of October 16, 2003.            § 50.45 Standards for construction permits.     An applicant for a license or an amendment of a license who proposes to construct or alter a production or utilization facility will be initially granted a construction permit, if the application is in conformity with and acceptable under the criteria of §§ 50.31 through 50.38 and the standards of §§ 50.40 through 50.43.        § 50.46 Acceptance criteria for emergency core cooling systems for light-water nuclear power reactors.     (a)(1)(i) Each boiling or pressurized light-water nuclear power reactor fueled with uranium oxide pellets within cylindrical zircaloy or ZIRLO cladding must be provided with an emergency core cooling system (ECCS) that must be designed so that its calculated cooling performance following postulated loss-of-coolant accidents conforms to the criteria set forth in paragraph (b) of this section. ECCS cooling performance must be calculated in accordance with an acceptable evaluation model and must be calculated for a number of postulated loss-of-coolant accidents of different sizes, locations, and other properties sufficient to provide assurance that the most severe postulated loss-of-coolant accidents are calculated. Except as provided in paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section, the evaluation model must include sufficient supporting justification to show that the analytical technique realistically describes the behavior of the reactor system during a loss-of-coolant accident. Comparisons to applicable experimental data must be made and uncertainties in the analysis method and inputs must be identified and assessed so that the uncertainty in the calculated results can be estimated. This uncertainty must be accounted for, so that, when the calculated ECCS cooling performance is compared to the criteria set forth in paragraph (b) of this section, there is a high level of probability that the criteria would not be exceeded. Appendix K, Part II Required Documentation, sets forth the documentation requirements for each evaluation model. This section does not apply to a nuclear power reactor facility for which the certifications required under § 50.82(a)(1) have been submitted.    (ii) Alternatively, an ECCS evaluation model may be developed in conformance with the required and acceptable features of appendix K ECCS Evaluation Models.    (2) The Director of Nuclear Reactor Regulation may impose restrictions on reactor operation if it is found that the evaluations of ECCS cooling performance submitted are not consistent with paragraphs (a)(1) (i) and (ii) of this section.          (3)(i) Each applicant for or holder of an operating license or construction          permit shall estimate the effect of any change to or error in an acceptable          evaluation model or in the application of such a model to determine if          the change or error is significant. For this purpose, a significant change          or error is one which results in a calculated peak fuel cladding temperature          different by more than 50F from the temperature calculated for the limiting          transient using the last acceptable model, or is a cumulation of changes          and errors such that the sum of the absolute magnitudes of the respective          temperature changes is greater than 50°F.    (ii) For each change to or error discovered in an acceptable evaluation model or in the application of such a model that affects the temperature calculation, the applicant or licensee shall report the nature of the change or error and its estimated effect on the limiting ECCS analysis to the Commission at least annually as specified in § 50.4. If the change or error is signficant, the applicant or licensee shall provide this report within 30 days and include with the report a proposed schedule for providing a reanalysis or taking other action as may be needed to show compliance with § 50.46 requirements. This schedule may be developed using an integrated scheduling system previously approved for the facility by the NRC. For those facilities not using an NRC approved integrated scheduling system, a schedule will be established by the NRC staff within 60 days of receipt of the proposed schedule. Any change or error correction that results in a calculated ECCS performance that does not conform to the criteria set forth in paragraph (b) of this section is a reportable event as described in §§ 50.55(e), 50.72 and 50.73. The affected applicant or licensee shall propose immediate steps to demonstrate compliance or bring plant design or operation into compliance with § 50.46 requirements.    (b)(1)  Peak cladding temperature . The calculated maximum fuel element cladding temperature shall not exceed 2200º F.    (2)  Maximum cladding oxidation . The calculated total oxidation of the cladding shall nowhere exceed 0.17 times the total cladding thickness before oxidation. As used in this subparagraph total oxidation means the total thickness of cladding metal that would be locally converted to oxide if all the oxygen absorbed by and reacted with the cladding locally were converted to stoichiometric zirconium dioxide. If cladding rupture is calculated to occur, the inside surfaces of the cladding shall be included in the oxidation, beginning at the calculated time of rupture. Cladding thickness before oxidation means the radial distance from inside to outside the cladding, after any calculated rupture or swelling has occurred but before significant oxidation. Where the calculated conditions of transient pressure and temperature lead to a prediction of cladding swelling, with or without cladding rupture, the unoxidized cladding thickness shall be defined as the cladding cross-sectional area, taken at a horizontal plane at the elevation of the rupture, if it occurs, or at the elevation of the highest cladding temperature if no rupture is calculated to occur, divided by the average circumference at that elevation. For ruptured cladding the circumference does not include the rupture opening.    (3)  Maximum hydrogen generation . The calculated total amount of hydrogen generated from the chemical reaction of the cladding with water or steam shall not exceed 0.01 times the hypothetical amount that would be generated if all of the metal in the cladding cylinders surrounding the fuel, excluding the cladding surrounding the plenum volume, were to react.    (4)  Coolable geometry . Calculated changes in core geometry shall be such that the core remains amenable to cooling.    (5)  Long-term cooling . After any calculated successful initial operation of the ECCS, the calculated core temperature shall be maintained at an acceptably low value and decay heat shall be removed for the extended period of time required by the long-lived radioactivity remaining in the core.    (c) As used in this section: (1) Loss-of-coolant accidents (LOCA's) are hypothetical accidents that would result from the loss of reactor coolant, at a rate in excess of the capability of the reactor coolant makeup system, from breaks in pipes in the reactor coolant pressure boundary up to and including a break equivalent in size to the double-ended rupture of the largest pipe in the reactor coolant system.    (2) An evaluation model is the calculational framework for evaluating the behavior of the reactor system during a postulated loss-of-coolant accident (LOCA). It includes one or more computer programs and all other information necessary for application of the calculational framework to a specific LOCA, such as mathematical models used, assumptions included in the programs, procedure for treating the program input and output information, specification of those portions of analysis not included in computer programs, values of parameters, and all other information necessary to specify the calculational procedure.    (d) The requirements of this section are in addition to any other requirements applicable to ECCS set forth in this part. The criteria set forth in paragraph (b), with cooling performance calculated in accordance with an acceptable evaluation model, are in implementation of the general requirements with respect to ECCS cooling performance design set forth in this part, including in particular Criterion 35 of appendix A.    [39 FR 1002, Jan. 4, 1974, as amended at 53 FR 36004, Sept. 16, 1988; 57 FR 39358, Aug. 31, 1992; 61 FR 39299, July 29, 1996; 62 FR 59726, Nov. 3, 1997]        § 50.46a Acceptance criteria for reactor coolant system venting systems.           Each nuclear power reactor must be provided with high point vents for          the reactor coolant system, for the reactor vessel head, and for other          systems required to maintain adequate core cooling if the accumulation          of noncondensible gases would cause the loss of function of these systems.          High point vents are not required for the tubes in U-tube steam generators.          Acceptable venting systems must meet the following criteria:         (a) The high point vents must be remotely operated from the control room.         (b) The design of the vents and associated controls, instruments and          power sources must conform to appendix A and appendix B of this part.         (c) The vent system must be designed to ensure that:         (1) The vents will perform their safety functions; and         (2) There would not be inadvertent or irreversible actuation of a vent.         [68 FR 54142, Sep. 16, 2003]            § 50.47 Emergency plans.     (a)(1) Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, no initial operating license for a nuclear power reactor will be issued unless a finding is made by the NRC that there is reasonable assurance that adequate protective measures can and will be taken in the event of a radiological emergency. No finding under this section is necessary for issuance of a renewed nuclear power reactor operating license.    (2) The NRC will base its finding on a review of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) findings and determinations as to whether State and local emergency plans are adequate and whether there is reasonable assurance that they can be implemented, and on the NRC assessment as to whether the applicant's onsite emergency plans are adequate and whether there is reasonable assurance that they can be implemented. A FEMA finding will primarily be based on a review of the plans. Any other information already available to FEMA may be considered in assessing whether there is reasonable assurance that the plans can be implemented. In any NRC licensing proceeding, a FEMA finding will constitute a rebuttable presumption on questions of adequacy and implementation capability.    (b) The onsite and, except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, offsite emergency response plans for nuclear power reactors must meet the following standards:    (1) Primary responsibilities for emergency response by the nuclear facility licensee and by State and local organizations within the Emergency Planning Zones have been assigned, the emergency responsibilities of the various supporting organizations have been specifically established, and each principal response organization has staff to respond and to augment its initial response on a continuous basis.    (2) On-shift facility licensee responsibilities for emergency response are unambiguously defined, adequate staffing to provide initial facility accident response in key functional areas is maintained at all times, timely augmentation of response capabilities is available and the interfaces among various onsite response activities and offsite support and response activities are specified.    (3) Arrangements for requesting and effectively using assistance resources have been made, arrangements to accommodate State and local staff at the licensee's near-site Emergency Operations Facility have been made, and other organizations capable of augmenting the planned response have been identified.    (4) A standard emergency classification and action level scheme, the bases of which include facility system and effluent parameters, is in use by the nuclear facility licensee, and State and local response plans call for reliance on information provided by facility licensees for determinations of minimum initial offsite response measures.    (5) Procedures have been established for notification, by the licensee, of State and local response organizations and for notification of emergency personnel by all organizations; the content of initial and followup messages to response organizations and the public has been established; and means to provide early notification and clear instruction to the populace within the plume exposure pathway Emergency Planning Zone have been established.    (6) Provisions exist for prompt communications among principal response organizations to emergency personnel and to the public.    (7) Information is made available to the public on a periodic basis on how they will be notified and what their initial actions should be in an emergency (e.g., listening to a local broadcast station and remaining indoors), the principal points of contact with the news media for dissemination of information during an emergency (including the physical location or locations) are established in advance, and procedures for coordinated dissemination of information to the public are established.    (8) Adequate emergency facilities and equipment to support the emergency response are provided and maintained.    (9) Adequate methods, systems, and equipment for assessing and monitoring actual or potential offsite consequences of a radiological emergency condition are in use.    (10) A range of protective actions has been developed for the plume exposure pathway EPZ for emergency workers and the public. In developing this range of actions, consideration has been given to evacuation, sheltering, and, as a supplement to these, the prophylactic use of potassium iodide (KI), as appropriate. Guidelines for the choice of protective actions during an emergency, consistent with Federal guidance, are developed and in place, and protective actions for the ingestion exposure pathway EPZ appropriate to the locale have been developed.    (11) Means for controlling radiological exposures, in an emergency, are established for emergency workers. The means for controlling radiological exposures shall include exposure guidelines consistent with EPA Emergency Worker and Lifesaving Activity Protective Action Guides.    (12) Arrangements are made for medical services for contaminated injured individuals.    (13) General plans for recovery and reentry are developed.    (14) Periodic exercises are (will be) conducted to evaluate major portions of emergency response capabilities, periodic drills are (will be) conducted to develop and maintain key skills, and deficiencies identified as a result of exercises or drills are (will be) corrected.    (15) Radiological emergency response training is provided to those who may be called on to assist in an emergency.    (16) Responsibilities for plan development and review and for distribution of emergency plans are established, and planners are properly trained.    (c)(1) Failure to meet the applicable standards set forth in paragraph (b) of this section may result in the Commission declining to issue an operating license; however, the applicant will have an opportunity to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Commission that deficiencies in the plans are not significant for the plant in question, that adequate interim compensating actions have been or will be taken promptly, or that there are other compelling reasons to permit plant operations. Where an applicant for an operating license asserts that its inability to demonstrate compliance with the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section results wholly or substantially from the decision of state and/or local governments not to participate further in emergency planning, an operating license may be issued if the applicant demonstrates to the Commission's satisfaction that:    (i) The applicant's inability to comply with the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section is wholly or substantially the result of the non-participation of state and/or local governments.    (ii) The applicant has made a sustained, good faith effort to secure and retain the participation of the pertinent state and/or local governmental authorities, including the furnishing of copies of its emergency plan.    (iii) The applicant's emergency plan provides reasonable assurance that public health and safety is not endangered by operation of the facility concerned. To make that finding, the applicant must demonstrate that, as outlined below, adequate protective measures can and will be taken in the event of an emergency. A utility plan will be evaluated against the same planning standards applicable to a state or local plan, as listed in paragraph (b) of this section, with due allowance made both for --    (A) Those elements for which state and/or local non-participation makes compliance infeasible and    (B) The utility's measures designed to compensate for any deficiencies resulting from state and/or local non-participation.    In making its determination on the adequacy of a utility plan, the NRC will recognize the reality that in an actual emergency, state and local government officials will exercise their best efforts to protect the health and safety of the public. The NRC will determine the adequacy of that expected response, in combination with the utility's compensating measures, on a case-by-case basis, subject to the following guidance. In addressing the circumstance where applicant's inability to comply with the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section is wholly or substantially the result of non-participation of state and/or local governments, it may be presumed that in the event of an actual radiological emergency state and local officials would generally follow the utility plan. However, this presumption may be rebutted by, for example, a good faith and timely proffer of an adequate and feasible state and/or local radiological emergency plan that would in fact be relied upon in a radiological emergency.    (2) Generally, the plume exposure pathway EPZ for nuclear power plants shall consist of an area about 10 miles (16 km) in radius and the ingestion pathway EPZ shall consist of an area about 50 miles (80 km) in radius. The exact size and configuration of the EPZs surrounding a particular nuclear power reactor shall be determined in relation to local emergency response needs and capabilities as they are affected by such conditions as demography, topography, land characteristics, access routes, and jurisdictional boundaries. The size of the EPZs also may be determined on a case-by-case basis for gas-cooled nuclear reactors and for reactors with an authorized power level less than 250 MW thermal. The plans for the ingestion pathway shall focus on such actions as are appropriate to protect the food ingestion pathway.    (d) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, and except as specified by this paragraph, no NRC or FEMA review, findings, or determinations concerning the state of offsite emergency preparedness or the adequacy of and capability to implement State and local or utility offsite emergency plans are required prior to issuance of an operating license authorizing only fuel loading or low power testing and training (up to 5 percent of the rated power). Insofar as emergency planning and preparedness requirements are concerned, a license authorizing fuel loading and/or low power testing and training may be issued after a finding is made by the NRC that the state of onsite emergency preparedness provides reasonable assurance that adequate protective measures can and will be taken in the event of a radiological emergency. The NRC will base this finding on its assessment of the applicant's onsite emergency plans against the pertinent standards in paragraph (b) of this section and appendix E. Review of applicant's emergency plans will include the following standards with offsite aspects:    (1) Arrangements for requesting and effectively using offsite assistance on site have been made, arrangements to accommodate State and local staff at the licensee's near-site Emergency Operations Facility have been made, and other organizations capable of augmenting the planned onsite response have been identified.    (2) Procedures have been established for licensee communications with State and local response organizations, including initial notification of the declaration of emergency and periodic provision of plant and response status reports.    (3) Provisions exist for prompt communications among principal response organizations to offsite emergency personnel who would be responding onsite.    (4) Adequate emergency facilities and equipment to support the emergency response onsite are provided and maintained.    (5) Adequate methods, systems, and equipment for assessing and monitoring actual or potential offsite consequences of a radiological emergency condition are in use onsite.    (6) Arrangements are made for medical services for contaminated and injured onsite individuals.          (7) Radiological emergency response training has been made available          to those offsite who may be called to assist in an emergency onsite.

(a)(1) Each operating nuclear power plant must have a fire protection plan that satisfies Criterion 3 of appendix A to this part. This fire protection plan must:    (i) Describe the overall fire protection program for the facility;    (ii) Identify the various positions within the licensee's organization that are responsible for the program;    (iii) State the authorities that are delegated to each of these positions to implement those responsibilities; and    (iv) Outline the plans for fire protection, fire detection and suppression capability, and limitation of fire damage.    (2) The plan must also describe specific features necessary to implement the program described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section such as--    (i) Administrative controls and personnel requirements for fire prevention and manual fire suppression activities;    (ii) Automatic and manually operated fire detection and suppression systems; and    (iii) The means to limit fire damage to structures, systems, or components important to safety so that the capability to shut down the plant safely is ensured.    (3) The licensee shall retain the fire protection plan and each change to the plan as a record until the Commission terminates the reactor license. The licensee shall retain each superseded revision of the procedures for 3 years from the date it was superseded.    (b) Appendix R to this part establishes fire protection features required to satisfy Criterion 3 of appendix A to this part with respect to certain generic issues for nuclear power plants licensed to operate before January 1, 1979.    (1) Except for the requirements of Sections III.G, III.J, and III.O, the provisions of Appendix R to this part do not apply to nuclear power plants licensed to operate before January 1, 1979, to the extent that--    (i) Fire protection features proposed or implemented by the licensee have been accepted by the NRC staff as satisfying the provisions of Appendix A to Branch Technical Position (BTP) APCSB 9.5-1 reflected in NRC fire protection safety evaluation reports issued before the effective date of February 19, 1981; or    (ii) Fire protection features were accepted by the NRC staff in comprehensive fire protection safety evaluation reports issued before Appendix A to Branch Technical Position (BTP) APCSB 9.5-1 was published in August 1976.    (2) With respect to all other fire protection features covered by Appendix R, all nuclear power plants licensed to operate before January 1, 1979, must satisfy the applicable requirements of Appendix R to this part, including specifically the requirements of Sections III.G, III.J, and III.O.    (c) [Reserved].    (d) [Reserved].    (e) [Reserved].    (f) Licensees that have submitted the certifications required under Sec. 50.82(a)(1) shall maintain a fire protection program to address the potential for fires that could cause the release or spread of radioactive materials (i.e., that could result in a radiological hazard).    (1) The objectives of the fire protection program are to--    (i) Reasonably prevent these fires from occurring;    (ii) Rapidly detect, control, and extinguish those fires that do occur and that could result in a radiological hazard; and    (iii) Ensure that the risk of fire-induced radiological hazards to the public, environment and plant personnel is minimized.    (2) The licensee shall assess the fire protection program on a regular basis. The licensee shall revise the plan as appropriate throughout the various stages of facility decommissioning.          (3) The licensee may make changes to the fire protection program without          NRC approval if these changes do not reduce the effectiveness of fire          protection for facilities, systems, and equipment that could result in          a radiological hazard, taking into account the decommissioning plant conditions          and activities.         [65 FR 38190, June 20, 2000]        § 50.49 Environmental qualification of electric equipment important to safety for nuclear power plants.     (a) Each holder of or an applicant for a license for a nuclear power plant, other than a nuclear power plant for which the certifications required under § 50.82(a)(1) have been submitted, shall establish a program for qualifying the electric equipment defined in paragraph (b) of this section.    (b) Electric equipment important to safety covered by this section is:          (1) Safety-related electric equipment. 3    Engineers, Inc., 345 East 47th Street, New York, NY 10017.    (i) This equipment is that relied upon to remain functional during and following design basis events to ensure --    (A) The integrity of the reactor coolant pressure boundary;    (B) The capability to shut down the reactor and maintain it in a safe shutdown condition; or    (C) The capability to prevent or mitigate the consequences of accidents that could result in potential offsite exposures comparable to the guidelines in § 50.34(a)(1), § 50.67(b)(2), or §100.11 of this chapter, as applicable.    (ii) Design basis events are defined as conditions of normal operation, including anticipated operational occurrences, design basis accidents, external events, and natural phenomena for which the plant must be designed to ensure functions (b)(1)(i) (A) through (C) of this section.    (2) Nonsafety-related electric equipment whose failure under postulated environmental conditions could prevent satisfactory accomplishment of safety functions specified in subparagraphs (b)(1) (i) (A) through (C) of paragraph (b)(1) of this section by the safety-related equipment.          (3) Certain post-accident monitoring equipment. 4    (c) Requirements for (1) dynamic and seismic qualification of electric equipment important to safety, (2) protection of electric equipment important to safety against other natural phenomena and external events, and (3) environmental qualification of electric equipment important to safety located in a mild environment are not included within the scope of this section. A mild environment is an environment that would at no time be significantly more severe than the environment that would occur during normal plant operation, including anticipated operational occurrences.    (d) The applicant or licensee shall prepare a list of electric equipment important to safety covered by this section. In addition, the applicant or licensee shall include the information in paragraphs (d)(1), (2), and (3) of this section for this electric equipment important to safety in a qualification file. The applicant or licensee shall keep the list and information in the file current and retain the file in auditable form for the entire period during which the covered item is installed in the nuclear power plant or is stored for future use to permit verification that each item of electric equipment is important to safely meet the requirements of paragraph (j) of this section.    (1) The performance specifications under conditions existing during and following design basis accidents.    (2) The voltage, frequency, load, and other electrical characteristics for which the performance specified in accordance with paragraph (d)(1) of this section can be ensured.    (3) The environmental conditions, including temperature, pressure, humidity, radiation, chemicals, and submergence at the location where the equipment must perform as specified in accordance with paragraphs (d)(1) and (2) of this section.    (e) The electric equipment qualification program must include and be based on the following:    (1)  Temperature and pressure . The time-dependent temperature and pressure at the location of the electric equipment important to safety must be established for the most severe design basis accident during or following which this equipment is required to remain functional.    (2)  Humidity . Humidity during design basis accidents must be considered.    (3)  Chemical effects . The composition of chemicals used must be at least as severe as that resulting from the most limiting mode of plant operation (e.g., containment spray, emergency core cooling, or recirculation from containment sump). If the composition of the chemical spray can be affected by equipment malfunctions, the most severe chemical spray environment that results from a single failure in the spray system must be assumed.    (4)  Radiation . The radiation environment must be based on the type of radiation, the total dose expected during normal operation over the installed life of the equipment, and the radiation environment associated with the most severe design basis accident during or following which the equipment is required to remain functional, including the radiation resulting from recirculating fluids for equipment located near the recirculating lines and including dose-rate effects.    (5)  Aging . Equipment qualified by test must be preconditioned by natural or artificial (accelerated) aging to its end-of-installed life condition. Consideration must be given to all significant types of degradation which can have an effect on the functional capability of the equipment. If preconditioning to an end-of-installed life condition is not practicable, the equipment may be preconditioned to a shorter designated life. The equipment must be replaced or refurbished at the end of this designated life unless ongoing qualification demonstrates that the item has additional life.    (6)  Submergence  (if subject to being submerged).    (7)  Synergistic effects . Synergistic effects must be considered when these effects are believed to have a significant effect on equipment performance.    (8)  Margins . Margins must be applied to account for unquantified uncertainty, such as the effects of production variations and inaccuracies in test instruments. These margins are in addition to any conservatisms applied during the derivation of local environmental conditions of the equipment unless these conservatisms can be quantified and shown to contain appropriate margins.    (f) Each item of electric equipment important to safety must be qualified by one of the following methods:    (1) Testing an identical item of equipment under identical conditions or under similar conditions with a supporting analysis to show that the equipment to be qualified is acceptable.    (2) Testing a similar item of equipment with a supporting analysis to show that the equipment to be qualified is acceptable.    (3) Experience with identical or similar equipment under similar conditions with a supporting analysis to show that the equipment to be qualified is acceptable.    (4) Analysis in combination with partial type test data that supports the analytical assumptions and conclusions.    (g) Each holder of an operating license issued prior to February 22, 1983, shall, by May 20, 1983, identify the electric equipment important to safety within the scope of this section already qualified and submit a schedule for either the qualification to the provisions of this section or for the replacement of the remaining electric equipment important to safety within the scope of this section. This schedule must establish a goal of final environmental qualification of the electric equipment within the scope of this section by the end of the second refueling outage after March 31, 1982 or by March 31, 1985, whichever is earlier. The Director of the Office of Nuclear Reactor Regulation may grant requests for extensions of this deadline to a date no later than November 30, 1985, for specific pieces of equipment if these requests are filed on a timely basis and demonstrate good cause for the extension, such as procurement lead time, test complications, and installation problems. In exceptional cases, the Commission itself may consider and grant extensions beyond November 30, 1985, for completion of environmental qualification.    The schedule in this paragraph supersedes the June 30, 1982, deadline, or any other previously imposed date, for environmental qualification of electric equipment contained in certain nuclear power operating licenses.    (h) Each license shall notify the Commission as specified in § 50.4 of any significant equipment qualification problem that may require extension of the completion date provided in accordance with paragraph (g) of this section within 60 days of its discovery.    (i) Applicants for operating licenses granted after February 22, 1983, but prior to November 30, 1985, shall perform an analysis to ensure that the plant can be safely operated pending completion of equipment qualification required by this section. This analysis must be submitted, as specified in § 50.4, for consideration prior to the granting of an operating license and must include, where appropriate, consideration of:    (1) Accomplishing the safety function by some designated alternative equipment if the principal equipment has not been demonstrated to be fully qualified.    (2) The validity of partial test data in support of the original qualification.    (3) Limited use of administrative controls over equipment that has not been demonstrated to be fully qualified.    (4) Completion of the safety function prior to exposure to the accident environment resulting from a design basis event and ensuring that the subsequent failure of the equipment does not degrade any safety function or mislead the operator.    (5) No significant degradation of any safety function or misleading information to the operator as a result of failure of equipment under the accident environment resulting from a design basis event.    (j) A record of the qualification, including documentation in paragraph (d) of this section, must be maintained in an auditable form for the entire period during which the covered item is installed in the nuclear power plant or is stored for future use to permit verification that each item of electric equipment important to safety covered by this section:    (1) Is qualified for its application; and    (2) Meets its specified performance requirements when it is subjected to the conditions predicted to be present when it must perform its safety function up to the end of its qualified life.    (k) Applicants for and holders of operating licenses are not required to requalify electric equipment important to safety in accordance with the provisions of this section if the Commission has previously required qualification of that equipment in accordance with ""Guidelines for Evaluating Environmental Qualification of Class 1E Electrical Equipment in Operating Reactors,"" November 1979 (DOR Guidelines), or NUREG - 0588 (For Comment version), ""Interim Staff Position on Environmental Qualification of Safety-Related Electrical Equipment.""    (l) Replacement equipment must be qualified in accordance with the provisions of this section unless there are sound reasons to the contrary.

Upon determination that an application for a license meets the standards and requirements of the act and regulations, and that notifications, if any, to other agencies or bodies have been duly made, the Commission will issue a license, or if appropriate a construction permit, in such form and containing such conditions and limitations including technical specifications, as it deems appropriate and necessary.        § 50.51 Continuation of license.     (a) Each license will be issued for a fixed period of time to be specified in the license but in no case to exceed 40 years from date of issuance. Where the operation of a facility is involved, the Commission will issue the license for the term requested by the applicant or for the estimated useful life of the facility if the Commission determines that the estimated useful life is less than the term requested. Where construction of a facility is involved, the Commission may specify in the construction permit the period for which the license will be issued if approved pursuant to § 50.56. Licenses may be renewed by the Commission upon the expiration of the period. Renewal of operating licenses for nuclear power plants is governed by 10 CFR part 54. Application for termination of license is to be made pursuant to § 50.82.    (b) Each license for a facility that has permanently ceased operations, continues in effect beyond the expiration date to authorize ownership and possession of the production or utilization facility, until the Commission notifies the licensee in writing that the license is terminated. During such period of continued effectiveness the licensee shall --    (1) Take actions necessary to decommission and decontaminate the facility and continue to maintain the facility, including, where applicable, the storage, control and maintenance of the spent fuel, in a safe condition, and    (2) Conduct activities in accordance with all other restrictions applicable to the facility in accordance with the NRC regulations and the provisions of the specific 10 CFR part 50 license for the facility.

[21 FR 355, Jan. 19, 1956, as amended at 43 FR 6924, Feb. 17, 1978]        § 50.54 Conditions of licenses.     Whether stated therein or not, the following shall be deemed conditions in every license issued:    (a)(1) Each nuclear power plant or fuel reprocessing plant licensee subject to the quality assurance criteria in appendix B of this part shall implement, pursuant to § 50.34(b)(6)(ii) of this part, the quality assurance program described or referenced in the Safety Analysis Report, including changes to that report.    (2) Each licensee described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section shall, by June 10, 1983, submit to the appropriate NRC Regional Office shown in appendix D of part 20 of this chapter the current description of the quality assurance program it is implementing for inclusion in the Safety Analysis Report, unless there are no changes to the description previously accepted by NRC. This submittal must identify changes made to the quality assurance program description since the description was submitted to NRC. (Should a licensee need additional time beyond June 10, 1983 to submit its current quality assurance program description to NRC, it shall notify the appropriate NRC Regional Office in writing, explain why additional time is needed, and provide a schedule for NRC approval showing when its current quality assurance program description will be submitted.)    (3) Each licensee described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section may make a change to a previously accepted quality assurance program description included or referenced in the Safety Analysis Report without prior NRC approval, provided the change does not reduce the commitments in the program description as accepted by the NRC. Changes to the quality assurance program description that do not reduce the commitments must be submitted to the NRC in accordance with the requirements of Sec. 50.71(e). In addition to quality assurance program changes involving administrative improvements and clarifications, spelling corrections, punctuation, or editorial items, the following changes are not considered to be reductions in commitment:    (i) The use of a QA standard approved by the NRC which is more recent than the QA standard in the licensee's current QA program at the time of the change;    (ii) The use of a quality assurance alternative or exception approved by an NRC safety evaluation, provided that the bases of the NRC approval are applicable to the licensee's facility;    (iii) The use of generic organizational position titles that clearly denote the position function, supplemented as necessary by descriptive text, rather than specific titles;    (iv) The use of generic organizational charts to indicate functional relationships, authorities, and responsibilities, or, alternately, the use of descriptive text;    (v) The elimination of quality assurance program information that duplicates language in quality assurance regulatory guides and quality assurance standards to which the licensee is committed; and    (vi) Organizational revisions that ensure that persons and organizations performing quality assurance functions continue to have the requisite authority and organizational freedom, including sufficient independence from cost and schedule when opposed to safety considerations.    (4) Changes to the quality assurance program description that do reduce the commitments must be submitted to the NRC and receive NRC approval prior to implementation, as follows:    (i) Changes made to the quality assurance program description as presented in the Safety Analysis Report or in a topical report must be submitted as specified in Sec. 50.4.    (ii) The submittal of a change to the Safety Analysis Report quality assurance program description must include all pages affected by that change and must be accompanied by a forwarding letter identifying the change, the reason for the change, and the basis for concluding that the revised program incorporating the change continues to satisfy the criteria of appendix B of this part and the Safety Analysis Report quality assurance program description commitments previously accepted by the NRC (the letter need not provide the basis for changes that correct spelling, punctuation, or editorial items).    (iii) A copy of the forwarding letter identifying the change must be maintained as a facility record for three years.    (iv) Changes to the quality assurance program description included or referenced in the Safety Analysis Report shall be regarded as accepted by the Commission upon receipt of a letter to this effect from the appropriate reviewing office of the Commission or 60 days after submittal to the Commission, whichever occurs first.    (b) No right to the special nuclear material shall be conferred by the license except as may be defined by the license.    (c) Neither the license, nor any right thereunder, nor any right to utilize or produce special nuclear material shall be transferred, assigned, or disposed of in any manner, either voluntarily or involuntarily, directly or indirectly, through transfer of control of the license to any person, unless the Commission shall, after securing full information, find that the transfer is in accordance with the provisions of the act and give its consent in writing.    (d) The license shall be subject to suspension and to the rights of recapture of the material or control of the facility reserved to the Commission under section 108 of the act in a state of war or national emergency declared by Congress.    (e) The license shall be subject to revocation, suspension, modification, or amendment for cause as provided in the act and regulations, in accordance with the procedures provided by the act and regulations.    (f) The licensee shall at any time before expiration of the license, upon request of the Commission, submit, as specified in § 50.4, written statements, signed under oath or affirmation, to enable the Commission to determine whether or not the license should be modified, suspended, or revoked. Except for information sought to verify licensee compliance with the current licensing basis for that facility, the NRC must prepare the reason or reasons for each information request prior to issuance to ensure that the burden to be imposed on respondents is justified in view of the potential safety significance of the issue to be addressed in the requested information. Each such justification provided for an evaluation performed by the NRC staff must be approved by the Executive Director for Operations or his or her designee prior to issuance of the request.    (g) The issuance or existence of the license shall not be deemed to waive, or relieve the licensee from compliance with, the antitrust laws, as specified in subsection 105a of the Act. In the event that the licensee should be found by a court of competent jurisdiction to have violated any provision of such antitrust laws in the conduct of the licensed activity, the Commission may suspend or revoke the license or take such other action with respect to it as shall be deemed necessary.    (h) The license shall be subject to the provisions of the Act now or hereafter in effect and to all rules, regulations, and orders of the Commission. The terms and conditions of the license shall be subject to amendment, revision, or modification, by reason of amendments of the Act or by reason of rules, regulations, and orders issued in accordance with the terms of the act.    (i) Except as provided in § 55.13 of this chapter, the licensee may not permit the manipulation of the controls of any facility by anyone who is not a licensed operator or senior operator as provided in part 55 of this chapter.    (i - 1) Within three months after issuance of an operating license, the licensee shall have in effect an operator requalification program which must as a minimum, meet the requirements of § 55.59(c) of this chapter. Notwithstanding the provisions of § 50.59, the licensee may not, except as specifically authorized by the Commission decrease the scope of an approved operator requalification program.    (j) Apparatus and mechanisms other than controls, the operation of which may affect the reactivity or power level of a reactor shall be manipulated only with the knowledge and consent of an operator or senior operator licensed pursuant to part 55 of this chapter present at the controls.    (k) An operator or senior operator licensed pursuant to part 55 of this chapter shall be present at the controls at all times during the operation of the facility.    (l) The licensee shall designate individuals to be responsible for directing the licensed activities of licensed operators.

(ii) Each licensee shall have at its site a person holding a senior operator license for all fueled units at the site who is assigned responsibility for overall plant operation at all times there is fuel in any unit. If a single senior operator does not hold a senior operator license on all fueled units at the site, then the licensee must have at the site two or more senior operators, who in combination are licensed as senior operators on all fueled units.    (iii) When a nuclear power unit is in an operational mode other than cold shutdown or refueling, as defined by the unit's technical specifications, each licensee shall have a person holding a senior operator license for the nuclear power unit in the control room at all times. In addition to this senior operator, for each fueled nuclear power unit, a licensed operator or senior operator shall be present at the controls at all times.    (iv) Each licensee shall have present, during alteration of the core of a nuclear power unit (including fuel loading or transfer), a person holding a senior operator license or a senior operator license limited to fuel handling to directly supervise the activity and, during this time, the licensee shall not assign other duties to this person.    (3) Licensees who cannot meet the January 1, 1984 deadline must submit by October 1, 1983 a request for an extension to the Director of the Office of Nuclear Regulation and demonstrate good cause for the request.    (n) The licensee shall not, except as authorized pursuant to a construction permit, make any alteration in the facility constituting a change from the technical specifications previously incorporated in a license or construction permit pursuant to § 50.36 of this part.    (o) Primary reactor containments for water cooled power reactors, other than facilities for which the certifications required under § 50.82(a)(1) have been submitted, shall be subject to the requirements set forth in appendix J to this part.    (p)(1) The licensee shall prepare and maintain safeguards contingency plan procedures in accordance with appendix C of part 73 of this chapter for effecting the actions and decisions contained in the Responsibility Matrix of the safeguards contingency plan. The licensee may make no change which would decrease the effectiveness of a security plan, or guard training and qualification plan, prepared pursuant to § 50.34(c) or part 73 of this chapter, or of the first four categories of information (Background, Generic Planning Base, Licensee Planning Base, Responsibility Matrix) contained in a licensee safeguards contingency plan prepared pursuant to § 50.34(d) or part 73 of this chapter, as applicable, without prior approval of the Commission. A licensee desiring to make such a change shall submit an application for an amendment to the licensee's license pursuant to § 50.90.    (2) The licensee may make changes to the plans referenced in paragraph (p)(1) of this section, without prior Commission approval if the changes do not decrease the safeguards effectiveness of the plan. The licensee shall maintain records of changes to the plans made without prior Commission approval for a period of three years from the date of the change, and shall submit, as specified in § 50.4, a report containing a description of each change within two months after the change is made. Prior to the safeguards contingency plan being put into effect, the licensee shall have:    (i) All safeguards capabilities specified in the safeguards contingency plan available and functional,    (ii) Detailed procedures developed according to appendix C to part 73 available at the licensee's site, and    (iii) All appropriate personnel trained to respond to safeguards incidents as outlined in the plan and specified in the detailed procedures.    (3) The licensee shall provide for the development, revision, implementation, and maintenance of its safeguards contingency plan. The licensee shall ensure that all program elements are reviewed by individuals independent of both security program management and personnel who have direct responsibility for implementation of the security program either:    (i) At intervals not to exceed 12 months, or    (ii) As necessary, based on an assessment by the licensee against performance indicators, and as soon as reasonably practicable after a change occurs in personnel, procedures, equipment, or facilities that potentially could adversely affect security, but no longer than 12 months after the change. In any case, all elements of the safeguards contingency plan must be reviewed at least once every 24 months.    (4) The review must include a review and audit of safeguards contingency procedures and practices, an audit of the security system testing and maintenance program, and a test of the safeguards systems along with commitments established for response by local law enforcement authorities. The results of the review and audit, along with recommendations for improvements, must be documented, reported to the licensee's corporate and plant management, and kept available at the plant for inspection for a period of 3 years.    (q) A licensee authorized to possess and operate a nuclear power reactor shall follow and maintain in effect emergency plans which meet the standards in § 50.47(b) and the requirements in appendix E of this part. A licensee authorized to possess and/or operate a research reactor or a fuel facility shall follow and maintain in effect emergency plans which meet the requirements in appendix E to this part. The licensee shall retain the emergency plan and each change that decreases the effectiveness of the plan as a record until the Commission terminates the license for the nuclear power reactor. The nuclear power reactor licensee may make changes to these plans without Commission approval only if the changes do not decrease the effectiveness of the plans and the plans, as changed, continue to meet the standards of § 50.47(b) and the requirements of appendix E to this part. The research reactor and/or the fuel facility licensee may make changes to these plans without Commission approval only if these changes do not decrease the effectiveness of the plans and the plans, as changed, continue to meet the requirements of appendix E to this part. This nuclear power reactor, research reactor, or fuel facility licensee shall retain a record of each change to the emergency plan made without prior Commission approval for a period of three years from the date of the change. Proposed changes that decrease the effectiveness of the approved emergency plans may not be implemented without application to and approval by the Commission. The licensee shall submit, as specified in § 50.4, a report of each proposed change for approval. If a change is made without approval, the licensee shall submit, as specified in § 50.4, a report of each change within 30 days after the change is made.    (r) Each licensee who is authorized to possess and/or operate a research or test reactor facility with an authorized power level greater than or equal to 2 MW thermal, under a licensee of the type specified in § 50.21(c), shall submit emergency plans complying with 10 CFR part 50, appendix E, to the Director of the Office of Nuclear Reactor Regulation for approval by September 7, 1982. Each licensee who is authorized to possess and/or operate a research or test reactor facility with an authorized power level less than 2 MW thermal, under a license of the type specified in § 50.21(c), shall submit emergency plans complying with 10 CFR part 50, appendix E, to the Director of the Office of Nuclear Reactor Regulation for approval by November 3, 1982.

This  Supplement was prepared because of technological advances in decommissioning operations,  experience gained by licensees, and changes made to NRC regulations since the  1988 GEIS. This Supplement updates the information provided in the 1988  GEIS. It is intended to be used to evaluate environmental impacts during the decommissioning  of nuclear power reactors as residual radioactivity at the site is reduced to  levels that allow for termination of the NRC license. This Supplement addresses  only the decommissioning of nuclear power reactorslicensed by the NRC. It updates  the sections of the 1988 GEIS relating to pressurized water reactors, boiling  water reactors, and multiple reactor stations. It goes beyond the 1988 GEIS to  explicitly consider high-temperature gas-cooled reactors and fast breeder reactors.  This document can be considered a stand-alone document for power reactor facilities  such that readers should not need to refer back to the 1988 GEIS. The environmental  impacts described in this Supplement supercede those described for power reactor  facilities in the 1988 GEIS.  The scope of this Supplement is based on the  decommissioning activities performed to remove radioactive materials from structures,  systems, and components from the time that the licensee certifies that it has  permanently ceased power operations until the license is terminated. The scope  of the document was determined through public scoping meetings and meetings with  other Federal agencies and the nuclear industry. An evaluation process was then  developed to determine environmental impacts from nuclear power reactor facilities  that are being decommissioned. The evaluation process involved determining the  specific activities that occur during reactor decommissioning and obtaining data  from site visits and from licensees at reactor facilities currently being decommissioned.  The data obtained from the sites were analyzed and then evaluated against a list  of variables that defined the parameters for facilities that are currently operating  but which will one day be decommissioned. This evaluation resulted in a range  of impacts for each environmental issue that may be used for comparison by licensees  that are or will be decommissioning their facilities.              Privacy Policy  |    Site Disclaimer    Last revised Monday, June 23, 2003

These opportunities bring new challenges that require the reevaluation of current information dissemination programs to take advantage of new opportunities and minimize disruption of public access during this period of rapid change. In August, 1995, the U.S. Government Printing Office (GPO), at the direction of Congress, initiated a cooperative study to identify measures necessary for a successful transition to a more electronic Federal Depository Library Program (FDLP). The study was concluded in March 1996, and a draft report was issued in order to provide an extended opportunity for public comment. This is the final report to Congress on the FDLP Study. In order to complete the study and prepare this report, it was necessary to establish definitions to clarify the meaning of several important words and phrases. These definitions are provided on page v of this report. To implement the study, the Public Printer established a working group consisting of representatives from GPO, appropriate Congressional committees, the Congressional Research Service (CRS), the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA), the Federal Publishers Committee (FPC), the Interagency Council on Printing and Publication Services (ICPPS), the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts, and the depository library community. He also invited a number of organizations to identify representatives to serve as advisors to the working group. Comments from advisors are provided in Attachments J through N. A substantial amount of useful information was gathered and numerous issues and alternatives were identified and examined during the course of the study. These are summarized in this report. A number of specific tasks were identified to provide information and alternatives for consideration. The preparation of the task force reports and the review of public comments resulting from their dissemination were the primary fact-finding activities of the study. The task force reports are included in Attachment D; they were the product of a substantial amount of effort on the part of the task leaders and participants. Separately, a document entitled the Electronic Federal Depository Library Program: Transition Plan, FY 1996 - FY 1998 was developed by GPO and included with its FY 1997 appropriations request. Public comments in response to this document also provided useful information to the study participants, and led directly to the development of the Federal Depository Library Program: Information Dissemination and Access Strategic Plan, FY 1996 - FY 2001, included with this report as Exhibit 1. The Strategic Plan proposes four ways in which GPO can bring electronic information into the FDLP: GPO can identify, describe and link the public to the wealth of distributed Government information maintained at Government electronic information services for free public use. GPO can establish reimbursable agreements with agencies that provide fee-based Government electronic information services in order to provide free public access to their information through the FDLP.  -   -  GPO can ""ride"" agency requisitions and pay for depository copies of tangible electronic information products, such as CD-ROM titles, even if they are not produced or procured through GPO. GPO can obtain from agencies electronic source files for information the agencies do not wish to disseminate through their own Government electronic information services. These files can be made available through the GPO Access services or disseminated to depository libraries in CD-ROM or other tangible format.  -  Section V, Policy Issues That Impact Publishing Agencies, GPO, NARA, Depository Libraries, the Public and the Private Sector, summarizes the major issues identified in the course of the study process. While many of these issues are not new, this study has examined the issues in the new context of the rapid shift of the FDLP into a more electronic program. The major conclusions of the study are summarized below: Scope of the FDLP: There is widespread interest in expanding the content of the program to make it more comprehensive, and a great deal of optimism that the rapid expansion of agency electronic publishing offers cost-effective options to do so. Nevertheless, the highest priority remains the retention of information content that historically has been in the program and is rapidly leaving it as agencies move from print to electronic publishing or eliminate Government information products to save costs. Notification and Compliance: The historical program relied heavily on the ability of the FDLP to obtain material as it was printed or procured through GPO. With the increasing emphasis on electronic dissemination and decreasing compliance with statutory requirements for agencies to print through GPO, identifying and obtaining information for the FDLP is becoming increasingly difficult. There must be new means to inform agencies of their responsibilities and to ensure compliance with agency FDLP obligations. There must be effective means for all three branches of Government to notify GPO of their intent to: (1) initiate, (2) substantially modify, or (3) terminate Government information products. This includes Government information products in all formats, including information available from Government electronic information services, such as agency World Wide Web sites. Permanent Access to Authentic Information: The FDLP has the responsibility for providing permanent public access to the official Government information products disseminated through the program.1 Historically, permanent access has been the role of the regional depository libraries, and this has been a cost-effective means of ensuring that Government information products remained available to the public indefinitely. Permanent access also is an essential element of the electronic depository library program, but it will be more difficult to attain. To ensure permanent public access to official electronic Government information products, all of the institutional program stakeholders (information producing agencies, GPO, depository libraries and NARA) must cooperate to establish authenticity, provide persistent identification and description of Government information products, and establish appropriate arrangements for its continued accessibility. This includes identification and implementation of standard formats for FDLP dissemination2 and providing for the technological currency of the electronic information products available at GPO for remote access. In the case of tangible information products, permanent access will remain a  Permanent access is required by 44 U.S.C. 1911: ""Depository libraries not served by a regional depository library, or that are regional depository libraries themselves, shall retain Government publications permanently in either printed form or in microfacsimile form, except superseded publications or those issued later in bound form which may be discarded as authorized by the Superintendent of Documents."" Additional conclusions related to the requirement for assessment of standards for creation and dissemination of electronic Government information products are provided on the next page. 2  1  ii   responsibility of regional depository libraries, while in the case of remotely accessible information products, it will be the responsibility of GPO, as the administrator of the FDLP, to coordinate a distributed system that provides continuous, permanent public access. Locator Services: Together, the Cataloging and Indexing Program required by 44 U.S.C. 1710 and 1711 and the Locator Services required by 44 U.S.C. 4101 provide the statutory basis for GPO to assist depository libraries and the public to identify and obtain access to the full range of Government information. In a distributed environment, where libraries and users often access Government electronic information services rather than local collections, tools for identifying and locating information will be critical components of an effective program. Timetable for Implementation: The Transition Plan, submitted with the GPO FY 1997 appropriations request, projected an ambitious, two and one-half year schedule for conversion to a more electronic FDLP (FY 1996 to FY 1998). Input from publishing agencies and depository libraries indicates a five to seven year transition would be more realistic and cost-effective since it would allow GPO to convert to electronic information at the same pace as publishing agencies can produce it and depository libraries can absorb it. It will be substantially more costly for GPO to convert agency print publications to electronic formats than it will be to work in partnership with the agencies, assisting them in accelerating their own electronic publishing initiatives. Consequently, the Strategic Plan attached to the report as Exhibit 1 proposes a transition period of FY 1996 through FY 2001. Assessment of Standards for Creation and Dissemination of Electronic Government Information Products: For the successful implementation of a more electronic FDLP, the Congress, GPO and the library community must have additional information about future agency publishing plans, as well as an expert evaluation of the cost-effectiveness and usefulness of various electronic formats that may be utilized for depository library dissemination or access. A central implementation issue is the identification and utilization of standards for creation and dissemination of electronic Government information products. These standards would enhance access to and use of Government information by both the Government and the public. The Government produces an enormous quantity and variety of information. The standards best suited for one type of data may be substantially less suited, or even entirely inappropriate, for another. Consequently, there is no single standard in which all Government information products can, or should, be created or disseminated. Nevertheless, it is in the best interests of the Government, and those who use Government information, to achieve a greater degree of standardization than now exists, and to develop recommended standards for each major type of Government information product in order to facilitate the exchange and use of that information. To accomplish this, it is first necessary to know the range of formats Federal agencies currently use in the creation and dissemination of information and to assess the de facto or actual standards that are in use for each major type of data. It also is necessary to identify areas where there is no standardization, or such limited standardization that the effect is virtually the same. Finally, it would be useful to evaluate standards utilized by private sector and other non-governmental publishers. This information will provide the basis for an assessment, in consultation with the depository library community, of the usefulness and cost-effectiveness of various electronic formats for depository library dissemination or access. It also will be the basis for a dialog with the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA), the National Commission on Libraries and Information Science (NCLIS), the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), and others with an interest in establishing and promulgating Government-wide standards for information creation and dissemination. GPO is proposing to accomplish this data gathering and evaluation through a joint effort with NCLIS. As an independent Federal agency established to advise the President and the Congress on national policies related to library and information services adequate to meet the needs of the people of the United States, NCLIS is uniquely situated to coordinate this activity. While substantial changes are already underway, this assessment of standards for creation and dissemination of electronic Government iii   information products should proceed as rapidly as possible in order to assure a successful and costeffective transition to a more electronic FDLP. Cost of Electronic Information Dissemination: While there are many benefits inherent in the use of electronic information, including more timely and broader public access, there is no conclusive data at this time to support the assertion that it will result in significant savings to the program as a whole in the next few years. Based on comments received, electronic dissemination and access will shift the costs among the program participants. For example, GPO will incur additional, recurring costs to provide permanent public access through its electronic information services, as will other Government agencies that maintain information products through their own services. Costs for migration can be minimized by the adoption and use of open systems standards through the entire life cycle of information products--from the time the original source files are created by the publishing agencies to final preservation by NARA. Similarly, depository libraries and their users will have to pay to print, or purchase printed copies of, information that is needed in print, but is no longer disseminated in the format through the FDLP. At the same time, depository libraries will have to provide specialized staff training, public access workstations, software and the related services necessary to connect the public to remotely accessible Government electronic information services. GPO will continue to monitor the technological capabilities of the depository libraries to provide cost-effective public access to electronic Government information products, particularly as it relates to the standards utilized by agencies in the creation and dissemination of electronic Government information products. GPO also will begin to monitor the costs to users for printing, downloading and similar services using depository library equipment. GPO and other study participants have noted that there is a need for more in-depth and concrete data on the life cycle costs to the Government for creating, disseminating and providing permanent access to its information products, to depository libraries for providing public access to them, and to the public for using them. However, the transition to electronic dissemination of Government information is still in its early stages, so it is doubtful that reliable and conclusive data on life cycle costs could be gathered in this rapidly evolving period. Nevertheless, the assessment of standards proposed in this report is an essential first step toward the ultimate goal of collecting and analyzing information life cycle costs. It will provide a basis for further consultation with the library community and for discussions with publishing agencies concerning the appropriate standards for cost-effective dissemination of Government information products in formats appropriate to the needs of users and the intended usage. The assessment also will provide valuable information to Congress for the future development of appropriate and cost-effective Government information policies and programs. Legislative Changes: Substantial changes in the FDLP already are underway within the context of the existing statute. Nevertheless, certain key legislative changes could be made in order to assure a successful and cost-effective transition to a more electronic FDLP. These changes are discussed in the report on Task 6 (Attachment D-5) and many of them are reflected in the preceding conclusions.  iv   DEFINITIONS The following definitions are provided to clarify the meaning of several important words and phrases as used in this report. Unless otherwise noted, in this report ""Government"" always refers to the Government of the United States. ""Agency"" means any Federal Government department, including any military department, independent regulatory agency, Government corporation, Government controlled corporation, or other establishment in the executive, legislative, or judicial branch. ""Depository library"" means a library, designated under the provisions of 44 U.S.C. Chapter 19, which maintains tangible Government information products for use by the general public, offers professional assistance in locating and using Government information, and provides local capability for the general public to access Government electronic information services. The ""Federal Depository Library Program"" is a nationwide geographically-dispersed system, established under the provisions of 44 U.S.C. Chapter 19 and administered by the Superintendent of Documents, consisting of libraries acting in partnership with the United States Government for the purpose of enabling the general public to have local access to Federal Government information at no cost. ""Government electronic information service"" means the system or method by which an agency or its authorized agent provides public access to Government information products via a telecommunications network. ""Government information"" means Government publications, or other Government information products, regardless of form or format, created or compiled by employees of a Government agency, or at Government expense, or as required by law.1 ""Government information product"" means a discrete set of Government information, either conveyed in a tangible physical format including electronic media, or made publicly accessible via a Government electronic information service. ""Migration"" means both: (1) the periodic refreshing or transfer of Government information products from one medium to another in order to minimize loss of information due to physical deterioration of storage media and (2) the reformatting of information to avoid technological obsolescence due to software or platform dependence. ""Permanent access"" means that Government information products within the scope of the FDLP remain available for continuous, no fee public access through the program.2 For emphasis, the phrase ""permanent public access"" is sometimes used with the same definition.  1 2  ""Government information"" has a significantly broader meaning in the context of Federal records.  Permanent access is required by 44 U.S.C. 1911: ""Depository libraries not served by a regional depository library, or that are regional depository libraries themselves, shall retain Government publications permanently in either printed form or in microfacsimile form, except superseded publications or those issued later in bound form..."" In the case of tangible information products, permanent access remains a responsibility of regional depository libraries, while in the case of remotely accessible Government information products, it is a responsibility of GPO to coordinate a distributed system that provides continuous, permanent public access.  v   ""Preservation"" means that official records of the Federal Government, including Government information products made available through the FDLP, which have been determined to have sufficient historical or other value to warrant being held and maintained in trust for future generations of Americans, are retained by the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA).  vi   Report to the Congress STUDY TO IDENTIFY MEASURES NECESSARY FOR A SUCCESSFUL TRANSITION TO A MORE ELECTRONIC FEDERAL DEPOSITORY LIBRARY PROGRAM I. INTRODUCTION  Emerging technologies afford tremendous opportunities for improved and enhanced public access to Government information. These opportunities bring new challenges that require the reevaluation of current information dissemination programs to take advantage of new opportunities and minimize disruption of public access during this period of rapid change. The advent of electronic dissemination has brought with it a host of new problems and concerns unheard of, or less prevalent, in the paper-based model of Government information dissemination. In many cases, technology has outpaced efforts of the Government to accommodate and adjust to its development. Several legislative and administrative initiatives over the last decade, including the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, the Government Printing Office Electronic Information Access Enhancement Act of 1993, and the 1994 revision of OMB Circular A-130, have attempted to address and/or advance the shift in Government dissemination methods from paper to electronic. The U.S. Government Printing Office (GPO), at the direction of Congress, initiated a cooperative study to identify measures necessary for a successful transition to a more electronic Federal Depository Library Program (FDLP). The study began in August 1995 and involved representatives from the legislative, executive, and judicial branches of the Government, as well as the depository library community, the national library associations, the information industry, and other appropriate Government and public entities. In the Senate Report 104-114 to accompany H.R. 1854, the Legislative Branch Appropriations Act of 1996, the Committee stated that: Public access to Government information is a basic right of every American citizen. The Committee recognizes the critically important service that the Government Printing Office and participating libraries in the Federal Depository Library Program provide to citizens throughout the country in furnishing timely, equitable access to Government information. While acknowledging that recent advances in technology provide new opportunities for public access to Government information, the report stated that without careful analysis, planning, and a strongly coordinated effort, improvements to the FDLP would be delayed, costly, and might compromise the public's right to Government information. Since the increasing utilization of electronic technologies in support of dissemination programs by all three branches of Government necessitates analysis, planning and a probable restructuring of the FDLP, the Committee directed the Public Printer to initiate a study that: Examines the functions and services of the Federal Depository Library Program; Surveys current technological capabilities of the participating libraries in the Federal Depository Library Program; Surveys current and future information dissemination plans of executive branch agencies;  -   -  Examines and suggests improvements for agency compliance of relevant laws, regulations, and policies regarding Government information dissemination; Identifies measures necessary to ensure a successful transition to a more electronically based program; Identifies the possible expansion of the array of Federal information products and services made available to participating libraries; and, Ensures the most cost effective program to the taxpayer.  -  -  -  The Senate report also directed that the study include a strategic plan that could assist the Congress in redefining a new and strengthened Federal information dissemination policy and program. That plan is attached as Exhibit 1. The final Study Report was to be made available to Congress by March 1996. House Report 104-212 to accompany H.R. 1854 concurred with the Senate recommendation, and Public Law 104-53 (109 Stat. 533), the Legislative Branch Appropriations Act, 1996, included the following provision: Sec. 210. The fiscal year 1997 budget submission of the Public Printer to the Congress for the Government Printing Office shall include appropriations requests and recommendations to the Congress that(1) are consistent with the strategic plan included in the technological study performed by the Public Printer pursuant to Senate Report 104-114; (2) assure substantial progress toward maximum use of electronic information dissemination technologies by all departments, agencies, and other entities of the Government with respect to the Federal Depository Library Program and information dissemination generally; and (3) are formulated so as to require that any department, agency, or other entity of the Government that does not make such progress shall bear from its own resources the cost of its information dissemination by other than electronic means. Appropriate sections from the House and Senate reports and from Public Law 104-53 are included in this report as Attachment A. The provision from Section 210 of Public Law 104-53 resulted in the development and submission of the Electronic Federal Depository Library Program: Transition Plan, FY 1996 - FY 1998 (Transition Plan) with the GPO FY 1997 appropriations request. Public comments in response to the Transition Plan led directly to the development of the Federal Depository Library Program: Information Dissemination and Access Strategic Plan, FY 1996 - FY 2001 (Strategic Plan), included with this report as Exhibit 1. The FDLP Study was concluded in March 1996, and a draft report was issued in order to provide an extended opportunity for public comment. This document is the final report to Congress on the FDLP Study. In order to complete the study and prepare this report, it was necessary to establish definitions to clarify the meaning of several important words and phrases. These definitions are provided on page v of this report.  II.  METHODOLOGY Page 2   To implement the study, the Public Printer established a working group consisting of representatives from GPO, appropriate Congressional committees, the Congressional Research Service (CRS), the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA), the Federal Publishers Committee (FPC), the Interagency Council on Printing and Publication Services (ICPPS), the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts, and the depository library community. He also invited a number of organizations to identify representatives to serve as advisors to the working group. A complete roster of working group members, advisors and GPO support staff is provided as Attachment B. Following the initial meeting of the working group, a number of tasks were identified to provide information and alternatives for consideration. These tasks included: A technical analysis by a Federally-funded research and development center (FFRDC) to determine the most cost-effective way to provide electronic access through the FDLP; Identification of relevant laws, regulations, and policies regarding Government information dissemination, and evaluation of agency compliance in so far as they affect the FDLP; Identification, acquisition, and evaluation of available information relevant to the study; Identification of current and ongoing electronic information dissemination activities for the FDLP; Evaluation of incentives for publishing agencies to migrate from print products to electronic format; Evaluation of current laws governing the FDLP and recommendation of any legislative changes necessary for a successful transition to a more electronic program; A survey of Federal agencies to identify CD-ROM titles not currently included in the FDLP and reasons for both participation and non-participation in the program; Case studies of specific Federal electronic dissemination initiatives with respect to their costs, and impact on public access to information through the FDLP in comparison with present methods of dissemination; Evaluation of issues pertaining to inclusion in electronic formats of materials traditionally not included in the FDLP in either paper or microfiche; and A review of Federal programs permitting or requiring the sale of information to recover costs, and the effects on efforts to assure free public access through the FDLP.  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  The complete task list which identifies task leaders and specific case studies is included as Attachment C. Task force reports, including reports for each case study, were distributed to study participants and posted electronically to major Government document listservs for public comment. Task leaders reviewed the comments received and, when appropriate, incorporated these remarks into the final reports. The final task force reports are included as Attachments D-1 to D-15. At Congressional direction, the FFRDC technical analysis was deferred until the information gathering from the other study tasks could be completed. The letter from the Joint Committee on Printing denying the initial GPO request for the FFRDC analysis is included as Attachment D-1. Task 2, which involved identification of laws, regulations, and policies regarding Government information dissemination, resulted in the compilation of more than 400 pages of statutory text. Rather than include the complete text Page 3   of this report, the index for this compilation is included as Attachment D-2. Task 4, which identified current GPO electronic initiatives, was accomplished through a series of demonstrations and presentations given to working and advisory group members; therefore, no report for this task is included in the attachments.  III.  PRINCIPLES FOR FEDERAL GOVERNMENT INFORMATION  The FDLP Study brought together representatives from a variety of organizations who share an interest in the continued dissemination of, and access to, Federal Government information through the Federal Depository Library Program. Despite differing viewpoints, agendas and responsibilities, study participants did reach consensus on several basic principles for Federal Government information. Over the years, these principles have been expressed by a wide variety of organizations many times and in many different ways. Last year, the National Commission on Libraries and Information Science (NCLIS) republished its principles for comment in the June 9, 1995 issue of the Federal Register. The NCLIS principles are included as Attachment E. The principles below, which are derived from the NCLIS principles, served as the underlying foundation for all study group discussion and activities. Principle 1: The Public Has the Right of Access to Government Information  A cornerstone of every democratic society is the public's right of access to Government information. Open and uninhibited access to Government information ensures that the public has the opportunity to monitor and participate in the full range of Government activities. As Thomas Jefferson said in 1816, ""If we are to guard against ignorance and remain free, it is the responsibility of every American to be informed."" Access to Government information, except where restricted by law, is a basic right of every American citizen. It should not be format dependent, nor should it be compromised by the imposition of excessive fees, time delays or copyright-like restrictions imposed by the Government in a manner that hinders timely access, use or redissemination. Principle 2: The Government Has an Obligation to Disseminate and Provide Broad Public Access to Its Information  The Government should not only allow public participation in the democratic process by providing access to its information, but should encourage public participation and use of Government information through proactive dissemination efforts that ensure timely and equitable public access. This principle was the basis for the establishment of the Federal Depository Library Program more than a century ago. It also is supported by hundreds of other Government statutes which prohibit the copyright of Federal information, mandate affirmative public dissemination of such information and assign dissemination functions to a variety of Federal agencies and Government-wide clearinghouses. This responsibility entails providing public access to Government information in such a way that even those citizens without special equipment or training can find, access, and use it. This principle covers access to both Government information products and the underlying data from which they are created.  Page 4   Principle 3:  The Government Has an Obligation to Guarantee the Authenticity and Integrity of Its Information  Government information is used in many ways, some of which affect the continued health and livelihood of the American public. Any corruption of Government information poses a serious and real threat to the common good. Therefore the Government has an obligation to protect its citizens by guaranteeing to the maximum extent possible the authenticity and integrity of its information. Due to the ease in which it currently is possible to manipulate electronic source files, the obligation to provide long range assurances of authenticity will become increasingly important as more Government information moves to electronic formats. Principle 4: The Government Has an Obligation to Preserve Its Information  Government information is part of our national heritage. It documents the fundamental rights of American citizens, the actions of Federal officials in all three branches of our Government, and the characteristics of our national experience. Therefore, it is a Government obligation to guarantee the preservation of Government information for future generations of Americans. This principle applies to Government information that has been determined to have sufficient historical value or that provides significant evidence of the organizations, functions, policies, decisions, procedures, operations or activities of the Government. Despite changing times and technologies, public access to these types of Government information in a meaningful format must be maintained in perpetuity to ensure the continued accountability of the Government to its present and future citizens. Principle 5: Government Information Created or Compiled by Government Employees or at Government Expense Should Remain in the Public Domain  Except where exempted by law, Government information created or compiled at Government expense or by Government employees as part of their official duties, regardless of the format in which it is published, is in the public domain. The Government is precluded by 17 U.S.C. Chapter 1 from holding copyright protection for its published and/or unpublished works. This prohibition on copyright should not be undermined by the Government's imposition of copyright-like restrictions on the use or reuse of Government information, such as the imposition of royalties, establishment of exclusive distribution arrangements, or denying timely access to underlying data.  IV.  MISSION AND GOALS FOR THE FEDERAL DEPOSITORY LIBRARY PROGRAM The mission of the Federal Depository Library Program is to provide equitable, efficient, timely and dependable no-fee public access to Federal Government information within the scope of the program.1  MISSION:  The Government's transition to electronic dissemination requires improving the way the Federal Depository Library Program operates, redefining terms taken for granted in the print-on-paper publishing  For purposes of this report, Government information is defined as Government publications, or other Government information products, regardless of form or format, created or compiled by Government employees, or at Government expense, or as required by law. The scope of the FDLP is Government information products, except those determined by their issuing agency to be required for official use only or for strictly administrative or operational purposes which have no public interest or educational value and information classified for reasons of national security. A more complete list of definitions begins on page v at the front of this report.  1  Page 5   environment, finding ways to use new technologies both to sustain and increase the amount of information in the FDLP, and exploring new methods for the delivery of information in timely, useful formats. However, the underlying mission of the program remains unchanged -- to provide equitable, efficient, timely and dependable no-fee public access to Federal Government information products that fall within the scope of the program. Fulfilling this mission in the rapidly-changing world of electronic information requires the renewed and expanded cooperation of Federal publishers, the Government Printing Office, depository libraries, the National Archives and Records Administration and other organizations both public and private that are committed to the dissemination of, and public access to, Government information. The goals for an electronic FDLP reaffirm the traditional objectives of the program with a new emphasis that reflects the increasing amount of Government information in electronic formats. GOAL 1: Ensure that the public has equitable, no-fee, local public access to Government information products through a centrally managed, statutorily authorized network of geographically-dispersed depository libraries.  This includes ensuring that depository libraries provide public access workstations and the related services necessary to connect the public to remotely accessible Government electronic information services and sufficient to assure equitable access to that information. GOAL 2: Use new information technologies to improve public access to Government information and expand the array of Government information products and Government electronic information services made available through the FDLP.  This includes: (1) ensuring that Government information products traditionally included in the FDLP in print or microform remain available through the FDLP when converted to electronic format by publishing agencies; (2) converting appropriate Government information products to an electronic format when a suitable electronic format is not available from the publishing agency and conversion is a cost-effective means to disseminate the information to depository libraries; and (3) acquiring, or obtaining access for depository libraries to, electronic Government information products which have not been included in the FDLP in print or microform, but which can now be cost-effectively included through remotely accessible Government electronic information services. GOAL 3: Provide Government information products in formats appropriate to the needs of users and the intended usage.  This includes establishing a reasonable number of standard formats for electronic information disseminated through the FDLP which depository libraries will be responsible for supporting. GOAL 4: Enable the public to locate Government information regardless of format.  This includes: (1) participation in, and utilization of, the Government Information Locator Service (GILS) and (2) development of other locator services tailored specifically to the needs of the FDLP. GOAL 5: Ensure both timely, current public access and permanent, future public access to Government information products at or through depository libraries, without copyright-like restrictions on the use or reuse of that information.  This includes assuring to the maximum extent possible that all Government information products within the scope of the FDLP, regardless of market value, are available for no fee public access through the FDLP. Although it is recognized that private sector publishers and other secondary disseminators of Government information will continue to provide high value, high interest information products, the purpose of the FDLP is to acquire and maintain access to the full range of Government information products within Page 6   the scope of the program, without copyright-like restrictions on the use or reuse of that information. GOAL 6: Facilitate preservation of Government information through the National Archives and Records Administration.  This includes the continued transfer to NARA of information disseminated to depository libraries by GPO, as well as the initiation of transfer to NARA of electronic information held by GPO for depository library access. GOAL 7: Ensure that the program is cost-effective for all parties involved, including Government publishing agencies, GPO, depository libraries, and the public.  This includes a commitment to minimize costs to depository libraries as a result of changes in the FDLP in order to encourage continued participation in the program and thereby assure broad public access to Government information.  V.  POLICY ISSUES THAT IMPACT PUBLISHING AGENCIES, GPO, NARA, DEPOSITORY LIBRARIES, THE PUBLIC, AND THE PRIVATE SECTOR  The issues summarized below were identified during the course of the study. Many of them are explained in greater detail, with examples and alternative solutions, in the individual task force reports included as Attachments D-1 to D-15. ISSUE 1: Redefinition of Terms; Authenticity of Information.  The electronic publishing environment necessitates new definitions of terms such as ""Government publication"" to include ""Government information product"" and ""Government electronic information service"", as well as new means to identify and assure the authenticity of electronic Government information. A. The scope of Government information products included in the FDLP, and the criteria for excluding information products from the FDLP, should be reaffirmed through revision of 44 U.S.C. 1901 and 1902. These sections should explicitly include all formats of Government information, including electronic information products. Since NARA accepts dissemination through the FDLP as one criteria for identifying information for preservation, this also will serve to define a body of electronic Government information products that should be transferred to NARA by GPO2 or the publishing agencies for preservation, notwithstanding its continued availability through the FDLP. B. Means should be found to assure the authenticity of Government information products in the FDLP, both for the current users and usage and for permanent public access and preservation. This may include the utilization of ""signatures"" on electronic Government information products (files) and the establishment of a unique and permanent name or identification number for each file that is constant throughout its life cycle. Authentication efforts should assure the accuracy of the information content without imposing barriers to use or reuse.  Currently GPO transfers to NARA only that information over which it has physical custody, i.e. information disseminated to depository libraries by GPO and information maintained at GPO for remote access. GPO can and will work with Federal publishing agencies to assure the transfer to NARA of other information that is within the scope of the FDLP, but never directly in the custody of GPO.  2  Page 7   ISSUE 2:  Changing Roles for FDLP Participants.  The focus of the FDLP is changing, with GPO providing more electronic access and less physical distribution, and depository libraries providing connections to remotely accessible Government electronic information services, rather than building collections in their own facilities. The role of GPO, as the agency responsible for administration of the FDLP, will include the A. establishment of official arrangements for depository library access to information available directly from Federal agencies or other organizations, with the appropriate provisions for permanent access to and through the FDLP. This will assure that GPO, and the depository libraries, can rely on access through these distributed sources, rather than collecting the information for a single, central computer system operated by GPO or requiring libraries to maintain extensive local collections of electronic Government information products. B. The role of depository libraries will include requirements to serve as local providers of public access workstations and the related services necessary to connect the public to remotely accessible Government electronic information services. This redefinition will result in different types of resource and training requirements that the libraries will have to meet in order to assure equitable access to Government information. C. Means should be found to assure that publishing agencies in all three branches of the Federal Government provide notification to GPO, as the administrator of the FDLP, before they initiate, substantially modify, or terminate Government information products. This would include notification of removal, or change of location, of information products on a Government electronic information service when availability through that service is the means by which the agency fulfills its FDLP responsibilities. The Paperwork Reduction Act establishes a notification requirement for publishing agencies in the executive branch, but it does not explicitly identify GPO as one of the entities that must be notified. There is no comparable statutory requirement for notification of affected parties for legislative and judicial branch publishers. It is insufficient to establish the obligation; there must be means to assure compliance if the FDLP and other affected parties are to rely on this notification. ISSUE 3: Permanent Access and Preservation.  The requirements for permanent access to and preservation of electronic Government information products necessitate a reevaluation of the life cycle of that information. The best time to assure preservation of official electronic Government information is at the time it is prepared, when the originator can certify its authenticity. For purposes of this report, ""permanent access"" means that Government information products within the scope of the FDLP remain available for continuous, no fee public access through the program,3 and ""preservation"" means that official records of the Federal Government, which have been determined to have sufficient historical or other value to warrant being held and maintained in trust for future generations of Americans, are retained by the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA). A. NARA and GPO should establish an official relationship to assure that electronic Government information products disseminated to depository libraries by GPO, or held by GPO for  In the case of tangible information products, permanent access remains a responsibility of regional depository libraries, while in the case of remotely accessible information products, it is a responsibility of GPO to coordinate a distributed system that provides continuous, permanent public access through the FDLP.  3  Page 8   depository library access, are transferred to NARA for preservation in formats acceptable to NARA.4 Ideally, this should be done in a manner that meets the publishing agencies' requirements for deposit with NARA, so that duplicative preparation and transfer of such information is eliminated. Currently GPO transfers to NARA only that information over which it has physical custody, i.e. information disseminated to depository libraries by GPO and information maintained at GPO for remote access. B. The requirement for permanent access at or through depository libraries necessitates: (1) the creation of information in formats that resist technological obsolescence due to software or platform dependence; and/or (2) the migration of the information to new media or new formats. In this context, migration means both: (1) the periodic refreshing or transfer of Government information products from one medium to another in order to minimize loss of information due to physical deterioration of storage media and (2) the reformatting of information to avoid technological obsolescence due to software or platform dependence. C. As the volume of electronic Government information products increases, it is essential to collect more in-depth and concrete data on the life cycle costs to the Government for creating, disseminating and preserving them, to depository libraries for providing public access to them, and to the public for using them. ISSUE 4: Standards.  The requirements for timely access to current Government information products within the scope of the FDLP, and for permanent access to and preservation of these products, necessitate the identification and implementation of Government-wide standards for the creation and dissemination of electronic Government information products.5 Where adequate standards do not already exist, standards must be developed by and for the agencies that create and disseminate the products. A. Broad utilization of Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML) in the preparation of Government information products will facilitate the exchange, dissemination and preservation of that information; however, it will take many years for this to be broadly accepted throughout the Government. B. GPO needs to establish a range of preferred file formats, including SGML, for use in the FDLP and should recommend (but not require) that Federal publishing agencies use one of those formats when submitting electronic Government information products to GPO for FDLP dissemination. Whenever possible, open systems and formats compliant with Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) and other national or international standards should be used to assure that the format of the information is not a barrier to FDLP or public use. Such standardization is essential to assure that depository libraries have the hardware, software and training necessary to assist the public in the utilization of information made available through the FDLP. C. When agencies cannot, or do not, use one of the preferred formats, GPO will need to convert agency supplied electronic Government information to one of the preferred formats if that is necessary to assure that the information product is appropriate to the needs of users and the intended usage. The formats utilized for FDLP dissemination must be appropriate for the program's intended audience, representing a broad cross-section of the general public. If the format utilized by the publishing agency is not suitable for public access through the FDLP, GPO should convert, reformat or scan the  The historical and future roles of GPO in the transfer of Government information products to NARA for preservation are addressed in the discussion of Goal 6 on page 21. The proposal for an Assessment of Standards for Creation and Dissemination of Electronic Government Information is described on page 28 in the Results and Conclusions. 5  4  Page 9   information product for distribution through the FDLP. For example, depository libraries cannot have available the software for every word processor or desktop publisher used by a Government agency to create documents, so GPO might accept documents from agencies in a wide variety of formats and convert them into one or more standard formats for depository library access or distribution. This will not restrict creation or dissemination by Federal agencies in the formats which they feel best serve their needs and those of their primary constituencies, but rather will supplement agency dissemination efforts by assuring availability to a wider range of users through the FDLP. Whenever possible, the standard formats utilized by the FDLP should be platform D. independent and either non-proprietary or open in order to assure the widest possible use of the information and to avoid copyright-like restrictions resulting from software licensing. For example, the Government is distributing a significant amount of information using CD-ROM. Most CD-ROM titles include retrieval and display software, and often this software requires formatting the information in specific ways that can only be accessed through that software. This imposes copyright-like restrictions on those who want access to the underlying data and can preclude future use due to dependency on specific computer operating systems or other technology that may become obsolete. E. Where paper and microfiche are formats that do not face technological obsolescence, many electronic information formats are software or platform dependent, necessitating the periodic review and, when necessary, migration of that information to newer media and or alternative file formats. Creation in, and certification of, information in standard formats that are not technologically dependent is the best way to assure that Government information products remain permanently accessible through the FDLP and are preserved by NARA. F. The use of standards in the preparation and dissemination of Government information products also will facilitate incorporation in value-added information products from the private sector and assure a diversity of both public and private sources for Government information. ISSUE 5: Locator Services.  With the proliferation of remotely accessible Government electronic information services, and the necessity to link or direct depository libraries to those services, rather than duplicating them, the provision of comprehensive finding aids and indexing (locator) services is essential. This includes full participation in and utilization of the Government Information Locator Service (GILS), as well as development of other locator services tailored specifically to the needs of the FDLP. ISSUE 6: Inclusion of Fee-Based Services in the FDLP.  The principles for Government information, and many of the laws and policies implementing them, recognize the need for assuring broad access to the public. The statute authorizing the FDLP specifically requires no-fee public access; however, this requirement is often in conflict with statutes establishing sales programs and fee-based Government electronic information services. Purchase of access to fee-based Government information services for the FDLP is one means to reduce this conflict. This would require the establishment of a basis for determining appropriate fees for depository access and the restrictions, if any, that such services should be able to place on access to the services. Another alternative would be for Congress to require publishing agencies operating under fee-based requirements to provide this information to the FDLP without charge. In either case, such access should not restrict the use and reuse of information provided to the public through the FDLP. ISSUE 7: Avoidance of Copyright-Like Restrictions.  Government information must be available without copyright-like restrictions to assure broad public access and a diversity of dissemination sources. When publishing agencies impose, or permit others to Page 10   impose, copyright-like restrictions on information created or compiled by Government employees or at Government expense, the effect is to restrict public access to that information. This violates the intent, if not the specific provisions, of the laws and policies precluding copyright on Federal information, including the Paperwork Reduction Act and OMB Circular A-130. Nevertheless, budget constraints, requirements for operating cost-recovery information services, and other factors are encouraging agencies to treat Government information as a commodity whose economic value can only be preserved by the imposition of such restrictions. Excessive fees, exclusive arrangements, royalty fees, and restrictions on the use or reuse of Government information are examples of copyright-like restrictions that must be avoided. The utilization of proprietary data formats also may impose copyright-like restrictions by requiring users to obtain software licenses in order to access or reproduce the information. ISSUE 8: Incentives for Agency Compliance with FDLP Requirements.  GPO should inform publishing agencies of their obligations to the FDLP. The Office of Management and Budget and the Congress should assist GPO in making sure that agencies understand the requirements for participation in the FDLP and comply with them. GPO should have the ability to offer incentives for participation and to assure publishing agency compliance with statutory obligations to the FDLP.  VI.  COMPARISON OF THE HISTORICAL FDLP WITH THE ELECTRONIC FDLP AS ENVISIONED IN THE STRATEGIC PLAN  The Federal Depository Library Program has been in existence for more than 150 years. The program has stood the test of time, providing equitable, efficient, timely and dependable no-fee public access to Federal Government information products in print and microform, and more recently in electronic formats. It has proven to be a well-designed and well-balanced program, with clearly defined roles and responsibilities for Federal agencies, GPO and the depository libraries. However, the advent of electronic dissemination has introduced a host of new problems and concerns unheard of, or less prevalent, in the print-based model of Government information dissemination. This study is part of the process for informing the Congress about the issues and alternatives that should be considered for a successful transition to a more electronic FDLP. As part of the study, a Strategic Plan was prepared program through FY 2001. This plan is attached as Exhibit comparison of the historical FDLP with the electronic FDLP comparison is made in the context of how the program has Section IV of this report. Goal 1: to describe the anticipated evolution of the 1. This section of the report provides a as it is envisioned in the Strategic Plan. The met and will meet the goals presented in  Ensure that the public has equitable, no-fee, local public access to Government information products through a centrally managed, statutorily authorized network of geographically-dispersed depository libraries.  Page 11   Historical Model For more than a century, the Federal Depository Library Program has served the Government and its citizens by providing a national network of libraries through which Government information is made available to the people of the United States, without geographic, economic or administrative barriers. The scope of the program as defined in 44 U.S.C. 1902 includes all ""publications except those determined by their issuing components to be required for official use only or for strictly administrative or operational purposes which have no public interest or educational value and publications classified for reasons of national security.""6 There are currently 1,382 depository libraries located throughout the country, one in almost every Congressional district, as well as in the U.S. territories and possessions. Designation of a depository library is made by a Senator or Member of Congress or by law. Regardless of whether a citizen lives in a poor district in the inner city, a wealthy suburb, or a rural area, Government information products are accessible to each citizen at a depository library in the local area. Depository libraries are required by 44 U.S.C. 1911 to make the publications distributed to them through the FDLP"" available for the free use of the general public."" GPO delivers Government publications to depository libraries primarily in print and microfiche. However, an increasing number of Government information products are being distributed in both physical electronic format, such as CD-ROM, and through Government electronic information services, such as GPO Access. Although the amount and type of information obtained through the FDLP and the type of facilities vary by depository, traditionally the only equipment depository libraries needed to provide equitable public access to non-print Government information products was a microfiche reader or reader/printer. This equipment is relatively inexpensive and simple to operate, and microfiche does not require special training or expertise to use. In recent years, as CD-ROM discs have become a popular medium for the dissemination of Government information, many depository libraries have acquired computer workstations with CD-ROM drives, and some have even offered remote access to CD-ROM discs through their library networks. Currently 1,140 (83.1%) depository libraries have CD-ROM drives available for use with their Government information collections.7 A workstation equipped with a CD-ROM drive and a printer is more expensive than a microfiche reader/printer and requires additional training and expertise, particularly given the wide variety of software and data formats used by Federal agencies in their CD-ROM publishing. Although the amounts and types of equipment vary by library, the formats currently used for dissemination do not preclude depository libraries from selecting the Government information products they feel are needed to best serve their communities. Under the traditional FDLP model, the only major resource limitations on depository selection of Government information products are available shelf space (or microfiche cabinets) and support staff.8  Strategic Plan  There is an additional exclusion in 44 U.S.C. 1903, based not on the content of Government information products, but on their source of funding, for ""so-called cooperative publications which must necessarily be sold in order to be self-sustaining."" This information is based on data from the 1995 Biennial Survey of Depository Libraries, with all but 10 libraries responses received. A summary of the survey results is available as Attachment G. Selection of information products available through Government electronic information services is discussed in more detail under Goal 2 on page 14. 8 7  6  Page 12   Congress has already authorized GPO to disseminate electronic information to depository libraries through the GPO Access legislation (44 U.S.C. 4101). Ensuring equitable public access in an electronic dissemination environment will require two changes to the FDLP. The first involves reaffirmation that the scope of the program includes a comprehensive range of publishing formats. The current scope of the program refers to distribution of Government ""publications."" The term ""publications"" implies information published in a static, physical medium. However, electronic information can be dynamic and changeable, and often does not lend itself to physical dissemination. Therefore, the Strategic Plan proposes elimination of the term ""publications"" where it is used in 44 U.S.C. 1901 and 1902 to define the scope of the program and substitution of the more generic term ""information products."" This term encompasses both traditional products in physical formats and new electronic information available through Government electronic information services.9 The second significant change will take place in the depository libraries themselves. With the amount and type of electronic information in the program growing rapidly, it will be incumbent upon depository libraries to expand their capabilities at a local level for public access to remotely accessible Government electronic information services. Despite the increasing amount of Government information available for free public use on the Internet, studies have shown that a significant majority of Americans still lack the necessary equipment, skills, or Internet connections to access remote Government electronic information services. A recent Nielsen survey found that only 17 percent of the public has access to the Internet, whether at home, in the classroom, at the office or through a friend's computer.10 In addition, the complexity of the distributed information environment has created new problems for the public, eroding the ability of even experienced users to locate the information they need. Depository libraries located in most Congressional districts can meet the needs of this large segment of the American public which has not yet acquired the equipment or expertise necessary to locate and access Government information directly from their home, classroom, or office. The Strategic Plan recognizes that in order to provide equitable public access to Government information in an electronic environment, depository libraries will have to accelerate their plans to obtain public access computer workstations, and satisfy the demand for local printing and downloading. According to the 1995 Biennial Survey, only 32 percent of responding depositories currently provide the kind of robust workstation configuration necessary to provide equitable public access to Government information through the Internet.11 The Strategic Plan recognizes that in a more electronic FDLP, all depository libraries will have to provide at least one public access workstation with a graphical user interface, CD-ROM capabilities, Internet connections and the ability to access, download, and print extensive products. In addition to hardware and software, depositories will need to provide assistance to patrons in the use of electronic Government information products which employ a variety of search engines, user interfaces, and software packages. These requirements are defined in the Recommended Minimum Specifications for Public Access Workstations in Federal Depository Libraries, which are scheduled to become requirements effective October 1, 1996, and are provided as Attachment H. Acquiring this technical expertise and providing user support for electronic depository collections will require additional depository training and support staff. As a result, depository libraries will have to balance the resource requirements necessary to support electronic information products with those necessary to provide access to the Government information products in their print and microfiche collections.  9  A more complete list of definitions begins on page v at the front of this report.  The CommerceNet/Nielsen Internet Demographics Survey. [New York]: CommerceNet Consortium/Nielsen Media Research, 1995. [URL: http://www.commerce.net/information/surveys/] 11  10  More detailed information from the Biennial Survey is available as Attachment G.  Page 13   The Strategic Plan also suggests that, in the transition of the FDLP from a series of local repositories to a network of local access points, many depositories may find that they lack the necessary public or private funding to achieve the minimal level of electronic capability they will need. The plan proposes that GPO provide up to $25,000 per library in technology grants to those depositories that demonstrate need and stipulate that no other public or private funding source is available for this purpose. These would be one-time grants, available for a single year and totalling no more than $500,000 per year. In addition, the Strategic Plan envisions an expanded role for GPO in providing support services to depositories including, but not limited to, locator services, user support, training, and documentation. Goal 2: Use new information technologies to improve public access to Government information and expand the array of Government information products and Government electronic information services made available through the FDLP. Historical Model As the primary provider of printing services for the Government, GPO is able to identify and acquire information for the FDLP when publishing agencies submit printing requisitions to GPO in the course of printing or contracting for the printing of their publications. The number of copies needed for depository distribution is added to the agency's printing requisition as a ""rider."" Therefore, GPO's integral role in the production process has ensured that publications are identified and acquired for the FDLP, without agencies having to be aware of their obligations to the program. With the vast amount of Government information products flowing through the GPO print production process, and thereby being acquired for the FDLP, expanding the array of Government information products available for public access was never a primary concern for the program. In the historical model for the FDLP, paper was the primary format used for dissemination of Government information. Advances in printing technology over the years have changed the production process for Government publications, but they have not changed the way in which Government information products are distributed or made available to the public through depository libraries. Before the advent of electronic dissemination, the only technology that significantly impacted FDLP dissemination was micrographics. The FDLP began using microfiche as a format for dissemination in the early 1970's. The use of micrographics allowed GPO to distribute a slightly greater amount of material to depositories at a significantly lower cost to the Government. No major changes to the FDLP distribution system were needed because microfiche was a physical format. Depository libraries purchased microfiche readers or reader/printers in order to provide public access to microfiche information.12 Depository library patrons could access the exact graphical image of a printed publication simply by placing a sheet of microfiche in the microfiche reader; therefore no special training or user support was needed to use information in this format. Due to the vast quantity of Government information products disseminated through the program, and the physical limitations of depository libraries for storing print and microfiche, the historical model for the FDLP necessitated a distinction between ""selective"" depository libraries and ""regional"" depository libraries. Selective depositories pre-select the type of publications they wish to receive based on the specific needs and interests of the communities they serve. Fifty-three ""regional"" depository libraries receive everything that is distributed through the program. If users do not find the information they need at a selective depository library, they can arrange for an inter-library loan from another depository that does elect to receive that information or from a regional library. While this is not as timely as on demand access from an electronic information service, the delay is not so lengthy that it significantly impedes public access.  While comparable in cost to public access workstations acquired for the CD-ROM titles and other electronic Government information products, the microfiche equipment has a much longer useful life.  12  Page 14   Government information products in paper or microfiche are available at depository libraries for on-site use by members of the public. Users can borrow material to read at home, in the classroom, or in the office, or they may elect to pay to copy or print it out in order have their own copy. When Government CD-ROM titles were included in the FDLP, depository libraries began to add public access workstations equipped with CD-ROM drives. Since the initiation of the GPO Access electronic information services, authorized by 44 U.S.C. 4101, the public has had free use of a variety of databases through public access workstations equipped for Internet access. This was quickly expanded to offer users the option of access from their home, classroom or office through one of several depository library gateways or direct access from GPO. Strategic Plan The electronic Federal Depository Library Program as outlined in the Strategic Plan will take advantage of the increasing amount of Government information available in electronic format to expand and enhance the array of Government information products available to the public. An increasing amount of Government information is available from agency publishers in electronic formats. This information falls into three categories: (1) information products that are currently included in the FDLP in print, but not in electronic formats, (2) information products that previously were included in the FDLP in print, but that are no longer included in the program since the publishing agency converted to electronic information products, and (3) information products that have never been a part of the program for various operational or financial reasons. Often this information is more timely, useful, and less expensive in electronic format than it is in print. The Strategic Plan proposes four ways in which GPO can bring these electronic information products into the FDLP: GPO can identify, describe and link the public to the wealth of distributed Government information products maintained at Government electronic information services for free public use. GPO can establish reimbursable agreements with agencies that provide fee-based Government electronic information services in order to provide free public access to their information through the FDLP. GPO can ""ride"" agency requisitions and pay for depository copies of tangible electronic information products, such as CD-ROM discs, even if they are not produced or procured through GPO. GPO can obtain from agencies electronic source files for information the agencies do not wish to disseminate through their own Government electronic information services. These files can be made available through the GPO Access services or disseminated to depository libraries in CD-ROM or other tangible format.  -  -  -  GPO's ability to provide timely and comprehensive access to Government electronic information products will be dependent on the receipt of timely notification from publishing agencies when they initiate, substantially modify, or terminate an information product. Both the Paperwork Reduction Act and OMB Circular A-130 require executive agencies to provide such notice to affected parties. The proposed revisions to 44 U.S.C. 1902 presented in the report for Task 6 (Attachment D-5) establish a specific requirement for notification of GPO by all branches of Government. The proposal suggests the following language: Agencies shall notify the Superintendent of Documents of their intent to initiate any Government information product and shall notify the Superintendent of Documents at such Page 15   time as they substantially modify or terminate a product available via a Government electronic information service. The task force report also proposes an addition to 44 U.S.C. Chapter 19 that would require agencies to provide the Superintendent of Documents with timely notice of any tangible electronic information product produced or procured outside of GPO, so that the Superintendent of Documents can make arrangements to ride the agency requisition for depository copies on an incremental cost basis. Several benefits will be realized from the inclusion of more electronic information in the FDLP. When mounted to an online service, electronic information can be accessed simultaneously from multiple sites located across the country within minutes of its creation. This means that Government information products like agency press releases can be made accessible at or through depository libraries when public interest in the information is at its peak, whereas previously weeks would pass before the printed press releases arrived in a depository shipment. Another major benefit of electronic information is the ease in which it can be manipulated and searched. Unlike paper or microfiche, electronic information is dynamic. For example, locating agency regulations on toxic waste management published in the paper Federal Register required a user to scan through indices and pages of text manually. This was a very time-consuming and labor-intensive process. The same search on the electronic Federal Register database can be done in seconds with a simple search that locates and ranks all references to toxic waste management in the Federal Register over a specified period of time. After viewing relevant passages on the screen, the user can ""paste"" those passages of text into word processing software, download and save the entire file for use at a later time, or print out selected pages. Use of information technology not only will enhance public access to Government information by improving its timeliness and utility to the user, but will make access to certain types of Government information more widely available. Currently, shelf and cabinet space restrict the amount and type of print and microfiche materials depository libraries select. As more information is included in the FDLP through access to Government electronic information services, depository libraries will be able to access a wider range of Government information products because the responsibility for providing access to the information will rest increasingly with publishing agencies and GPO, instead of with each individual library.  13  The Strategic Plan notes that in FY 1997 depository libraries will be required to meet minimum specifications for public access workstations which include capabilities for accessing Government electronic information services.14 This will mean that the full range of Government information products remotely accessible through the FDLP will be available for public use at or through any depository library within the next year. In addition, users who have the necessary hardware, software and expertise will continue to access an expanding array of electronic information available through the FDLP directly from their home, classroom or office using depository library gateways or by connecting to GPO electronic information services directly. While every depository library will be able to access all of the available remotely accessible Government electronic information services, each library will continue to determine the appropriate levels 13  This does not mean that all of the information products provided to GPO by agencies will be maintained at GPO. Some Government information products will be in facilities, such as depository libraries, that establish contractual arrangements with GPO to house the information for depository library access. These alternatives are discussed more fully under Goal 5. The current requirements are provided in Attachment H: Recommended Minimum Specifications for Public Access Workstations in Federal Depository Libraries. These specifications are revised periodically to reflect changes in computer technology and software. 14  Page 16   of service for the various types of information. For example, a depository library in a law school will have public access workstations that can be used to access remote scientific and technical information, but it is not likely to offer any reference service to support the use of that information since it is outside of the scope of its collection and expertise. On the other hand, a law library may offer substantially better assistance for legal and regulatory materials than a public library that has limited experience with this type of information. GOAL 3: Provide Government information products in formats appropriate to the needs of users and the intended usage.  Historical Model The historical model for the FDLP involved dissemination of information primarily in two physical, static formats: paper and microfiche. GPO also has distributed a substantial number of CD-ROM titles to depository libraries, and a limited number of videos, slides, and floppy diskettes. The CD-ROM discs have conformed to the international standards for CD-ROM media and file layout, but have presented a challenge to the libraries due to the wide range of retrieval software and file formats on the discs. Depository libraries have had access to electronic files in a variety of formats on the Federal Bulletin Board since 1992, including ASCII text, various word processing files, dBase databases, Lotus 123 spreadsheets, PostScript files, and Adobe Acrobat Portable Document Format (PDF) files. GPO Access began providing depository libraries with online databases in 1994, offering the Congressional Record, the Federal Register, the Congressional Record Index and Congressional Bills. There are now more than 65 databases available online via GPO Access. All of the databases from GPO Access are available as ASCII text files. ASCII files with a print equivalent are also available as PDF files, with graphics imbedded. For databases without a print equivalent, graphics are provided as individual Tagged Image File Format (TIFF) files, and the ASCII text files contain notations to identify each graphic. Under the historical model for the FDLP, the availability of electronic information has been used to supplement, but not replace, dissemination of the same information in paper or microfiche. Therefore, while the Federal Bulletin Board and GPO Access online service are heavily used by depository libraries, 52% of depository libraries have not yet registered for the Federal Bulletin Board and 40% indicated that they do not yet offer GPO Access online databases.15 The paper and microfiche versions of the Federal Register and Congressional Record continue to be selected by more than 1,000 depository libraries.  The assessment of user needs and the intended usage of Government information products is essential if GPO is to provide the information in formats that can be utilized by the public at or through depository libraries. This is not a new goal, but rather the adaptation of long-standing practices for electronic information dissemination. For example, GPO has established criteria that control when a paper document can, or cannot, be converted to microfiche. If the intended use is ""ready reference"" then it may need to remain in print; if it contains four-color graphics that cannot be reproduced in microfiche without loss of content, then it remains in print. Similarly, the GPO Access legislation requires GPO to create electronic information services, and that clearly includes designing databases. GPO Access has certain capabilities, and GPO has established certain ""standard"" ways of displaying and tagging information. Within those constraints, GPO designs its databases in consultation and cooperation with the publishing agencies. However, the FDLP is the primary customer for GPO Access, and that requires GPO to consider depository needs, as well as agency preferences, when selecting and designing databases. Strategic Plan  This information is based on data from the 1995 Biennial Survey of Depository Libraries, with responses received from all but 10 libraries. A summary of the survey results is available as Attachment G.  15  Page 17   In the future, Federal agencies will continue to have a number of publishing alternatives available for their needs, and many Government information products will continue to be printed. However, it is expected that electronic formats will become the Federal publishing media of choice, and virtually every printed publication will have an electronic counterpart. Unfortunately, at present no Government-wide standard formats have been established for electronic information, although GPO currently uses a few ""preferred"" formats for electronic source files, including ASCII, dBase, PDF, PostScript and Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML). The Strategic Plan suggests that the identification of standard formats be determined through an assessment of standards for creation and dissemination of electronic Government information products.16 The assessment would be a joint project between GPO and NCLIS. Following successful completion of the assessment, GPO will make every reasonable effort to provide meaningful public access to Government electronic information by converting, repackaging or scanning agency-produced information products for distribution or access through the FDLP in one of the standard formats identified by the assessment as being useful and cost-effective. This will not restrict Federal agencies from creating or disseminating information in any format that suits their own needs and mission, but rather, will supplement existing agency dissemination efforts (often tailored to the needs of specific constituencies) and assure broad public access. Regardless of which formats ultimately are utilized, GPO will continue to provide a text-only interface for its online databases in order to maintain compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and to assure access to users with limited technological and communication capability. As of December 1995, 40% of the use of the GPO Access databases was through the Simple WAIS (SWAIS) text-based interface. While this percentage is declining, there is still a substantial requirement for this type of access. GOAL 4: Historical Model Historically, GPO has facilitated the identification and location of Government information through its Cataloging and Indexing Program (CIP). This program is authorized by 44 U.S.C. 1710 and 1711. GPO's statutory mission is to provide bibliographic control for all Government documents. GPO fulfills this mission by preparing, publishing, and distributing the Monthly Catalog of U.S. Government Publications (Monthly Catalog) and a comprehensive index of public documents at the close of each regular session of Congress. A complete and authoritative description for each Government information product is prepared by GPO in accordance with nationally accepted cataloging standards and practices. The Monthly Catalog and other finding aids are used by depository librarians to help the public identify Government information. Electronic access to the Monthly Catalog has been available through the GPO Web site since June 1995. Records in the Monthly Catalog database are linked to depository item selection, so a user can identify a Government information product in the database and then locate nearby depository libraries that have that product available for public use. This is part of GPO's implementation of the requirement for an electronic directory, or locator service, under the GPO Access legislation (44 U.S.C. 4101). GPO has been cataloging Federal CD-ROM titles for inclusion in the Monthly Catalog for several years. Recently titles on Government electronic information services also have been included in the CIP. GPO continues to be an active participant in the Government Information Locator Service (GILS) initiative, serving in the GILS advisory group and acting as the host for the GILS records of approximately 25 agencies. Enable the public to locate Government information regardless of format.  This assessment replaces the Technical Implementation Assistance proposed in the draft FDLP Study Report. The assessment is described in more detail on page 26 in the section on Results and Conclusions.  16  Page 18   Strategic Plan The Strategic Plan recognizes that meaningful public access will be possible only if GPO continues to develop appropriate finding aids to assist depository libraries and the public in identifying information available from the Government, regardless of its format or location. Therefore, the plan proposes that GPO accelerate development of Pathway locator services (Pathway). These services will use advanced indexing, search, and retrieval tools to identify, describe, and link users to electronic Government information, whether it is held by GPO or at other sites. Pathway will be developed using open systems standards and will be compatible with complementary initiatives such as the GILS. GPO intends to provide records in machine-readable cataloging (MARC) format, following the Anglo-American Cataloging Rules, 2nd Edition (AACR2), for all appropriate Government information products, whether in physical format or available through Government electronic information services. GPO cataloging will continue to emphasize information products which are not brought under bibliographic control by another Government agency. GPO cataloging records that include references to electronic information products available from Government Internet sites will include the Uniform Resource Locator (URL). The URL will be displayed in the Monthly Catalog records at the GPO Web site, and will be ""hot linked"" to the actual electronic content. GOAL 5: Ensure both timely, current public access and permanent, future public access to Government information products at or through depository libraries, without copyright-like restrictions on the use or reuse of that information.  Historical Model For more than a century, information delivery through the FDLP has been a linear model: a chain beginning with the publishing agency, linking through GPO and the depository libraries and ultimately reaching the public. Responsibility for public access in the historical model correlates directly to the actual creation, transfer and possession of physical information products. Publishing agencies are responsible for the collection of data and the creation of information products. GPO acquires the information through the print production process, determines independently of the publishing agency whether to distribute the information in paper or microfiche, and ships authentic Government publications to depository libraries. Depository libraries assume custody of the information upon receipt and then are responsible for processing and storing the Government publications for no-fee public access, use, and reuse without copyright restrictions.  As required by law, selective depository libraries hold the information they receive for at least five years. Fifty-three regional depository libraries hold all Government publications distributed to them through the FDLP, except superseded publications or those issued later in bound form, in perpetuity.17 This means that Government information products published today will be available for the researcher, scholar, or student a hundred years from now, just as documents dating back to the Civil War are available to the public through depository libraries today. Government information products available through the FDLP are free from copyright and can be used or redisseminated by the public as it so chooses. Strategic Plan  Permanent access is required by 44 U.S.C. 1911: ""Depository libraries not served by a regional depository library, or that are regional depository libraries themselves, shall retain Government publications permanently in either printed form or in microfacsimile form, except superseded publications or those issued later in bound form which may be discarded as authorized by the Superintendent of Documents.""  17  Page 19   The Strategic Plan proposes a new FDLP model that allows the traditional partners in the program to interact in new ways and which defines the various partners in the process by the services they provide rather than by the actions they perform. Publishing agencies, GPO, and depository libraries will be expected both to perform their current functions and assume new responsibilities that were previously the sole province of one of the other partners in the FDLP model. Agencies will remain responsible for the collection of data and the creation of information products. According to the Strategic Plan, the next step in the process will involve proactive negotiation and coordination between GPO and the issuing agencies regarding appropriate formats for immediate and permanent public access and custody of the information.18 The issuing agency will determine the format used in the dissemination of the information for their own purposes and for dissemination to depository libraries when depository access is provided directly through the agency's own site. When agencies choose to transfer their electronic information to GPO for the FDLP, GPO will determine the most appropriate format for dissemination or access, as authorized under 44 U.S.C. 1914, which says that GPO can determine the ""measures [it] considers necessary for the economical and practical implementation of [the Federal Depository Library Program]."" Previously these measures were limited by the number of formats available for dissemination. However, information technology now provides GPO with a wide range of dissemination options, many of which will cast GPO in the roles of disseminating agent and ""publisher"" of Government information products. For example, an agency might issue weekly press releases through its own Internet site. At the end of each year it might remove these releases from the agency site and pass them to GPO for permanent access through the FDLP. Instead of remounting the releases to the Internet through GPO Access, GPO may decide it is more economical to pack and publish the press releases on a CD-ROM for distribution to depository libraries. In this context, although the agency is still responsible for the information content, GPO acts as the publisher of a Government information product through its creation and production of this annual compilation. In the historical model, information products would move forward through distribution channels to the point of access, depository libraries, where they would ultimately reside for both immediate and permanent public access. In the new FDLP model, forward movement of information products can stop at any one of the points in the dissemination process: the point of creation (the issuing agency), the point of coordination (GPO), or the point of local access (depository library). Nor will Government information products always reside at the same location both for immediate and permanent access. Some agencies may decide to fulfill their obligations for public and depository access through their own electronic information services for the short term, only to pass responsibility for the information on to GPO for permanent access through the FDLP. Under other partnering arrangements, depository libraries may accept responsibility for permanent public access to some types of Government information products. The party that retains physical custody of the information for on demand depository access will be responsible for the information's authenticity, storage and maintenance. Using GPO sponsored finding aids, depository libraries will have to assist members of the public in determining at which point(s) in the new FDLP model the Government information product relevant to their needs resides, whether it was published ten days or ten years ago. As with the historical model, any Government information product provided to the public under the auspices of the FDLP will remain free of copyright or copyright-like restrictions, regardless of its format or physical location. For example, the report on Task 9 (Attachment D-11) describes one alternative by which GPO would negotiate an agreement to purchase access for depository libraries when agency information is available electronically for a fee. The alternative states that ""the agreement may include limitations on  For purposes of this report, permanent access means that Government information products within the scope of the FDLP remain available for continuous, no fee public access through the program.  18  Page 20   numbers of users or on remote access via library networks, but will not include any copyright-like restrictions on the use or reuse of the information."" Unfortunately, there are instances when copyright-like restrictions cannot be avoided. For example, many of the CD-ROM titles distributed to the depository libraries include retrieval and display software that format the information in specific ways that can only be accessed through that software. This imposes copyright-like restrictions on those who want access to the underlying data and can preclude future use due to dependency on specific computer operating systems or other technology that may become obsolete. GPO will not refuse to accept such CD-ROM titles for depository distribution, but GPO will continue to work with publishing agencies to encourage publication in a manner that avoids copyright-like restrictions. GOAL 6: Facilitate preservation of Government information through the National Archives and Records Administration.  Historical Model The National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) is the repository for the preservation of the Government's permanent records. These are records that have been appraised by NARA as having sufficient historical or other value to warrant continued preservation beyond the time they are needed for administrative, legal, or fiscal purposes.19 No more than 5 percent of the records created by the Federal Government fall into this very select category, but this has traditionally included all formal publications of Federal agencies. In addition to any agency transfer of publications, NARA accepts for deposit from GPO one copy of every publication cataloged through the Cataloging and Indexing Program and/or distributed by GPO through the Federal Depository Library Program. GPO transfers a full collection to NARA after the completion of each four-year Presidential term. These procedures have resulted in the granting of preservation status within NARA to all Government information products in the CIP or FDLP as part of the definitive official collection of U. S. Government publications. At present this status is extended to all paper and microfiche publications and to all electronic products that are in formats acceptable to NARA for archival purposes (36 CFR 1228.188). Recently NARA has begun to accept for reference purposes only, without accessioning for preservation, CD-ROM discs and other electronic products that are software dependent and, therefore, not in archival format.20 Strategic Plan GPO will continue to transfer to NARA a collection of the information it disseminates to depository libraries or holds for depository library access. Whenever possible, electronic information will be transferred to NARA in formats acceptable for archival purposes. When that is not possible, GPO will continue to provide NARA with copies for reference purposes. Ideally, legislative or regulatory changes could be made so that transfers from GPO to NARA in suitable archival formats can be recognized as meeting publishing agencies' archival requirements with respect to NARA. This would eliminate duplicative preparation, transfer and accessioning of such information. Transfer of depository material to NARA will not preclude continued maintenance of the information by, or under the authority of, GPO for permanent access through the FDLP. 19  For purposes of this report, preservation means that official records of the Federal Government, including Government information products made available through the FDLP, which have been determined to have sufficient historical or other value to warrant being held and maintained in trust for future generations of Americans, are retained by the National Archives and Records Administration. NARA accepts such materials for reference purposes only and maintains them for public use so long as the technology and software permit. However, NARA does not take extraordinary measures to ensure long-term access or preservation of the content, and such a transfer does not meet the publishing agency's obligation for transfer of the information to NARA for preservation. 20  Page 21   GOAL 7:  Ensure that the program is cost-effective for all parties involved, including Government publishing agencies, GPO, depository libraries, and the public.  Historical Model The FDLP exemplifies how a Federal program can provide an essential public service with a modest investment that is returned many fold by the participation of partners in the communities that benefit from the service. In this instance, the partner libraries share the responsibilities and the costs to assure broad public access to Government information products in their local communities. In the traditional FDLP model, there are a variety of costs associated with providing public access to Government information products. The Government bears only a small portion of these costs when it pays for the printing, distribution, and cataloging of publications and information products to depository libraries. The division of production costs for depository copies of Government print publications is clearly defined in 44 U.S.C. 1903. It states that: The cost of printing and binding those publications distributed to depository libraries obtained elsewhere than from the Government Printing Office, shall be borne by components of the Government responsible for their issuance; those requisitioned from the Government Printing Office shall be charged to appropriations provided the Superintendent of Documents for that purpose. The division of production costs for electronic information products are not specifically addressed in 44 U.S.C. Chapter 19 because these costs are not associated with ""printing and binding."" However, GPO handles the replication of CD-ROM discs, and the payment for software licenses associated with CD-ROM titles, in a manner consistent with this provision. Most of the material distributed to depository libraries in print and microfiche is produced or procured by Federal agencies through GPO. The centralized production and distribution of depository materials through GPO offers significant economies of scale. For example, in FY 1995 GPO distributed more than 16.7 million copies of 44,734 different titles, at an average cost of $1.36 per copy. Centralized funding of the FDLP also facilitates Congressional oversight of the program, thereby deterring misuse or mismanagement of appropriated funds. Depository libraries, composed of both public and private institutions, bear the bulk of the costs for public access to Government information. They supply the funds for the processing, use, storage and housing of depository information products. This includes providing support staff, facilities, equipment, and telecommunications. Depository libraries typically spend three to five times the dollar value of the Government information products they receive in support of public access to their depository collections.21 Strategic Plan GPO and other study participants have noted that there is a need for more in-depth and concrete data on the life cycle costs to the Government for creating, disseminating and providing permanent access to its information products, to depository libraries for providing public access to them, and to the public for using them. However, the transition to electronic dissemination of Government information is still in its early stages, so it is doubtful that reliable and conclusive data on life cycle costs could be gathered in this rapidly-evolving period. Nevertheless, the assessment of standards proposed in this report is an essential  Robert E. Dugan and Ellen M. Dodsworth, ""Costing Out a Depository Library: What Free Government Information?"" Government Information Quarterly, Volume 11, Number 3 (1994), pages 261-284.  21  Page 22   first step toward the ultimate goal of collecting and analyzing information life cycle costs. It will provide a basis for further consultation with the library community and for discussions with publishing agencies concerning the appropriate standards for cost-effective dissemination of Government information products in formats appropriate to the needs of users and the intended usage. There is no doubt that the transition to electronic dissemination of Government information products changes the costs associated with the administration of, and participation in, the FDLP. Based on the limited data that currently is available concerning life cycle costs, the Strategic Plan outlines a new direction for the program that looks to balance dissemination based on paper and microform with that based on electronic information products, while seeking to maintain a reasonable distribution of costs among publishing agencies, the Government Printing Office, depository libraries and the public. In some instances, the transition to electronic dissemination will provide savings for one of these parties at the price of incurring new costs for another, thus shifting costs between the parties involved rather than reducing costs overall. One example of this shift is the costs associated with providing permanent access to electronic Government information products for public use. In the historical model, the primary cost incurred by regional depository libraries for permanent access to print publications was providing adequate storage space. In the electronic environment, information can be stored more easily and cost-effectively on a computer. However, unlike physical print products that remain relatively stable over long periods of time, electronic information must be migrated to new and different media to prevent deterioration, avoid technological obsolescence, and assure information integrity and quality. This migration requires significant financial resources which, according to the Strategic Plan, are costs for ensuring permanent public access to Government information products that the Government Printing Office and Federal publishing agencies, as well as those depository libraries that choose to act as their partners, will share.22 Costs for migration can be minimized by the adoption and use of open systems standards through the entire life cycle of information products--from the time the original source files are created by the publishing agencies to final preservation by NARA. At the same time, depository libraries and their users will have to pay to print, or purchase printed copies of, information that is needed in print, but no longer disseminated in that format through the FDLP. The Strategic Plan proposes retention of the current level of FDLP funding through the GPO Salaries and Expenses (S&E) appropriation. According to the plan, with adequate agency notification, GPO will continue to ""ride"" and pay for depository copies for tangible electronic information products, whether or not they are produced or procured through GPO. In addition, Task 9 (Attachment D-11), Task 10A (Attachment D-14) and Task 10B (Attachment D-15) all discuss alternatives through which GPO would purchase access to agency electronic information services when an agency is required by law to recover costs for such services. In such scenarios, there will be no copyright-like restrictions on the use or reuse of the information content, but gateway access to the fee-based information services through depository libraries may be restricted or prohibited in order to safeguard the publishing agencies' ability to recover operating costs. Publishing agencies also will be able to transfer to GPO information for which they can no longer support public access on their own electronic information services. GPO will pay to mount, convert and maintain this information on GPO Access for permanent public access or to convert it to CD-ROM or another tangible format for distribution to depository libraries. GPO also may establish partnerships with depository libraries to retain and provide permanent public access to certain types of information. This range of funding options will make electronic dissemination through the FDLP cost-effective for publishing agencies.  For purposes of this report, migration means both: (1) the periodic refreshing or transfer of Government information products from one medium to another in order to minimize loss of information due to physical deterioration of storage media and (2) the reformatting of information to avoid technological obsolescence due to software or platform dependence.  22  Page 23   GPO will realize savings from a reduction in printing and distribution costs associated with the paper and microfiche versions of products it makes available electronically through the FDLP. Funding estimates for the next three to five years indicate that these savings will be sufficient to cover most of the costs for the transition to a more electronic FDLP. Although no one can accurately project today the longterm costs for maintaining permanent access to the electronic information through the FDLP, the assumption remains that new technology will provide more efficient and effective means to disseminate and access this information in the future. The report on Task 10B (Attachment D-15) provides one example of savings that can be projected for the next few years. Providing access to MEDLINE and eliminating paper distribution of just three NLM products to depository libraries could result in annual savings to GPO of more than $338,000, less whatever amount would be paid to NLM for depository access. Similarly, if GPO eliminated paper distribution of the Congressional Serial Set to selective depository libraries and replaced it with a quarterly CD-ROM as discussed in the report on Task 8B (Attachment D-8), the agency could realize cost savings of more than $1 million. However, a CD-ROM version of the Serial Set is feasible only if Congress requires that the component Documents and Reports that are not typeset at GPO be provided to GPO in usable electronic format. Currently up to 80% of the documents and 20% of reports are received by GPO as camera copy. Scanned images created from the camera copy are not consistently searchable and create large files with low resolution quality. There is no conclusive data at this time to support the assertion that electronic dissemination will always save the Government money. As shown in the report on Task 8A (Attachment D-7), there will be times when the cost to the Government for providing permanent public access to electronic Government information products exceeds the one-time costs associated with producing and distributing the same information in print or microform. However, as explained above, there are many instances when dissemination is more cost-effective in electronic format than in paper or microfiche, and even more instances where the information is more timely and/or more useful. The more electronic FDLP as proposed in the Strategic Plan will seek to identify and cultivate those instances when information technology can be used to save the Government money and to enhance and expand public access. Depository libraries will realize cost savings through the reduction in the number of Government information products that they must house and maintain. For example, whereas depository libraries once had to have several shelves of space for the United States Code in print, this same information now is available on a single CD-ROM or online from GPO Access. However, depository libraries will incur new costs for ongoing acquisition and upgrade of software and computer systems, specialized training for staff, and connections to telecommunications networks.23 The Strategic Plan suggests several ways in which GPO can ease the financial burden of the transition on depository libraries. One of these is the establishment and promotion of a limited range of standard formats for FDLP use. This will minimize the costs to depository libraries by reducing the range of platforms and software that the libraries must acquire and support. An assessment to determine appropriate and cost-effective standards for the creation and dissemination of Government information products will be accomplished through a joint project involving GPO and NCLIS. The Strategic Plan also proposes that GPO provide $500,000 in assistance to financially needy depository libraries through one-time technology grants of up to $25,000 per library in FY 1997. In addition, the Strategic Plan proposes in FY 1997 an increase of $20,000 in the statutory limit on Salaries and Expenses Appropriation (S&E) travel and reallocation of a substantial portion of the funds currently used for library inspections in order for GPO to devote additional resources for training and continuing education opportunities for  While the initial costs for a well-equipped public access workstation are comparable to those for a microfiche reader/printer, the personal computer technology is changing rapidly, forcing frequent replacement or upgrading of equipment and software.  23  Page 24   depository librarians. GPO will continue to monitor the technological capabilities of the depository libraries to provide cost-effective public access to electronic Government information products, particularly as it relates to standards utilized by agencies in the creation and dissemination of electronic Government information products. This will include gathering information about the costs of equipment, telecommunications, software, staff training and other depository library expenses for accessing and utilizing electronic Government information products through the FDLP. Users can browse Government information products in any depository library without charge and, in some libraries, users can check out books or CD-ROM titles for short term use at home, in the classroom, or in the office.24 Currently most users must pay to photocopy documents in depository libraries or to print images from microfiche if they wish to obtain their own copies of Government information products. Electronic Government information products may increase the costs to users as fewer items are available for reading in the library without the necessity of paying to print the information first or to obtain diskettes on which to download and save electronic information for later use. Limitations on the time that an individual user can spend at a public access workstation are common and restrict the user's ability to browse Government information products at the computer terminal. These limitations, and delays when a workstation is not available, cost users both time and money. For this reason, GPO also will begin to monitor the costs to users for printing, downloading and similar services using depository library equipment. Finally, while computer literacy is increasing dramatically, many depository library users are not yet conversant with computer technology or are frustrated by the variety of software they must master to utilize electronic Government information. This lack of computer skills delays the user's access to the information and requires additional assistance from library staff.  VII. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS A substantial amount of useful information was gathered and numerous issues and alternatives were identified and examined during the course of the study. These are summarized in this report. A number of specific tasks were identified to provide information and alternatives for consideration. The preparation of the task force reports and the review of public comments resulting from their dissemination was the primary fact-finding activity of the study. Each task force report is included as an attachment and is the product of a substantial amount of effort on the part of the task leader and participants. Separately, a document entitled the Electronic Federal Depository Library Program: Transition Plan, FY 1996 - FY 1998 was developed by GPO and included with its FY 1997 appropriations request. Public comments in response to this document also provided useful information to the study participants, and led directly to the development of the Federal Depository Library Program: Information Dissemination and Access Strategic Plan, FY 1996 - FY 2001, included with this report as Exhibit 1. The Strategic Plan proposes four ways in which GPO can bring electronic information into the FDLP: GPO can identify, describe and link the public to the wealth of distributed Government information products maintained at Government electronic information services for free public use. GPO can establish reimbursable agreements with agencies that provide fee-based  24  Loan policies vary from library to library.

GPO can ""ride"" agency requisitions and pay for depository copies of tangible electronic information products, such as CD-ROM discs, even if they are not produced or procured through GPO.  -  GPO can obtain from agencies electronic source files for information the agencies do not wish to disseminate through their own Government electronic information services. These files can be made available through the GPO Access services or disseminated to depository libraries in CD-ROM or other tangible format.  Section V, Policy Issues that Impact Publishing Agencies, GPO, NARA, Depository Libraries, the Public and the Private Sector, summarizes the major issues identified in the course of the study process. While many of these issues are not new, this study has examined the issues in the new context of the rapid shift of the FDLP into a more electronic program. The major conclusions of the study are summarized below: Scope of the FDLP: There is widespread interest in expanding the content of the program to make it more comprehensive, and a great deal of optimism that the rapid expansion of agency electronic publishing offers cost-effective options to do so. Nevertheless, the highest priority remains the retention of information content that historically has been in the program and is rapidly leaving it as agencies move from print to electronic publishing or eliminate Government information products to save costs. Notification and Compliance: The historical program relied heavily on the ability of the FDLP to obtain material as it was printed or procured through GPO. With the increasing emphasis on electronic dissemination and decreasing compliance with statutory requirements for agencies to print through GPO, identifying and obtaining information for the FDLP is becoming increasingly difficult. There must be new means to inform agencies of their responsibilities and to ensure compliance with agency FDLP obligations. There must be effective means for all three branches of Government to notify GPO of their intent to: (1) initiate, (2) substantially modify, or (3) terminate Government information products. This includes Government information products in all formats, including information available from Government electronic information services, such as agency World Wide Web sites. Permanent Access to Authentic Information: The FDLP has the responsibility for providing permanent public access to the official Government information products disseminated through the program.25 Historically, permanent access has been the role of the regional depository libraries, and this has been a cost-effective means of ensuring that Government information products remained available to the public indefinitely. Permanent access also is an essential element of the electronic depository library program, but it will be more difficult to attain. To ensure permanent public access to official electronic Government information products, all of the institutional program stakeholders (information producing agencies, GPO, depository libraries and NARA) must cooperate to establish authenticity, provide persistent identification and description of Government information products, and establish appropriate arrangements for its continued accessibility. This includes identification and implementation of standard formats for FDLP  Permanent access is required by 44 U.S.C. 1911: ""Depository libraries not served by a regional depository library, or that are regional depository libraries themselves, shall retain Government publications permanently in either printed form or in microfacsimile form, except superseded publications or those issued later in bound form which may be discarded as authorized by the Superintendent of Documents.""  25  Page 26   dissemination26 and providing for the technological currency of the electronic information products available at GPO for remote access. In the case of tangible information products, permanent access will remain a responsibility of regional depository libraries, while in the case of remotely accessible information products, it will be the responsibility of GPO, as the administrator of the FDLP, to coordinate a distributed system that provides continuous, permanent public access. Locator Services: Together, the Cataloging and Indexing Program required by 44 U.S.C. 1710 and 1711 and the Locator Services required by 44 U.S.C. 4101 provide the statutory basis for GPO to assist depository libraries and the public to identify and obtain access to the full range of Government information. In a distributed environment, where libraries and users often access Government electronic information services rather than local collections, tools for identifying and locating information will be critical components of an effective program. Timetable for Implementation: The Transition Plan, submitted with the GPO FY 1997 appropriations request, projected an ambitious, two and one-half year schedule for conversion to a more electronic FDLP (FY 1996 to FY 1998). Input from publishing agencies and depository libraries indicates a five to seven year transition would be more realistic and cost-effective since it would allow GPO to convert to electronic information at the same pace as publishing agencies can produce it and depository libraries can absorb it. It will be substantially more costly for GPO to convert agency print publications to electronic formats than it will be to work in partnership with the agencies, assisting them in accelerating their own electronic publishing initiatives. Consequently, the Strategic Plan attached to the report as Exhibit 1 proposes a transition period of FY 1996 through FY 2001. Assessment of Standards for Creation and Dissemination of Electronic Government Information Products: For the successful implementation of a more electronic FDLP, the Congress, GPO and the library community must have additional information about future agency publishing plans, as well as an expert evaluation of the cost-effectiveness and usefulness of various electronic formats that may be utilized for depository library dissemination or access. A central implementation issue is the identification and utilization of standards for creation and dissemination of electronic Government information products. These standards would enhance access to and use of Government information by both the Government and the public. The Government produces an enormous quantity and variety of information. The standards best suited for one type of data may be substantially less suited, or even entirely inappropriate, for another. Consequently, there is no single standard in which all Government information products can, or should, be created or disseminated. Nevertheless, it is in the best interests of the Government, and those who use Government information, to achieve a greater degree of standardization than now exists, and to develop recommended standards for each major type of Government information product in order to facilitate the exchange and use of that information. To accomplish this, it is first necessary to know the range of formats Federal agencies currently use in the creation and dissemination of information and to assess the de facto or actual standards that are in use for each major type of data. It also is necessary to identify areas where there is no standardization, or such limited standardization that the effect is virtually the same. Finally, it would be useful to evaluate standards utilized by private sector and other non-governmental publishers. This information will provide the basis for an assessment, in consultation with the depository library community, of the usefulness and cost-effectiveness of various electronic formats for depository library dissemination or access. It also will be the basis for a dialog with the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA), the National Commission on Libraries and Information Science (NCLIS), the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), and others with an interest in establishing and promulgating Government-wide standards for information creation and dissemination.  Additional conclusions related to the requirement for assessment of standards for creation and dissemination of electronic Government information products are provided on the next page.  26  Page 27   GPO is proposing to accomplish this data gathering and evaluation through a joint effort with NCLIS. As an independent Federal agency established to advise the President and the Congress on national policies related to library and information services adequate to meet the needs of the people of the United States, NCLIS is uniquely situated to coordinate this activity. While substantial changes are already underway, this assessment of standards for creation and dissemination of electronic Government information products should proceed as rapidly as possible in order to assure a successful and costeffective transition to a more electronic FDLP. Cost of Electronic Information Dissemination: While there are many benefits inherent in the use of electronic information, including more timely and broader public access, there is no conclusive data at this time to support the assertion that it will result in significant savings to the program as a whole in the next few years. Based on comments received, electronic dissemination and access will shift the costs among the program participants. For example, GPO will incur additional, recurring costs to provide permanent public access through its electronic information services, as will other Government agencies that maintain information products through their own services. Costs for migration can be minimized by the adoption and use of open systems standards through the entire life cycle of information products--from the time the original source files are created by the publishing agencies to final preservation by NARA. Similarly, depository libraries and their users will have to pay to print, or purchase printed copies of, information that is needed in print, but is no longer disseminated in the format through the FDLP. At the same time, depository libraries will have to provide specialized staff training, public access workstations, software and the related services necessary to connect the public to remotely accessible Government electronic information services. GPO will continue to monitor the technological capabilities of the depository libraries to provide cost-effective public access to electronic Government information products, particularly as it relates to the standards utilized by agencies in the creation and dissemination of electronic Government information products. GPO also will begin to monitor the costs to users for printing, downloading and similar services using depository library equipment. GPO and other study participants have noted that there is a need for more in-depth and concrete data on the life cycle costs to the Government for creating, disseminating and providing permanent access to its information products, to depository libraries for providing public access to them, and to the public for using them. However, the transition to electronic dissemination of Government information is still in its early stages, so it is doubtful that reliable and conclusive data on life cycle costs could be gathered in this rapidly evolving period. Nevertheless, the assessment of standards proposed in this report is an essential first step toward the ultimate goal of collecting and analyzing information life cycle costs. It will provide a basis for further consultation with the library community and for discussions with publishing agencies concerning the appropriate standards for cost-effective dissemination of Government information products in formats appropriate to the needs of users and the intended usage. The assessment also will provide valuable information to Congress for the future development of appropriate and cost-effective Government information policies and programs. Legislative Changes: Substantial changes in the FDLP already are underway within the context of the existing statute. Nevertheless, certain key legislative changes could be made in order to assure a successful and cost-effective transition to a more electronic FDLP. These changes are discussed in the report on Task 6 (Attachment D-5) and many of them are reflected in the preceding conclusions.

The Committee recognizes the critically important service that the Government Printing Office and participating libraries in the Federal Depository Library Program provide to citizens throughout the country in furnishing timely, equitable access to Government information. The dramatic advances in technology provide new opportunities for enhancing and improving public access. However, the increasing utilization of electronic technologies in support of dissemination programs by all branches of government requires careful analysis, planning, and probable restructuring of the current program. Without this analysis, planning, and a strongly coordinated effort, improvements to the program will be delayed, costly, and very well may compromise the public's right to Government information. The Committee believes the planning should incorporate the goals of equitable, efficient, timely, and dependable access to Government information. The Committee supports a strong coordinated effort between the respective oversight and appropriation committees, the Government Printing Office, executive branch agencies, participating depository libraries, and other relevant and appropriate organizations. To this end, the Committee directs the Public Printer to initiate a study, under the direction of the Committee, that: --Examines the functions and services of the Federal Depository Library Program; --Surveys current technological capabilities of the participating libraries in the Federal Depository Library Program; --Surveys current and future information dissemination plans of executive branch agencies; --Examines and suggests improvements for agency compliance of relevant laws, regulations, and policies regarding Government information dissemination; --Identifies measures that are necessary to ensure a successful transition to a more electronically based program; --Identifies the possible expansion of the array of Federal information products and services made available to participating libraries; and --Ensures the most cost-efficient program to the taxpayer. The study shall include a strategic plan that will assist the Congress in redefining a new and strengthened Federal information dissemination policy and program. In conducting the study, it will be important for the Public Printer to work closely with the respective oversight and appropriation committees, executive branch agencies, other distributors of Federal documents and information products, the Library of Congress, the depository library community, the National Technical Information Service, users, the information industry, and other appropriate organizations. The completed study shall be available to Congress by March 1996.

The fiscal year 1997 budget submission of the Public Printer to the Congress for the Government Printing Office shall include appropriations requests and recommendations to the Congress that-(1) are consistent with the strategic plan included in the technological study performed by the Public Printer pursuant to Senate Report 104-114; (2) assure substantial progress toward maximum use of electronic information dissemination technologies by all departments, agencies, and other entities of the Government with respect to the Depository Library Program and information dissemination generally; and (3) are formulated so as to require that any department, agency, or other entity of the Government that does not make such progress shall bear from its own resources the cost of its information dissemination by other than electronic means. And the Senate agree to the same.  House Report 104-212: Conference Report on H.R. 1854: FY 1996 Legislative Branch Appropriations (Pages 14-15) Amendment numbered 34: Deletes a House provision stricken by the Senate which would have amended section 1903 of Title 44, and inserts a provision directing the Public Printer to include in the fiscal year 1997 budget submission a proposal for the depository library program that will result in the conversion of this program to electronic format. The Public Printer is directed to propose a means to create cost incentives for publishing agencies, including the Congress, to migrate from print-on paper products to electronic format. The conferees direct that the Public Printer and Superintendent of Documents consult with the Joint Committee on Printing, House and Senate document publishing managers, and appropriate executive branch officials in the development of the fiscal year 1997 budget program. The conferees also do not intend that the study directed in the Senate report or the plan regarding electronic format should interfere with the activities of the authorizing committees to consider legislation amending Title 44, U.S. Code, or any legislative initiative which will improve the Federal printing program.

This TIA contract was to obtain additional information about future agency publishing plans and current depository library capabilities, as well as an expert evaluation of the costeffectiveness and usefulness of various electronic formats that may be selected for depository library distribution or access. During the public comment period, the concept of the TIA was refined further into the Assessment of Standards for Creation and Dissemination of Electronic Government Information Products, which is described below. For the successful implementation of a more electronic FDLP, the Congress, GPO and the library community must have additional information about future agency publishing plans, as well as an expert evaluation of the cost-effectiveness and usefulness of various electronic formats that may be utilized for depository library dissemination or access. A central implementation issue is the identification and utilization of standards for creation and dissemination of electronic Government information products. These standards would enhance access to, and use of, Government information both by the Government and the public. The Government produces an enormous quantity and variety of information. The standards best suited for one type of data may be substantially less suited, or even entirely inappropriate, for another. Consequently, there is no single standard in which all Government information products can, or should, be created or disseminated. Nevertheless, it is in the best interests of the Government, and those who use Government information, to achieve a greater degree of standardization than now exists, and to develop recommended standards for each major type of Government information product in order to facilitate the exchange and use of this information. To accomplish this, it is first necessary to know the range of formats Federal agencies currently use in the creation and dissemination of information and to assess the de facto or actual standards that are in use for each major type of data. It also is necessary to identify areas where there is no standardization, or such limited standardization that the effect is virtually the same. Finally, it would be useful to evaluate standards utilized by private sector and other non-governmental publishers. This information will provide the basis for an assessment, in consultation with the depository library community, of the usefulness and cost-effectiveness of various electronic formats for depository library dissemination or access. It also will be the basis for a dialog with the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA), the National Commission on Libraries and Information Science (NCLIS), the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), and others with an interest in establishing and promulgating Government-wide standards for information creation and dissemination. GPO is proposing to accomplish this data gathering and evaluation through a joint effort with NCLIS. As an independent Federal agency established to advise the President and the Congress on national policies related to library and information services adequate to meet the needs of the people of the United States, NCLIS is uniquely situated to coordinate this activity. While substantial changes already are underway, this assessment of standards for the creation and dissemination of electronic Government information products should proceed as rapidly as possible in order to assure a successful and costeffective transition to a more electronic FDLP.

INTRODUCTION The FY 1996 Legislative Branch Appropriations Senate Report (104-114) contained language directing the conduct of a study that: examines the functions and services of the Federal Depository Library Program, including technological capabilities of the participating libraries; surveys current and future dissemination plans of executive branch agencies; suggests improvements for agency compliance with relevant laws and policies regarding Government information dissemination; and identifies necessary measures to ensure transition to a more electronically based and cost-efficient program.  -  -  As part of this effort, the Congressional Research Service (CRS) was asked to prepare a compilation of statutes authorizing the dissemination of government information to the public. The methodology employed involved searching for relationships of variant forms of keywords in the text portion of the Westlaw online database of The United States Code Annotated. The searches were repeated to allow for all possible word combination and synonyms. The results of these searches were then reviewed by CRS staff to eliminate irrelevant items and identify statutes of known relevance that did not emerge from the searches. Known statutes were retrieved by citation. This process was reiterated until CRS staff had a degree of confidence in the results. The initial searching was conducted in October, 1995, with additional searches performed throughout the revision process. Statutes mandating the publication of information in the Federal Register or reports to Congress were eliminated. House Document 104-15, prepared by the Clerk of the House, identifies statutory requirements for reports to Congress. Also eliminated were statutes allowing only public examination of agency records, but not calling for affirmative public dissemination. Particular reports and documents specified in Chapter 5, Title 2 and Chapter 13 of Title 44 were not included because there is no language specifically indicating public dissemination. This methodology, which relies heavily on online searching of a massive database, cannot ensure that all relevant statutory provisions are identified. Thus, a preliminary draft was distributed for review by others, including executive branch personnel, who identified other statutes appropriate for addition to the compilation. We emphasize that this compilation identifies a large survey of statutes providing Federal agencies with authority for disseminating government information to the public, but it cannot be considered exhaustive or definitive. The statutory provisions identified are listed in order by title and section of The United States Code Annotated. In most cases, the entire section is provided to give adequate context, although in some instances editing was done to reduce the volume of the document. The most relevant passages are underlined. A guide to the relevant sections provides listings according to agency and selected topics. A  Page A - 25   given section may appear under several headings depending on its contents. What the guide reflects is that, in addition to broad Government-wide information dissemination policies (e.g., those in Title 44), many agencies have some kind of generic publication or dissemination authority. Further, there are many instances where specific authority is granted for the publication or dissemination of particular kinds of information, the production of information services, or the creation of clearinghouses. Only the index of Federal entities and the topical index are provided in this attachment.

This bibliography includes a selection of articles, books, reports, surveys and documents on subjects related to the FDLP Study. It is far from comprehensive, but attempts to include a variety of materials and a mix of policy investigations and technical studies. When they were located, Universal Resource Locators (URL's) are provided for materials which are available through the Internet. Materials on the bibliography are grouped into seven general areas: * * * * * * * Information Access Policy and Practice Reports and Articles from Depository Library Conferences, Librarians, and Library Associations Surveys on Access to Technologies Archiving and Preservation of Electronic Information Technology and the National Information Infrastructure Selected Congressional Hearings and Reports Government Printing Office Studies  INFORMATION ACCESS POLICY AND PRACTICE Both general and specific issues relating to Government information access policy are explored from a variety of viewpoints in the articles, reports and books listed here. Issues of equity and access appear in many of the publications. Comprehensive overviews are found in the Hernon and Perritt studies, among others. The public's use is investigated in reports from Bauman Foundation, OMB Watch, and Ryan and McClure.

METHODOLOGY Input was solicited from the two main agency sources involved in publishing and distribution of Government information: Information Resource Management (IRM) Officers and Printing Officers. This task was most relevant to the Printing Officers since the request from Congress was to identify cost incentives to migrate from print products to electronic format. However, IRM Officers were included in order to identify the opportunities for, and obstacles to, including agency electronic information products in the FDLP. From interviewing associates in the two fields, it is apparent that there is a definite difference of opinion on possible incentives for participation in the FDLP. Also, due to the differing procedural functions of the two entities, it was necessary to approach this task from two different perspectives. BACKGROUND Printing Management The printing community is very familiar with 44 U.S.C. Chapter 19 and the Federal Depository Library Program (FDLP). It appears that in this arena there are real possibilities for an effective incentive program. Virtually all publications are made available to the FDLP automatically through the GPO printing procurement process. Only publications procured outside the GPO procurement process, ""fugitive documents,"" fail to be considered for the FDLP. Printing management responses indicate a real perceived value to participation in the FDLP and an appreciation for the incentives already implicit in the current structure, i.e. that GPO pays for printing depository copies when a publication is printed or procured through GPO. Currently, approximately 50% of all printing requests submitted to GPO are submitted in an electronic format, but these encompass a wide variety of formats. While this 50% is a basis for electronic distribution, it will require reformatting by the agencies or GPO to put the Government information products in formats useful to and useable by depository libraries. If it becomes mandatory for GPO to make publications available to the FDLP in an electronic format, printing managers fear that the originating office could become responsible for creating, or reformatting, the document in a format suitable for FDLP distribution. If that occurs, it will be an administrative burden on the originating agencies as well as an additional expense, and therefore, a major disincentive to participation in the FDLP. This might lead to more fugitive documents. Since GPO is the recommended procurement office for Federal printing and the coordinator for the FDLP system, it is reasonable to assume that a program to enhance the FDLP system should start with the GPO. With its FY 1997 budget justification, GPO included the Electronic Federal Depository Library Program: Transition Plan, FY 1996 - FY 1998 (known as the Transition Plan) which sought continued funding and the authority for GPO to create, or reformat, electronic Government information products for distribution through the FDLP.27  Information Resources Management (IRM) 27  Public comments in response to this document led directly to the development of the Electronic Federal Depository Library Program: Information Dissemination and Access Strategic Plan, FY 1996 - FY 2001, included with this report as Exhibit 1.  Page A - 49   Unlike Printing Management, the typical IRM office is unaware of 44 U.S.C. Chapter 19 requirements and the FDLP. There is little doubt that the IRM community has moved into the electronic information management age. With the advent of the Internet, more specifically the World Wide Web (Web), public access to Government information products has reached new levels. Virtually all publications that involve IRM routinely are evaluated for dissemination through agencies' Web servers. However, Government information products made available directly to an IRM office may not be intended to be printed. Likewise, documents made to be printed may not be submitted to an IRM office. A key problem is that an IRM office often does not know what publications have been made available to GPO for printing and likewise the publications being printed often are not made available to an IRM office. It is apparent that the two entities do not communicate as thoroughly as necessary, therefore, information products are missed by both offices. There are many legitimate reasons why this happens, but subject matter and audience appear to be major considerations in determining whether an information product goes to print-on-paper or to the IRM community. Typical IRM offices see no incentive to make Government information products available electronically through the FDLP. The belief is that as long as these products are made available to the public via the Web, their mission of providing information to the American public is complete because the information is available to anyone who has access to a computer and the Internet. This overlooks the necessity to provide Government information products to those who do not have Internet access and a computer, as well as the need to provide permanent access, both of which currently are assured by the FDLP. It should be noted that if the FDLP continues, the general consensus in the IRM community is that all depository libraries should be required to include a minimum standard of computer equipment, including at the absolute minimum: CD-ROM readers, network connections, download and printing capabilities. In fact, this has occurred and the minimum technical guidelines become requirements in October 1996. General Conclusions Although several specific alternatives for new incentives were developed and are discussed below, the strongest incentive identified during this task was, in fact, the one that exists in the current program: make participation as effortless and automatic as possible and at no cost to the agency. One agency official summarized this by saying ""first do no harm,"" i.e. don't distract the agencies from their primary missions or require the expenditure of any of their increasingly scarce resources. The current system where GPO rides agency print orders at its own expense means that merely by printing through GPO, as required by 44 U.S.C., FDLP participation is ensured at no cost to the agency. Whatever new mechanisms are put in place, a more electronic FDLP must provide an equally simple and cost-effective means for agency participation. DISSEMINATION ALTERNATIVES Incentive A Establish an electronic information management function within the Superintendent of Documents. This would be similar to the current system of publication identification and review via GPO Form 3868 (Notification of Intent to Publish) and the SF-1 (Printing and Binding Requisition), where all Government information products are reviewed to establish the requirements for depository library distribution as part of the publication process. The electronic information management function would assume those current duties and add to that a determination of balance between electronic requirements and printing needs. It is anticipated that the number of print-on-paper copies will be greatly reduced by this process. GPO would utilize to the extent possible electronic information products received from agencies and, when necessary, create or procure alternative formats useful to and useable by depository libraries and the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA). GPO, in conjunction with the depository libraries and within Page A - 50   its available funding, could provide remote access to electronic Government information products or disseminate it in a tangible form such as CD-ROM. Electronic information products included in the FDLP also would be transferred to NARA at the appropriate time and in formats acceptable to NARA. It should be noted that this transfer would not relieve the publishing agency of its archival responsibility without a change in the law or archival regulations. Benefits This would not affect the procurement process of GPO. It would reduce the number of print-on-paper copies needed for the FDLP, thereby reducing the total cost of printing to GPO. Agencies could continue to meet public requests for their Government information products by referring inquiries to depository libraries. Agencies would continue to submit documents to GPO in the same manner with no additional burden or cost. GPO remains the main focal point for a significant portion of the documents entering the FDLP. This would not adversely affect the current printing procurement procedure, but would continue to funnel documents through a central point for dissemination to the public. This alternative allows for standardization of formats of publications for electronic dissemination. Standard formatting is a cause for great concern among all Federal agencies including GPO and NARA. It is widely accepted that this is probably the most imposing task we face in electronic publishing today. This would also provide the option for the agencies to receive their own electronic information products back from GPO in one of the standardized formats at little or no additional cost to the agency. Reformatting to standard formats by GPO relieves the submitting agency from encumbering their current process. This encourages participation in the FDLP by eliminating the cost for reformatting each publication for electronic dissemination. At the same time, it guarantees widespread distribution of agency information products. Whenever it is possible and cost-effective to do so, GPO will reformat agency information products into formats suitable for preservation and will transfer them to NARA at the appropriate time. With the necessary change in law or archival regulations, providing electronic information products to GPO for FDLP distribution in these instances also would fulfill an agency's obligation to NARA.  -  -  -  -  -  -  Disadvantages/Problems GPO will incur additional costs for reformatting, providing access to and storing electronic Government information products. Some types of reformatting would result in GPO, rather than the agency, assuming responsibility for the accuracy of the content. If the agency provides GPO with camera copy instead of machine readable data, and is unwilling or unable to provide some electronic format, GPO must scan the information product for dissemination. Unless scanning is done at a high resolution, the image files produced will be only slightly better than microfiche. If  scanning is done at higher resolutions, it will be difficult to provide the image files through the GPO electronic information services due to the slower and more limited access methods that many depository libraries currently use to access such services. This will not influence the IRM managers who have never used and may be unfamiliar with the Page A - 51   traditional print channels at GPO, so it will not be a comprehensive solution. Incentive B For agencies who wish to maintain access to their electronic information products themselves, encourage participation in the FDLP by offering to have the GPO Pathway locator services direct users to the agency Web sites. Also, offer to provide permanent access through the FDLP when the agency no longer has the desire or resources to maintain their electronic information products on their Internet sites. Partnerships between GPO and these agencies could be formalized through interagency agreements. Electronic information products transferred to GPO for the FDLP also would be transferred to NARA at the appropriate time and in formats acceptable to NARA. It should be noted that this transfer would not relieve the publishing agency of its archival responsibility without a change in the law or archival regulations. Benefits More electronic information products are brought ""officially"" into the FDLP. Public access is improved because the GPO Pathway locator services provide a centralized mechanism for finding electronic Government information products on multiple Government Web sites. Permanent access to electronic Government information products through the FDLP is maintained. Whenever it is possible and cost-effective to do so, GPO will reformat agency information products into formats suitable for preservation and will transfer them to NARA at the appropriate time. With the necessary change in law or archival regulations, providing its electronic information products to GPO for FDLP distribution in these instances also would fulfill an agency's obligation to NARA.  -  Disadvantages/Problems Depository libraries that currently have little or no Web access cannot access electronic Government information products on these sites. This disadvantage will be reduced over time as depository libraries upgrade their equipment and Internet access. The willingness of GPO to provide permanent access is not an incentive for agencies to convert from print to electronic format, although it does have the potential to bring additional Government electronic information products into the FDLP.  -  ISSUES TO BE ADDRESSED Need for Central Management of Public Access and Dissemination The Government Printing Office is an important cog in the Federal Government procurement system. GPO has been very effective in procuring a myriad of crosscutting services far beyond simple printing. This is accomplished at the best price and quality level available in the United States. In the Government printing community there is a heavy reliance on the expertise and guidance of GPO staff in addition to printing procurement. While the information management community may be decentralized, there should remain a central focal point and coordinated means for assuring public access to Government information products. As stated earlier, GPO is the recommended procurement source for Federal printing and is the coordinator for the FDLP. It is reasonable to assume that any program should only enhance what GPO now provides better than any other source. The natural progression is to Page A - 52   begin making GPO the Federal Government's information manager for public dissemination of Government information products. Standard Formats for Electronic Government Information Products The need for standard formats has been a key issue for a number of years. Now is an excellent time to address it. If standard formats are implemented, expenditures could be reduced in preparation, printing, distribution, storage and retrieval, archiving, and use of electronic Government information products. Education and Outreach Many agency IRM and program managers are unaware of the FDLP and their obligations to the program under 44 U.S.C. Chapter 19 and OMB Circular A-130. Some of those who are aware do not recognize the value of the program in providing public access to their electronic information products. To influence these managers it may be necessary to implement an outreach program highlighting what the FDLP is, the role it plays in providing public access to Government information, and agency obligations to the FDLP. The difficulty will be in locating those people within an agency who need to be contacted as responsibilities for dissemination of information becomes increasingly decentralized.

Changes to 44 U.S.C. Chapter 19 would facilitate the transition to a more electronic Federal Depository Library Program (FDLP). The changes discussed below support the FDLP Study Report, particularly Section III, Principles for Federal Government Information, and Section IV, Mission and Goals for the Federal Depository Library Program. SCOPE OF INFORMATION IN THE FDLP Electronic Information to be Included Electronic Government information products must be included in the FDLP in order to provide the broadest possible public access. The current definition of ""government publication"" in 44 U.S.C. 1901 needs to be broadened to include, without question, electronic information products. The following language, which would substitute new definitions, is one way to accomplish this: ""Government information"" means Government publications, or other Government information products, regardless of form or format, created or compiled by employees of a Government agency, or at Government expense, or as required by law. ""Government information product"" means a discrete set of Government information, either conveyed in a tangible physical format including electronic media, or made publicly accessible via a Government electronic information service. ""Government electronic information service"" means the system or method by which an agency or its authorized agent provides public access to Government information products via a telecommunications network. The purpose of this language is to broaden the scope of the chapter to include information in electronic formats, whether published as a tangible product or made accessible via a Government electronic information service. ""Cooperative Publications"" Exclusion Another consensus emerged from the Task 6 participants, as well as the broader FDLP Study working group relating to 44 U.S.C.  1903. This section permits the exclusion from the FDLP of ""so-called cooperative publications which must necessarily be sold in order to be self-sustaining."" This exclusion has resulted in Government information of significant public interest being kept out of the FDLP. In the view of the Task 6 participants this exclusion should be eliminated.  Page A - 57   Fee-based Electronic Services The general public, through the FDLP, should have no-fee access to all Government information products meeting FDLP requirements. However, attaining this goal is often at odds with statutory or other requirements on agencies that fees be charged for access to their electronic information services. This situation might be resolved in two ways. Through legislative action, agencies could be directed to extend no-fee access to the public through depository libraries. Alternatively, funds appropriated to the Superintendent of Documents for the FDLP could be used to purchase depository library access from the originating agencies. How Information Is Made Available The decentralized characteristics of the electronic information environment make it impractical for any single organization to obtain all electronic information products for access and preservation, nor is such an approach cost-effective. Both FDLP Study working group and Task 6 participants envision that GPO would make information available to depository libraries and the public in a variety of ways. The centralized acquisition and distribution of tangible products would continue, as this activity has significant value to the depository library community. However, purely electronic Government information products could be accessible from a variety of Government electronic information services, including the GPO Access services. This could include services operated by the originating agencies or other entities acting as their agents, or by secondary disseminators. Language such as the following would clarify this approach: The Superintendent of Documents shall make tangible products available through distribution to program libraries and shall direct program libraries and the general public to Government information products available via Government electronic information services. Obtaining Copies of Products not Produced through GPO Sometimes electronic Government information products are not included in the FDLP because they are not produced or procured through the Government Printing Office. The Task 6 participants agreed that the Superintendent of Documents should be authorized to use appropriated funds to obtain, on an incremental cost basis, copies of tangible electronic information products, particularly CD-ROM titles, which are produced or procured elsewhere than through GPO. Agencies shall notify the Superintendent of Documents of tangible electronic information products which are to be produced or procured elsewhere than through the Government Printing Office and establish procedures whereby the Superintendent of Documents may obtain copies on an incremental cost basis. Electronic Source Files As nearly all Government information products exist in electronic form at some point in their life cycle, most FDLP Study participants concurred that the most cost-effective method of incorporating additional electronic information products into the FDLP was to obtain that source data from the originating agency. The following language provides one approach to obtaining these source data files: Upon request of the Superintendent of Documents, agencies shall provide the Superintendent of Documents with electronic source data files of any Government information products falling within Page A - 58   the scope of this Section. PERMANENT PUBLIC ACCESS TO GOVERNMENT INFORMATION Historically, the FDLP, through the mechanism of the regional depository libraries, has guaranteed permanent access to tangible Government information products. With respect to purely electronic Government information, there is no parallel mechanism to ensure that this information is maintained for permanent public access. Nearly all of the FDLP Study participants and FDLP stakeholders have raised issues concerned with maintaining electronic Government information products for permanent public access. The Task 6 participants agreed that GPO, as the administrator of the FDLP, should coordinate the development of a distributed system including the publishing agencies, GPO, the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA), and depository libraries for such purposes. The following language is one way to accomplish this: The Superintendent of Documents will coordinate with issuing agencies, the National Archives and Records Administration, and with regional and other program libraries to establish a system so that Government information products available via Government electronic information services will be maintained permanently for program library and general public access. This system will utilize as one component the electronic storage facility established by the Superintendent of Documents under the provisions of Section 4101, Chapter 41, Title 44, U.S. Code. REQUIREMENTS FOR DEPOSITORY LIBRARIES Public Service Depository libraries are expected to provide no-fee public access to Government information products included in the FDLP. For tangible information products, all but the regional depository libraries may select what products they wish to receive and add to their collections, based on their assessment of local needs. For purely electronic Government information, depository libraries are expected to provide no-fee public access to all such information provided under the aegis of the FDLP. FDLP electronic information products may be accessible from GPO Access, or the SOD Pathway locator services may direct and link users to other agencies' electronic information services. The Task 6 participants agreed that the commitment to provide public service should be emphasized as a responsibility of any depository library. Language such as the following, which expands upon Section 1909, could clarify this point: Only a library able to properly maintain and provide public access to Government information and located in an area where it can best serve the public need, and within an area not already adequately served by existing program libraries may be designated ...  Retention and Disposal of Government Information In addition, a need to clarify and update the retention requirements on both regional and selective Page A - 59   depository libraries was identified. This could be accomplished, in part, by removing the specific five-year retention requirement from the statute, and allowing libraries to dispose of Government information products as authorized under guidelines to be issued by the Superintendent of Documents; and in part by the language such as the following: Regional program libraries shall permanently retain at least one copy of all Government information products originally distributed either in printed, microform, or tangible electronic form, except superseded publications or those issued later in bound form which may be discarded. Other Program libraries may dispose of government information products as authorized by the Superintendent of Documents. Such language would clarify that the regional depository libraries' responsibilities for retaining copies of tangible products, e.g. books, maps, CD-ROM titles, etc., are not extended automatically to electronic information products made accessible via Government electronic information services. Instead, regional depository libraries could elect to participate in the development of a distributed system for providing permanent public access to Government electronic information products. NOTIFICATION In order for the FDLP to function effectively in a decentralized electronic environment, timely notice is required so that GPO personnel can obtain and/or convert data and provide locator services. A requirement is needed that publishing components notify the Superintendent of Documents at such time as they initiate, substantially modify, or terminate Government information products. The following language is one way to accomplish this: Agencies shall notify the Superintendent of Documents of their intent to initiate any Government information product and shall notify the Superintendent of Documents at such time as they substantially modify, or terminate a product available via a Government electronic information service. COMPLIANCE ISSUES There was a consensus among Task 6 participants that agency compliance with the FDLP requirements of Title 44 has long been an issue. Historically, Section 1903, which authorizes the SOD to pay for copies of products produced or procured through GPO, and which requires agencies to bear the cost of FDLP copies produced other than through GPO, has acted as an incentive for agencies to participate in the program. Nevertheless, there were numerous instances where agencies failed to comply with the Title 44 requirements, and the Section 1903 ""incentive"" is not as effective in its application to information published via a Government electronic information service. Regardless of the reasons for agency non-compliance, the result is that Government information products are unavailable to the public through the FDLP. A consensus emerged among Task 6 participants that statutory language is needed to improve program compliance among the agencies; however, no specific language was proposed.  CATALOGING AND LOCATOR SERVICES Incorporating electronic information into the FDLP poses new challenges to users trying to find what they want. The Task 6 participants perceived a need to coordinate the traditional SOD cataloging activity, Page A - 60   covering tangible information products, with the developing suite of Pathway locator services directing users to information available from Government electronic information services. The following language, which would replace the existing Sections 1710 and 1711, is one way to approach this: The Superintendent of Documents shall provide cataloging and locator services which will direct program libraries and the general public to Government information products. The Superintendent of Documents shall create a comprehensive and timely catalog of tangible Government information products which will be accessible to program libraries and the general public. The Public Printer and the head of each agency shall immediately deliver to the Superintendent of Documents a copy of every tangible Government information product falling within the scope of Chapter 19 of this Title. The Superintendent of Documents shall create an electronic directory of Government information products available via Government electronic information services as required by Section 4101 of Chapter 41, of this Title, which will identify, describe, and dynamically link users to information products available via Government electronic information services. When an agency makes an information product available only via a Government electronic information service, the agency shall immediately furnish information about that product to the Superintendent of Documents to enable the Superintendent of Documents to provide locator services. REDESCRIBING THE PROGRAM TO REFLECT A CHANGING ENVIRONMENT A consensus developed among Task 6 participants that the program should be redescribed to be more reflective of the electronic information environment. ""Depository"" was viewed as strongly linked to the old paradigm of shipping physical products, and did not adequately express the goal of public access to public Government information products. To express this aspect of the program more fully, and to emphasize the affirmative role of agencies to make their information available, the Task 6 participants suggested that the title of Chapter 19 could be changed to: ""Public Access to Government Information through Libraries: The Federal Information Dissemination and Access Program."" New definitions such as the following would support such a change: The ""Federal Information Dissemination and Access Program"" is a nationwide geographicallydispersed system, administered by the Superintendent of Documents, consisting of program libraries acting in partnership with the United States Government, established within this Chapter for the purpose of enabling the general public to have local access to Federal Government information at no cost. This introduced a possible new term, ""program library,"" which would replace the former ""depository library,"" and might be defined as:  ""Program library"" means a depository or other library designated under the provisions of Chapter 19 which maintains tangible Government information products for use by the general public, offers professional assistance in locating and using Government information, and provides local capability for the general public to access Government electronic information services.

METHODOLOGY Contacting Federal publishers concerning their CD-ROM publishing has been a shared effort by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the Government Printing Office (GPO). OMB requested information from the executive branch publishing agencies, and GPO queried selected legislative and judicial branch publishers. Respondents were asked to include detailed information about their CD-ROM publishing activities since FY 1993 and to provide reasons for not including specific CD-ROM titles in the FDLP. The OMB memorandum was done in conjunction with their effort to gather data for the National Information Infrastructure initiative. This task group hoped to identify specific reasons for participation and non-participation in the FDLP, in order to learn what motivates agencies. The responses were not sufficient to support a statistical analysis, but some general conclusions can be drawn from the responses. These results are based on replies from 24 executive branch agencies, 2 legislative branch agencies, and 2 judicial branch organizations. Survey letters were sent to 35 executive agencies, including all cabinet level agencies. All cabinet level agencies except the Department of State responded, although State does have at least one CD-ROM title in the FDLP. However, the responses from many cabinet level agencies were obviously incomplete. For example, both the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) and Bureau of the Census responded to the survey, but other Commerce agencies such as NTIS and NOAA which have major CD-ROM publishing programs did not respond. In order to gain additional perspective on the agency responses, GPO gathered additional data from two sources. Records on CD-ROM titles in the FDLP were extracted from GPO's Acquisition, Classification, and Shipment Information System (ACSIS) and this information was compared with the CD-ROM titles reported by the agencies, in order to determine if GPO had distributed any CD-ROM titles which agencies reported as not in the FDLP. GPO staff also reviewed records from the 1995 SIGCAT Compendium, a voluntary listing of CD-ROM titles, most of which are published by Federal Government agencies. Although the Compendium data is not directly comparable to the results from the OMB and GPO survey because of a different time period and other parameters, it did provide another means to assess agency responses. SURVEY RESULTS The survey responses identified 215 CD-ROM titles. The agency responses identified only 91 (42.3%) as being distributed to depository libraries. An additional 27 titles (12.6%) were identified by GPO as being included in the FDLP, even though the publishing agencies stated that those title were not included. Therefore, altogether, 118 (54.8%) of the 215 titles identified by publishing agencies are in the FDLP. Three agencies, the Census Bureau, Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), and the Page A - 65  -   Department of Education, accounted for 71 (78.0%) of the 91 CD-ROM titles reported by agencies as included in the FDLP. GPO records indicated that another 16 of the titles reported by these three agencies were actually in the FDLP, raising the total to 87 of a possible 118 (73.7%). Census reported providing 42 out of 66 CD-ROM titles, or 63.6% of its CD-ROM titles. According to GPO records, Census actually provided 56 of its 66 CD-ROM titles (84.8%). DHHS provided 16 out of 25 CD-ROM titles reported, or 64.0%, and GPO's records confirmed this report. Education acknowledged providing 13 out of 33 CD-ROM titles reported, or 39.3%. According to GPO records, it actually provided 15 titles (45.5%). No reasons for participation in the FDLP were expressed by any of the respondents. No reasons for non-participation were provided for 65 of the 117 titles (55.6%) identified by agencies as not included in the FDLP. Eight CD-ROM titles not included in the FDLP do have comparable titles in the program in paper, although it was not possible to determine if the content is identical. The two most frequent reasons given for non-participation were that the software license imposes a limit on the number of copies distributed (21 responses) and that title was produced or is available through the National Technical Information Service (NTIS) (14 responses). Other reasons include: forthcoming title (4); commercially developed and distributed (4); public availability under review (4); contains restricted or confidential information (2); distributed by another agency (1); and an offer to arrange to include the title in the FDLP (1). Several responses included more than one reason. Judiciary and legislative branch responses indicated little to no CD-ROM publishing activities to date. However, both the Supreme Court and the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts mentioned an interest in future CD-ROM development. The Library of Congress response included a list of eleven CD-ROM titles, all of which were bibliographic in nature and all of which were excluded from the program as cooperative publications and/or due to licensing restrictions. LC did not report any of its American Memory discs or other CD-ROM titles.  -  -  -  -  -  -  Page A - 66   Agency Name  Number of Titles Reported: Agencies  Number of Titles in the FDLP: Agency Reported  Number of Titles in the FDLP: GPO Confirmed  Number of Titles Reported: 1995 SIGCAT  EXECUTIVE Agriculture Commerce/BEA Commerce/Census Defense Education Energy EPA FCC FDIC Health HUD Interior/USGS Justic Labor NARA NASA NRC NSF OMB SBA Transportation Treasury/IRS USIA Veterans JUDICIAL Supreme Court Admin.

For example, a search of the 1995 SIGCAT CD-ROM Compendium database identified 107 CD-ROM titles issued by NASA, which reported no CD-ROM titles in response to the survey. A similar search identified 104 titles from NOAA and 54 from NIST, although neither agency responded to the survey. In discussions not related to this task force report, agencies have identified other reasons for not including their CD-ROM titles in the FDLP. These reasons included a lack of awareness of the program or its benefits; miscellaneous software licensing issues; or that their discs were cooperative publications which must be sold in order to be self-sustaining, as defined in 44 U.S.C. 1903. ISSUES TO BE ADDRESSED Agency Responsibilities for Dissemination Through the FDLP Some agencies believe that making their products available through NTIS satisfies their public dissemination obligations, although OMB Circular A-130 states that it is good public policy to include agency electronic information products in the FDLP. There is unresolved disagreement between various program stakeholders as to whether current law requires CD-ROM titles to be in the FDLP. This issue hinges on the definition of a publication codified in 44 U.S.C. 1901 and 1902. Software Licensing Restrictions arising from software licensing arrangements affect not only the cost, but the availability of CD-ROM products. All Government information products provided through the FDLP, including CD-ROM titles, remain the property of the Government, so FDLP copies can fall within contractual language that restricts the software to Government use. Agencies may need to consider FDLP requirements and include appropriate language in their contracts in order for their discs to be included in the FDLP. GPO can (and has) contracted for software licenses for sales and depository copies when agency licenses do not cover GPO dissemination. Awareness of the FDLP/Communications Since CD-ROM titles may be produced by agency personnel unfamiliar with traditional printing arrangements there can be a lack of communication within the publishing agency which results in discs not being included in the FDLP. In addition, not all relevant personnel within the agency may be aware of how their information products reach the public. Thus, even agencies like Census and Education that work closely with GPO and are committed to including their information in the FDLP do not always know which of their titles are and are not in the program. A program of improved communication or outreach to agencies may be necessary to ameliorate this situation.

BACKGROUND The legislative agenda of each Congress determines the number of bills introduced. Therefore, although it is possible to determine the average number of bills per session this average does not accurately predict the number of bills that will be produced in any particular session. For the 102nd and 103rd Congressional Sessions, the total number of bills and resolutions simple, joint and concurrent was 24,543. All published versions of bills are available electronically via Internet or asynchronous connection through GPO Access. Files are available in both ASCII and Adobe Acrobat Portable Document Format (PDF). PDF files provide users with an exact image of the typeset page. With an Adobe Acrobat Reader, available at no cost from GPO or Adobe, users can view, navigate and print Congressional bills exactly as they appear in the original typeset version, including all fonts, graphics and formats. FEDERAL DEPOSITORY LIBRARY DISTRIBUTION Congressional bills on microfiche are selected by 859 depository libraries. This item selection includes House and Senate Bills, Resolutions, Joint Resolutions and Concurrent Resolutions on microfiche. The cost to the FDLP per session of Congress for the production and distribution of Congressional bills and resolutions on microfiche is approximately $94,940. Prior to December 1995, when free public access to the GPO Access databases was announced, the electronic bills were selected by 544 depository libraries. WAIS access to Congressional bills, joint, concurrent and simple resolutions was selected by 199 libraries, and SWAIS access was selected by 257 libraries. Both types of access were selected by 88 libraries. However, these figures do not represent the total number of depository subscriptions to the electronic services because each depository library could register for as many as 10 subscriptions while being counted as having made only a single item selection. Currently, depository libraries may select Congressional bills and resolutions in both microfiche and electronic formats. Under the policies laid out in the Federal Depository Library Program: Information Dissemination and Access Strategic Plan, FY 1996 - FY 2001 (Strategic Plan) for the FDLP, this will no longer be an option for depository libraries as all dual distribution will be discontinued. The Strategic Plan specifies that: Redundant dissemination of content in different formats; e.g. paper and microfiche, or microfiche and electronic, or CD-ROM and online, will be reduced. In making the decision to eliminate redundant versions of the same content, LPS will consider such factors as the usability, intended audience, time sensitivity, and costs of the various formats. Only ""core"" paper titles such as those listed in Appendix A represent potential duplicate distribution, as their content also may be available electronically.  Page A - 71   DISSEMINATION ALTERNATIVES Alternative A Eliminate all microfiche distribution to depository libraries and make Congressional bills and resolutions available strictly through the GPO Access WAIS server. The PDF files for the bills also could be mounted for FTP download. This would allow libraries who only have access to the bills database through SWAIS to obtain the more useful PDF files. Benefits Timely delivery of the information. $94,940 currently spent for microfiche distribution is saved, although this is offset by increased depository usage of the WAIS server. No new product development is required. PDF files provide exact images of the typeset bills and can be searched, printed, and cut and pasted into other documents. Therefore the information is more useful in this format than it is on microfiche.  -  Disadvantages/Problems Distribution costs will be higher than for microfiche. It is estimated that 11.41% of the WAIS server currently is being used for the bills database. Based upon this figure, the estimated percentage of WAIS costs that can be attributed to the bills database is $138,000 per year. This is $43,060 more than distribution costs for microfiche. However, as the bills currently are distributed in both microfiche and electronic format, moving solely to electronic dissemination will reduce costs overall by eliminating dual distribution. The number of depository libraries that will be able to access this information will decline. Preliminary results from the 1995 Biennial Survey indicate less than 50% of depository libraries have computer terminals with Internet access available for public use. Of those libraries who do not provide Internet access for the public, 169 (12.3%) said they have no plans to obtain it. The percentages of depository libraries with Internet access for public patrons are as follows: E-mail Telnet FTP World Wide Web (graphical) World Wide Web (non-graphical) 21.4% 38.9% 30.8% 37.6% 27.3%  -  The revised minimum technical guidelines for depository libraries (January 1995) recommend that libraries try to establish a SLIP/PPP Internet connection. The Depository Library Council has recommended that these guidelines be made requirements effective October 1, 1996.  Page A - 72   -  As more Congressional sessions are added to the GPO to remove older, less frequently used bills. If depository a less costly, permanent access method will be needed GPO Access. This may mean production of a CD-ROM FTP downloading after a predetermined period of time.  Access WAIS server it will be necessary access to historical files is to be ensured, to supplement access to the bills through or mounting of the PDF and ASCII files for  Alternative B Eliminate microfiche distribution of the Congressional bills and resolutions in favor of a monthly cumulative CD-ROM containing the PDF files. Depository libraries still would be able to access the GPO Access service. Producing and distributing 12 discs a year would cost approximately $60,908. This figure can be broken down as follows: Mastering of twelve discs per year Replication of 859 discs plus 20 claims copies @ $3.50 distributed monthly Postage (estimated $0.29 per disc) Total cost of discs distributed monthly Benefits Total costs savings of $34,032 over the current cost for microfiche distribution of the same material. Depository libraries are better equipped to handle CD-ROM titles than they are to handle Government electronic information services. According to preliminary results from the 1995 Biennial Survey, 83.1% of all depository libraries had CD-ROM capability at a stand-alone workstation. In addition, the revised technical guidelines for depository libraries recommend libraries acquire a single or multiple platter CD-ROM drive compatible with the ISO 9660 standard. CD-ROM is a good media for depository distribution. As a read-only media, CD-ROM assures the integrity of the data, and the estimated media life of a CD-ROM is 30 years or more. However, the longevity of the retrieval and display software frequently used on CD-ROM titles is less certain due to dependency on specific computer operating systems or other technology that may become obsolete more rapidly than the physical media. The PDF files provide exact images of the typeset bills and can be searched, printed, and cut and pasted into other documents. Therefore the information is much more useful in this format than it would be on microfiche. However, although PDF is an open format, it is software dependent and therefore not accepted by NARA for preservation. $ $ $ $ 21,000 36,918 2,990 60,908  -  -  -  Disadvantages/Problems Although timeliness of a monthly CD-ROM might be equivalent to that of microfiche, it does not compare with the speed at which information could be made available through an electronic information service.  Page A - 73   ISSUES TO BE ADDRESSED Technical Capabilities of Depository Libraries Information currently available concerning the technical capabilities of depository libraries and the technical expertise of both libraries and their patrons is not substantive. As more information in the FDLP is converted to electronic formats and discontinued in paper and/or microfiche, the number of, and cost for, computer terminals, CD-ROM drives, printers, and other equipment and software needed to access Government information becomes increasingly relevant. Preliminary estimates from the 1995 Biennial Survey of depository libraries indicate that almost 7% would withdraw or consider withdrawing from the program if it became exclusively electronic.  Page A - 74   Attachment D-8 Task 8B: Case Study on the Congressional Serial Set  Page A - 75   Page A - 76   Attachment D-8  TASK 8B: Evaluation of the costs and benefits of converting Congressional Documents and Reports to electronic format for distribution through the Federal Depository Library Program, even though currently a substantial amount of the source data is not available to GPO in machine readable form. METHODOLOGY The Report of the Serial Set Study Group was submitted to the Public Printer on October 7, 1994. That report identified the then current costs of producing the Serial Set (Documents and Reports) and projected costs for four dissemination alternatives, including several electronic options. This report re-examines those options in light of current GPO technical capabilities and refined cost data. [Note: for the purpose of this task, the focus will be on distribution to depository libraries, not on distirbution to International Exchange System partners (16) or posterity (22) libraries.] BACKGROUND The U.S. Congressional Serial Set comprises a significant portion of the historical record of the work of Congress. The legal basis for the compilation, binding, numbering and distribution of the bound Serial Set is contained in 44 U.S.C. 701, 719 and 738. The Serial Set currently includes Senate and House documents, congressional committee reports, Presidential and other executive publications, treaty documents, and selected reports of non-governmental organizations. From June 13, 1994 to October 7, 1994, the Serial Set Study Group examined alternate formats and cost reduction strategies for issuing the Serial Set (Documents and Reports). The study group consisted of representatives from the Government Printing Office (GPO), the Joint Committee on Printing (JCP), and the library community. The final report from the Serial Set Study Group evaluated the benefits and drawbacks of various dissemination alternatives. Since the 1994 Report of the Serial Set Study Group, new cost data has come to light. GPO's CD-ROM production capability and the cost to produce discs now is very clearly defined, and shows a significant reduction over the cost estimates projected in the 1994 Report. The 1994 Report based CD-ROM costs on the estimate of producing the test disc for the Congressional Record CD-ROM Pilot Project. The cost estimate to master the disc for that project was $212,900. More than half of that cost, $130,000, was to write and test software. Current GPO CD-ROM production costs are much lower. GPO receives approximately 80% of reports from Congress in machine readable format and 20% as camera copy. Documents are more of a problem; only 20% are received from Congress in machine readable format and 80% as camera copy. It is necessary either to obtain electronic source files from Congress or convert the information received in camera copy to machine readable form by scanning it using software such as Adobe Acrobat Capture. Proofing and correction are necessary to assure accuracy of the data recognized by the software. If the Acrobat software does not recognize portions of the document, it converts what it cannot read to an image. The images are non-searchable, making the entire document less useful. The current resolution of these images is only 300 dots per inch (d.p.i.), an inadequate resolution for effective use, and the scanned images increase the file size substantially, inhibiting remote access. Scanning will remain necessary unless arrangements can be made to receive all of this information in machine readable format from the Congress, or the organizations that submit the Page A - 77   information to Congress. Consequently, either a CD-ROM or online version of the Serial Set is feasible only if Congress requires that the component Documents and Reports not typeset at GPO are provided to GPO in a usable electronic format. FEDERAL DEPOSITORY LIBRARY DISSEMINATION Every depository is eligible to receive both slip publications and the bound Serial Set in either paper and/or microfiche format. Depository libraries that select the Serial Set in microfiche (755) receive a paper copy of material too graphically intensive (i.e. four color process) to be practical for conversion to microfiche. The 1994 Report of the Serial Set Study Group indicated that for the 101st Congress, 463 libraries selected the bound Serial Set and the slips in paper format (as well as 16 International Exchange and 22 posterity libraries). The current cost of dissemination per session, based on the actual costs for the 101st Congress, as reported in the 1994 Report of the Serial Set Study Group, is $1,567,000. Most Documents and Reports also are available now through GPO Access. DISSEMINATION ALTERNATIVES Alternative A The 1994 Serial Set Study Group recommended that regional libraries receive the bound Serial Set in paper format and Documents and Reports in a CD-ROM version. Selective libraries could choose access to the slip documents through the GPO Access service in lieu of either paper or microfiche. They also would be able to select either the bound Serial Set in paper or the Documents and Reports CD-ROM. Benefits Depository libraries have a wide variety of formats to select. A phased-in change would minimize the effects of electronic conversion on depository libraries. CD-ROM is a good media for depository distribution. As a read-only media, CD-ROM assures the integrity of the data, and the estimated media life of a CD-ROM is 30 years or more. However, the longevity of the retrieval and display software frequently used on CD-ROM titles is less certain due to dependency on specific computer operating systems or other technology that may become obsolete more rapidly than the physical media.  Disadvantages/Problems Costs are difficult to quantify, but will be higher under this phased-in approach. The discs will contain files that are not entirely searchable. This will be a continuing problem until GPO can negotiate with Congress to receive all Documents and Reports in machine readable format or scan and convert camera copy to machine readable format.

(1) This section applies to the financing of ocean freight or ocean freight differential. Ocean freight will be financed by CCC only to the extent specifically provided for in the purchase authorization. The purchase authorization may provide requirements in addition to or in lieu of those specified in this section.          (2) The supplier of ocean transportation must be engaged     in the business of furnishing ocean transportation from the     United States and must have a person, principal or agent, on     whom service of judicial process may be had in the United     States.       (3) The quantity of the commodity which must be shipped on     privately owned U.S.-flag commercial vessels will be     determined by the Director.            (4) The supplier of ocean transportation shall release     copies of the ocean bills of lading to the supplier of the     commodity promptly upon completion of loading of the vessel.            (5) When CCC finances any part of the ocean freight or the     ocean freight differential, the participant must open an     operable irrevocable letter of credit for the portion of the     ocean freight not financed by CCC. All banking institution     charges, such as commissions, expenses, etc., are for the     account of the participant. The amount of the letter of     credit shall be computed using the information provided in     the Form CCC-106.   The letter of credit shall provide     for sight payment or acceptance of a draft, payable in U.S.     dollars, on the basis of the quantities specified in the     applicable ocean freight contract. If the supplier of ocean     transportation accepts the commodity before receipt of an     acceptable letter of credit from a bank, the supplier takes     such action at its own risk. This action in itself does not     affect eligibility for CCC financing.       (b)  Contracting procedures.          (1)  Invitations for Bids (IFB's).                       (i) Public freight ""Invitations for Bids""         are required in the solicitation of freight offers from         all U.S. and non-U.S. flag vessels when CCC is financing         any portion of the ocean freight.           (ii) For non-U.S. flag vessels when CCC is not         financing any portion of the ocean freight, public         freight IFB's are also required unless otherwise         authorized by the Director, or unless the participant         requires the use of vessels under its flag, the flag of         the destination country, or other non-U.S. flag vessels         under its control. Vessels considered to be under the         control of the participant or the destination country         include vessels under time charters, bare boat charters,         consecutive voyage charters, or other contractual         arrangements for the carriage of commodities which         provide guaranteed access to vessels.           (iii) Prior to release to the trade, all freight IFB's         must be submitted to the Director for approval. Freight         IFB's must be issued by means of Bridge News, New York,         plus at least one other means of communication.                             (iv) All freight IFB's must:                                          (A) Specify a closing time for the receipt of             offers and state that late offers will not be             considered;               (B) Provide that offers are required to have a             canceling date no later than the last contract layday             specified in the IFB;               (C) Provide the same deadline for receipt of             offers from both U.S. flag vessels and non-U.S. flag             vessels;               (D) Stipulate the responsibility for each party             for payment of any costs not eligible for financing             by CCC (in the IFB or the pro forma charter party).                             (2)  Competitive bidding.  When CCC is financing     any portion of the freight, all offers shall be opened in     public in the United States at the time and place specified     in the IFB. Offers shall be opened prior to receipt of offers     for the sale of commodities as the Director determines     appropriate. Only offers which are responsive to the IFB may     be considered, and no negotiation shall be permitted.             (3)  Records of offers .  Copies of all     offers received must be promptly furnished to the Director,     who may require the participant, or its shipping agent, to     submit a written certification to the GSM that all offers     received (with the times of receipt designated thereon) were     transmitted to the Department. For purposes of this paragraph     ""time of receipt"" shall be the time a hand-carried     offer or a mailed offer was received at the designated     location for presentation or, if transmitted electronically,     the time the offer was received, as supported by evidence     satisfactory to the Director.       (4)  Re-tenders.  The Director may permit or     require a participant to refuse any and all bids, and in such     case a participant may conduct a re-tender with the approval     of the Director. The Director shall not approve or require     freight re-tenders unless they will increase the likelihood     of meeting U.S. flag cargo preference requirements, will     permit the desired quantity to be shipped, will likely result     in reduced CCC expenditures, or are otherwise determined to     be in the best interest of the program.       (c)  Request for vessel approval.  The pertinent terms of all proposed charters and all proposed liner bookings, regardless of whether any portion of ocean freight is financed by CCC, must be submitted to the Director for review and approval before fixture of the vessel. Tentative advance vessel approvals may be obtained by telephone provided Form CCC-105, AOcean Shipment Data--Pub. L. 480 (Request for Vessel Approval)@, is furnished promptly confirming the information supplied by telephone. The Form CCC-105 shall be submitted in duplicate to the Director.    (d)  Advice of vessel approval .          (1) USDA will give written approval of charters and liner     bookings on Form CCC-106, ""Advice of Vessel     Approval."" The Form CCC-106 will state whether CCC will     finance any part of the ocean freight. For f.a.s. or f.o.b.     shipments, CCC will issue a signed original of Form CCC-106     to the ocean carrier when CCC finances any part of the ocean     freight. For c.& f. or c.i.f. shipments, CCC will issue     Form CCC-106 to the supplier of commodity.            (2) If CCC agrees to finance any portion of the ocean     freight, the participant or its agent shall forward a copy of     the ocean freight contract immediately after execution to the     Director for review and approval prior to issuance of Form     CCC-106.        (3) CCC may also require the supplier of ocean     transportation to submit copies of lightening, stevedoring,     or bagging contracts for any voyage for which CCC finances     ocean freight or ocean freight differential.       (e)  Special charter party provisions required when any part of ocean freight is financed by CCC . This paragraph applies when CCC finances any part of the ocean freight for commodities booked on charter terms. In the event of any conflict between the provisions of the regulations in this part and the charter party or ocean bills of lading issued pursuant thereto, the provisions of the regulations in this part shall prevail. The charter party shall contain or, for the purpose of financing pursuant to the regulations in this part, be deemed to contain the following provisions:          (1) That if there is any failure on the part of the     supplier of ocean transportation to perform the charter party     after the vessel has tendered at the loading port, the     charterer shall be entitled to incur all expenses which in     the judgment of the General Sales Manager are required to     enable the vessel to carry out her obligations under the     charter party including, but not limited to, expenses for     lifting any liens asserted against the vessel.            (2) That, notwithstanding any prior assignments of freight     made by the owner or operator, the expenses authorized in     paragraph (e)(1) of this section may be deducted from the     freight earned under the charter party.       (3) That ocean freight is earned and that 100% thereof is     payable by the charterers when the vessel and cargo arrive at     the first port of discharge, subject to paragraph (e)(4) of     this section, and to the further condition that if a force     majeure as described in paragraph (l)(1) of this section     results in the loss of part of the vessel's cargo, 100% of     the ocean freight is payable on the part so lost. This     provision does not relieve the carrier of the obligation to     carry to other points of discharge if so required by the     charter party.        (4) That if a force majeure as described in paragraph     (l)(1) of this section prevents the vessel's arrival at the     first port of discharge, the freight shall be payable by the     charterer at the time the General Sales Manager determines     that such force majeure was the cause of nonarrival.        (5) That laydays are non-reversible.       (6) That in a dispute involving any rights and obligations     of CCC, including rights and obligations as successor or     assignee, which cannot be settled by agreement, the dispute     shall not be subject to arbitration.      (f)  Special charter party information required when any part of ocean freight is financed by CCC.  When CCC finances any part of the ocean freight for commodities booked on charter terms, the charter party shall contain the following information:          (1) The name of each party participating in the ocean     freight brokerage commission, if any, and the percentage     thereof payable to each party;       (2) The name of the vessel and the name of the substitute     vessel, if any.      (g)  Notice of arrival.  Each Form CCC-106 will indicate whether a notice of arrival is required. A notice of arrival, when required, must be furnished promptly by the participant or its designated agent or other source acceptable to CCC (excluding the carrier or its agent) and must include the name of the vessel, the purchase authorization number, the first port of discharge, and the date of arrival. The notice of arrival of the vessel also constitutes prima facie evidence of arrival of the cargo.    (h)  Foreign flag vessels.  The cost of ocean transportation will be financed by CCC on non-U.S. flag vessels only when, and to the extent, specifically provided in the applicable purchase authorization.    (i)  U.S.-flag vessels.  When a commodity is required to be shipped on a privately owned U.S.-flag commercial vessel, Form CCC-106 will set forth:          (1) The rate of the ocean freight differential, if any,     which the Director determines to exist between the prevailing     foreign-flag vessel rate and the U.S.-flag vessel rate; and       (2) The approximate tonnage for which CCC will authorize     reimbursement of ocean freight or ocean freight differential,     as appropriate.      (j)  Items not eligible for financing by CCC.  The following costs will not be financed by CCC, either separately or as part of the commodity contract price:          (1) Loading, trimming, and other related shipping expenses     unless included in the ocean freight rate;       (2) Discharge costs unless included in the ocean freight     rate;       (3) The cost of ""dead freight"";       (4) Cargo dues and taxes assessed by the importing or     recipient country;            (5) Surcharges assessed by steamship conferences or     carriers, unless specifically authorized by the Director;       (6) General average contributions;       (7) Stevedoring overtime and vessel crew overtime;       (8) Ship's disbursements;       (9) Any payments prohibited in § 17.6(b) and (c); and       (10) Detention.      (k)  General financing provisions.   When any part of ocean freight will be financed either separately or as part of the commodity contract price, the following shall apply:          (1) Ocean freight contracts must show the ocean freight     rate from one loading port to one discharge port,   and     may provide for an increase in rate for an additional port of     loading or discharge, or other option. CCC, however, will     finance initially the lowest such rate or OFD, as     appropriate. Increased amounts due because of the exercise of     such option will be financed only after receipt of an ocean     bill of lading or other evidence showing that the option was     exercised.       (2) In the case of transshipment to a foreign flag vessel,     CCC will finance the ocean freight or OFD, as appropriate,     only to the point of transshipment, at a rate   determined     by the GSM, and CCC will not finance any part of the ocean     freight beyond the point of transshipment unless specifically     approved by the GSM. If the commodity was transported from a     U.S. port and was transshipped at another U.S. port, CCC will     not finance, without prior approval of the GSM, any part of     the ocean freight incurred before transshipment.             (3) The ocean freight rate eligible for CCC financing and     the rate used for the U.S.-flag vessel in calculating ocean     freight differential shall not exceed the following rates for     the category of the vessel concerned:                      (i) For commodities covered by published tariff         rates--the published conference contract rate;           (ii) For other commodities--the market rate prevailing         at the time of request for approval as determined by the         Director, but in any event not in excess of rates charged         other shippers (irrespective of booking dates) for like         commodities on the voyage concerned.                  (4) Payment will be made for ocean freight or OFD, as     appropriate, from loading points to discharge points at rates     approved by the Director on Form CCC-106 in conformity with     paragraph (k)(3) of this section.            (5) Freight for a vessel designated on Form CCC-106 as a     U.S. flag vessel shall not be eligible for financing unless     such vessel complies with the provisions of Pub. L. 87-266.             (6) Ocean freight contracts must specify that the     participant shall be liable for detention of the vessel for     loading delays attributable solely to the decision of the     supplier of ocean transportation not to commence loading     because of the failure of the participant to establish an     ocean freight letter of credit in accordance with paragraph     (a)(5) of this section. However, ocean freight contracts may     not contain a specified detention rate. The ocean     transportation supplier shall be entitled to reimbursement     for detention costs for all time so lost, for each calendar     day or any part of the calendar day, including Saturdays,     Sundays and holidays. The period of such delay shall not     commence earlier than upon presentation of the vessel at the     designated loading port within the laydays specified in the     ocean freight contract, and upon notification of the vessel's     readiness to load in accordance with the terms of the     applicable ocean freight contract. The period of such delay     shall end at the time that operable irrevocable letters of     credit have been established for the applicable ocean freight     or the time the vessel begins loading, whichever is earlier.     Time calculated as detention shall not count as laytime.     Reimbursement for such detention shall be payable no later     than upon the vessel's arrival at the first port of     discharge.      (l)  Force majeure.  (1) The GSM will waive the requirement for the notice of arrival required by Form CCC-106 by a written notice to the supplier of ocean transportation on the receipt of evidence satisfactory to the General Sales Manager that the vessel is lost or unable to proceed to destination after completion of loading as a result of one or more of the following causes: Damage caused by perils of the sea or other waters; collisions; wrecks; stranding without the fault of the carrier; jettison; fire from any cause; Act of God; public enemies or pirates; arrest or restraint of princes, rulers or peoples without the fault of the supplier of ocean transportation; wars; public disorders; captures; or detention by public authority in the interest of public safety. The supplier may substitute such waiver for the notice of arrival.           (2) The determination of a force majeure by the GSM shall     not relieve the participant from its obligation under the     Agricultural Commodities Agreement to pay CCC, when due, the     dollar amount of ocean freight, plus interest (exclusive of     ocean freight differential), financed by CCC.      (m)  Demurrage/despatch.  CCC will not finance demurrage and CCC will not share in despatch earnings. Owners and commodity suppliers will settle laytime accounts at load port(s) and owners and charterers will settle laytime accounts at discharge port(s). Under no circumstances shall CCC be responsible for resolving disputes involving calculation of laytime or the payment of demurrage or despatch.    (n)  Ocean freight included in the commodity contract price.  For cost and freight or c.i.f. contracts the ocean freight, or the ocean freight differential, as appropriate, will be financed only to the extent specifically provided in the applicable purchase authorization.    (o)  Separate freight contracts . Contracts for ocean transportation, under a purchase authorization which limits delivery terms to f.o.b. or f.a.s., must be separate and apart from the contracts for the commodity.                                                         Last modified: Friday, June 20, 2003"

Before submitting the ICR to OMB for review and approval, EPA is  soliciting comments on specific aspects of the proposed information  collection as described below.  DATES: Comments must be submitted on or before April 15, 2002.  ADDRESSES: The current ICR is available on the internet at  www.epa.gov/ airmarkets/AcidRainICR.pdf .   FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Contact Kenon Smith at (202-564-9164)  or ( smith.kenon@epa.gov ).  SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:     Affected entities: Entities potentially affected by this action are  those which participate in the Acid Rain Program.     Title: Acid Rain Program ICR; (OMB Control No. 2060-0258; EPA ICR  No. 1633.13) expiring 9/30/2002.     Abstract: The Acid Rain Program was established under Title IV of  the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments. The program calls for major  reductions of the pollutants that cause acid rain while establishing a  new approach to environmental management. This information collection  is necessary to implement the Acid Rain Program. It includes burden  hours associated with developing and modifying permits, transferring  allowances, monitoring emissions, participating in the annual auctions,  completing annual compliance certifications, participating in the Opt- in program, and complying with Nox permitting requirements. Most of  this information collection is mandatory under 40 CFR parts 72-78. Some  parts of it are voluntary or to obtain a benefit, such as participation  in the annual auctions under 40 CFR part 73, subpart E. An agency may  not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required to respond to, a  collection of information unless it displays a currently valid OMB  control number. The OMB control numbers for EPA's regulations are  listed in 40 CFR part 9 and 48 CFR chapter 15. The EPA would like to  solicit comments to:     (i) Evaluate whether the proposed collection of information is  necessary for the proper performance of the functions of the agency,  including whether the information will have practical utility;     (ii) Evaluate the accuracy of the agency's estimate of the burden  of the proposed collection of information, including the validity of  the methodology and assumptions used;     (iii) Enhance the quality, utility, and clarity of the information  to be collected; and     (iv) Minimize the burden of the collection of information on those  who are to respond, including through the use of appropriate automated  electronic, mechanical, or other technological collection techniques or  other forms of information technology, e.g., permitting electronic  submission of responses.     Burden Statement: The annual public reporting and recordkeeping  burden for this collection of information is estimated to average 132  hours per response. Burden means the total time, effort, or financial  resources expended by persons to generate, maintain, retain, or  disclose or provide information to or for a Federal agency. This  includes the time needed to review instructions; develop, acquire,  install, and utilize technology and systems for the purposes of  collecting, validating, and verifying  [[Page 6707]]  information, processing and maintaining information, and disclosing and  providing information; adjust the existing ways to comply with any  previously applicable instructions and requirements; train personnel to  be able to respond to a collection of information; search data sources;  complete and review the collection of information; and transmit or  otherwise disclose the information.     Respondents/Affected Entities: 850.     Estimated Number of Respondents: 850.     Frequency of Response: Varies by task.     Estimated Total Annual Hour Burden: 1,330,327 hours.     Estimated Total Annualized Capital and Start-up Cost: $92,058,000.     Estimated Total Annualized Operation and Maintenance Cost:  $43,574,000.      Dated: February 4, 2002.

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Sharron L. Gebhardt, telephone (303) 2313211, FAX (303) 2313385, e-mail Sharron.Gebhardt@mms.gov. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The MMS published a notice of proposed rulemaking regarding the value for royalty purposes of crude oil produced from Indian leases on February 12, 1998 (63 FR 7089) and a supplementary proposed rule on January 5, 2000 (65 FR 403). In today's Federal Register, MMS is announcing dates, places, and times for workshops on issues related to the existing rules adopted in March 2000 governing the valuation for royalty purposes of crude oil produced from Federal leases. The workshops will address, among other things, issues related to calculation of transportation allowances (including the rate of return allowed for calculating actual costs under nonarm's-length transportation arrangements), timing and application of published index prices, and calculation of location and quality differentials under certain circumstances. Because of the substantive overlap between these issues and issues involved in the proposed Indian oil valuation rule, and to give persons interested in Indian lease issues an opportunity to participate in the workshops, MMS is reopening the comment period on the proposed Indian oil valuation rule for 60 days so it can include in the record any relevant comments received. The MMS then can consider those comments as it proceeds with the Indian oil valuation rule. The policy of the Department of the Interior is to give the public an opportunity to participate in the rulemaking process. Accordingly, you may submit your written comments, suggestions, or objections regarding this notice to the location identified in the ADDRESSES section of this notice. You should submit comments on or before the date identified in the DATES section of this notice. We will also make copies of the comments available for public review, including names and addresses of respondents, during regular business hours at our offices in Lakewood, Colorado. Individual respondents may request that we withhold their home address from the public record, which we will honor to the extent allowable by law. There also may be circumstances in which we would withhold from the rulemaking record a respondent's identity, as allowable by law. If you  7087  request that we withhold your name and/or address, state this prominently at the beginning of your comment. However, we will not consider anonymous comments. We will make all submissions from organizations or businesses, and from individuals identifying themselves as representatives or officials of organizations or businesses, available for public inspection in their entirety. Dated: February 5, 2003. Lucy Querques Denett, Associate Director for Minerals Revenue Management.

Notice of proposed rulemaking.  SUMMARY: The Coast Guard is proposing to change the operating regulations that govern the operation of the Jordan (S337) bridge, the Gilmerton (US 13/ 460) bridge, and the Dominion Boulevard (US 17) bridge which all span the Southern Branch of the Elizabeth River, and the Centerville Turnpike (SR170) bridge across the Albemarle and Chesapeake Canal. We propose to extend the morning and evening rush hour closure periods between one hour and one-half hour for the Jordan and Gilmerton bridges and to add rush hour scheduled openings for the Gilmerton and Centerville Turnpike bridges. These regulations are necessary to relieve increased vehicular traffic congestion during weekday rush hours; the changes would reduce traffic delays while still providing for the reasonable needs of navigation. DATES: Comments and related material must reach the Coast Guard on or before April 14, 2003. ADDRESSES: You may mail comments and related material to Commander (Aowb), Fifth Coast Guard District, Federal Building, 4th Floor, 431 Crawford Street, Portsmouth, Virginia 237045004, or they may be hand  VerDate Jan<31>2003  16:17 Feb 11, 2003  Jkt 200001  PO 00000  Frm 00007  Fmt 4702  Sfmt 4702  E:\FR\FM\12FEP1.SGM  12FEP1
GX251-79-2314783	"Central Artery/Third Harbor Tunnel Project  Oversight Coordination Commission   Commission Summary Report July 1998       Contents   Background   The Oversight Coordination Commission   Summary of Work   Conclusion               SUMMARY OF WORK     OFFICE OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL   OFFICE OF THE STATE AUDITOR   OFFICE OF THE INSPECTOR GENERAL      Oversight activities of the Commission members' offices are summarized below.  [1]    OFFICE OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL    Since the CA/T Project's inception, the OAG has delivered substantial cost savings to the Commonwealth through its success in litigation.  In 1997, the Attorney General was enabled to undertake an affirmative oversight role with respect to the CA/T Project when the Legislature appropriated the necessary funding.  Considerable legal and investigative resources can now be focused exclusively on the CA/T Project.  The value of crimes prevented and fraud deterred is, of course, inestimable.    The OAG dedicated a twenty-four hour anonymous ""hotline"" service to CA/T Project oversight in order to facilitate the reporting of tips, leads, and information.  The OAG has reviewed a number of allegations of fraud, both civil and criminal, which have been made concerning the CA/T Project.  Due to the OAG policy of refraining from comment on investigations, much of the Attorney General's work in this area is not in public view.     The Attorney General has initiated proactive measures to combat improper activities and contain costs on the CA/T Project, including anti-fraud and cost-containment training sessions.  Also, the Attorney General has co-sponsored False Claims Act legislation which, when passed, will further protect the Commonwealth's funds and enhance its oversight capabilities.     Civil Litigation    The Attorney General investigates allegations that may result in civil cost-recovery actions, and proposes systemic changes to deter fraud and other problems that may arise on the CA/T Project.  The Attorney General also defends the Commonwealth in a variety of contract, eminent domain, environmental, and other matters regarding the CA/T Project, saving hundreds of millions of dollars to date, and avoiding disruptions to the CA/T Project.    The Attorney General recently instituted an environmental cost-recovery action against a subcontractor alleged to have unlawfully and unsafely handled, stored, and disposed of asbestos-containing materials during the demolition of the Anelex Building at 150 Causeway Street in Boston.  This action is pending in Suffolk Superior Court.    In March 1998, the Attorney General won a significant decision against Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospital, which had claimed that the CA/T Project was obligated contractually to take the hospital by eminent domain and pay for its relocation.  The Spaulding decision, which followed a 44-day trial, saved the CA/T Project and taxpayers as much as $100 million.  This case is now on appeal.    In three federal and state cases, the Attorney General successfully defended the CA/T Project's decision to change the design of roads and highways that will cross the Charles River.  Under the selected redesign plan, two parallel bridges will cross the river.  Plaintiffs sought the adoption of a redesign plan that included tunneling under the Charles River, which would have increased the CA/T Project cost by hundreds of millions of dollars.  Plaintiffs also sought to stop construction of the entire CA/T Project.  A fourth case remains pending in state court.    In two actions relating to the ventilation buildings for the depressed and covered portions of the new highway and tunnel, the Attorney General successfully defended new state environmental regulations specifically designed to address these indirect sources of air pollution.  General regulations intended for ""stationary sources"" of air pollution would have called for the use of technologically inappropriate pollution control equipment.    The Attorney General also successfully defended a MassHighway bid specification that included a provision requiring all successful bidders to become signatories to a project labor agreement previously negotiated with a number of affiliated unions engaged in the building and construction trades.  The CA/T Project labor agreement, among other things, contains a ""no strike"" clause that virtually eliminates the risk of delay due to labor disputes, and sets forth uniform provisions on overtime, shifts, holidays, pay, and benefits.    The Attorney General has defended numerous claims brought by property owners after their properties were taken by eminent domain for the CA/T Project.  To date, the Attorney General has saved the CA/T Project more than $72 million in inflated compensation claims brought in the eighteen separate cases that have been resolved.    In other actions, the Attorney General successfully has defended actions brought by various plaintiffs who improperly have sought to enjoin the CA/T Project from specific construction, to obtain relocation assistance and damages, and to halt construction of the CA/T Project during a detailed study of the plaintiff's own alternative plan to build a bypass bridge around Boston.    Finally, in a case initiated by a relocation contractor against MassHighway for outstanding payments, the Attorney General counterclaimed that the contractor had submitted false claims.  The case eventually resulted in CA/T Project savings of approximately $600,000 and the debarment of the contractor and certain of its principals.     Criminal Litigation    The Attorney General has investigated and prosecuted numerous individuals and corporations for violations of law on the CA/T Project.  The OAG receives allegations from a variety of sources, including the Commission members, and investigates such matters with assistance of internal investigators and the Massachusetts State Police.  These investigations typically involve allegations of the following crimes: procurement fraud, larceny, false claims, prevailing wage violations, and worker's compensation fraud.    Specifically, the OAG indicted a bidding contractor on the CA/T Project in the fall of 1997 for procurement fraud.  Section 67A of M.G.L. c.266, the procurement fraud statute, prohibits, among other things, anyone from intentionally: (1) making a material statement that is false; (2) omitting or concealing a material fact in a written statement; or (3) submitting or inviting reliance on a material writing or recording that is false, altered, or otherwise lacking in authenticity ""relative to the procurement of supplies, services, or construction...within the jurisdiction of any department, agency or public instrumentality of the Commonwealth, or any political subdivisions thereof."" The subject contractor, who bid $7 million on a surveying project as part of a joint venture with other surveyors, was charged with submitting certification forms bearing forgeries as part of his company's bid package.  Although the defendant's company was the lowest bidder, CA/T Project officials ultimately awarded the contract to the next lowest bidder in light of the alleged fraud.  The case is pending in Suffolk Superior Court.    Additionally, the OAG indicted sixteen individuals and seven corporations who employ truck drivers on the CA/T Project, for violating prevailing wage, unemployment, and worker's compensation laws.  These laws govern fundamental aspects of the CA/T Project.  Under the prevailing wage law, the contractors and subcontractors are required to pay their truck drivers a minimum of $27.00 to $29.00 per hour, depending on the specific contract and the classification.  The employers additionally are required to file certified payroll records with the CA/T Project identifying all of their employees and their respective salaries.  Moreover, these employers are obligated to provide worker's compensation coverage through either an independent carrier or self-insurance.  The defendants in these cases are charged with failing to pay numerous truck drivers the prevailing wages, failing to submit correct certified payroll records, and failing to provide the mandatory worker's compensation coverage.  In total, the defendants are alleged to owe in excess of $500,000 in back wages.  All of these cases were commenced in Suffolk Superior Court and currently are pending.     Anti-Fraud and Cost-Containment Training    In order to help the Commission and its individual members detect waste, fraud, and abuse on the CA/T Project, the OAG organized and sponsored a full-day construction-fraud training seminar in May 1997.  A nationally recognized expert in the field of public construction fraud addressed members of the OAG on methods of reducing waste, fraud, and abuse on large-scale construction projects.  A segment of this seminar also was presented to representatives of the OIG and OSA.    At the request of the OAG, the consultant returned in March 1998 to speak with OAG and CA/T Project personnel in greater detail about cost-containment and anti-fraud measures on the CA/T Project.  The focus of this second training session was to more accurately identify potential vulnerabilities of the CA/T Project and ways to best monitor and overcome them.  CA/T Project personnel outlined cost-containment and anti-fraud measures currently in place, and participated in a subsequent discussion.  Additional seminars will be conducted as necessary.     False Claims Act    The Attorney General has co-sponsored False Claims Act legislation, House Bill 4164, that significantly would enhance the ability of the Commonwealth to recover state funds that are obtained improperly through the submission of false claims or false statements to the Commonwealth, or to its agencies or contractors.  Effective cost-recovery actions under the statute, including ""whistleblower"" actions, may have the additional beneficial effect of reducing the incidence of such activities.    The False Claims Act would add to the civil investigative tools available to the OAG, and would authorize the Commonwealth to recover treble damages, a civil penalty for each false or fraudulent submission, costs, and attorney's fees from persons found liable.    Also, in order to meaningfully encourage private ""whistleblowers"" to come forward with information about such false claims or false statements, which otherwise may remain undetected by the affected state agencies, the statute would enable such persons to share in the Commonwealth's recovery in certain circumstances, and would protect them from retribution by their employers.    The enactment of the False Claims Act would have special significance with respect to the CA/T Project, in light of the hundreds of parties and billions of dollars it involves.  It is expected that cases brought under the statute would generate additional matters for further investigation, review, and audit by the Commission member agencies.    False Claims Act legislation was discussed with legislative staff at a quarterly coordinating session of the Commission, and subsequently was passed to be engrossed in the Senate by unanimous vote.  As of this writing, the legislation is pending in the House Committee on Ways and Means.  The OAG has compared the House and Senate bills, and has proposed certain technical amendments that would facilitate the implementation of the statute.      Fair Labor and Business Practices Enforcement    In early 1997, the Attorney General initiated a comprehensive review of potential wage violations on the CA/T Project.  This review encompassed hundreds of interviews of truck owners and operators, scrutiny of numerous certified payroll records and other relevant documents, and repeated inspections and visits to various contract sites on the CA/T Project, including certain landfills.  These enforcement measures resulted in six settlement agreements in which the owner/operators agreed to pay back wages of $130,000 to their employees, and to refrain from entering into new public construction contracts with the Commonwealth or any municipality for six months.  The Attorney General's review of wage violations is ongoing.    The OAG meets with MassHighway and CA/T Project personnel on a regular basis regarding wage violations, and has conducted a training seminar for MassHighway personnel and CA/T Project resident engineers to better educate them as to compliance in this area.     Information Gathering    The OAG is creating a consolidated database of all contractors and primary subcontractors on the CA/T Project.  Information is being obtained from Commission members and the CA/T Project.  The goal of this endeavor is to compile comprehensive information regarding all key CA/T Project players, which would facilitate investigations, enforcement, and prosecution.      Fraud Hotline    The OAG implemented a Big Dig Fraud Hotline, 1-888-TIP-BGDG, to help identify potential fraud, waste, and abuse on the CA/T Project.  The hotline was established in cooperation with other Commission members.    The toll-free hotline was designed following an analysis of different types of fraud hotlines in a variety of industries.  The hotline is answered by OAG personnel during business hours and by voicemail during other hours.  Calls that can be better addressed by a different agency are referred accordingly.  All calls to the hotline are confidential.     OFFICE OF THE STATE AUDITOR    Due to the importance and magnitude of the CA/T Project, the OSA has been reviewing and assessing the system of internal controls the CA/T Project has established for estimating, monitoring, and controlling project costs in order to identify system weaknesses and opportunities for savings, cost avoidance, and adhering to scheduling and performance requirements.  OSA audit work has resulted in seven interim reports to date, which have identified $180 million in waste and questionable expenses.  With the design activities nearing completion, the major project expenditures are now focusing on construction.     OSA REPORTS    The CA/T Project Counterclockwise Loop Viaduct in East Boston    In July 1997, the OSA issued a report on the design and construction costs associated with a section of roadway that joins Logan Airport to the Third Harbor Tunnel roadway, referred to as the Counterclockwise Loop Viaduct (CLV).  The CLV is a series of ramps connecting the tunnel with the arrivals and departures roadways at the airport.  The OSA concluded that the CA/T Project incurred additional design and construction costs of approximately $8.4 million by not resolving a major design issue with the Massachusetts Port Authority (Massport) in a timely manner.     MassHighway Bridge Maintenance Activities    MassHighway has the responsibility for planning, designing, maintaining, and operating a safe and efficient highway and bridge transportation system.  MassHighway is responsible for 4,455 bridges, of which 2,909 are state owned and 1,546 are locally owned.  Although the respective communities are responsible for their own bridges, MassHighway generally replaces, rehabilitates, and inspects these bridges on behalf of and to assist the local communities since local resources are usually limited.  In December 1997, the OSA issued a report concerning MassHighway's activities relating to how well bridge activities were managed and whether those activities resulted in efficient, economical, and effective use of resources.  The report disclosed that MassHighway had 669 bridges (15%) under its purview that were structurally deficient, and 1,176 (26%) that were functionally obsolete, together making up 1,845, or 41% of the total number of bridges in MassHighway's care.    The report also concluded that the condition of the Commonwealth's bridges will remain a problem for some time unless increased resources are devoted to bridge rehabilitation and replacement.  MassHighway estimated in a 1994 report that it would cost $2.1 billion to rehabilitate, replace, or maintain the current backlog of deficient bridges in just the geographical area covered by the Boston Metropolitan Planning Organization, not the entire state.  For federal fiscal years 1992 to 1996, the Commonwealth used approximately $304 million, or 47% of the $646 million in available federal funds, for bridges statewide.  Of the remaining $342 million, $304 million was or will be used on the CA/T Project.  MassHighway officials reported to FHWA that they will substantially increase the use of federal bridge funds for the CA/T Project in the upcoming years.  Although MassHighway officials contend that they will continue to use state funds to offset the use of federal bridge funds for the CA/T Project, future federal funding constraints may affect MassHighway's ability to meet its statewide needs.     INCREASED OVERSIGHT    Section 17 of Chapter 102 of the Acts of 1995 required ""additional on site auditors and investigatory personnel to monitor activities related to the Central Artery/Third Harbor Tunnel Project.""  Section 2B of Chapter 205 of the Acts of 1996, which created the Commission, required members to ""scrutinize and recommend cost savings in said Central Artery/Third Harbor Tunnel project.""  In accordance with those requirements, the OSA utilized the funds provided with the establishment of the Commission to significantly increase its on site audit staff.  Prior to the establishment of the Commission, the OSA had three audit staff reviewing CA/T Project activities.  The OSA now has nine full-time audit staff and an Assistant Audit Director assigned to on site oversight of CA/T Project activities.  In addition, there are other senior management audit staff who continue to devote time and effort towards the OSA and Commission oversight responsibilities along with an appropriate level of support staff.  In the first year of the Commission's operation, the OSA has initiated four assignments at the CA/T Project.     CA/T Project Insurance Program    While design and construction contractors generally purchase their own insurance and recover costs through their various contracts, the CA/T Project purchased ""wrap-up"" insurance that provides contractors working at the CA/T Project with coverage for a variety of risks.  Wrap-up insurance programs usually result in lower total insurance costs for a number of reasons, including the elimination of redundant insurance services and profit margins associated with the purchase of insurance by each contractor and subcontractor.  CA/T officials estimated that the CA/T Project will realize approximately $826 million in insurance savings by using a wrap-up insurance program.  According to CA/T Project officials, these insurance savings will be returned to the CA/T Project in 2017, long after completion of the CA/T Project.    Approximately 64% or almost $500 million of the estimated CA/T Project wrap-up insurance program cost of about $779 million, represents worker's compensation insurance coverage while approximately another 30% or almost $234 million is represented by general liability insurance costs.    The CA/T Project entered into agreements with the American International Group (AIG) of New York City to provide worker's compensation and general liability insurance.  The worker's compensation agreement contains a large deductible.  Specifically, the CA/T Project is responsible for individual claims up to $1 million and up to $3 million per event.  The general liability agreement likewise contains a large deductible or loss limit.  Specifically, the CA/T Project is responsible for claims up to $2 million per insured individual per occurrence and up to $6 million per occurrence for all insured individuals.  During our audit period, there were no worker's compensation or general liability claims individually or in the aggregate that exceeded the deductible amounts, and accordingly AIG has not been required to pay any claims on its own behalf.  The OSA is reviewing the CA/T Project's monitoring and administration of its insurance program to identify possible cost savings that could be used to alleviate the potential shortfall of funding for the CA/T Project.     Third Harbor Tunnel/Bird Island Flats Interface    This ongoing review is concerned with the design and construction activities associated with the interface between the Third Harbor Tunnel and the Bird Island Flats land tunnel in East Boston.  In addition to reviewing the design and construction contracts, the OSA examined the various change orders and additional costs incurred.  Under the terms of the original contracts, MassHighway paid the design and construction contractors to design and construct a watertight work environment and tunnel interface.  It did not materialize for several reasons.  As a result, the CA/T Project had to issue approximately $10 million in change orders.  The OSA is reviewing MassHighway's rationale for absorbing the cost of these change orders.     CA/T Project Mitigation Activities    A substantial portion of the CA/T Project's budget will be used for mitigation.  The CA/T Project mitigation deals with negotiations or actions taken to lessen the impact of the CA/T Project's construction on the community and the environment.    The CA/T Project has developed extensive mitigation efforts to offset and minimize the impacts during construction and when the CA/T Project is completed. Many mitigation components are established as CA/T Project-wide efforts, while others are developed as very distinct elements created for specifically identified areas, agencies, abutting property owners, businesses, residents, and constituents.    The overall CA/T Project mitigation framework was outlined in the CA/T Project environmental documentation known as the Final Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement/Report, and various mitigation agreements and related approval documentation, such as the federal Record of Decision and the Massachusetts Environmental Policy Acts Certificates.    Just as major highway projects undergo revisions and refinements as the project moves through the preliminary engineering, final design, and construction phases, the resulting mitigation is revised and refined as well. The CA/T Project staff have described the mitigation process as ""evolutionary"" in that the CA/T Project's mitigation framework, which was established through the environmental review process, is continuously being developed and defined through formal written agreements and through the environmental permitting process.    Some CA/T Project officials estimate that up to one-third of the CA/T Project's total costs will be devoted to mitigation.  Consequently, mitigation is a significant factor in the total cost of the CA/T Project.  The OSA is reviewing various aspects of the CA/T Project to determine the impact of mitigation on CA/T Project costs and potential steps that could be taken to lessen this cost impact.     Fort Point Channel Crossing    Currently, an audit is underway of the Fort Point Channel Crossing which will connect the existing Turnpike to the Ted Williams Tunnel.  This connection will be accomplished by inserting a series of multi-lane tunnels under the active railroad lines at South Station between the Post Office Annex, commuter rail lines, and a major industrial complex.  It will also pass over the MBTA's Red Line.  This work area is complicated by the requirements that the construction cannot interfere with the operations of the adjacent Post Office Annex, commuter rail lines, or the major industrial complex.  The channel crossing has been divided into several design packages and construction packages, which have an estimated construction value of $1 billion.  The OSA is evaluating the various major design changes due to the poor soil condition found in the area.     LEGISLATIVELY MANDATED REVIEW    Joint Assessment Study of Segments of the Metropolitan Highway System to be acquired by Massport    Pursuant to Chapter 102 of the Acts of 1995 and Chapter 3 of the Acts of 1997, Massport will enter into a Roadway Construction and Transfer Agreement with the Commonwealth, under which Massport will acquire certain segments of the Metropolitan Highway System (MHS) at a cost not to exceed $300 million.    Chapter 3 of the Acts of 1997 also authorized and directed that Massport, MassPike, the Executive Office of Administration and Finance, the OSA, and the Division of Capital Planning and Operations undertake a joint assessment study to identify assets that may be acquired by Massport.  In conjunction with the study, the OSA is examining the adequacy of the estimated valuation of the assets identified by the study.     SPECIAL EXAMINATIONS    Anonymous Allegations    The OSA occasionally receives anonymous allegations of waste, abuse, and illegal activities at the CA/T Project.  On such occasions, the OSA conducts an investigation to quickly assess the merits of the allegations.  If warranted, the allegation is pursued by the OSA or would be referred to the OAG or the OIG, as appropriate.     OFFICE OF THE INSPECTOR GENERAL    An interdisciplinary team within the OIG monitors the design and construction by MassHighway of the CA/T Project.  The team is funded in part by funds provided by the Legislature for additional oversight initiatives under the auspices of the Commission.  With the funds released in 1997, the OIG has focused its efforts on staffing and equipping the Commission, fulfilling legislative mandates, and framing reviews and recommendations proactively - that is, with a focus on future opportunities for improvement - wherever possible.    The OIG team conducts reviews originating primarily from three sources: legislative directives; staff assessments of management systems particularly vulnerable to waste and abuse; and CA/T Project requests for technical assistance.  The OIG has also undertaken joint projects with other state oversight agencies, particularly the two other Commission members' offices - the OAG and OSA.  Regardless of how a case or review originates, coordination and avoiding duplication of the efforts of other oversight agencies are high among the issues the OIG considers as it structures cases and deploys resources.  Specific examples of oversight coordination, including joint projects, appear elsewhere in this report.     LEGISLATIVELY MANDATED REVIEWS    CA/T Project Financing    Section 21 of Chapter 102 of the Acts of 1995 directed the OIG to study CA/T Project financing and ""recommend adjustments and corrections to the budget and project plans in order to ensure the long term financial stability of the Central Artery/Third Harbor tunnel[.]"" *   In pursuit of that charge, the OIG drafted a detailed request for responses (RFR) aimed at soliciting competitive proposals from firms qualified to conduct and deliver an independent assessment of the CA/T Project financing plan.  [2]    To ensure that the strategy would be responsive to the legislative intent in light of new developments since the original bill language was crafted, the OIG circulated a confidential draft of the RFR to relevant parties.   The Inspector General is considering the feedback he received and will in 1998 determine whether to advertise for an outside firm to do the work or hire staff in-house to deliver the mandated work products.     Building Construction    Section 67 of Chapter 205 of the Acts of 1996 (the transportation bond bill) states in pertinent part:    [MassHighway] shall have jurisdiction over the selection of designers performing design services in connection with the ventilation of buildings, utility facilities and toll booths to be constructed as part of the central artery/third harbor tunnel project, and shall construct, control, supervise, or contract for said structures; provided, however,  that no construction or contractual agreement for construction shall begin prior to the review and approval of the inspector general.   The inspector general shall file with the house and senate committees on ways and means and the joint committee on transportation all notices of approval for projects undertaken pursuant to the provisions of this paragraph.  [Emphasis added.]    The statutory requirement for the Inspector General's  approval  was new with this legislation; previously, only review and comment was required.  The OIG conducts these statutorily mandated reviews and addresses the results to the CA/T Project, the Legislature, and others as appropriate.    The first contract to be subject to the new requirement will be the $7 - 11 million East Boston Toll Facility, which the CA/T Project plans to put out to bid, and award the last quarter of 1998.  In order to complete the review without unnecessarily delaying the CA/T Project schedule, the OIG initiated the preliminary phase of the analysis in the fall of 1997.  Timely completion of the review is dependent upon timely receipt of documents from the CA/T Project.  In keeping with the Commission's legislative mandate, the OIG will provide a briefing on its findings on this and subsequent reviews to the other Commission members.     OIG INITIATIVES    Report:  A Review of the Central Artery/Tunnel Project's Materials Testing Laboratory Function    In December 1997, the OIG issued the results of a review of the CA/T Project's Materials Testing Laboratory, which is responsible for ensuring that construction materials such as concrete and steel meet CA/T Project specifications.  This report focused on the CA/T Project's creation of the laboratory services.  The laboratory opened in 1991 and taxpayers have already paid more than $26 million for MassHighway's consultant, the joint venture of Bechtel/Parsons Brinckerhoff (B/PB) to design, construct, operate, and maintain the facility.  The OIG estimated that the laboratory will cost an additional $26 million between now and the scheduled completion of the CA/T Project in 2004.    The OIG reached several conclusions concerning the CA/T Project: management did not comply with all applicable state laws and regulations in developing the laboratory; at least $5 million had been spent unnecessarily for design, renovation work, relocation expenses, and fees paid to B/PB; and CA/T Project management should include the CA/T Project laboratory operations in cost containment initiatives at this point in the CA/T Project.  Cost savings may result from transferring certain CA/T laboratory functions to MassHighway's already existing statewide materials testing laboratory, using outside laboratories, or some combination of the two.    In response to the report, the CA/T Project Director stated that the laboratory has provided a good value to the CA/T Project and the Commonwealth and that careful analysis of options is conducted when necessary.  The CA/T Project Director also disagreed with the OIG's conclusion that MassHighway violated state law and stated that the laboratory would be the subject of continuing analysis to identify more cost-effective alternatives.     The Early Opening of the Third Harbor Tunnel    In December 1997, the OIG completed an examination of the costs of the early opening of the third harbor tunnel now known as the Ted Williams Tunnel.  The OIG found that MassHighway underestimated the cost of the ""accelerated"" early opening of the Tunnel, which occurred later than had been planned, the CA/T Project may have overestimated the economic benefits of the early opening, and the FHWA does not fund all early opening costs.    The OIG is concerned that costly early opening initiatives will increase the financial burden of the CA/T Project for Massachusetts taxpayers.  In light of decreasing FHWA financial participation in the CA/T Project and the CA/T Project's attempts to control costs, any decision to expend resources on an early opening initiative should be examined closely.  The public benefit to an early opening initiative should clearly outweigh the costs of the initiative for an early opening to make financial sense at this point in the life of the CA/T Project.    In a letter of response, the CA/T Project took issue with some of the concerns documented in the OIG review and concluded by stating that ""the Project's central goal remains to open facilities for beneficial use at the earliest possible dates, so that the economic impact of increased mobility can begin to accrue.  ... We will apply the same technique to future milestones.""     The Value Engineering Change Proposal (VECP) Program    In 1997, the OIG followed up on programmatic concerns raised in its December 1996 report on the VECP program. The VECP program provides construction contractors with an opportunity to propose design changes or changes in construction methods during construction.  These proposals aim to create cost savings, reduce schedules, and/or enhance constructability.  If the CA/T Project implements a VECP, the contractor receives one-half of the net cost savings as an incentive bonus.    In May 1997, the OIG advised the CA/T Project that CA/T Project staff had not included schedule savings in a VECP cost-savings analysis.  Apparently, staff held aside proposed schedule reductions for future negotiations and trade-offs with the contractor.  The OIG advised the CA/T Project that these actions sacrifice savings opportunities and create vulnerabilities to fraud and abuse.    The CA/T Project responded by stating that schedule savings are included in the final VECP savings estimate after the completion of what could be a lengthy negotiation process between the CA/T Project and a construction contractor.     Subaru Warehouse Security    An OIG investigation of security measures at certain CA/T Project locations revealed that Building 13 at the Black Falcon Terminal in Boston, also known as the Subaru Warehouse, was not secured against unauthorized entry.  The building houses electrical equipment and approximately $300,000 of copper cable purchased for construction of the Ted Williams Tunnel as well as core samples from the CA/T Project soil testing program.  Surveillance by the OIG disclosed evidence that copper cable had been stolen from the warehouse.  A March 1997 letter from the OIG to the CA/T Project Director urged the CA/T Project to secure the building and maintain a current inventory of all warehoused equipment and materials.    The CA/T Project concurred with the OIG's concerns in an April 1997 letter describing the enhanced security measures implemented at the site as a result of the OIG investigation.     Public Information Outreach Initiative Contract    Early in 1998, the OIG sent the CA/T Project a preliminary critique of the CA/T Project's request for qualifications/proposal to firms interested in conducting a one-year, $2 million public information/public relations campaign with the potential for a one-year extension.  The OIG's letter questioned the purpose of the expenditure and recommended that the CA/T Project clarify the selection criteria, the work products that were to be delivered, the evaluation component, and the method by which payment would be made.  The CA/T Project responded by clarifying aspects of the selection process and committing to monitoring costs closely, instituting cost containment measures (e.g., using in-house staff instead of the consultant to perform some of the work and pressing the consultant to arrange for  pro bono  work), and independently evaluating the contractor before granting an extension.  CA/T Project staff kept the OIG apprised during the negotiation process and appear to have improved the process as a result of oversight agency input.     Legislative Reviews and Recommendations    The OIG is obligated under its enabling statute (M.G.L. c. 12A) to review legislation and make recommendations concerning the effect of the legislation on the prevention and detection of fraud, waste, and abuse.  Throughout the session, the OIG reviewed and commented on CA/T Project-related bills, including the following:      House No. 1261 proposed to create the MHS and to designate the Massachusetts Turnpike Authority (MassPike) as the owner/operator of the new system, which would include the CA/T Project facilities once construction was completed.  The OIG did not object to the new MassPike role, but recommended several changes: retain control over the issuance of debt for the MHS; subject MassPike to statutory reforms aimed at ensuring open, fair, and robust competition when disposing of real property; strike proposed language that appeared to excuse MassPike from potential liabilities and disputes during MHS construction; and fund additional independent state oversight of the CA/T Project.      House No. 117 would authorize MassHighway (and the CA/T Project) to abandon the Commonwealth's construction bid laws and use whatever alternative methods of construction it wished.  The OIG has consistently objected to the wholesale grant of power to any entity, including MassHighway, to jettison at will essential statutory safeguards.   The OIG has not objected to innovative procurement practices that are undertaken in a prudent, cost-conscious manner; however, any experimentation should be carefully planned, controlled, and evaluated.  To that end, the OIG recommended amended language and offered to work with MassHighway staff to develop other language that would permit innovation without sacrificing the public interest.      House No. 1636, a 1997 transportation bond bill, presented the opportunity for the OIG to again analyze and weigh in on vulnerabilities created by designating MassPike - an independent authority not subject to the same laws and regulations that govern MassHighway - as the owner/operator of the MHS.      House No. 4987 addressed bond authorization requirements of the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA), and also proposed significant changes in previously established public policy, including authorizing the MBTA, MassHighway, MassPike, and Massport to use whatever alternative methods of procurement and construction they wished on certain projects.  In addition to recommending amended language to encourage innovation while safeguarding the public interest, the Inspector General advised the Legislature of plans to evaluate the CA/T Project budget and financing.  The next iteration of the bill (House No. 5432) included most of the language the Inspector General had recommended.         TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE    Bidder Attraction    In response to a CA/T Project request, the OIG reviewed the CA/T Project's bidder attraction program (BAP).  The CA/T Project began the BAP in an attempt to attract a greater pool of construction contract bidders for the CA/T Project.  By letter in July 1997, the OIG reported to the CA/T Project that even though the CA/T Project met its limited BAP program goal of attracting additional bidders, problems created by B/PB's management of the program impeded the program's effectiveness.  The letter recommended improvements to the program.    The CA/T Project responded by stating that it believed the BAP met its goal and that B/PB performed satisfactorily.  The CA/T Project acknowledged that more could be done to attract bidders through additional efforts but that no decision had been made to initiate new efforts.     The Field Engineer's Inspection Handbook    In response to a CA/T Project request, the OIG reviewed the CA/T Project's Field Engineer's Inspection Handbook (FEIH).  The FEIH is intended to provide field-engineering staff with uniform guidelines for judging the acceptability of construction.  By letter of May 1997, the OIG advised the CA/T Project that the FEIH was an adequate reference tool for experienced field staff but might be too general for inexperienced or new staff.  The OIG also concluded that the FEIH could be made more user friendly and could be refined through the addition of references to CA/T Project procedures and guidelines for professional conduct.  In addition, the OIG found that B/PB did not adequately review the FEIH when instructed to by MassHighway and that B/PB failed to follow CA/T Project procedures for the distribution and control of the FEIH.    In response, the CA/T Project wrote that the letter was shared with relevant CA/T Project personnel ""to maximize the awareness of this report and its recommendations and to make others aware of your important role in assisting the Project.""     Resident Engineer Filing System    By letter in February 1998, the OIG provided the CA/T Project with the results of a technical assistance review of the resident engineer (RE) filing system.  In May 1996, the OIG had provided similar assistance by completing a technical assistance review of B/PB's construction management practices including compliance with procedures governing the filing system.  The review, based on examination of RE files in construction site offices and interviews with relevant B/PB staff, disclosed that weaknesses still existed in the collection and maintenance of information by B/PB field staff.  Introduction of a new construction management computer system may rectify some of the problems, but inconsistencies in documentation could continue to compromise the Commonwealth's position in recovery actions and claims disputes.     Automated Technology Office    In response to a CA/T Project request, the OIG reviewed the procurement practices of the CA/T Project's Automated Technology Office (ATO) and reported the results of the review in a December 1997 letter.  Specifically, the CA/T Project asked that the OIG analyze the extent to which B/PB uses state blanket contracts for computer hardware and software, and related purchases.  OIG staff reviewed 143 purchase orders, ATO budgets and expenditures, state regulations and policies, and interviewed CA/T Project staff.  The review disclosed relatively minor problems that will be or are being addressed by management.      [1]   See pages 8 and 9  for specific examples of joint undertakings.   [2]  Section 21 of Chapter 102 of the Acts of 1995 (See  Appendix A ), in addition to directing the development of a comprehensive oversight plan for the CA/T Project, further directed that the plan include the creation of an office within the OIG.      next section:  Conclusion            [ Commission ] [ Attorney General ]  [ State Auditor ]  [ Inspector General ]  [ Big Dig Fraud Hotline ]"
GX270-83-7497740	"Office of the Inspector General Gregory W. Sullivan Inspector General  Commonwealth of Massachusetts  Analysis of Bechtel/Parsons Brinckerhoff's Reply to The Boston Globe's Investigative News Series Concerning the Big Dig  February 2003 Publication No. 18327-50-50-02/03-IGO, approved by Philmore Anderson III, State Pur chasing Agent. Printed on recycled paper.   Introduction On February 9, 10, and 11, 2003, the Boston Globe published a three-part series detailing evidence of mismanagement of the Central Artery/Tunnel Project (CA/T Project) by Bechtel/Parsons Brinckerhoff (B/PB), the private management consultant that has overseen the Big Dig on behalf of the Commonwealth since 1985. Following the publication of the Globe series, which alleged that B/PB has profited from design mistakes and poor decisions contributing to more than $1.6 billion in construction cost overruns to date, public officials pledged their support for cost recovery efforts:  The Governor expressed outrage that B/PB had not been held accountable for costly mistakes, announced a plan to hire an independent engineering firm to review overruns for potential cost recovery from B/PB, and requested that B/PB's President and Chief Operating Officer fly to Boston to explain B/PB's performance. The Massachusetts Turnpike Authority Chairman announced that the Turnpike Authority's cost-recovery team has been pursuing more than 300 claims ranging as high as $1 million against Big Dig contractors. The State Auditor announced that his office is reviewing five major Big Dig contracts entailing combined overruns of $500 million to determine the potential for cost recovery. The Secretary of the Commonwealth announced that he would investigate record-keeping by the Big Dig to determine whether documentation of cost overruns is missing and filed legislation to extend the statute of limitations for Big Dig contract claims from six years to ten years. The Senate and House voted to extend the statute of limitations for lawsuits arising from Big Dig contracts to 10 years beyond the Project completion date. The Inspector General issued a detailed report that provided additional evidence of deficient work on the part of B/PB in connection with $65 million in Project cost increases relating to ground movement, or ""grout heave."" The Inspector General also announced that he would require investigative production of all documents from B/PB, contractors, and cost recovery officials concerning cost overruns identified in the Globe series.            The Inspector General's Office's concurs with the major findings and conclusions of the Globe's investigative series. The Office has identified more than $730 million in contract  1   modifications associated with construction contracts initiated prior to final design approval. B/PB's defense is that it employed a ""fast track"" system. However, based on the Office's review of hundreds of thousands of Big Dig documents over the past 12 years, the Office is not aware of any ""fast track"" system that superceded B/PB's contractual obligations to prepare preliminary designs and to accept or reject final designs. The Office has also identified more than $340 million in contract modifications resulting from ""differing site conditions."" However, the Office has identified cases in which the attribution of cost overruns to ""differing site conditions"" has been used by B/PB as a cover story for its failure to perform its contractual obligation to fully assess site conditions during the design stage. Thus, B/PB's claims mask, in many cases, the true nature of the overruns and obfuscate B/PB's culpability for its share of responsibility for these cost overruns. The Globe series elicited a comprehensive response from B/PB, which released a 17page, point-by-point reply on February 20, 2003. In the interest of advancing the cause of cost recovery, the Office has prepared a point-by-point response to B/PB's 17-page reply. The Office's response is provided in the following pages, along with a listing of selected CA/T Project oversight reports and letters issued by the Office between 1991 and 2003. At the end of this report is an acknowledgment of certain individuals and organizations whose positive contributions to the Project have benefited Massachusetts taxpayers and tollpayers. Over the past decade, the Office of the Inspector General has documented numerous cases of B/PB's mismanagement of the CA/T Project and failure to institute aggressive cost containment measures. The Office's December 2001 report exposed the failure of the CA/T Project's cost recovery program: in six years, the Project had only recovered $30,000 from about $83.5 million in cost recovery related change orders. The report also found that the Project had set up the cost recovery program primarily to ensure federal funding, not to recover costs, and that B/PB's overly broad role in Project management undermined the Commonwealth's ability to hold B/PB accountable for its design work. The recent Globe series reached similar conclusions. The Office will  2   continue its efforts to ensure that the Commonwealth recovers all funds to which it is entitled on the CA/T Project.  3   This page intentionally left blank.  4   Analysis of Bechtel/Parsons Brinckerhoff's Reply The following includes excerpted information from the February 20, 2003 response by Bechtel/Parsons Brinckerhoff (B/PB) to the findings in the three-part Boston Globe series. These excerpts also include B/PB's summary of the Globe's findings. Inspector General's point-by-point response to B/PB follows each excerpt. The  B/BP's Responsibility for Cost Overruns Globe Finding: The Project ran up ""1.6 billion in construction cost overruns,"" of which at least $1.1 billion was tied to B/PB errors. B/PB Reply: The Globe contends that cost overruns totaling $1.1 billion are B/PB's fault and responsibility. Virtually every construction project faces unanticipated challenges requiring contract modifications, known as change orders, that are not the result of neglect, mistakes, or abuse. The changes in Boston, approved by MTA, reflected a host of legitimate circumstances, including the discovery of unforeseen underground obstacles such as undocumented utilities and old wharves buried in landfill, statemandated changes in the scope of project work, and schedule adjustments caused by factors such as public requests for noise or traffic mitigation. The $1.6 billion in question -- which comes from B/PB's own charts -- reflects legitimate modifications to original project construction contracts and cannot be construed as errors. Examples of these change orders include:       $321 million in project scope changes $263 million in design development. $357 million to cope with what engineers call ""differing site conditions."" $152 million for unforeseeable schedule adjustments. $85 million in approved costs to deal with third parties, such as utilities and property owners adjacent to the project. $460 million in unclassified costs.  Inspector General's Response: The Inspector General's Office strongly concurs with the Globe conclusion that $1.1 billion in cost overruns are linked to contracts begun before designs were completed and contracts with cost overruns related to differing site conditions. Our review concludes that more than $730 million in contract modifications were associated with construction contracts initiated prior to final design approval. Our review also found that more than $340 million in contract modifications resulted from  5   contracts that involved differing site conditions. In total, this represents more than $1.07 billion in cost overruns associated with contracts that were either initiated prior to final design or were later modified due to differing site conditions. B/PB misstated the  Globe's conclusion in its response when it rebutted the Globe's findings on this point. B/PB stated that the Globe had found that ""at least $1.1 billion was directly B/PB's fault."" What the Globe actually said was that $1.1 billion in construction cost overruns are tied to B/PB mistakes. The Inspector General's Office concludes that at least $1.07 billion in cost overruns are tied to contracts with incomplete designs or that encountered site conditions that were not planned for. According to B/PB, none of these overruns are attributable to B/PB's work. Since 1997, the Inspector General's Office has strongly advocated that overruns such as these be reviewed for potential cost overruns to identify B/PB's share of responsibility. In addition to the $1.07 billion in cost overruns, the Project also incurred many millions of dollars more in administrative costs associated with these overruns. This $1.07 billion figure represents a major portion of the universe of potential cost recovery claims that will become the subject of the major cost recovery initiative underway at the Turnpike Authority. B/PB defends itself by claiming that it employed ""fast track"" construction methods, thus purporting to explain why so many contracts were initiated prior to completion of final designs. The Inspector General's Office has literally reviewed hundreds of thousands of Big Dig documents during the past 12 years and is not aware of any verification of B/PB's claim that a ""fast track"" system was implemented to supercede B/PB's contractual obligations to promulgate preliminary designs and to accept or reject final designs to facilitate construction. Similarly, B/PB defends itself by stating that $357 million in cost overruns were incurred due to unexpected ""differing site conditions."" The Inspector General's Office concludes that in many cases, the categorization of cost overruns as ""differing site conditions"" has been used by B/PB as a cover story for its failure to perform its contractually obligated duties to assess site conditions during the design stage. Thus, B/PB `s ready claims of  6   ""fast track"" and ""differing site conditions"" masks, in many cases, the true nature of the overruns and obfuscates B/PB's culpability for its share of responsibility for these cost overruns. The Inspector General's Office and the State Auditor's Office, as is detailed in this report, have presented to B/PB and the Turnpike Authority many instances wherein cost overruns were related to design changes that should have been part of the original design. The Inspector General's Office concludes that what B/PB and the  Turnpike Authority calls ""fast tracking"" has very often been nothing more than spending millions for catching up to the Big Dig construction schedule because of prior designrelated delays. An example is the so-called ""early opening"" of the Ted Williams Tunnel. The Inspector General's Office formally complained to the Turnpike Authority in 1997 that $23 million had been wasted to open the Tunnel ""early."" In fact, this Office concluded at the time that the Tunnel opening did not occur ""early'"" but actually occurred nearly two years late. The State Auditor's Office also issued a report that cited $44 million in earlier acceleration costs associated with the Tunnel opening. Thus the combined $67 million was spent to make up for schedule slippage and delays caused by earlier mistakes. Thus, in the case of the Ted Williams Tunnel the ""fast tracking"" excuse was used to completely avoid scrutiny of B/PB's potential liability.  Fleet Center Overruns Globe Finding: B/PB failed to depict the Fleet Center arena in its preliminary designs, costing taxpayers nearly $1 million in construction rework. B/PB Reply: The Globe claims the Fleet Center was not included in preliminary designs, an error that resulted in almost $1 million in additional costs. The truth is that incomplete plans drawn up by the final designer -- not B/PB -- led to $30,000 of rework, only 3 percent of the Globe's figure. The state took authority for approving final designs. Contrary to the Globe's account, B/PB was not responsible for alleged flaws in the final design of this or any other part of the project. Inspector General's Response: B/PB responded that revisions to the Fleet Center design only cost $30,000 and not the nearly $1 million as claimed. However, the  Inspector General's Office wrote to the Project in September 1997 identifying nearly $2  7   million in added costs for the redesign of the Vent Building abutting the Fleet Center. This redesign was made necessary because the Project failed to identify an easement granted to the Fleet Center by the Highway Department in 1993. This was clearly an error made during design that has gone uninvestigated. In addition, the Project had to expend more than $500,000 to redesign a water line that conflicted with existing utilities. B/PB failed to identify these existing utilities. This issue was never investigated.  B/PB's Contractual Responsibilities Globe Finding: During the 17 years it has managed the Big Dig, Bechtel has neglected to perform basic work called for in its contracts. B/PB Reply: As management consultant to the Massachusetts Turnpike Authority (MTA) on the ""Big Dig"" project, B/PB has been responsible for preliminary design, management of the final design process and construction by other consultants and contractors, and reporting on the project's overall cost and schedule. The state has always maintained authority and responsibility for policy-level decision making, direction of the project, and oversight of B/PB. The state hired other engineering and construction firms to take responsibility for final design and actual construction. Each designer and contractor is responsible to MTA for its cost, schedule, and work quality. B/PB does estimate the costs of individual contracts, monitors them for adherence to budget, schedule, and contract terms; provide quality assurance services; and oversee the contractors' safety programs. B/PB is not responsible for checking design submittals and is not responsible for their content -- yet the Globe blames B/PB for any and all alleged flaws in the final design of the project. Inspector General's Response: The Inspector General concurs with the Globe finding and believes that B/PB misrepresents its contractual role. Based on B/PB's response it would appear that B/PB has been paid nearly $2 billion to simply monitor these design contracts, process payments, and pass documents through to the Turnpike Authority. For $2 billion, the Commonwealth expected B/PB to do more than shuffle paper. The Inspector General's review of B/PB's contract with the Commonwealth has found the following: a) The first line of the contract specifically states that B/PB should ""manage the design and construction of the"" Project.  8   b) The contract section ""Final Design"" states that B/PB ""shall review and submit for Department approval all SDC designs and work products for:      Conformance with Project design criteria, standards, specifications, budgets, schedules, environmental commitments and other requirements; Conformance with accepted professional standards for quality and other professional standards as defined by the Department; Overall coordination between disciplines and different design packages; Consistency with final design packages completed by others; and Consistency with the preliminary design.  c) The contract allows for B/PB to perform final design work as directed by the Turnpike Authority. In some instances, B/PB did perform final design work and did sign and stamp drawings. d) The contract section ""Review of Design Submittals,"" states that B/PB shall perform technical reviews of SDC [section design consultants] design submittals and ""shall accept or reject SDC submittals based on these reviews."" The same contract  section provides that the consultant shall perform ""an independent peer review of the 75 percent design submittal by the SDC."" e) The contract section ""Final Design Phase,"" states that B/PB shall comment on final design and construction bid documents prepared by the SDC and that these comments should reflect SDC compliance with Project standards, design intent, and coordination with other design contracts. f) The contract section ""Structural Analysis of Joint Development"" calls for B/PB to ""verify feasibility and structural integrity"" of certain designs. g) The contract section ""Design Management"" calls for B/PB to provide a qualified design management team to oversee SDC services and to maintain ""the availability' of recognized experts in relevant fields to provide advice, opinions, and to review ""design problems of a special nature.""  9   h) The contract section ""Architecture"" specifically states that B/PB has the responsibility to design or manage the design of highway and building architecture as well as associated elements. i) The contract calls for B/PB to perform quality control for the Project. j) The contract section ""Review of Final Design Submittals"" calls for B/PB to ""perform reviews for all design submittals made by SDCs."" According to the contract, B/PB reviews final design work five separate times for each contract and ""recommends"" to the Turnpike Authority whether the SDC work should be approved, changed, or rejected. k) The contract calls for B/PB to conduct studies to identify alternatives for each Project structure, including recommending through final design, two structural types for bridges and viaducts valued at more than $10 million. l) Under the contract, B/PB provides and manages survey and mapping services through final design. This includes the identification of underground utilities and existing conditions. m) The contract calls for B/PB not only to perform preliminary design work, but to prepare standard and directive drawings, design manuals, and other design guidelines to be used by the SDCs during final design. According to the contract, these design documents ""serve as the basis for SDCs to perform the final design."" In a number of cases the SDCs attributed errors to these design standards prepared by B/PB and imposed upon the SDCs by contract. n) The contract calls for B/PB to inspect field construction conditions ""for technical conformance to design."" Therefore, B/PB has a key role to play in identifying and evaluating whether errors relate to design work or construction quality. o) The contract section ""Changes and Claims Administration"" requires that B/PB prepares cost and schedule evaluations and process changes and claims proposed  10   by the SDCs and other consultants. situations.""  B/PB must also ""ascertain potential claim  B/PB's Responsibility for Field Surveys Globe Finding: B/PB neglected to perform basic work called for in its contracts, such as conducting crucial field surveys of the elevated Artery. As a result, contractors incurred large overruns. Such failures cost the state more than $350 million. B/PB Reply: The $350 million reflects costs to deal with what engineers call ""differing site conditions"" -- unexpected obstacles to construction, such as undocumented utilities. These are inevitable when building underground in a historic urban area. A detailed survey of the Artery was not done completely in advance of construction, since the contractor was required to do a survey prior to building the Artery underpinning. This standard industry practice saved the cost of doing the survey twice. The costs incurred to deal with issues that were identified by the contractor's survey would have had to be paid for whether or not the survey was done before the design. Inspector General's Response: Under B/PB's contract with the Commonwealth, B/PB is required to provide and manage survey and mapping services through final design. This includes the identification of underground utilities and existing conditions. As explained in the section entitled ""B/PB's Responsibility for Cost Overruns,"" the Inspector General's Office concludes that in many cases, the categorization of cost overruns as ""differing site conditions"" has been used by B/PB as a cover story for its failure to perform its contractually obligated duties to assess site conditions during the design stage. While ""differing site conditions"" are an expected occurrence on any construction project of the Big Dig's magnitude, this Office has pointed out repeatedly in the past and reiterates now that B/PB has claimed no responsibility for these overruns.  Inaccurate Designs Globe Finding: Construction on many of the Big Dig's major contracts began with incomplete and inaccurate designs, causing costly delays. B/PB Reply: All project designs were essentially complete when construction began, with one major exception: the ongoing mechanical and electrical design work at the time the Mainline Tunnel and Ventilation Building contracts were signed.  11   The individual section design consultants, not B/PB, signed off on the design drawings associated with their contracts. They are the responsible designers of record. Inspector General's Response: The Inspector General does not believe B/PB's response is accurate. The hundreds of millions of dollars worth of claims relating to design development issues and the hundreds of design update packages indicates that designs were not 100 percent complete when awarded for construction. In the recent report issued by the National Academy of Engineering for the Turnpike Authority, the Academy states that ""the CA/T work packages . . . frequently required modifications to accommodate project-wide systems that were designed in later packages."" In addition, this Office has reported, on numerous occasions since 1994, that many change orders could have been avoided had design elements been included before a construction package was put out for bid.  Incomplete Designs Globe Finding: B/PB acknowledged that three major construction contracts went out to bid while designs were ""substantially incomplete."" B/PB Reply: The three other allegedly incomplete designs referenced in the Globe article were still pending at the time bids were first advertised, in order not to miss a window of opportunity for federal funding. Inspector General's Response: Notwithstanding B/PB's claim that it approved construction start-up based on incomplete designs in order not to miss a window of opportunity for federal funding, the resultant problems contributed to massive cost overruns that in turn led the U.S. Congress to institute a funding cap on the Big Dig. The frustration of Congress about these overruns and the resultant imposition of the funding cap has left Massachusetts bearing at least $6 billion of Big Dig costs, excluding interest on bond debt, by far the largest state burden for a federally funded public works project in U.S history.  12   Fast Track Documentation Globe Finding: No documentation of the so-called fast track plan exists, calling into question whether it was an actual initiative or an after-the-fact justification. B/PB Reply: State officials, who continuously reviewed B/PB's work and approved all bids and contracts, supported the fast-track approach ever since construction began in 1991. Inspector General's Response: This issue has been previously discussed in this report. The Inspector General's Office has literally reviewed hundreds of thousands of Big Dig documents during the past 12 years and is not aware of any verification of B/PB's claim that a ""fast track"" system was implemented to supercede B/PB's contractual obligations to promulgate preliminary designs and to accept or reject final designs to facilitate construction. B/PB `s ready claims of ""fast track"" mask, in many cases, the true nature of the overruns and obfuscate B/PB's culpability for its share of responsibility for these cost overruns.  Haymarket Square Globe Finding: The cost to build tunnels from Haymarket Square to North Station grew nearly 60 percent over the contractor's bid, an object lesson in B/PB's mismanagement. B/PB Reply: Evidence shows that the growth in costs was directly related to the conditions encountered at the site, not mismanagement. Assertions to the contrary by Jay M. Cashman Inc. are those of a contractor trying to build a case for a claim. Cashman had ample time to review all relevant documents and addenda during the bid phase. Inspector General's Response: This Office concurs with the Globe. Records show that B/PB sent the contractor 16 design revision packets that included hundreds of revised drawings. These changes raised more than 1,800 issues that needed to be clarified regarding differences between the revised design and actual field conditions. B/PB's response overlooks these matters of record, again denying any responsibility for the cost overruns.  13   MBTA Green Line Globe Finding: On Dec. 22, 1994, MBTA officials met with B/PB to discuss plans to raze a ramp near the Fleet Center. MBTA's representatives told B/PB that it would cause the Green Line and the ramp to collapse. B/PB did not change the plans. Three years later, conceding that MBTA officials were right all along, B/PB ordered an elaborate support system for which Cashman received $250,000. B/PB Reply: The project coordinated with MBTA throughout the entire course of the design. The New Chardon Street off-ramp, which was a common train and roadway ramp developed jointly with MBTA and the Big Dig, did require additional underpinning due to its proximity to a slurry wall and utility work. Although underpinning was part of the design bid by the contractor, additional costs resulted from revisions to this underpinning due to site-specific field conditions as opposed to lack of coordination with MBTA. Inspector General's Response: B/PB disregards, in its response to the Globe, its clear obligations under its contract concerning design submittals. The contract section ""Review of Design Submittals"" states that B/PB shall perform technical reviews of SDC [section design consultants] design submittals and ""shall accept or reject SDC submittals based on these reviews."" The same contract section provides that the  consultant shall perform ""an independent peer review of the 75 percent design submittal by the SDC."" The contract section ""Final Design Phase"" states that B/PB shall comment on final design and construction bid documents prepared by the SDC and that these comments should reflect SDC compliance with Project standards, design intent, and coordination with other design contracts. Site specific conditions could have been  identified or anticipated in the construction contract. A cost recovery should identify which party, if any, was at fault.  Ted Williams Tunnel Globe Finding: Drawings for the Ted Williams Tunnel left a 4-foot gap between tunnel sections, causing $307,000 in new work. B/PB Reply: There was an error in the final design of the tunnel sections where two contracts came together. It was corrected with the extension of a cut-and-cover tunnel. The Cost Recovery Committee concluded there were $9,000 in additional costs, which  14   B/PB, and the two section design consultants responsible for the final design of the tunnel sections, agreed to bear. Inspector General's Response: In this case, B/PB admits that an error occurred. B/PB also states that B/PB and the final designer agreed to bear $9,000 in additional costs, indicating to this Office that the needed design revisions were performed. The total cost of this error was $307,000. Thus, the tollpayers bore $298,000, or 97 percent, of the cost of this error. The fault for the error in this case resides with B/PB or the final designer, not the tollpayers.  Design Updates Globe Finding: Once construction began, B/PB and the design firms it managed fired out hundreds of ""design update"" packages to contractors already in the field, often with new information that conflicted with other designs. Some of those updates arrived years into construction. B/PB Reply: Issuance of design update packages to construction contractors is normal construction industry practice as designers react to newly discovered site conditions, approved initiatives for cost containment and schedule recovery, and updates from mechanical and electrical designers. Many Big Dig contracts involved five to six years of construction. Inspector General's Response: Some design update packages during construction are justified and unavoidable. However, as discussed earlier in this report, this Office has reported on numerous occasions since 1994 that many change orders could have been avoided had the necessary design elements always been included before construction packages were put out for bid.  Quality Control Globe Finding: B/PB's quality control was lax, based on the findings of Federal Highway Administration inspectors. One steel beam was made of a weaker grade of steel than project regulations allowed. B/PB Reply: The FHWA inspection report rated the overall quality of work on the site as ""satisfactory."" Furthermore, the Quality Assurance Process Review conducted by  15   FHWA in July 2000 listed the process for acceptance of metal products as one of five noteworthy accomplishments. Inspectors discovered one beam of lower-grade steel, caused by a supplier error. It was a temporary bulkhead end pile. The contractor requested that the temporary pile be accepted rather than removed, since it carried a reduced load and was not a structural member. The final designer agreed. Inspector General's Response: Records reviewed by the Office support the Globe's conclusion and contradict B/PB's reply. B/PB understates the magnitude of the  problems identified by the U.S. Department of Transportation in its inspection report of February 24, 1999. B/PB minimizes and mischaracterizes the federal criticism by  saying that the federal report only identified one beam of lower grade steel. Records show that the Department of Transportation cited three additional problems contributing to its conclusion that the overall quality of work was unsatisfactory. Records include the following:  Removal of live piles: Improper procedures used in the removal of an unknown number of load bearing shafts that had previously supported the elevated Central Artery;  Soldier piles (temporary supporting shafts): lack of the specified steel quality reports tests of additional support shafts of the Central Artery.  Steel installed on the contract did not match up with the steel quality control tracking numbers for this phase of the contract.  Fort Point Channel Globe Finding: In November 1999, Drew King, a B/PB field engineer, noted in a report that a steel dam built to keep water out of Fort Point Channel tunnel area was not sealed. B/PB never informed state managers of King's findings or directed the contractor, Modern Continental Construction Co., to make the needed repairs. Two years later, a massive leak erupted, causing the largest construction setback and delaying I-90's opening at a cost of at least $41 million. A state inquiry concluded that B/PB had relied on an ""unreasonable"" design in the first place, according to a confidential report by the law firm of Kirkpatrick & Lockhart. In October 1997, an 16   independent group of engineers, who were invited to review the designs before construction began, called them ""unrealistic."" B/PB Reply: Of the $75 million worth of specific B/PB mistakes alleged by the Globe, more than half is accounted for by a Fort Point Channel leak for which B/PB was not found at fault by MTA's independent engineering consultant. The MTA's independent engineering consultant, retained after the leaks occurred, did not find fault with B/PB's performance. The sheeting discontinuity was the result of construction contractor noncompliance with the contract documents and MTA held the contractor accountable for that deficiency. The quoted comment about B/PB relying on an ""unreasonable design"" is taken out of context and demonstrates the Globe's lack of understanding of complex engineering issues. The law firm Kirkpatrick & Lockhart was citing a prior consultant's conclusion in October 1997 that some design assumptions were unrealistic. Inspector General's Response: A report by an independent expert did in fact conclude that B/PB relied on an unreasonable design for this contract. Under its contract, B/PB was responsible to ""perform reviews for all design submittals made by SDCs."" According to the contract, B/PB is responsible for reviewing design work five separate times for each contract and for recommending to the Turnpike Authority whether the SDC work should be approved, changed, or rejected. After B/PB disagreed with the negative assessment of the independent expert, the matter was dropped. This contract represents an example of a potential cost recovery issue that should be reviewed. The Fort Point Channel issue has been of interest to both this Office and the State Auditor Joseph DeNucci. In fact, the Auditor issued a report pertaining to Fort Point Channel that identified design problems. This Office has never been satisfied that the design problems stemming from the Fort Point area have been adequately reviewed by the independent consultants hired by the Big Dig. In one case, this Office referred an issue to the State Ethics Commission because we believed that a conflict of interest existed for one of the so-called independent consultants who reviewed the issue. B/PB is contractually responsible for both design and construction management. To the  extent that the failures in the Fort Point Channel stem from management errors, B/PB should be held accountable.  17   Cost Recovery Committee Globe Finding: The Cost Recovery Committee routinely overlooked or excused B/PB's errors. B/PB Reply: The project's Cost Recovery Committee -- which has authority to investigate allegations of unjustified cost overruns -- ""exonerated [B/PB] in all 15 cases it considered against the [joint venture]."" The committee, which consisted of the state project director, state construction manager, and Federal Highway Administration project engineer, was independent of B/PB. Its findings were based on timely and balanced investigations by expert evaluators, not judgments by reporters following old paper trails taken out of context. The Cost Recovery Committee is the responsibility of MTA, not B/PB. Its members -- the Big Dig's state project director, state construction manager, and Federal Highway Administration project engineer -- are independent of B/PB. Inspector General's Response: B/PB was responsible under the contract for providing the Turnpike Authority with ""technical support"" for the cost recovery process, including the ""review of plans, specifications, and correspondence; review of design and construction PCNs [change orders], contractor proposals, contract modifications; support Area Team analysis as requested; provide written reports and  recommendations when necessary and appropriate; attend sessions of the Cost Recovery Committee; and provide technical assistance to the Area Teams and Committee where appropriate or as requested"" by the Turnpike Authority. also responsible to ""ascertain potential claim situations."" A report issued in December 2000 by the Inspector General concerning the Big Dig's cost recovery program stated: ""B/PB's role in the cost recovery process is akin to the fox guarding the hen house. B/PB's extensive role in preliminary design and final design management should preclude any role in a program - such as the cost recovery program - that purports to examine problems that may have been caused by B/PB's own work. But B/PB controls the data."" B/PB was  18   Referrals to the Cost Recovery Committee Globe Finding: The state relied on B/PB to point out flaws in its own designs and management. B/PB referred just three cases to the Cost Recovery Committee. B/PB Reply: Numerous authorities, including federal and state transportation officials, have always had the right and did take the opportunity to flag potential cost recovery issues. According to the MTA legal department, the Globe had access to only 71 closed cases of a total of more than 350 cost recovery cases. It appears that the Globe's statistics about B/PB were derived from a small sample. In addition, many of the cases do not document the referral source. B/PB's recollection is that it initiated more cases than the Globe identified. Inspector General's Response: This Office strongly concurs with the Globe's conclusion. Our review of the cost recovery program in 2000 did not identify any cost recovery or other action against B/PB. The Commonwealth paid B/PB to review,  negotiate, and manage thousands of change orders worth billion of dollars. B/PB also had virtual control over the change order process by virtue of its presence in the field. B/PB's reply that many authorities have had the right to identify potential cost recovery issues is not responsive to the Globe's conclusion that B/PB failed to perform its duties under the contract and to point out flaws in its own management. This Office reached the same conclusion independently in December 2000 when this Office recommended that in regards to cost recovery, B/PB and the Turnpike Authority be delinked. This Office also stated: ""The Commonwealth's over-reliance on B/PB  and B/PB's  dominant role in the Project - provides insulation from cost recovery actions and shields B/PB from any attempt by the Turnpike Authority to hold the joint venture accountable through the cost recovery process for deficient design."" Routinely, when this Office or the State Auditor's Office referred a matter for potential cost recovery, we have been rebuffed. In a joint letter issued with the State Auditor in October 2001, this Office stated: ""Since its inception, the cost recovery process that holds contractors responsible for cost overruns has been totally reliant upon B/PB. It is disturbing, but not surprising, that under such a claims recovery process not a single claim has been filed against B/PB, even though possible substandard performance by B/PB may have contributed directly to billions of dollars in added costs.""  19   Flawed Contract Globe Finding: The state's contract was fundamentally flawed, effectively rewarding the firm for delays and overruns. B/PB Reply: B/PB has received a standard compensation package for the professional services it provides. This includes fees for service as well as reimbursement of its labor and operating costs, a normal industry practice. It has always had project incentives to minimize delays, overruns, or both. Inspector General's Response: B/PB does not address the Globe's underlying conclusion that B/PB's compensation indirectly increases in proportion to Project length and cost. The Inspector General's Office independently reached this conclusion as well. In May 2000, this Office wrote that under its contract, B/PB is paid principally on a costplus-fixed-fee basis, which fails to create the necessary incentives or to hold B/PB accountable for meeting CA/T Project budget and schedule goals. Most of B/PB's compensation is not tied to deliverables or other measurable performance standards; indeed, project delays and construction contract changes serve to increase B/PB's compensation.  B/PB's Fee Globe Finding: B/PB will receive more than $2 billion by project completion, including $180 million in profits. B/PB Reply: The Globe inflated B/PB's fees by 50 percent. Currently, it is estimated that for the period 1985-2005 B/PB will receive $122 million in fees and its subconsultants will receive $26 million. B/PB's fees represent only about 8 tenths of 1 percent of project costs. The vast majority of B/PB's revenues are simply pass-through payments--reimbursements for labor and direct expenses or for payments to other subcontractors. Inspector General's Response: The Inspector General strongly concurs with the Globe's conclusion. B/PB claims that its fee will only be $122 million. However, this $122 million is only the profit guaranteed to B/PB under the contract. It does not include the overhead. For every $100 paid to B/PB for direct costs, it receives an additional $110 for indirect costs.  20   Formal Review Procedures Globe Finding: No formal procedure existed to oversee B/PB's performance at all until 1994. B/PB Reply: There have been dozens of audits, investigations, and reviews by federal, state, and local officials as well as news media. Many critics have questioned B/PB's project management, but few specific charges have been substantiated upon close review. B/PB's performance has continuously been monitored by MTA and several federal and state agencies, including FHWA, Department of Transportation Inspector General, State Auditor, and State Inspector General, as well as several independent consultants engaged by MHD/MTA over the years. From the beginning of the project, MHD/MTA put in place a ""part/counterpart"" organization, by which state design, construction, and services officials shadowed their counterparts at B/PB. In the late 1990s the project adopted an Integrated Project Organization at MTA's behest. MTA inserted employees directly into the construction and project management team, where they directly supervise day-to-day project activities. For example, the project's construction manager is a state official to whom B/PB staffers report. Inspector General's Response: This Office first raised this issue in 1991. Of note is that the original management agreement between the Highway Department and B/PB was drafted by B/PB. In 1991 we wrote: ""The [management] Plan does not provide the Department with adequate means to hold B/PB accountable for managing the Project in a cost-conscious and responsible manner . . . the Plan as presently crafted does not go far enough toward providing the means to accomplish that end . . . Virtually all administrative control and oversight appears to be vested in B/PB."" The Inspector General wrote in May 2000: The Commonwealth's excessively broad project management contract with Bechtel/Parsons Brinckerhoff has impeded effective cost control and oversight, undermined public accountability on the CA/T Project, and eroded the Commonwealth's contracting leverage. The Massachusetts Highway Department (MassHighway) selected the joint venture of Bechtel/Parsons Brinckerhoff (B/PB) from among five firms in 1985 to manage design and construction of the CA/T Project. Since 1985, MassHighway has paid B/PB nearly $2 billion through a series of noncompetitively awarded contracts, also called ""work programs."" From  21   the beginning, MassHighway has turned over most administrative control and oversight of the Project to B/PB. Although MassHighway is the designated recipient agency for federal highway funds and the signatory on the contracts with B/PB, MassPike now negotiates and oversees the contractual arrangement. A state law enacted over my objections in 1997, M.G.L. c. 81A, created the Metropolitan Highway System, designated MassPike as the future owner and operator of the CA/T facilities, and opened the door for MassPike to play a larger role in other arenas. With the approval of the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) and under written agreement with MassHighway, MassPike now manages design and construction of the CA/T Project, including B/PB's consulting contract. Under its CA/T-related consulting contracts, B/PB has prepared preliminary designs, overseen -- and, in some cases, performed -- final design work; implemented value engineering reviews and other quality control measures; overseen soils testing and remediation; prepared construction bid packages; overseen construction contracts; negotiated construction contract changes and claims; processed invoices; maintained management information systems; and performed many other functions, including general record-keeping. B/PB as project manager is responsible for identifying the causes of major cost overruns and delays. In effect, this arrangement relies on B/PB to reveal problems even when such problems are associated with B/PB's own design work. This Office is aware of no evidence that B/PB has ever acknowledged making a mistake that contributed to increased costs and schedule delays. By contracting with B/PB to perform the full range of project management services and to oversee its own work, the Commonwealth has weakened its capacity to exert effective control over the cost and quality of the services B/PB provides. Moreover, the structure of the contractual arrangement, under which B/PB is paid principally on a cost-plus-fixed-fee basis, fails to create the necessary incentives or to hold B/PB accountable for meeting CA/T Project budget and schedule goals. Most of B/PB's compensation is not tied to deliverables or other measurable performance standards; indeed, project delays and construction contract changes serve to increase B/PB's compensation. The Commonwealth's near-total dependence on B/PB has eroded its negotiating leverage to the detriment of the public interest. I have repeatedly recommended that the Commonwealth's contractual arrangement with B/PB be reconfigured. CA/T Project officials have largely declined to do so precisely because they depend so heavily on  22   B/PB's expertise. As a result, the problems caused by this contractual arrangement have been perpetuated and exacerbated. Now is the time to act: MassPike staff is currently negotiating the terms, cost, and duration of the next consulting contract with B/PB. Although CA/T construction is reportedly nearly 60 percent complete, opportunities still exist to strengthen the public interest protections in this contractual arrangement. MassPike should take steps to further reduce the scope of its contract with B/PB and to ensure that B/PB is no longer paid to review its own work. Design-related functions such as value engineering, quality control, quality assurance, and negotiation of construction contract changes and claims should be competitively procured from consultants independent of B/PB or provided by MassPike or MassHighway staff. Reducing the scope of the contractual arrangement with B/PB will enable MassPike to incorporate more meaningful performance requirements, including deliverables, and performance-based compensation provisions into future contracts with B/PB. B/PB has been the only game in town for too long, and taxpayers are paying the price. The current management organization of the CA/T Project undermines the essential arm's-length relationship between the Commonwealth and B/PB. In the past, MassHighway was prohibited by M.G.L. c. 29, 29A from allowing B/PB to supervise state employees assigned to manage and oversee the Project. However, MassPike is an independent authority with no such constraints on its organizational arrangements. Under the MassPike umbrella, Project officials have created a so-called ""integrated project organization"" combining MassPike employees and B/PB employees. According to CA/T Project managers, the integrated project organization was designed to match staff members' technical skills to jobs without regard to the organization paying their salaries. The resulting organizational scheme has the potential to be an accountability nightmare. For example, MassPike's Director of Construction reports both to B/PB's top program manager and to the MassPike Project Director. This individual (the MassPike Director of Construction) has represented MassPike in contract negotiations with B/PB. This type of arrangement renders the CA/T Project vulnerable to divided loyalties and conflicting interests. Project management plans prepared by B/PB and approved by the FHWA and the Commonwealth have described the Project as a ""dynamic, flexible and harmonious whole."" MassPike's integrated project organization is the dangerously misguided product of that concept. Intertwining the CA/T oversight function with the private management consulting function is an invitation to fraud, waste, and abuse. I urge you to take immediate action to decouple and ensure appropriate separation of these two functions.  23   Payment of Overruns Globe Finding: B/PB reviewed and recommended the state pay all overruns. And yet hundreds, perhaps thousands of the overruns were rooted in missing or incorrect information in the design process supervised by B/PB. B/PB Reply: This statement is categorically false. The state, FHWA, and B/PB undertake an extensive analysis for each change order. The merit of the issue is determined and then the commercial context of the issue is established. Over the life of the project, the average change order has been settled at approximately 50 percent of its claimed value. In summary, not all claims have merit and those that do are often not settled at the contractors' claimed value. Some are rejected entirely. Furthermore, to allege that ""thousands of the overruns"" are related to B/PB mistakes is false and totally unsupported. It should also be noted that all commercial settlements are approved by state and federal officials as part of the change order process. Inspector General's Response: The Inspector General's Office concurs with the Globe's conclusion. The Office reached this same conclusion independently in May 2000 when the Inspector General wrote: Deficient management practices on the CA/T Project have reduced the Commonwealth's capacity to generate accurate cost estimates on individual contracts, control spending, and predict and control future costs. In letters and reports issued since 1991, my Office has identified numerous management practices that, if left uncorrected, were likely to obscure problems, increase costs, and hamper the CA/T Project's ability to predict and control costs. Recent reports by federal oversight agencies have corroborated my Office's findings. For example, my Office has raised concerns about poor or incomplete CA/T Project design specifications, the approval of major design changes after construction contracts have been advertised and awarded, and the removal of items from the contract scope of services to reduce apparent costs. Cost control -- and the ability to identify potential cost exposure -- has also been undermined by poor coordination between design consultants and construction contractors and the CA/T Project's propensity to view large cost overruns as isolated events. CA/T Project management's avowed commitment to cost-consciousness and cost containment has not always been reflected in the actions and decisions this Office has reviewed. For example, the CA/T Project has frequently employed noncompetitive service procurement methods in the interest of expediency. My Office has questioned and criticized the CA/T  24   Project's award of unadvertised, sole-source contracts, some of which violated public bidding laws. The CA/T Project has also relied on the excessive use of change orders and amendments to existing contracts in order to procure work that was not included in the original scopes of services for those contracts. Moreover, the CA/T Project's final design work for buildings and many of the value engineering reviews failed to assess the post-construction operations and maintenance (O&M) costs. Because O&M costs  a key factor in life-cycle costs  will be paid almost entirely by the Commonwealth, these costs should have been a significant factor in the decision-making processes throughout design and construction. These and other programs aimed at cost-saving opportunities have been flawed not in concept, but in execution. Not until about 1997, shortly after the $10.8 billion cost estimate was announced, did this Office observe a concerted and consistent organization-wide effort commitment to cost containment. This Office's reports and letters have consistently highlighted another deficient management practice: CA/T Project staff have ignored or circumvented internal management controls embedded in the CA/T Project's own written policies, procedures, guidelines, and agreements. For example, the CA/T Project's cost control efforts have been undermined by its own failure to consistently conduct claims avoidance reviews and other cost-control measures, document deficient site conditions, or invoke contract provisions that penalize poor performance. My Office has also found that poor documentation practices have fragmented the official record, thereby reducing the Commonwealth's capacity to trace substandard performance to the root cause or responsible party. For example, the CA/T Project's sporadic failure to document negotiation of change order work and deficient contractor performance in the field can obscure problems that have major cost and schedule implications.  Fort Point Channel Globe Finding: The Helmes Report on the Fort Point Channel said that B/PB failed to take steps to resolve a design dispute with Maguire/Harris and an eight-month schedule delay occurred. Phil Helmes dropped his conclusion that B/PB was remiss in its management of the Fort Point Channel tunnel design only because the state would not agree to his request for more time to investigate further. B/PB Reply: The underlying challenge in the design of the tunnel running under Fort Point Channel was the need for a huge excavation support wall due to weak soil conditions. Early design concepts would have increased the project cost about $500  25   million. Finding a more cost-effective alternative took months of careful study. B/PB came up with several creative solutions, including soil strengthening (by mixing cement into the soil) and extended development of immersed tubes, which could be built without elaborate excavation. These innovations limited the cost increase to about $200 million, saving $300 million. B/PB also came up with the proposal to build the lower level of the vent structure as an integral part of tube construction, which greatly benefited the project schedule in that area. Helmes apparently told the Globe that he would have liked more time to investigate the issues. His official report judged that B/PB ""performed with a reasonable standard of care"" on ""this very complicated and unique design challenge."" He did not find B/PB remiss. Inspector General's Response: This Office disagrees with B/PB's reply concerning a matter with which this Office has been heavily involved. This Office referred the Helmes matter to the State Ethics Commission. Upon careful review, this Office concluded that Helmes had determined B/PB appeared to be at fault in the Fort Point Channel issue. His original independent report in December 1995 suggested that if the inadequacy of B/PB's review contributed to delay in the project, then B/PB and the other designers were remiss in their responsibilities and B/PB seemed to have taken an inordinate amount of time before taking appropriate action. Then, after MassHighway directed B/PB to enter into a subcontract with Helmes' firm, his subsequent report deleted that conclusion.  Waivers Globe Finding: B/PB spurned a state request in January 2002 to waive the legal limit on review of all of its work. The joint venture said it would only waive the limit on individual cases. B/PB Reply: Whenever the Client has requested an extension of the statute of limitations on a specific issue, claim, or contract, B/PB agreed to such a request. B/PB has agreed to a total of nine such requests since 1994. Inspector General's Response: This Office disagrees with B/PB's reply. A joint letter issued by the Inspector General and State Auditor Joseph DeNucci in October 2001 concerning B/PB's responsibility for cost overruns, stated: ""We . . . believe that B/PB's recent refusal to acknowledge any responsibility for or share in the burden of paying for increasing Project cost overruns in irresponsible and unconscionable . . . B/PB is, in  26   effect seeking to evade all responsibility for the multi-billion cost overruns and to place the entire cost on the taxpayers and turnpike users.""  Conflict of Interest Globe Finding: There's an inherent conflict of interest in that B/PB does preliminary design and then passes judgment on its own design work (during the final design and construction phase). B/PB Reply: B/PB is responsible for the preparation of preliminary design, which is both approved by the client and used by the various section design consultants in the development and finalization of the project design. The consultants provide design development submittals to B/PB to review for consistency with B/PB's preliminary design criteria. From that point on, the design is owned by the design consultant, not B/PB. Inspector General's Response: The Inspector General's Office disagrees with B/PB's conclusions and previously reached the same conclusion as the Globe. A December 2000 report by the Inspector General's Office pertaining to the Big Dig's cost recovery program states: ""B/PB's multiple roles in preliminary design, final design, and cost assessment (change orders) impedes the Turnpike Authority's ability to hold B/PB accountable for its performance. The cost recovery program simply underscores the Turnpike Authority's reliance on B/PB and the vulnerabilities of that arrangement.""  Asbestos Globe Finding: When inspectors found cancer-causing asbestos dust at a Big Dig work site in 1996, the project's private-sector manager faced a possible trial and millions of dollars of fines for flouting clean air laws. B/PB Reply: ""When inspectors found cancer-causing asbestos dust at a Big Dig work site in 1996,"" the story begins, ""the project's private-sector manager faced a possible trial and millions of dollars in fines for flouting clean air laws."" But state transportation officials, supposedly in thrall to B/PB, ""hired a lawyer to broker an unusual settlement"" that let B/PB off the hook for only $131,000, while ""taxpayers paid more than $3 million to clean up the asbestos mess."" To the contrary, no inspector ever found asbestos dust ""swirling around a Big Dig work site."" Moreover, despite the innuendo about brokering an ""unusual"" settlement, there was no backroom deal.  27   Here's what did happen. The state Attorney General alleged that asbestos-containing materials were removed and transported from the Analex Building site by the construction contractor in a manner that violated the state Clean Air Act and applicable regulations (including requirements for adequate wetting of material, sealing asbestoscontaining materials into leak-tight containers, and disposal). The settlement was entirely normal and taxpayers, $493,000, a substantial sum of approved in August 1999 by the Attorney Environmental Protection, and MHD and its aboveboard. It cost the contractors, not money. The settlement was reviewed and General, the Massachusetts Department of environmental consultants.  The increased cost of asbestos abatement resulted from the unexpectedly aggressive methods required to remove asbestos-containing adhesives from concrete surfaces in the building before demolition, which led to extra work and delayed completion of the contract. There was no cost to taxpayers beyond the cost of these required activities, and specifically no added cost to address the allegations made by the Attorney General. The Attorney General alleged that asbestos-containing materials were removed from the Analex Building site by the construction contractor in a manner that violated the state Clean Air Act and applicable regulations (including requirements for adequate wetting of material, sealing asbestos-containing materials into leak-tight containers, and maintaining air cleaning equipment). It also alleged that the contractor (not B/PB) improperly transported asbestos containing materials to a non-approved disposal site in violation of approved project shipping documents and federal and state environmental laws and regulations, and forged the shipping documents to cover up the deception. Inspector General's Response: Official records contradict B/PB's response to the Globe. B/PB claims that no inspector ever found asbestos dust around a Big Dig work cite"" and the only Attorney General allegation that concerns B/PB in a civil complaint is the manner in which a contractor (not B/PB) violated regulations concerning removal and disposal of asbestos. This Office reviewed the formal complaint brought against the Massachusetts Department of Highways, Bechtel Corporation, Parsons Brinckerhoff Quade & Douglas, Inc., et al. by the Attorney General in 1998. The records show that in 1996, Massachusetts Department of Environmental (DEP) inspectors on several occasions observed problems with asbestos abatement including the dry sweepings of asbestos containing material (ACM), visible emissions of air-borne  28   dust, dirty air cleaning filters, failure to adequately wet ACM, and breaches in containment of ACM in work areas to prevent emissions of asbestos to the ambient air. On January 31, 1996, DEP issued a Notice of Noncompliance concerning the asbestos violations and shut the site down. Records also demonstrate that the DEP asked B/PB to provide the agency with copies of the signed, returned manifests for shipments of asbestos waste removal. B/PB was unable to produce such records. DEP attested that it had found asbestos from this Big Dig site in a non-approved landfill.  Confidential Documents Globe Finding: Confidential project documents from 1995 reveal that B/PB knowingly hid project costs. B/PB Reply: It was the responsibility of state and federal authorities to communicate with the public. Yet in another stretch of the truth, the Globe story manages to leave the impression that B/PB bears major responsibility for hiding costs and misleading the public. Strip away the negative images conjured up by repeated talk of ""lobbyists, strategists and consultants,"" and what do you have? Thousands of words that fail to support the headlines. And far from showing that B/PB called the shots, the story relates that James J. Kerasiotes, the state's top Big Dig official, along with Governor William Weld, ""demanded"" that B/PB remove its project manager from the Big Dig in 1994 when a public rift developed over cost estimates. At issue was the public insistence by state officials that project costs would be maintained at under $8 billion (not counting inflation), in contradiction to B/PB's 1994 projection that total project costs would come in at around $14 billion. This assertion is absolutely false. B/PB has continually advised MHD/MTA about any and all cost estimates and components, as noted in the 2001 report of the state Inspector General. The IG noted that B/PB provided ""uncannily"" accurate cost estimates to MTA in 1994 and ""insisted upon and, in fact, made full disclosure to local FHWA officials in 1994-1995"" of all relevant budget assumptions. Inspector General's Response: The Inspector General's Office concurs with the Globe's findings. In its response, B/PB fails to mention the key findings of our report concerning the cover-up of Big Dig costs. B/PB neglects to mention their complete role  29   in the process. This Office's March 2001 report also illustrated how B/PB developed and implemented the accounting schemes sanctioned by Big Dig and Federal Highway Administration officials in the ""public relations downsizing"" of the Big Dig cost estimate. Big Dig costs could have been manipulated and effectively hidden from the public and the Legislature without the active and willing participation of B/PB. This Office's report states: ""What has remained unspoken is B/PB's active participation in the promulgation of misleading reports to the State Legislature. Big Dig officials would never had been able to perpetrate the inaccurate presentation of such detailed information without the active collaboration of B/PB - the entity that gathered, controlled, and manipulated all Big Dig cost data. B/PB did not participate passively. B/PB took control soon after Big Dig officials decided to obscure the true costs and after FHWA accepted the accounting assumptions.""  Campaign Contributions Globe Finding: Because of campaign contributions, some elected officials intervened at crucial junctures in ways that helped the company avoid scrutiny. B/PB Reply: The story offers not a shred of evidence, only innuendo, in support of this claim. The allegation is absurd on its face considering the intense scrutiny the project has received from the State Inspector General, State Auditor, Department of Transportation Inspector General, State Attorney General, FHWA, and MHD/MTA. None of these watchdog agencies has ever alleged that public officials intervened on B/PB's behalf. Inspector General's Response: The Inspector General's Office strongly disagrees with B/PB's reply and offers the following example of an elected official who intervened to thwart criticism of B/PB and the Project. The Office of the Inspector General faced elimination because of the intervention of an elected official. In early 2001, the day before this Office released the highly critical report of the Big Dig's cost recovery program, then-Governor Paul Cellucci filed a bill to eliminate the Office. This action was in direct response to two reports issued by this Office. One report, issued in December 2000, was a compilation of technical assistance provided to the Big Dig by this Office. The Governor's staff derided this report as former Inspector General Cerasoli's ""greatest  30   hits."" The second report, which was in the hands of the Governor in draft form at the time of his action, dealt with the cost recovery program. This report was highly critical of the Turnpike Authority's failure to pursue cost recovery against B/PB and reported that the cost recovery program had only collected $30,000 from more than $80 million in claims. Also at this time, Governor Cellucci and his staff were aware that this Office was preparing to release a report concerning Big Dig finances that implicated top administration officials in covering up Big Dig costs since 1994. This was clear  intervention by an elected official to support B/PB and the Big Dig from harsh criticism. At the time that the Governor filed this legislation, the Inspector General stated: ""They took steps to block access of key information, even going so far as to try to close this Office.""  Sanitized Memo Globe Finding: Michael P. Lewis, then the deputy project director, directed William Edwards of B/PB to ""sanitize"" the budget documents he prepared for federal officials by deleting the cost exclusion information. B/PB Reply: When former state project director Peter Zuk told the Globe that the term ""sanitize"" meant clean up (simplify) rather than conceal, many readers no doubt suspected an artful dodge. But the Globe failed to note that minutes of the meeting clearly show that participants discussed the exclusions, and federal officials requested a copy of the exclusions as well as the associated budget assumptions. Federal officials were kept fully in the loop. As the Globe well knows, the State Inspector General reported in 2001 that ""B/PB insisted upon and, in fact, made full disclosure to local FHWA officials in 1994 - 1995 of each exclusion, deduction, and accounting assumption . . . and that local FHWA officials used these assumptions in their own internal analyses."" As a matter of fact and public record, B/PB has always kept its client well informed on project cost and schedule matters. Inspector General's Response: The Inspector General's Office strongly disagrees with B/PB's conclusion. To suggest that ""sanitized"" means ""simplify,"" in the context of this memorandum starkly contradicts the history underlying it. What was sanitized from the memorandum was a set of disclosures that was necessary for federal officials to understand the true meaning of the Big Dig cost estimate. What is most significant about this memorandum is that it demonstrates the clear intent of Big Dig managers at 31   the time to be less than forthright with the federal government. The Inspector General considered this memorandum to be so significant that he appeared before a hearing of the Joint Transportation Committee in April 2001 with this memorandum blown up to poster-size for display asking for an investigation into this matter. In fact, this  memorandum is one of the subjects of the ongoing SEC investigation of the Big Dig. The Oxford Dictionary defines ""sanitize"" as used in slang as follows: ""to render more acceptable, clean up, as by the removal of undesirable, improper, or confidential material.""  B/PB Meeting in Boston Globe Finding: Top B/PB executives flew in with a surprising offer: The company would give the state up to $50 million to pay for past mistakes. After B/PB met with the governor's chief of staff, the afternoon meeting with MTA never took place and B/PB rescinded its offer. B/PB Reply: In a report issued in 2001, the Massachusetts Inspector General noted that two senior Bechtel officials flew to Boston in December 1994 to personally inform the governor and his senior advisers about the true cost estimate. In addition, the Inspector General stated, ""B/PB insisted upon and, in fact, made full disclosure to local FHWA [Federal Highway Administration] officials in 1994-1995 of each exclusion, deduction, and accounting assumption comprising the $6 billion difference."" The Globe completely misrepresents B/PB's offer, which included no admission of wrongdoing but responded to the state administration's urging that B/PB find ways to ""share the pain."" B/PB brought three options to the table at a morning meeting. Inspector General's Response: The Inspector General's Office strongly disagrees with B/PB's response. A joint letter issued by the Inspector General and State Auditor Joseph DeNucci in October 2001 concerning B/PB's responsibility for cost overruns, stated that: ""We . . . believe that B/PB's recent refusal to acknowledge any responsibility for or share in the burden of paying for increasing Project cost overruns in irresponsible and unconscionable . . . B/PB is, in effect seeking to evade all responsibility for the multi-billion cost overruns and to place the entire cost on the taxpayers and turnpike users."" In the Inspector General's Office March 2001 report, the Office states: ""What  has remained unspoken is B/PB's active participation in the promulgation of misleading  32   reports to the State Legislature. Big Dig officials would never have been able to perpetrate the inaccurate presentation of such detailed information without the active collaboration of B/PB - the entity that gathered, controlled, and manipulated all Big Dig cost data. B/PB did not participate passively. B/PB took control soon after Big Dig officials decided to obscure the true costs and after FHWA accepted the accounting assumptions."" Again, B/PB fails to mention the Inspector General's main conclusion about B/PB's role in the Big Dig cost cover-up.  33   This page intentionally left blank.  34   Selected CA/T Project Oversight Reports and Letters Issued by the Massachusetts Office of the Inspector General (1991-2003) 1991  The Inspector General issued a report identifying fundamental flaws in the selection process used to obtain CA/T Project audit services from private firms, including inadequate planning and analysis, vulnerability to favoritism, and unnecessarily costly contracting practices. The report recommended a prudent, cost-conscious procurement process for audit services. The Office criticized MassHighway's Project Management Plan for failing to clearly describe MassHighway's oversight role, failing to show how Bechtel/Parsons Brinckerhoff (B/PB) would be held accountable for bringing the Project in on time and within budget, and inappropriately assigning key Project oversight roles to B/PB. The Office advised the Executive Office of Transportation and Construction that a financing plan prepared by Lazard Freres & Company was erroneous and misleading: it overstated MassHighway's progress on design of the CA/T Project, omitted key factors that could dramatically increase Project costs and delay the Project schedule, and failed to provide a reliable and objective analysis of the Project's future costs, including operations and maintenance costs.      1992  The Office wrote to the Project Director regarding MassHighway's reimbursements of more than $2.11 million to B/PB for the cost of relocating the families of B/PB employees hired to work on the CA/T Project. The Office identified wasteful management practices, including poor documentation, lack of oversight, and specific abuses of the reimbursement system.  1993  The Inspector General issued a report criticizing MassHighway's lack of planning, frequent disregard for cost, and repeated missteps in the development of the Operations Control Center Complex, a multimillion-dollar building complex housing administrative and maintenance functions, including a $95 million control system, for the CA/T Project. The report recommended a series of corrective actions to reduce the Commonwealth's exposure to waste and public safety problems. The Office advised MassHighway that MassHighway lacked the expertise and resources to conduct a meaningful review of the effectiveness of the its    35   relationship with B/PB and expressed concern that MassHighway and B/PB seemed to have melded into a single unit. The Office recommended that MassHighway develop the internal capacity to manage its contractual relationships competently and cost-consciously and to provide effective oversight of B/PB.  The Office wrote to MassHighway warning that cost savings from the proposed Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) Program for the CA/T Project were unsubstantiated and that the ADR Program created another avenue for contractors to pursue payment over and above the original bid amount. The Office recommended specific improvements aimed at increasing the accountability, clarity, and cost-effectiveness of the ADR Program. The Office documented a pattern of apparently excessive use of contract modifications and change orders associated with design and constructionrelated contracts on the CA/T Project. The Office advised MassHighway that the large number of design contract modifications portended construction cost escalation far beyond the estimated $7.7 billion price tag. The Inspector General issued a report revealing that MassHighway and B/PB had mismanaged an eight-year, $10.9 million contract with DeLeuw, Cather & Company to design the CA/T Project's integrated project control system. The report documented massive cost overruns, schedule slippages, poor performance, and contract violations that B/PB as contract manager had failed to address. Warning that these problems were not unique, the report recommended that MassHighway institute a series of contracting safeguards, cease the practice of using contract modifications and change orders to make up for incomplete preliminary and final design work, and increase the contract administration and technical staff assigned to the CA/T Project. The Inspector General issued a report revealing that the CA/T Project's value engineering program, which was managed by B/PB, had been plagued from the beginning by a lack of independence, delays, misinformation, management errors, and an absence of management commitment to value engineering. The report found that MassHighway had forgone and was continuing to forgo opportunities to simplify designs and achieve significant cost reductions. Although the value engineering program had identified costsaving recommendations estimated to save $2.8 billion, the recommendations implemented by the CA/T Project had saved only an estimated $325 million. In one case, MassHighway's poor planning, erratic decision-making, and overreliance on B/PB led MassHighway to reject a value engineering recommendation that could have saved taxpayers an estimated $13 million. The report concluded that significant opportunities for controlling costs through value engineering still remained and recommended eliminating B/PB from its pivotal role in managing the value engineering program, conducting a    1994     36   comprehensive review of the program, and remolding the program to ensure its independence and usefulness as a cost control tool.  The Inspector General issued a report criticizing MassHighway's internal audit function for the CA/T Project. The report found that inefficient internal audit processes, audit delays, untimely audits, and insufficient audit staff resources jeopardized federal reimbursement for the CA/T Project, thereby risking an unnecessary increase in the state's share of CA/T Project costs. The report recommended specific measures aimed at strengthening MassHighway's internal audit procedures and capacity. The Office notified MassHighway that it had violated a state law requiring survey services to be awarded to the lowest responsible and eligible bidder by paying B/PB more than $9.4 million for survey services provided through a B/PB subconsultant. The Office notified MassHighway that its sole-source, negotiated, $5.5 million procurement of Inverset Technology violated the state's public works bidding law. The Office alerted MassHighway to large change orders and contract administration problems on a $32 million construction contract to relocate the Porter Street outfall sewer. The value of the contract had grown by 56 percent since 1991. The Office also found that B/PB, which managed the contract on behalf of MassHighway, had failed to adequately document the change orders or to take effective action in response to the contractor's noncompliance with contract specifications. The Office criticized B/PB's deficient handling of a no-bid, $414,700 change order for odor control measures on MassHighway's third harbor tunnel construction contract. B/PB had failed to anticipate the need for the change order, had allowed the tunnel contractor to violate project procedures, and had underestimated the cost of the change order work. The Office recommended that MassHighway revamp its change order process by requiring B/PB to obtain competitive prices and to justify the approach and price of each change order. The Office informed MassHighway that MassHighway's procurement of a $231,526 fireboat for the city of Boston violated the state's procurement statute, that MassHighway had paid $100,000 more than the actual cost of the fireboat to the contractor, and that because the FHWA had declined to participate in funding the fireboat, the full cost was borne by Massachusetts taxpayers. The Inspector General issued a report revealing that internal control weaknesses in the CA/T Project's asset management system, which was 37            1995    managed by B/PB, could lead to theft, fraud, and misuse of the Commonwealth's assets. The report recommended that MassHighway adopt a series of corrective actions, including procurement of an independent audit of B/PB's procedures.  The Inspector General, the Attorney General, and the State Auditor sent a joint letter to the Secretary of Transportation and Construction regarding MassHighway's practice of assigning staff (referred to as ""seconded"" employees) paid by private firms through MassHighway's contract with B/PB to perform MassHighway functions on the CA/T Project. The joint letter warned that this arrangement created divided loyalties, resulted in pay and benefit inequities among staff performing similar functions, created the appearance of a conflict of interest, and could violate state law. The joint letter recommended that MassHighway abandon the practice, provide eight top managers funded by B/PB with training on the state's conflict of interest law, and ensure that all key B/PB personnel were duly designated in the contract. The Office advised MassHighway of problems with the CA/T Project's use of waivers to state service contracting regulations. Specifically, the CA/T Project's practices violated state service contracting regulations, put the Commonwealth and its consultants at financial risk, and produced waivers that misstated the cost of the services for which waivers were granted and the amount of funding to be provided by the FHWA. The Office criticized MassHighway and B/PB for mismanaging a contract with DeLeuw, Cather & Company for the CA/T Project's integrated project control system. Problems cited by the Office included tolerance of cost overruns and poor consultant performance, waste of $600,000 for an ""independent"" assessment of the contract by B/PB's home office staff, and recovery of only $1.7 million when only 20 percent of the $6.5 million contract had been delivered. The Office also warned MassHighway that its pending plans to add nearly $7 million in services to the contract with DeLeuw, Cather & Company would violate state services contracting regulations. The Office wrote to MassHighway criticizing the CA/T Project's planned $107 million project known as ""Parcel Seven."" The Office found that the CA/T Project had failed to conduct a value engineering review, to comply with the state designer selection law, and to identify and estimate the cost of mitigation measures called for in the contract. The Office warned MassHighway that its near-total reliance on B/PB created significant and unnecessary financial risk, ignored cost containment opportunities from competition in the marketplace, and failed to serve pressing accountability requirements. The Office pointed out that MassHighway was not holding B/PB accountable for meeting the CA/T 38        1996    budget and schedule or for producing deliverables or other measurable results. Instead, MassHighway was paying B/PB on a cost-plus-fixed-fee basis. The Office recommended reconfiguring MassHighway's contractual relationship with B/PB.  The Inspector General issued a report on the CA/T Project's value engineering change proposal program, a cost containment effort that allows construction contractors to recommend design or construction changes to improve efficiency or lower costs. The report revealed that MassHighway and B/PB were not aggressively pursuing or managing this and other cost control programs to meet the goal of bringing the CA/T Project in on time and within budget. Of the $17 million in estimated savings from changes recommended by the contractor, only $1.7 million, or 10 percent, had been accepted by the CA/T Project during the period reviewed. The Office criticized B/PB's handling of an internal investigation of an allegation of deficient B/PB construction management practices. The Office's 1995 review of B/PB's response revealed that B/PB had ignored some of its own audit findings, inaccurately reported its findings to MassHighway, ignored MassHighway's directions to pursue certain issues, and compromised the independence of a second audit of B/PB's construction management practices. The second phase of the Office's review criticized B/PB's failure to comply with key Project policies aimed at containing costs and safeguarding public funds. B/PB also failed to effectively monitor and document its own activity. The Office recommended that MassHighway increase its oversight of construction management by developing an independent quality assurance program. The Office advised MassHighway to exercise caution in implementing a proposed pilot project to accelerate the bid, evaluation, and award cycle on the CA/T Project. The Office's analysis indicated that the causes of the CA/T Project's excessively lengthy bid cycle extended far beyond the focus of the pilot project to B/PB's project management problems. The Office found that addenda and change orders were routinely used to make up for incomplete designs and poor planning and coordination. Accordingly, the Office advised MassHighway to save time and money by curtailing its practice of using addenda to manage design or construction work after advertising the work. The Office criticized MassHighway's handling of the construction of Ventilation Building No. 3 on the CA/T Project. The Office's review disclosed that MassHighway did not employ two cost containment measures and that the estimated contract cost had increased by 60 percent with little explanation. In addition, the Office found that inadequate planning and a complicated right-of-way agreement could increase CA/T Project costs in the future.        39     The Office alerted MassHighway to problems in the CA/T Project's process for selecting a geotechnical instrumentation firm for a $17 million contract. These problems included vague selection criteria, the risk of ""bait-and-switch"" tactics by potential contractors, and overreliance on B/PB in the selection process. The Office sent a letter to the CA/T Project summarizing the Office's key findings and recommendations resulting from statutorily mandated contract reviews conducted by the Office between 1994 and 1996. The Inspector General subsequently issued a report containing a compilation of the reviews and the Project's written responses. The major corrective measures recommended by the Office in these reviews focused on instituting proactive and aggressive cost containment measures, analyzing the causes of cost estimate increases, minimizing the use of no-bid change orders, clearly defining mitigation commitments in construction contracts, obtaining federal funding approvals before the construction cycle begins, and maximizing federal funding. The Inspector General issued a report on the CA/T Project's materials testing laboratory function. The report disclosed that at least $5 million had been spent unnecessarily for design, renovation work, relocation expenses, and fees paid to B/PB in connection with the laboratory. The report criticized B/PB for failing to provide MassHighway with accurate cost information or consider using existing laboratories, and for giving no-bid work worth $621,000 to a Bechtel subsidiary. The Inspector General warned the Legislature that the proposed metropolitan highway system bill constituted a wholesale grant of powers to the Massachusetts Turnpike Authority that unnecessarily increased the Commonwealth's financial vulnerability in the construction, operation and maintenance of the CA/T Project. The Inspector General expressed concern that the cost of the CA/T Project would ultimately exceed $12 billion. The Inspector General recommended amendments to the bill, including sunset provisions; debt issuance safeguards; and controls over real property dispositions by the Turnpike Authority. The Inspector General communicated his objections in writing and underscored his concerns during a meeting with the House Committee on Long Term Debt and Capital Expenditures. An investigation by the Office disclosed evidence that copper cable had been cut and removed from a CA/T Project building storing electrical equipment and approximately $300,000 of copper cable purchased for the CA/T Project. The Office also discovered that the building was not secure and that the equipment and material stored in the building were not adequately inventoried. The Office informed MassHighway of the problem and    1997       40   recommended measures to secure the building and inventory all warehoused equipment and materials.  The Office sent a letter to MassHighway reporting on the Office's examination of the cost of the early opening of the third harbor tunnel, now known as the Ted Williams Tunnel. The Office's review disclosed that MassHighway had underestimated the cost of, and might have overestimated the economic benefits of, the accelerated early opening; the Office also found that the FHWA did not fund all early opening cost. The Office expressed concern that costly early opening initiatives would in the future increase the financial burden of the CA/T Project on Massachusetts taxpayers. The Office expressed concern to MassHighway regarding the CA/T Project's failure to aggressively pursue all available cost containment measures, including value engineering reviews, claims avoidance reviews, and peer reviews. The Office also criticized MassHighway's slow delivery of documents and failure to produce certain evidence until after public criticism by the Office. The Office advised MassHighway that B/PB's bidder attraction program was a poorly conceived and mismanaged effort to increase competition for CA/T construction contracts. B/PB had not developed an adequate scope and action plan for the project, had used an incomplete and subjective methodology in selecting firms to contact, had violated state procurement policy in hiring a program subcontractor, and had hired a subcontractor that appeared unqualified for the job. The Inspector General issued a report on the CA/T Project's handling of two no-bid change orders amounting to $850,000 on a $78.2 million tunnel finishes contract, which had increased by 58 percent over the original bid amount. The report revealed a host of problems, including poor design specifications for anchor bolt installation, unclear bolt testing procedures, payment for improper installation of anchor bolts, and poor coordination between designers and contractors. The report recommended a series of measures designed to improve the CA/T Project's construction contract specifications, design coordination, contractor oversight, and cost recovery actions. The Office conducted a review of the CA/T Project's East Boston Toll Facility contract showing that the CA/T Project was not implementing its own cost containment program, that it had seriously underestimated the cost of the facility, that it had incurred unnecessary costs, and that it had failed to prepare a life-cycle cost analysis for the facility. The Office's review also revealed that the design calculations relating to loads on the toll plaza canopies were not prepared by a Massachusetts registered engineer and that they had not been reviewed or checked by a senior architect or engineer at 41      1998      the design firm responsible for the calculations. These calculations did not appear to take into account wind against the north side of the canopies and weight of signage on the canopies, thus creating a potential public safety hazard. The Office recommended that MassHighway take steps to address these problems.  The Office provided MassHighway with the results of a review of the CA/T Project's resident engineer filing system. The Office found weaknesses in the collection and maintenance of information by B/PB field staff. The Office advised MassHighway to hold B/PB accountable for maintaining project records vital for contractor accountability and protection of the public interest. The Office sent MassHighway a letter criticizing the CA/T Project's request for qualifications/proposals for public information outreach services estimated to cost $2 million. The Office pointed out that spending public funds to sell the CA/T Project to a public that is already paying for the Project was wasteful, especially in view of the public information staff and subconsultants already in place in the B/PB organization. The Office informed the Executive Office of Transportation and Construction, the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority, the Massachusetts Port Authority, MassHighway, the Turnpike Authority, and the CA/T Project of the cost-saving potential of the CA/T's materials testing program. The Office's review of other materials testing programs revealed that some entities paid different prices for the same services offered by testing firms. The Office recommended that the entities included in the review consider the options of establishing a statewide materials testing laboratory, establish a statewide blanket contract for testing services, and establishing interagency agreements for testing services. The Office's review of documents relating to the CA/T Project's Ventilation Building No. 1 revealed that the Commonwealth had apparently paid twice for the design of a portion of the building. In addition, B/PB had prepared the final design drawings for a portion of the building; thus, B/PB as project manager was reviewing, critiquing, and approving its own work in circumvention of the CA/T Project's system of accountability. The Office's review disclosed no evidence that the CA/T Project had prepared a life-cycle cost analysis comparing the operating and maintenance costs of different design options; it also disclosed that the CA/T Project had failed to comply with certain public notice requirements contained in M.G.L. c. 149. The Office also expressed concern that certain project drawings had not been stamped, signed, and dated by a professional engineer registered in Massachusetts. On this ventilation building and another (No. 5) in South Boston, the Office warned of potentially costly problems arising from site access delays. The Office advised the CA/T Project that some of the issues identified in the      1999   42   Office's reviews might warrant withholding approval for the commencement of work on these two contracts under Section 67 of Chapter 205 of the Acts of 1996.  The Office's review of documents relating to the CA/T Project's Ventilation Building No. 8 disclosed that the building design interfered with an easement granted to the Fleet Center by MassHighway, necessitating significant redesign work estimated to cost the CA/T Project $2.5 million more than originally planned. The Office questioned the CA/T Project's failure to consider some of the cost savings identified during the redesign effort, such as elimination of some rooms and simplification of the roof design. The Office estimated that a value engineering review of the design could have generated cost savings of as much as $1 million. The Office also found that the CA/T Project had not conducted a formal claims avoidance review for the contract, nor had the CA/T Project completed a formal life-cycle cost analysis for the contract. The Office criticized the CA/T Project for considering cost control measures only in response to unanticipated cost increases, rather than implementing such measures in the normal course of business. The Office also criticized the CA/T Project's practice of allowing design work to be authorized based on oral direction from Project staff, in contravention of the procedures set forth in the contract. The Office expressed concern about possible errors and inconsistencies in the design drawings, including fire protection drawings. Finally, the Office found that hundreds of drawings lacked a stamped seal and dated signature of a professional architect or engineer registered in Massachusetts. The Office's review of documents relating to the CA/T Project's pending East Boston toll facility construction contract, estimated at $7.5 million, disclosed numerous drawings that either lacked professional seals or bore illegible seals. The Office questioned the high design cost for the toll facility relative to its estimated construction cost. The Office also criticized the CA/T Project for failing to redesign the toll booth canopies  at an estimated savings of nearly $1.5 million  until after the designer had prepared the original bid package. The Office's review found no evidence that the CA/T Project completed a formal life-cycle cost analysis for the contract; such a review might have led to this redesign earlier, thereby avoiding the schedule impact of last-minute redesign work. The Office provided comments and recommendations on the CA/T Project's Request for Qualifications and Proposal (RFQ/P) for the Central Artery Corridor Master Plan. The Office's recommendations focused on clarifying the scope of services, procedural requirements, and evaluation criteria contained in the RFQ/P; providing a level-playing field throughout the process for all proposers; documenting the selection process; and ensuring that the terms and conditions of the Turnpike Authority's executed contract are      43   consistent with the terms and conditions of previous CA/T Project contracts executed by MassHighway.  The Inspector General issued a report alerting the Legislature to at least four steps the Office had recommended to the CA/T Project as a result of legislatively mandated reviews: conduct cost containment reviews; identify future operations and maintenance costs; identify and explain cost estimate increases; and comply with professional engineering practices. Noting that the letters targeted issues at the heart of cost and performance, the report provided a compilation of the reviews and the Project's written responses. The Office wrote to the CA/T Project regarding the Incentive Fee Program, used on the CA/T Project's tunnel finishes contract, under which the construction contractor was given a financial incentive to meet or beat contract milestone dates, to mitigate certain delays without filing financial claims, and to work more cooperatively and efficiently with other contractors and CA/T Project staff. The Office's review revealed that Incentive Fee Program provisions contained inadequate safeguards against fraud, waste, and abuse. Specifically, the Office criticized the Program's lack of contractor oversight, its discretionary and subjective rating system, the unilateral authority of a single manager to change Program rules, and the lack of Program procedures and documentation requirements. The Office also expressed the view that the Program could violate Massachusetts public bidding laws. The Office recommended a series of measures to improve the Program, including evaluating the Program costs and benefits, developing objective criteria for contractor performance evaluation, strengthening Program rules and safeguards, and instituting disincentive clauses to discourage poor contractor performance. The Inspector General sent a letter to a Joint Special Commission of the Legislature expressing his views concerning the CA/T Project's $1.4 billion cost overrun first reported by Project leadership in February 2000. The Inspector General advised the Special Commission that state oversight agencies had not received the CA/T Project's October 1999 Finance Plan until February 17, 2000 and that the October 1999 Finance Plan provided no warning of the $1.4 billion overrun. Moreover, the October 1999 Finance Plan was not responsive to the legislative mandate in the Metropolitan Highway System legislation enacted in 1997; this legislation specifically required that the CA/T Project report on the CA/T Project status and schedule as well as the Commonwealth's ability to fund the state's share of the CA/T Project. In the letter, the Inspector General reiterated his position that the ""partnering"" model on which the contractual arrangement between MassHighway and B/PB is based fails to promote accountability and impedes rigorous oversight of the consultant's performance. The Inspector General pointed out that the Office had warned years ago that CA/T Project costs could exceed $12 billion  2000     44   and had repeatedly criticized CA/T Project managers for failing to implement cost containment measures such as value engineering in the early stages of the Project, when such measures could have had the greatest impact. The Inspector General urged the Special Commission to scrutinize the full lifecycle costs of the CA/T Project, including debt costs and operation and maintenance costs. Finally, the Inspector General advised the Special Commission that the Office had not consistently received timely information from the CA/T Project and that no oversight agency, including the Office, has been given access to the CA/T Project's Oracle database, despite repeated requests.  In a May 2000 letter, the Office alerted the newly appointed Turnpike Authority Chairman to major management control issues and areas of systemic vulnerability to fraud, waste, and abuse that the Office identified during nearly nine years of CA/T Project oversight. The Office urged the Chairman to address three recurring themes in order to help restore faith in the CA/T Project and ensure its ultimate success. First, the Commonwealth's excessively broad project management contract with B/PB has impeded effective cost control and oversight, undermined public accountability on the CA/T Project, and eroded the Commonwealth's contracting leverage. Second, the current management organization of the CA/T Project undermines the essential arm's length relationship between the Commonwealth and B/PB. Third, deficient management practices on the CA/T Project have reduced the Commonwealth's capacity to generate accurate cost estimates on individual contracts, control spending, and predict and control future costs. The Office concluded that the systemic management deficiencies outlined in the letter and documented in an attached 15-page listing of related Office reports and letters contributed to the escalating cost of the CA/T Project. In December 2000, the Inspector General issued a detailed report entitled A Review of the Central Artery/Tunnel Project Cost Recovery Program. The review disclosed that in six years, the Project had only recovered $30,000 from about $83.5 million in cost recovery related change orders; that the Project had set up the cost recovery program primarily to ensure federal funding, not to recover costs; and that B/PB's overly broad role in Project management undermined the Commonwealth's ability to hold B/PB accountable for its design work. The Project had not adequately documented cost recovery cases and, in some cases, had failed to assess accurately the full cost impact of deficient design work. The report showed that Project management had eliminated an effective method for catching potential cost recovery actions that B/PB may have missed and recommended a series of corrective actions aimed at using the cost recovery program as a tool to recover costs and hold Project participants accountable.    45     In December 2000 the Inspector General issued a report containing correspondence regarding management issues and recommendations in 22 technical assistance reviews conducted by the Office since 1993 at the request of Project officials. These reviews examined complex design and construction management problems, commented on procurement processes, and clarified legal compliance requirements. Throughout the 22 reviews undertaken at the Project's request, the Office consistently urged the Project to develop the internal organizational capacity to monitor and control costs on management consultant, design, and construction contracts; define performance standards and work products to be delivered under contract and hold vendors accountable for performance; guard against conflicts of interest and the appearance of impropriety; avoid sole source procurements; and develop clear Project procedures and guidelines.  2001  In a May 2001 letter to the Project, the Office summarizing the findings of a review relating to the $10.9 million Dewey Square Air Intake Structure, a planned three-story building that will provide fresh air supply and exhaust capabilities, and facilities for project control systems. The contract includes the building construction, supports for two ventilation fans, exterior site improvements, temporary street lighting, and maintaining the realigned Atlantic Avenue Bypass Roadway. The Office's review identified a number of concerns regarding cost, compliance, and planning. For example, the Office questioned the expenditure of an estimated $300,000 for architectural features to support future development by third parties that may never materialize. The Office raised concerns about the Project's failure to complete a formal life-cycle cost analysis. The Office criticized the Project, as it has in the past, for failing to comply with the requirements of the Massachusetts Board of Registration for Professional Engineers. The Office also identified errors and inconsistencies in the drawings and urged the Project to correct the problems. The Office expressed concern about the potential for added costs due to contract interface and site access restraints, in part because connecting the air intake structure would be performed under a different contract. The Office also noted that the Project had not provided documents to the Office in a timely manner and had not yet complied with certain notification requirements under M.G.L. c. 149. In October 2001, the Acting Inspector General sent a joint letter with the State Auditor to the Board of Directors of the Massachusetts Turnpike Authority. This letter supported the Board's initiative to hold B/PB accountable for its share of responsibility for Big Dig cost overruns. The two offices also offered assistance to the Board for this initiative to recover from B/PB every dollar it owes to the citizens of the Commonwealth. The two offices stated that B/PB was seeking to evade responsibility for the multi-billion dollar cost overruns and to place the entire cost on the taxpayers and turnpike users. The two    46   offices stated their mutual intention to obtain previously undisclosed financial information from B/PB to assist in cost recovery actions against B/PB. Since 1990 both offices have reported numerous times that B/PB's contract mismanagement, deficient practices, and poor performance have led to the Project's increased costs. 2002  In a May 2002 letter, the Acting Inspector General advised the Project Director of issues arising from the Office's statutorily mandated review of a pending $19.2 million contract for ancillary facilities north of the Gilmore Bridge. The issues, which could be instructive for remaining Project efforts, included the Project's failure to include the cost of the contract in the total Project cost estimate until June 2000; the approximately $1 million cost associated with placing the final design on hold for approximately three years; the likelihood that extended access restraints could significantly increase the contract cost, and the importance of conducting life-cycle cost analyses on a routine basis. In June 2002, the Acting Inspector General wrote to the Chairman of the Turnpike Authority regarding the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) review of $30 million in Project staffing costs. A decision by the FHWA to apply these staffing costs to the Project's federal funding cap would be an arbitrary reversal of FHWA policy that would add to the already great burden placed on Massachusetts taxpayers and tollpayers paying for the Project. The letter noted that documents obtained by the Office showed that as early as 1994, FHWA officials knew about and condoned the exclusion of these staffing costs from the Project's total cost definition. In 2000, when the Turnpike Authority added staff costs to the Finance Plan, FHWA officials did not question the continued exclusion of pre-1996 staff costs. The letter concluded that the FHWA had had ample opportunity over the previous 15 years to question costs that it had approved and continued to pay for year after year. In October 2002, the Inspector General wrote to the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Transportation in support of the Turnpike Authority's position that the full proceeds from the sale of the CA/T Project headquarters at 185 Kneeland Street in Boston should be used to pay for Project costs, in accordance with longstanding federal policy. The letter provided relevant historical information, contained in documents obtained by the Office during an earlier Project investigation, showing that the Project on 20 different occasions between June 1998 and January 2000 had reported to the FHWA and other oversight agencies that Project costs reflected a credit for the sale of the Kneeland Street Building. Moreover, the FHWA had reviewed and approved at least 12 Project finance plans with the understanding that the sale of air rights and real estate would be used to defray Project costs. The Inspector General strongly recommended against overturning the FHWA's 47       policy and noted that doing so would cost Massachusetts taxpayers and tollpayers an additional $87 million.  In November 2002, the Inspector General wrote to the Chairman of the Turnpike Authority to recommend that the Office of the Inspector General and the Turnpike Authority take immediate action to coordinate a cost recovery review of the CA/T Project with the assistance of independent expert consultants in law, engineering, and construction. The letter noted that the Turnpike Authority had implemented a number of important and worthwhile reforms over the previous year, and that the cumulative effects of such reforms had been to correct deficiencies from prior Turnpike Authority management and to better position the Project to prospectively control cost growth resulting from contractor claims.  2003  In February 2003, the Inspector General issued A Recommendation for Cost Recovery Against the Big Dig's Management Consultant, a report on grout heave-related claims on the C11A1 contract. The report identified $65 million in Project construction cost increases relating to ground movement, or ""grout heave,"" that may be attributable to deficient work on the part of B/PB. Specifically, the report found that these grout heave-related costs may be attributable to B/PB's failure to anticipate construction difficulty, prepare adequate contract specifications, conduct an adequate ground monitoring operation, investigate and gather sufficient information regarding contractor claims, and document evidence and decisions. Although B/PB stated that its actions saved money by maintaining the Project schedule, the Office concluded that B/PB may have been the cause of these multimillion-dollar claims. However, B/PB had shifted responsibility for the claims onto the Commonwealth, thereby nullifying the need for Turnpike Authority officials to determine why grout heave was not anticipated.  48   Acknowledgments The Office of the Inspector General hereby acknowledges the contributions of the following individuals to cost recovery efforts on the Big Dig: Governor Mitt Romney  Responding to the Globe's three-part series on the Big Dig, the new Governor's call for an independent claims review effort demonstrated the Commonwealth's commitment to holding Bechtel/Parsons Brinkerhoff (B/PB) accountable for its mistakes. General Court  Continuing its commitment to recoup costs paid to B/PB for substandard performance on the Big Dig, each branch of the Legislature voted without opposition to extend the deadline by which cost recovery suits could be brought against B/PB. Notably, an I.G. report entitled, A History of Central Artery/Tunnel Project Finances 1994  2001 issued in March 2001 included a finding faulting B/PB for not informing the Legislature of cost-minimizing accounting assumptions used to impact the total $13.8 billion cost forecast for the Big Dig. This Office found that B/BP shirked its contractual duty to report by concealing information from the State Legislature. This Office found that B/PB knew that the public, the press and the State Legislature had not been told that Big Dig officials based the estimate on a deceptively downsized definition of the cost forecast for fear of ""adverse"" political reactions. The Auditor of the Commonwealth A. Joseph DeNucci  The Auditor has continued to review and assess the controls that the Big Dig has in place for estimating, monitoring, and controlling project costs. The Auditor has issued 19 reports documenting $550 million in cost overruns and available savings opportunities. For many years the Big Dig consistently rejected Auditor DeNucci's recommendations. In an October 2001 joint letter with the I.G., the Auditor advised the Turnpike Authority to reform the cost recovery process citing that no cost recovery had been pursued against B/PB even though B/PB's performance may have contributed to cost overruns. Attorney General Tom Reilly  Deterring larceny, and tax evasion, the oversight and have lead to significant prosecutions and has also hired a construction and financial guidance on CA/T project finances. fraud, false claims, environmental offenses, enforcement efforts of the Attorney General financial recoveries. The Attorney General consulting firm to provide expert advice and  Secretary of the Commonwealth William Francis Galvin  Secretary Galvin introduced a bill that received unanimous approval in both branches of the Legislature, giving the Commonwealth 10 additional years to bring claims against B/PB. He has also pledged to review Big Dig record keeping procedures for proper compliance. Massachusetts Turnpike Authority Vice Chairman Jordan Levy  In October 2001, Jordan Levy proposed to the Turnpike Authority Board of Directors a comprehensive cost recovery initiative that centered on removing B/PB from the initial determination of potential cost recovery claims. Working in coordination with Chairman Matthew 49   Amorello, he is the person most responsible for advocating for and implementing reforms at the Big Dig. His initiative additionally called for moving the claims review process in-house and engaging independent engineers and experts who would work directly for the Turnpike Authority to review B/PB's performance in areas including design and construction management. Massachusetts Turnpike Authority Chairman Matthew Amorello  During the last year, this individual has spearheaded the adoption of each of Vice Chairman Levy's initiatives, including the engagement of an independent claims review panel chaired by former Judge Edward Ginsburg. The panel has hired former MWRA Counsel, Richard Goldstein. Mr. Goldstein has directed a cost recovery program at the MWRA, which this Office has consistently praised and publicly contrasted to the feeble cost recovery efforts at the Big Dig. Under the stewardship of Chairman Amorello and Counsel Michael Powers, the Office of the Inspector General has, for the first time in a decade, received the Turnpike Authority's cooperation and commitment to cost recovery against B/PB. Former Acting Governor Jane Swift  In October 2001, Acting Governor Jane Swift publicly endorsed cost recovery reforms recommended in a joint letter issued by the Acting Inspector General and the Auditor of the Commonwealth. She is responsible for bringing on Chairman Amorello. With respect to the toll increase controversy, she took an unpopular position to meet the obligations of the prior Governor and Turnpike Authority leadership. While this front-page controversy played out, her diligent efforts to reform the cost recovery system continued. Former State Treasurer Shannon O'Brien  The Office of the Inspector General's report, A History of CA/T Project Finances 1994-2001, credited the Treasurer's Office for forcing public disclosure of Big Dig cost overruns. Chief of Staff Michael Travaglini, together with Pat Landers and Jeff Stern, were instrumental in blowing the whistle on Big Dig cost overruns. Former Inspector General Robert Cerasoli  Gregory Sullivan's predecessor issued 14 reports, 75 letters and 400 recommendations, documenting a history of aggressive oversight of the Big Dig by the Office of the Inspector General between 1991 and 2001. Former Inspector General Cerasoli questioned $800 million in specific Big Dig costs. He was confronted with tremendous resistance, including an attempt by then-Governor Cellucci to eliminate the Office in response to a draft report issued to the then-Governor entitled, A Review of the Central Artery/Tunnel Project Cost Recovery Program. 3/03/03  50"

ACTION: Proposed rule.     SUMMARY: The EPA proposes interim approval of the title V operating  permits program submitted by the Mojave Desert Air Quality Management  District (Mojave Desert, or District) for the purpose of complying with  federal requirements that mandate that states develop, and submit to  EPA, programs for issuing operating permits to all major stationary  sources and to certain other sources. There are nine deficiencies in  Mojave Desert's program, as specified in the Technical Support Document  and outlined below, that must be corrected before the program can be  fully approved. EPA is also proposing to approve a revision to Mojave  Desert's portion of the California State Implementation Plan (SIP)  regarding synthetic minor regulations for the issuance of federally  enforceable state operating permits (FESOP). In order to extend the  federal enforceability of state operating permits to hazardous air  pollutants (HAP), EPA   [[Page 34489]]  is also proposing approval of Mojave Desert's synthetic minor  regulations pursuant to section 112 of the Act. Today's action also  proposes approval of Mojave Desert's mechanism for receiving straight  delegation of section 112 standards.  DATES: Comments on these proposed actions must be received in writing  by August 2, 1995.  ADDRESSES: Comments should be addressed to Sara Bartholomew, Mail Code  A-5-2, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Region IX, Air & Toxics  Division, 75 Hawthorne Street, San Francisco, CA 94105.     Copies of the District's submittal and other supporting information  used in developing the proposed interim approval are available for  inspection during normal business hours at the following location: U.S.  Environmental Protection Agency, Region IX, 75 Hawthorne Street, San  Francisco, CA 94105.  FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Sara Bartholomew (telephone 415/744- 1170), Mail Code A-5-2, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Region  IX, Air & Toxics Division, 75 Hawthorne Street, San Francisco, CA  94105.  SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:  I. Background and Purpose      As required under title V of the Clean Air Act (Act) as amended  (1990), EPA has promulgated rules that define the minimum elements of  an approvable state operating permits program and the corresponding  standards and procedures by which the EPA will approve, oversee, and  withdraw approval of state operating permits programs (see 57 FR 32250  (July 21, 1992)). These rules are codified at 40 CFR part 70 (part 70).  Title V requires states to develop, and submit to EPA, programs for  issuing operating permits to all major stationary sources and to  certain other sources.      The Act requires that states develop and submit title V programs to  EPA by November 15, 1993, and that EPA act to approve or disapprove  each program within 1 year after receiving the submittal. The EPA's  program review occurs pursuant to section 502 of the Act and the part  70 regulations, which together outline criteria for approval or  disapproval. Where a program substantially, but not fully, meets the  requirements of part 70, EPA may grant the program interim approval for  a period of up to 2 years. If EPA has not fully approved a program by 2  years after the November 15, 1993 date, or by the end of an interim  program, it must establish and implement a federal program.     On June 28, 1989 (54 FR 27274), EPA published criteria for  approving and incorporating into the SIP regulatory programs for the  issuance of federally enforceable state operating permits. Permits  issued pursuant to an operating permit program meeting these criteria  and approved into the SIP are considered federally enforceable. EPA has  encouraged states to consider developing such programs in conjunction  with title V operating permit programs for the purpose of creating  federally enforceable limits on a source's potential to emit. This  mechanism would enable sources to reduce their potential to emit to  below the title V applicability thresholds and avoid being subject to  title V. (See the guidance document entitled, ``Limitation of Potential  to Emit with Respect to Title V Applicability Thresholds,'' dated  September 18, 1992, from John Calcagni, Director of EPA's Air Quality  Management Division.) On November 3, 1993, EPA announced in a guidance  document entitled, ``Approaches to Creating Federally Enforceable  Emissions Limits,'' signed by John S. Seitz, Director of EPA's Office  of Air Quality Planning and Standards (OAQPS), that this mechanism  could be extended to create federally enforceable limits for emissions  of hazardous air pollutants (HAP) if the program were approved pursuant  to section 112(l) of the Act.  II. Proposed Action and Implications      This document focuses on specific elements of Mojave Desert's title  V operating permits program submittal that must be corrected to meet  the minimum requirements of 40 CFR part 70. The full program submittal,  the Technical Support Document containing a detailed analysis of the  full program, and other relevant materials are available as part of the  public docket.  A. Analysis of State Submission     Title V Support Materials      Mojave Desert's title V program was submitted by the California Air  Resources Board (CARB) on November 24, 1993 and found by EPA to be  incomplete, due to the lack of Federal Operating Permit regulations.  Mojave resubmitted its program on March 10, 1995 and it was found to be  complete on May 11, 1995. The Governor's letter requesting source  category-limited interim approval, California enabling legislation, and  Attorney General's legal opinion were submitted by CARB for all  districts in California and therefore were not included separately in  Mojave Desert's submittal. The Mojave Desert submission does contain a  complete program description, District implementing and supporting  regulations, and all other program documentation required by Sec. 70.4.  An implementation agreement between Mojave Desert and EPA is currently  being developed.    Title V Operating Permit Regulations and Program Implementation     The Mojave Desert's title V regulations were adopted on December  21, 1994. They consist of Regulation XII (Federal Operating Permits).  The District also submitted supporting materials including the  following rules: Rule 219 (Equipment Not Requiring a Permit, adopted  December 21, 1994), 221 (Federal Operating Permit Requirement, adopted  November 23, 1994), 301 (Permit Fees, adopted July 9, 1976, amended  October 23, 1994), 312 (Fees for Federal Operating Permits, adopted  December 21, 1994), and 430 (Breakdown Provisions, adopted May 7, 1976,  amended December 21, 1994). These regulations ``substantially meet''  the requirements of 40 CFR part 70, Sec. 70.2 and Sec. 70.3 for  applicability; Sec. 70.4, Sec. 70.5, and Sec. 70.6 for permit content,  including operational flexibility; Sec. 70.7 for public participation  and minor permit modifications; Sec. 70.5 for complete application  forms; and Sec. 70.11 for enforcement authority. Although the  regulations substantially meet part 70 requirements, nine program  deficiencies outlined below are interim approval issues. Recommended  changes are detailed further in the Technical Support Document.     Variances--Mojave Desert has authority under State and local law to  issue a variance from State and local requirements. Sections 42350 et  seq. of the California Health and Safety Code and District Regulation  1, sections 431-433 allow the District to grant relief from enforcement  action for permit violations. The EPA regards these provisions as  wholly external to the program submitted for approval under part 70,  and consequently, is proposing to take no action on these provisions of  State and local law.      The EPA has no authority to approve provisions of state or local  law, such as the variance provisions referred to, that are inconsistent  with the Act. The EPA does not recognize the ability of a permitting  authority to grant relief from the duty to comply with a federally  enforceable part 70 permit, except where such relief is granted through   [[Page 34490]]  procedures allowed by part 70. A part 70 permit may be issued or  revised (consistent with part 70 permitting procedures) to incorporate  those terms of a variance that are consistent with applicable  requirements. A part 70 permit may also incorporate, via part 70 permit  issuance or modification procedures, the schedule of compliance set  forth in a variance. However, EPA reserves the right to pursue  enforcement of applicable requirements notwithstanding the existence of  a compliance schedule in a permit to operate. This is consistent with  40 CFR 70.5(c)(8)(iii)(C), which states that a schedule of compliance  ``shall be supplemental to, and shall not sanction noncompliance with,  the applicable requirements on which it is based.''     Insignificant Activities--Section 70.4(b)(2) requires states to  include in their part 70 programs any criteria used to determine  insignificant activities or emission levels for the purpose of  determining complete applications. Section 70.5(c) states that an  application for a part 70 permit may not omit information needed to  determine the applicability of, or to impose, any applicable  requirement, or to evaluate appropriate fee amounts. Section 70.5(c)  also states that EPA may approve, as part of a state program, a list of  insignificant activities and emissions levels which need not be  included in permit applications. Under part 70, a state must request  and EPA must approve as part of that state's program any activity or  emission level that the state wishes to consider insignificant. Part  70, however, does not establish appropriate emission levels for  insignificant activities, relying instead on a case-by-case  determination of appropriate levels based on the particular  circumstances of the part 70 program under review.     In Rule 219 (Equipment Not Requiring a Permit) Mojave Desert  provided both threshold emissions levels and a list of specific  equipment which would not require a permit. This rule also clearly  states that equipment need not be listed in a permit application for a  federal operating permit if it falls below the threshold, is on the  list of equipment in the rule, is not subject to an applicable  requirement, and is not included in the equipment list solely due to  size or production rate. The only weakness in these gatekeepers is that  the word ``and'' is missing between sections (B)(1)(b) and (c), and  (B)(1)(c) and (d) of Rule 219. Adding ``and'' in these two places would  clarify that all of the four gatekeepers must apply for equipment to be  exempt, not just one. These corrections must be made in order to  receive full approval.      Rule 219 set the threshold criteria for equipment to be exempt from  a federal operating permit as 1012f the applicable threshold for  determination of a major source, or 5 tons per year of any regulated  air pollutant (whichever is less), and for HAP any de minimus level,  any significance level, or 0.5 tons per year (whichever is less). For  other state and district programs, EPA has proposed to accept, as  sufficient for full approval, emission levels for insignificant  activities of 2 tons per year for criteria pollutants and the lesser of  1000 pounds per year, section 112(g) de minimis levels, or other title  I significant modification levels for HAP and other toxics (40 CFR  52.21(b)(23)(i)). EPA believes that these levels are sufficiently below  the applicability thresholds of many applicable requirements to assure  that no unit potentially subject to an applicable requirement is left  off a title V application.      Mojave Desert did not describe the criteria used to determine the  insignificant activities or emission levels outlined in Rule 219. In  addition, Mojave's threshold levels as described above are higher than  those EPA has proposed to accept. Because of this, EPA is requesting  comment on the appropriateness of these emission levels for determining  insignificant activities in Mojave Desert. This request for comment is  not intended to restrict the ability of other states and districts to  propose, and EPA to approve, different emission levels if the state or  district demonstrates that such alternative emission levels are  insignificant compared to the level of emissions from and types of  units that are permitted or subject to applicable requirements. 3. Title V Permit Fee Demonstration      Section 502(b)(3) of the Act requires that each permitting  authority collect fees sufficient to cover all reasonable direct and  indirect costs required to develop and administer its title V operating  permits program. Each title V program submittal must contain either a  detailed demonstration of fee adequacy or a demonstration that  aggregate fees collected from title V sources meet or exceed $25 per  ton of emissions per year (adjusted from 1989 by the Consumer Price  Index (CPI)). The $25 per ton amount is presumed, for program approval,  to be sufficient to cover all reasonable program costs and is thus  referred to as the ``presumptive minimum.'' See Sec. 70.9(b)(2)(i).     Mojave Desert has opted to make a presumptive minimum fee  demonstration. Mojave Desert's existing fee schedule (Element 7)  requires title V facilities to pay an amount equivalent to $48.76 per  ton in annual operating fees. This amount meets EPA's presumptive  minimum (CPI adjusted). The $48.76 per ton amount is based on a  calculation of 1993/94 fee revenues per ton of emissions plus a  supplemental title V fee of 14.3that covers the additional costs  posed by title V. Mojave Desert will maintain an accounting system and  is prepared to increase fees, as needed, to reflect actual program  implementation costs.  4. Provisions Implementing the Requirements of Other Titles of the Act     a. Section 112--Mojave Desert has demonstrated in its title V  program submittal adequate legal authority to implement and enforce all  section 112 requirements through the title V permit. This legal  authority is contained in the State of California enabling legislation  and in regulatory provisions defining ``applicable requirements'' and  ``federally enforceable'' and mandating that all federal air quality  requirements must be incorporated into permits. EPA has determined that  this legal authority is sufficient to allow Mojave Desert to issue  permits that assure compliance with all section 112 requirements. For  further discussion, please refer to the Technical Support Document  accompanying this action and the April 13, 1993 guidance memorandum  entitled, ``Title V Program Approval Criteria for Section 112  Activities,'' signed by John Seitz.      b. Title IV--Mojave Desert is submitting proposed Rule 1210 (Acid  Rain Provisions of Federal Operating Permits) to its Board in June,  1995, which incorporates the pertinent provisions of part 72, either by  reference or in specific language in the rule. EPA interprets  ``pertinent provisions'' to include all provisions necessary for the  permitting of affected sources.  B. Proposal for and Implications of Interim Approval     Title V Operating Permits Program      a. Proposed Interim Approval--The EPA is proposing to grant interim  approval to the operating permits program submitted by CARB on behalf  of Mojave Desert on March 10, 1995. Following interim approval, Mojave  Desert must make the following changes to receive full approval:     (1) Revise Rule 1203(G)(3)(g), which prohibits the permit shield  from applying to Administrative Permit Amendments and Significant  Permit Modifications, to include a reference to   [[Page 34491]]  Minor Permit Modifications as well. The permit shield cannot apply to  Minor Permit Modifications, and the rule must state this clearly. See  Sec. 70.7(e)(2)(vi).      (2) Add a provision for sending the final permit to EPA, as  required by Sec. 70.8(a)(1). Mojave's Rule 1203(B)(1)(c) only provides  for sending the proposed permit to EPA.     (3) Adopt Rule 1210 (Acid Rain Provisions of Federal Operating  Permits).      (4) Rule 1206(A)(1)(i) must amend the provision that no reopening  is required if the effective date of the additional applicable  requirement is later than the date on which the permit is due to  expire. If the original permit or any of its terms and conditions are  extended pursuant to Sec. 70.4(b)(10), the permit must be reopened to  include a new applicable requirement, and a statement must be made to  this effect in Mojave's rule (Sec. 70.7(f)(1)(i)).     (5) Clarify in Rule 1203(G)(3)(B) that the permit shield shall not  limit liability for violations which occurred prior to or at the time  of the issuance of the federal operating permit, by adding the  underlined words. This is important to clarify that violations which  are continuing at the time of permit issuance will not be shielded  against.      (6) Lower the cutoff levels for criteria pollutants in Rule 219  (Equipment not Requiring a Permit) or, alternatively, demonstrate that  Mojave Desert's levels are insignificant compared to the level of  emissions from and types of units that are required to be permitted or  are subject to applicable requirements.     (7) Add ``and'' at the end of sections (b) and (c) in Rule  219(B)(2), in order to clarify that the four gatekeepers must all apply  in order for equipment to be exempt from getting a federal operating  permit.      (8) Add to Rule 1203(D)(1)(e)(i) a reference to the requirement for  the clear identification of all deviations with respect to reporting  (Sec. 70.6(a)(3)(iii)(A)).      (9) Add to Rule 1203(D)(1)(e)(ii) a reference to the requirement to  specify the probable cause and corrective actions or preventive  measures taken with regard to reporting a deviation  (Sec. 70.6(a)(3)(iii)(B)).      b. Legislative Source Category-Limited Interim Approval Issue--In  addition to the District-specific issues arising from Mojave Desert's  program submittal and locally adopted regulations, California State law  currently exempts agricultural production sources from permit  requirements. Because of this exemption, California programs are only  eligible for source category-limited interim approval. In order for  this program to receive full approval (and avoid a disapproval upon the  expiration of this interim approval), the California Legislature must  revise the Health and Safety Code to eliminate the exemption of  agricultural production sources from the requirement to obtain a  permit.      c. Implications of Interim Approval--The above described program  and legislative deficiencies must be corrected before Mojave Desert can  receive full program approval. For additional information, please refer  to the Technical Support Document, which contains a detailed analysis  of Mojave Desert's operating permits program, and California's enabling  legislation.      Interim approval, which may not be renewed, would extend for a  period of 2 years. During the interim approval period, the District  would be protected from sanctions, and EPA would not be obligated to  promulgate a federal permits program in the Mojave Desert. Permits  issued under a program with interim approval would have full standing  with respect to part 70, and the 1-year time period for submittal of  permit applications by subject sources would begin upon EPA's final  rulemaking granting interim approval, as would the 3-year time period  for processing initial permit applications.     Following final interim approval, if Mojave Desert should fail to  submit a complete corrective program for full approval by the date 6  months before expiration of the interim approval, EPA would start an  18-month clock for mandatory sanctions. Then, if Mojave Desert should  fail to submit a corrective program that EPA found complete before the  expiration of that 18-month period, EPA would be required to apply one  of the sanctions in section 179(b) of the Act, which would remain in  effect until EPA determined that the District corrected the deficiency  by submitting a complete corrective program. If, six months after  application of the first sanction, the Mojave Desert still had not  submitted a corrective program that EPA found complete, a second  sanction would be required.      If, following final interim approval, EPA were to disapprove Mojave  Desert's complete corrective program, EPA would be required to apply  one of the section 179(b) sanctions on the date 18 months after the  effective date of the disapproval unless prior to that date the  District submitted a revised program and EPA determined that it  corrected the deficiencies that prompted the disapproval. Again, if,  six months after EPA applied the first sanction, Mojave Desert had not  submitted a revised program that EPA determined corrected the  deficiencies, a second sanction would be required. In addition,  discretionary sanctions may be applied where warranted any time after  the end of an interim approval period if a state or district has not  submitted a timely and complete corrective program or EPA has  disapproved a submitted corrective program. Moreover, if EPA has not  granted full approval to a state or district program by the expiration  of an interim approval and that expiration occurs after November 15,  1995, EPA must promulgate, administer and enforce a federal permits  program for that state or district upon interim approval expiration. 2. Section 112(g) Implementation      EPA has decided that it is not reasonable to expect the states and  districts to implement section 112(g) before a rule is issued. EPA  therefore published an interpretive notice in the Federal Register  regarding section 112(g) of the Act: 60 FR 8333 (February 14, 1995).  This notice outlines EPA's revised interpretation of 112(g)  applicability prior to EPA's issuing the final 112(g) rule. The notice  states that major source modifications, constructions, and  reconstructions will not be subject to 112(g) requirements until the  final rule is promulgated. EPA expects to issue the 112(g) final rule  in September 1995.      The notice further explains that EPA is considering whether the  effective date of section 112(g) should be delayed beyond the date of  promulgation of the Federal rule so as to allow States and Districts  time to adopt rules implementing the Federal rule, and that EPA will  provide for any such additional delay in the final section 112(g)  rulemaking. Unless and until EPA provides for such an additional  postponement of section 112(g), Mojave Desert must be able to implement  section 112(g) during the period between promulgation of the Federal  section 112(g) rule and adoption of implementing District regulations.     For this reason, EPA is proposing to approve the use of Mojave  Desert's preconstruction review programs as a mechanism to implement  section 112(g) during the transition period between promulgation of the  section 112(g) rule and adoption by the nineteen districts of rules  specifically designed to implement section 112(g). However, since  approval is intended solely to confirm that Mojave Desert has a  mechanism to implement section 112(g) during the transition period, the  approval itself will be without effect if EPA decides in the final  section 112(g) rule that there will be no transition period. The EPA is   [[Page 34492]]  limiting the duration of its approval of the use of preconstruction  programs to implement 112(g) to 12 months following promulgation by EPA  of the section 112(g) rule.  3. Program for Delegation of Section 112 Standards as Promulgated     Requirements for part 70 program approval, specified in 40 CFR  70.4(b), encompass section 112(l)(5) requirements for approval of a  program for delegation of section 112 standards as promulgated by EPA  as they apply to part 70 sources. Section 112(l)(5) requires that the  District's program contain adequate authorities, adequate resources for  implementation, and an expeditious compliance schedule, which are also  requirements under part 70. Therefore, the EPA is also proposing to  grant approval under section 112(l)(5) and 40 CFR 63.91 of Mojave  Desert's program for receiving delegation of section 112 standards that  are unchanged from the federal standards as promulgated. California  Health and Safety Code section 39658 provides for automatic adoption by  CARB of section 112 standards upon promulgation by EPA. Section 39666  of the Health and Safety Code requires that districts then implement  and enforce these standards. Thus, when section 112 standards are  automatically adopted pursuant to section 39658, Mojave Desert will  have the authority necessary to accept delegation of these standards  without further regulatory action by the District. The details of this  mechanism and the means for finalizing delegation of standards will be  set forth in a Memorandum of Agreement between Mojave Desert and EPA,  expected to be completed prior to approval of Mojave Desert's section  112(l) program for straight delegations. This program applies to both  existing and future standards but is limited to sources covered by the  part 70 program.  4. State Operating Permit Program for Synthetic Minors     On March 31, 1995, CARB submitted for approval into the Mojave  Desert's portion of the California State Implementation Plan (SIP) a  local operating permit program designed to create federally enforceable  limits on a source's potential to emit. This District program is  referred to as a synthetic minor operating permit program, and it  consists of regulations that will be integrated with the District's  existing, non-federally enforceable, operating permit program. Such  programs are also referred to as federally enforceable state operating  permit (FESOP) programs. This synthetic minor or FESOP mechanism will  allow sources to reduce their potential to emit to below the title V  applicability thresholds and avoid being subject to title V.     Mojave Desert's synthetic minor regulations were adopted on  November 23, 1994 and codified in District Regulation XII, Rule 221  (Federal Operating Permit Requirement). EPA found the initial SIP  submittal complete on May 25, 1995.      The five criteria for approving a state operating permit program  into a SIP were set forth in the June 28, 1989 Federal Register notice  (54 FR 27282): (1) The program must be submitted to and approved by  EPA; (2) the program must impose a legal obligation on the operating  permit holders to comply with the terms and conditions of the permit,  and permits that do not conform with the June 28, 1989 criteria shall  be deemed not federally enforceable; (3) the program must contain terms  and conditions that are at least as stringent as any requirements  contained in the SIP or enforceable under the SIP or any other section  112 or other Clean Air Act standard or requirement; (4) permits issued  under the program must contain conditions that are permanent,  quantifiable, and enforceable as a practical matter; and (5) permits  issued under the program must be subject to public participation.     Permits issued under an approved program are federally enforceable  and may be used to limit the potential to emit of sources of criteria  pollutants. Mojave Desert's synthetic minor provisions of Regulation  XII, Rule 221 meet the June 28, 1989 criteria by ensuring that the  limits will be permanent, quantifiable, and practically enforceable and  by providing adequate notice and comment to EPA and the public. Please  refer to the Technical Support Document for a thorough analysis of the  June 28, 1989 criteria as applied to the Mojave Desert's synthetic  minor program.      EPA is proposing to approve pursuant to part 52 and the approval  criteria specified in the June 28, 1989 Federal Register notice the  following regulation that was submitted to create the synthetic minor  operating permit program: Rule 221 (Federal Operating Permit  Requirement).      On March 10, 1995, in its title V program submittal under  ``Addendum: Federal Clean Air Act Section 112(l) Authority Request  Letter,'' CARB requested approval of Mojave Desert's synthetic minor  program, consisting of the rules specified above, under section 112(l)  of the Act for the purpose of creating federally enforceable  limitations on the potential to emit of hazardous air pollutants (HAP).  The separate request for approval under section 112(l) is necessary  because the proposed SIP approval discussed above only provides a  mechanism for controlling criteria pollutants. While federally  enforceable limits on criteria pollutants (i.e., VOC's or PM-10) may  have the incidental effect of limiting certain HAP listed pursuant to  section 112(b) <SUP>1, section 112 of the Act provides the underlying  authority for controlling HAP emissions that are not criteria  pollutants. As a legal matter, no additional program approval by EPA is  required in order for these criteria pollutant limits to be recognized  as federally enforceable.      \1\ The EPA intends to issue guidance addressing the technical  aspects of how these criteria pollutant limits may be recognized for  purposes of limiting a source's potential to emit of HAP to below  section 112 major source levels.         EPA has determined that the five approval criteria for approving  FESOP programs into the SIP, as specified in the June 28, 1989 Federal  Register notice, are also appropriate for evaluating and approving the  programs under section 112(l). The June 28, 1989 notice does not  address HAP because it was written prior to the 1990 amendments to  section 112 (which injected the concept of major HAP sources versus  non-major or area HAP sources into the permit) and not because it  establishes requirements unique to criteria pollutants. Hence, the five  criteria outlined above are applicable to FESOP approvals under section  112(l).      In addition to meeting the criteria in the June 28, 1989 notice, a  FESOP program that will control HAP emissions must meet the statutory  criteria for approval under section 112(l)(5). Section 112(l)(5) allows  EPA to approve a program only if it: (1) Contains adequate authority to  assure compliance with any section 112 standard or requirement; (2)  provides for adequate resources; (3) provides for an expeditious  schedule for assuring compliance with section 112 requirements; and (4)  is otherwise likely to satisfy the objectives of the Act.     The EPA plans to codify the approval criteria for programs limiting  potential to emit of HAP in subpart E of part 63 (Subpart E), the  regulations promulgated to implement section 112(l) of the Act. The EPA  currently anticipates that these criteria, as they apply to FESOP  programs controlling HAP, will mirror those set forth in the June 28,  1989 notice, with the addition that the state's authority must extend  to all HAP, instead of, or in addition to, VOC's and PM-10. The EPA  currently anticipates that FESOP programs that are approved   [[Page 34493]]  pursuant to section 112(l) prior to the Subpart E revisions will have  had to meet these criteria, and hence, will not be subject to any  further approval action.      The EPA believes it has authority under section 112(l) to approve  programs to limit potential to emit of HAP directly under section  112(l) prior to this revision to Subpart E. Section 112(l)(5) requires  EPA to disapprove programs that are inconsistent with guidance required  to be issued under section 112(l)(2). This might be read to suggest  that the ``guidance'' referred to in section 112(l)(2) was intended to  be a binding rule. Even under this interpretation, the EPA does not  believe that section 112(l) requires this rulemaking to be  comprehensive. That is, it need not address all instances of approval  under section 112(l). Given the severe timing problems posed by  impending deadlines set forth in MACT standards and for submittal of  title V applications, EPA believes it is reasonable to read section  112(l) to allow for approval of programs to limit potential to emit  prior to issuance of a rule specifically addressing this issue.     EPA proposes approval of Mojave Desert's synthetic minor program  pursuant to section 112(l) because the program meets all of the  approval criteria specified in the June 28, 1989 Federal Register  notice and in section 112(l)(5) of the Act. Please refer to the  Technical Support Document for a complete discussion of how the June  28, 1989 criteria are met by the Mojave Desert. Regarding the statutory  criteria of section 112(l)(5) referred to above, the EPA believes  Mojave Desert's synthetic minor program contains adequate authority to  assure compliance with section 112 requirements since the third  criterion of the June 28, 1989 notice is met: the program does not  provide for waiving any section 112 requirement. Sources would still be  required to meet section 112 requirements applicable to non-major  sources. Furthermore, EPA believes that Mojave Desert's synthetic minor  program provides for an expeditious schedule for assuring compliance  because it allows a source to establish a voluntary limit on potential  to emit and avoid being subject to a federal Clean Air Act requirement  applicable on a particular date. Nothing in Mojave Desert's program  would allow a source to avoid or delay compliance with a federal  requirement if it fails to obtain the appropriate federally enforceable  limit by the relevant deadline. Finally, Mojave Desert's synthetic  minor program is consistent with the objectives of the section 112  program because its purpose is to enable sources to obtain federally  enforceable limits on potential to emit to avoid major source  classification under section 112. The EPA believes this purpose is  consistent with the overall intent of section 112, which is to decrease  the amount of HAP being emitted; by committing to stay below a certain  emission level for HAP, a source with a synthetic minor permit is  achieving this goal.  III. Administrative Requirements  A. Request for Public Comments      The EPA is requesting comments on all aspects of this proposed  interim approval. Copies of Mojave Desert's submittal and other  information relied upon for the proposed interim approval are contained  in a docket maintained at the EPA Regional Office. The docket is an  organized and complete file of all the information submitted to, or  otherwise considered by, EPA in the development of this proposed  interim approval. The principal purposes of the docket are:     (1) To allow interested parties a means to identify and locate  documents so that they can effectively participate in the approval  process, and      (2) To serve as the record in case of judicial review. The EPA will  consider any comments received by August 2, 1995.  B. Executive Order 12866      The Office of Management and Budget has exempted this action from  Executive Order 12866 review.  C. Regulatory Flexibility Act      The EPA's actions under sections 502, 110, and 112 of the Act do  not create any new requirements, but simply address operating permit  programs submitted to satisfy the requirements of 40 CFR part 70.  Because this action does not impose any new requirements, it does not  have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. Unfunded Mandates      Under Section 202 of the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995  (``Unfunded Mandates Act''), signed into law on March 22, 1995, EPA  must prepare a budgetary impact statement to accompany any proposed or  final rule that includes a Federal mandate that may result in estimated  costs to state, local, or tribal governments in the aggregate; or to  the private sector, of $100 million or more. Under Section 205, EPA  must select the most cost-effective and least burdensome alternative  that achieves the objectives of the rule and is consistent with  statutory requirements. Section 203 requires EPA to establish a plan  for informing and advising any small governments that may be  significantly or uniquely impacted by the rule.     EPA has determined that the proposed approval action promulgated  today does not include a federal mandate that may result in estimated  costs of $100 million or more to either state, local, or tribal  governments in the aggregate, or to the private sector. This proposed  federal action approves pre-existing requirements under state or local  law, and imposes no new federal requirements. Accordingly, no  additional costs to state, local, or tribal governments, or to the  private sector, result from this action.

ACTION: Direct final rule.     SUMMARY: Title IV of the Clean Air Act, as amended by Public Law 101- 549, the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 (the Act), authorizes the  Environmental Protection Agency (EPA or Agency) to establish the Acid  Rain Program. On January 11, 1993, the Agency promulgated final rules  under title IV. Several parties filed petitions for review of the  rules. On August 10, 1994, EPA and other parties signed a settlement  agreement addressing certain substitution plan issues.     Based on a review of the record, the Agency concludes that the  January 11, 1993 regulations concerning the eligibility of units to be  designated as substitution units should be revised. Under sections  404(b) and (c) of the Act, a unit that is not listed in Table A of  section 404 as being subject to Phase I of the Acid Rain Program (i.e.,  a non-Table A unit) and that is under the control of the owner or  operator of a unit listed in Table A of section 404 (i.e., a Table A  unit) may be designated as a substitution unit. The January 11, 1993  regulations state that the Table A unit and each non-Table A unit that  the Table A unit designates as a substitution unit must have ``the same  owner or operator.'' The Agency is revising the regulations in order to  specify more clearly the circumstances under which the statutory  ``control'' requirement for substitution plans is met. The rule  revision is being issued as a direct final rule because it is  consistent with the August 10, 1994 settlement and no adverse comment  is expected.    EFFECTIVE DATE: This direct final rule will be effective on January 3,  1995 unless significant, adverse comments are received by December 22,  1994. If significant, adverse comments are timely received on any  provision of the direct final rule, that provision of the direct final  rule will be withdrawn through a document in the Federal Register.    ADDRESSES: Docket No. A-93-40, containing supporting information used  to develop the proposal, copies of all comments received, and responses  to comments, is available for public inspection and copying from 8:30  a.m. to 12 p.m. and 1 p.m. to 3:30 p.m., Monday through Friday,  excluding legal holidays, at EPA's Air Docket Section (LE-131),  Waterside Mall, room 1500, 1st floor, 401 M Street, SW., Washington DC  20460. A reasonable fee may be charged for copying.    FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Dwight C. Alpern, Attorney-advisor, at  (202) 233-9151, Acid Rain Division (6204J), U.S. Environmental  Protection Agency, 401 M Street, SW., Washington, DC 20460, or the Acid  Rain Hotline at (202) 233-9620.    SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: All public comment received on any provision  of this direct final rule on which significant, adverse comments are  timely received will be addressed in a subsequent final rule based on  the relevant portions of the rule revision that is noticed as a  proposed rule in the Proposed Rules Section of this Federal Register  and that is identical to this direct final rule.     The contents of the preamble to the final rule are as follows: I. Control Requirement for Designating Substitution Units II. Modifications of the January 11, 1993 Regulation Concerning the  Control Requirement for Substitution Units     A. Control by Common Owner or Operator     B. Control by Contract      C. Plan Termination if Control Requirement is no Longer Met III. Administrative Requirements      A. Docket      B. Executive Order 12866      C. Paperwork Reduction Act      D. Regulatory Flexibility Act      E. Miscellaneous    I. Control Requirement for Designating Substitution Units        Sections 404(b) and (c) of the Act set forth the requirements for  submission and approval of substitution plans, under which a unit  listed on Table A of section 404 designates one or more non-Table A  units as substitution units and brings them into Phase I of the Acid  Rain Program. Congress established substitution plans as a compliance  option to increase units' compliance flexibility and reduce their  overall costs of compliance in Phase I while still achieving the  emissions reductions intended by Congress under title IV. See 58 FR  60950-60951 (Nov. 18, 1993).      A substitution plan allows the owner or operator of a Table A unit  to reassign the unit's emissions reduction obligations to a designated  non-Table A unit ``under the control of'' that owner or operator. 42  U.S.C. 7651c(b). Upon approval of the reassignment, the non-Table A  unit becomes subject to all requirements for Phase I units with regard  to sulfur dioxide and is allocated allowances. Emissions reductions by  the non-Table A unit may therefore free up allowances, which may be  used by the Table A unit (or any other unit) in lieu of making  emissions reductions.      Section 71.41 of the January 11, 1993 regulations provided that the  statutory requirement of control by the Table A unit's owner or  operator over the non-Table A unit is satisfied where such units have  ``the same owner or operator.'' 40 CFR 72.41(b)(1)(i) (1993). The  regulation also provided that having the same designated representative  would be treated as having the same operator and would thus meet the  control requirement. Id.; see also 58 FR 3600. On March 12, 1993,  petitions for review of the January 11, 1993 regulations were filed  with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.  Several petitioners challenged the provisions implementing the control  requirement.      On November 18, 1993, the Agency issued proposed revisions to the  January 11, 1993 regulations, including the provisions concerning the  control requirement. The Agency proposed to reverse its interpretation  that having a common designated representative alone meets the  statutory control requirement for substitution plans and to revise the  regulations accordingly. 58 FR 60957-60958. Several commenters  addressed the control requirement in their comments on the November 18,  1993 proposal. Some commenters opposed any change in the January 11,  1993 provisions concerning the control requirement.     Other commenters noted that, although Sec. 72.41(b)(1)(i) requires  that the substitution and Table A units have ``the same owner or  operator'' (40 CFR 72.41(b)(1)(i) (1993)), section 404(b) of the Act  requires that the substitution unit be under the control of the Table A  unit owner or operator. They argued that, in implementing section  404(b) and (c), the Agency should also focus on whether there is such  control. They suggested that common ownership of the units is not  necessarily determinative of whether the control requirement is met.  They alleged that where the units have multiple owners only one of  which is in common, the control requirement may not be met, e.g., where  the common owner owns only a very small percentage of the proposed  substitution unit. On the other hand, where the units lack any common  owner or operator, the control requirement allegedly may be met through  contractual arrangements under which the owner and operator of the  substitution unit commit, inter alia, to make emissions reductions and  deliver allowances to the owner and operator of the Phase I unit.     In a separate final rule in this Federal Register, the Agency  adopted the reasoning, set forth in the November 18, 1993 preamble (58  FR 60957-60958) and in the preamble of the Acid Rain regulations on  nitrogen oxides (59 FR 13554-13555 (Mar. 22, 1994)), that a designated  representative is not, merely by holding that position, also an  operator. In that separate final rule, the Agency revised the January  11, 1993 regulations to use the statutory language requiring control by  the Table A unit owner or operator and to provide that having a common  designated representative does not alone meet the control requirement  for substitution units. However, the Agency did not address in that  separate document comments raising issues concerning: under what  circumstances the existence of one or more common owners satisfies the  control requirement; and whether and, if so, under what circumstances  control can be established by contract if there are no common owners or  common operators. The Agency addresses below those issues and the  comments on those issues.    II. Modifications of the January 11, 1993 Regulation Concerning the  Control Requirement for Substitution Units    A. Control by Common Owner or Operator        Section 404(b) of the Act allows that the ``owner or operator'' of  a Table A unit to designate, as a substitution unit, a non-Table A unit  ``under the control of such owner or operator.'' 42 U.S.C. 7651c(b).  The Agency agrees with commenters that, like section 404(b), the  regulation implementing that section should focus on whether such  control exists.      Because many units have multiple owners with varying percentages of  ownership, there is a wide range of possible relationships between a  Table A unit and a non-Table A unit, ranging, for example, from no  common ownership to 100  ommon ownership and including all the   possible variations in between. In order to avoid burdensome case-bycase  determinations of whether each particular set of facts meets the  control requirement and in order to provide more certainty for  utilities and the public concerning what units qualify for inclusion in  substitution plans, the Agency is establishing generic criteria for  applying the control requirement. Further, the generic criteria are  based on the potential ability of owners and operators to exercise  control, not the actual exercise of such control potential. Determining  what entities actually make decisions governing the operation of a unit  could require the Agency to make lengthy case-by-case inquiries into  the details of utility operations and involve the Agency in matters  beyond its expertise.      In taking this approach, the Agency maintains that section 404(b)  should be interpreted to require that owners or operators of a Table A  unit have the ability to exercise a significant degree of control over  a non-Table A unit. The simplest case for applying this requirement is  where the Table A and non-Table A units have only a single owner or  where, regardless of their ownership, the units have a common operator.  Under these circumstances, it seems clear that the single owner or the  operator of the Table A unit has the ability to control the non-Table A  unit.      For units with multiple owners, the application of the control  requirement becomes somewhat more complex if they do not have a common  operator. If one or more owners and operators of a Table A unit own an  aggregate share of 5012r more of the capacity of a non-Table A unit,  no major decisions concerning the unit can be made without the  concurrence of such Table A unit owners and operators. The Agency  maintains, therefore, that they can control the non-Table A unit to a  significant extent and meet the control requirement.     Even where the aggregate ownership share of the one or more owners  and operators of a Table A unit in a non-Table A unit is less than 50,  the degree of control may still be significant. Such control is  evidenced by the ability of such non-Table A unit owners to determine  the dispatch of their respective shares of electricity generated by the  non-Table A unit. Decisions by such owners whether or not to take their  shares of generation can significantly affect the overall operation of  the unit. While the Agency recognizes that adopting a minimum level of  ownership in the non-Table A unit for meeting the control requirement  is necessarily somewhat arbitrary, the Agency maintains that, as a  matter of logic, there is some level of ownership below which the  owners lack significant control. Further, establishing such a minimum  level of ownership discourages gaming through the acquisition of minute  ownership shares simply to enable the new owner to qualify the nonTable  A unit as a substitution unit.      The Agency believes that an aggregate ownership interest of 1012r  more, and less than 50, of the capacity of the non-Table A unit meets  the control requirement, provided that such owners have the ability to  determine how their respective shares of the non-Table A unit's  generation are dispatched. The Agency notes that, in some regions of  the country, utilities have entered into power pool agreements under  which the utilities agree to centralize in the power pool the dispatch  of their units. Power pools with central economic dispatch enable  member utilities to minimize operating costs through the use of the  units in the pool that have the lowest generation costs. In light of  the important benefits of such power pools, the Agency maintains that  utilities in power pools should not be disadvantaged under section  404(b). Consequently, the determination of whether owners of a nonTable  A unit have, by right of contract, the ability to dispatch their  respective shares of the unit's generation should be made without  regard to whether owners that had contractual dispatch authority have  surrendered that authority to a power pool.     In sum, the Agency is establishing generic criteria for determining  whether the control requirement under section 404(b) is met. The first  category that meets this requirement is where one or more owners or  operators of a Table A unit have an aggregate ownership interest of 50 or more in the non-Table A unit or where the two units have a common  operator.<SUP>1 The second category that meets the control requirement  is where: a Table A and non-Table A unit lack a common operator; one or  more owners or operators of a Table A unit have an aggregate ownership  interest of 1012r more and less than 50 184n the non-Table A unit; and  such owners or operators have the contractual ability to determine the  dispatch of their respective shares of the non-Table A unit's  generation. The final regulation requires the designated  representatives submitting substitution plans to state in the  submission what category is applicable to the units in the plan and to  provide, upon request, documentation supporting such statements. These  statements, like all information included in submissions by the  designated representative, are covered by the certification required  under Sec. 72.21(b) concerning the truth, accuracy, and completeness of  the statements.           \1\In summing the ownership shares of individual Table A unit  owners and operators in the capacity of a non-Table unit, a given  share, and the generation associated with such share, obviously  cannot be double-counted. Otherwise, the sum of the ownership shares  of all persons owning a non-Table A unit could exceed 100      B. Control by Contract        The Agency agrees that, under certain circumstances, control over a  substitution unit by the owners and operators of the Table A unit may  be established by contract where the above-described criteria based on  a common operator or the level of common ownership are not met. The  contract must be a binding agreement between the owners and operators  of a Table A unit and the owners and operators of the non-Table A unit  that is designated as the Table A unit's substitution unit. Several  commenters supported an interpretation of section 404(b) that would  allow the control requirement to be met through a contract. The final  regulation specifies the circumstances under which the Administator  will find that control is established by contract.     Several determinations have guided the Agency's development of the  regulation concerning control by contract. First, the Agency believes  that the regulation should set forth detailed, generic requirements for  establishing control by contract. Leaving the specification of detailed  requirements to case-by-case development would increase the burden both  on the owners and operators interested in submitting contract-based  substitution plans and on the Agency, which must review such  submissions. A commenter supporting the approval of contract-based  substitution plans suggested that the Agency develop generic criteria.     Second, the Agency believes that the control requirement of section  404(b) of the Act should be interpreted in light of the emissions  reduction goals of title IV. The Agency maintains that a determination  of whether control is established by contract should focus on whether  the owners and operators of the Table A unit have the ability, under  the contract, to require emissions reductions by the non-Table A unit  and thereby to affect the overall operation of the unit. It is not  necessary in this context for the Table A unit's owners and operators  to have contractual authority over all facets of the non-Table A unit's  day-to-day operations.      Third, if the control requirement is to be met by simply showing  that Table A unit owners and operators have the ability, by contract,  to require emissions reductions by the non-Table A unit, the Agency  maintains that the contract must require emissions reductions that are  significant, new reductions that would not otherwise have been  implemented by the non-Table A unit. It is difficult to see how control  could be demonstrated if a contract with a Table A unit merely required  a non-Table A unit to ``make'' reductions that the non-Table A unit had  already implemented, was already in the process of implementing, or  would have implemented even in the absence of the contract. Further,  because a unit might be able to realize relatively minor reductions  while making little change in its operations, the scale of the  reductions required by contract should be significant in order to  demonstrate control of the non-Table A unit by owners and operators  that otherwise lack any operational responsibilities for that unit. A  commenter suggested that the contract between the Table A and non-Table  A units should specify a percentage emissions rate reduction that the  non-Table A unit is required to achieve.     To ensure that the contract requires significant, new reductions by  the non-Table A unit, the final regulation requires that the contract  establish a maximum annual average SO<INF>2 emissions rate for the  unit. The maximum emissions rate must be less than or equal to 7012f  the lesser of the following emissions rates for the non-Table A unit:  the 1985 actual SO<INF>2 emissions rate; the 1985 allowable SO<INF>2  emissions rate; the greater of the 1989 or 1990 actual SO2 emissions  rate; the most stringent federally enforceable or State enforceable  SO<INF>2 emissions limitation, as of November 15, 1990, applicable in  Phase I; and the lesser of the average actual SO<INF>2 emissions rate  or the most stringent federally enforceable or State enforceable  SO<INF>2 emissions limitation for the four-quarter period immediately  preceding the submission of the contract-based substitution plan.<SUP>2  The latter set of emissions rates (i.e., the current actual and  allowable rates) are included to ensure that the required reduction in  the unit's emissions rate is at least 3012f the emissions rate  achieved, or required to be achieved, by the non-Table A unit around  the time of the submission of the substitution plan. The other  emissions rates (i.e., those for 1985, 1989, 1990, and Phase I) are  used to ensure that the current actual or allowable rate does not  represent a spike in the emissions rate achieved by or required for the  unit since 1985.<SUP>3 A commenter supported using all of these  emissions rates to set a maximum emissions rate for the non-Table A  unit.           \2\Some units are subject to a non-unit-specific emissions limit  (e.g., a utility-wide emissions tonnage or rate limit). The final  regulation provides that if such a unit is designated as a  substitution unit in a contract-based substitution plan, the  Administrator will determine on a case-by-case basis how to apply  the non-unit-specific limit in setting the maximum annual SO<INF>2  emissions rate. If a non-unit-specific Federal limit was in effect  and applicable to the unit in 1985, that limit is already reflected  in the 1985 allowable SO<INF>2 emissions rate (in the National  Allowance Data Base), which will be treated as representing the nonunit     specific Federal limit.      \3\For the reasons set forth in a separate final rule in this  Federal Register, these other emissions rates are also used to  allocate allowances for any substitution unit and to ensure that  allowances are not allocated for emissions reductions that would  have been made without a substitution plan.          The Agency maintains that a 30reduction in the emissions rate  that the non-Table A unit would otherwise achieve represents a  significant reduction. A commenter supporting approval of contractbased  substitution plans asserted that it has identified about 30 Phase  II units that lack a common owner or operator with a Table A unit and  for which such plans would be economically feasible. The commenter  stated that this group of units could reduce their current emissions  rates by 50 to 70and indicated that a 30reduction might be an  acceptable requirement for approval of this type of substitution plan.     As a further means of ensuring that the non-Table A unit's  reductions are new, the final regulation requires that the contractbased  substitution plan include a description of the actions that will  be undertaken so that the non-Table A unit will comply with the maximum  emissions rate. Such actions may include, for example, the addition or  modification of a scrubber or fuel switching. The owners and operators  of the Table A and non-Table A units must show that the described  actions will not be implemented in Phase I unless the non-Table A unit  is approved as a substitution unit. The description of the actions that  will be taken must be sufficiently detailed so that the Agency can  determine whether the showing has been made. Information relevant to  the showing includes, inter alia, whether contracts implementing these  actions were entered into before submission of the substitution plan.  Under the regulation, the owners and operators must implement the  described actions but may seek to amend the substitution plan to change  the required actions.      In general, the Agency maintains that it is difficult to make  determinations, particularly in a large number of cases, of whether  owners and operators will take certain future actions in the absence of  a substitution plan. However, the Agency must make a determination of  this type in reviewing the actions described in each contract-based  substitution plan in order to make sure that the non-Table A unit is  really obligated to make new reductions. This will be a one-time  determination made when the plan is approved (or disapproved) unless  the designated representative subsequently seeks to modify the  description of actions in the plan. Further, the Agency does not expect  a large number of contract-based substitution plans to be submitted. As  noted above, commenters have identified only about 30 units for which  such a plan would be economic.      Fourth, it is important to ensure that the contract imposes an  effective emissions reduction requirement--i.e., a requirement that is  likely to be enforced by Table A unit owners and operators claiming  control of the non-Table A unit. Consequently, the contract should  include a meaningful remedy in the event that the required emissions  reductions are not achieved. The concept of requiring a meaningful  remedy in the event of default was supported by a commenter.     If the Table A unit owners and operators must surrender allowances  to the Administrator to the extent that the non-Table A unit fails to  make the required emissions reductions, then the Table A owners and  operators will bear responsibility for the reductions that they claim  to control and will have the incentive to take actions to ensure  achievement of the reductions. This puts the Table A owners and  operators in a position similar to that of owners and operators that  control a unit directly by owning or operating the unit. If, instead of  such allowance surrender by the Table A unit, the non-Table A unit had  to give allowances to the Table A unit (or to the Agency), then the  Table A unit owners and operators would bear no responsibility for the  non-Table A unit that they claim to control. Further, without elaborate  limitations on the transfer of allowances between the Table A and nonTable  A units, there would be no way of preventing the units from  arranging a future return to the non-Table A unit of any allowances  surrendered by the non-Table A unit to the Table A unit.     Under the final regulation, if the non-Table A unit fails to comply  with the maximum emissions rate during the year, the Table A unit  owners and operators must surrender a number of allowances equal to the  non-Table A unit's baseline multiplied by the difference between the  actual emissions rate for the year and the maximum emissions rate. This  approach segregates out the effect of utilization changes and leaves  such changes to be handled under the reduced utilization and allowance  surrender provisions (e.g., Sec. Sec. 72.43, 72.91, and 72.92)  applicable to all Phase I units. The surrendered allowances must have  the same or an earlier compliance use date as the allowances allocated  to the non-Table A unit for the year, and the surrender must be made on  or before the allowance transfer deadline. In order to encourage early  reductions at non-Table A units and innovative approaches to achieving  such reductions, the surrender and deduction of allowances will be the  only remedy under the Act for failure to meet the maximum emissions  rate. Of course, the deduction of allowances for failure to achieve the  maximum emissions rate may result in a unit having insufficient  allowances to cover its annual emissions, and the full panoply of  remedies for excess emissions will then apply.     Finally, in order to facilitate the Table A unit owners' and  operators' exercise of control and the Agency's review and enforcement,  where necessary, of the substitution plan, the units involved should  have a common designated representative. A commenter supported the need  for a common designated representative for this type of substitution  plan.<SUP>4 The final regulation provides that the requirement to have  a common designated representative is not met by simply having a common  alternate designated representative. This is because, as explained in  the preamble of the November 18, 1993 proposed rule, an alternate  designated representative does not carry the same level of  responsibilities as, and thus is not equivalent to, a designated  representative. 58 FR 60958.           \4\The commenter also suggested that the non-Table A owners and  operators be required to submit quarterly and annual reports to the  Table A unit owners and operators and to indemnify such owners and  operators for any violations at the non-Table A unit. These  requirements are not in the final rule because the Agency believes  that these matters are not central to the issue of control and are  better left to the owners and operators of the two units.      C. Plan Termination if Control Requirement is no Longer met        The January 11, 1993 regulations provide that where, as a result of  ownership or other changes, the units in a substitution plan no longer  meet the common owner or operator requirement in those regulations, the  substitution plan must be terminated. The final regulation adopted here  takes a similar approach. If there are changes that result in the  control requirement no longer being met, the designated representative  must terminate the plan, whether the plan is based on common owners or  operators or on a contract. The Administrator may, on his or her own  motion, terminate the plan under such circumstances.     The only exception to this requirement is for substitution plans  approved, and included in final permits issued, under the January 11,  1993 regulations and the Partial Settlement in Environmental Defense  Fund v. Carol M. Browner, No. 93-1203 (D.C. Cir. 1993) (signed May 4,  1994). So long as the Table A and non-Table A units under each plan  continue to meet the common owner, operator, or designated  representative requirement in the January 11, 1993 regulations, such  plans will not be terminated for the first year (and, in some cases,  for the second year) for which the substitution unit received a total  number of allowances equal to the number provided in those regulations.  This exception is consistent with both the May 4, 1993 settlement and  the Second Partial Settlement in Environmental Defense Fund v. Carol M.  Browner, No. 93-1203 (D.C. Cir. 1993) (signed August 10, 1994). The  Agency maintains that both settlements reasonably resolve the  substitution plan issues raised in the litigation, including the issues  relating to the control requirement.    III. Administrative Requirements    A. Docket        The docket is the organized and complete file of all the  information considered by EPA in the development of this rulemaking.  Along with the preamble of the direct final rule, the contents of the  docket--except for interagency review materials--will constitute the  record in case of judicial review. See 42 U.S.C. 7607(d)(7)(A).    B. Executive Order 12866        Under Executive Order 12866, 58 FR 51735 (Oct. 4, 1993), the  Administrator must determine whether the regulatory action is  ``significant'' and therefore subject to Office of Management and  Budget (OMB) review and the requirements of the Executive Order. The  Order defines ``significant regulatory action'' as one that is likely  to result in a rule that may:        (1) Have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more or  adversely affect in a material way the economy, a sector of the  economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public  health or safety, or State, local, or tribal governments or  communities;      (2) Create a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an  action taken or planned by another agency;     (3) Materially alter the budgetary impact of entitlements, grants,  user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations of recipients  thereof; or      (4) Raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal  mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles set forth in  the Executive Order.        Pursuant to the terms of Executive Order 12866, it has been  determined that this rule is a ``significant regulatory action''  because the rule seems to raise novel legal or policy issues. As such,  this action was submitted to OMB for review. Any changes made in  response to OMB suggestions or recommendations are documented in the  public record. Any written comments from OMB to EPA and any written EPA  response to those comments are included in the docket. The docket is  available for public inspection at the EPA's Air Docket Section, which  is listed in the ADDRESSES section of this preamble.    C. Paperwork Reduction Act        The information collection requirements in this rule have been  approved by OMB under the Paperwork Reduction Act, 44 U.S.C. 3501, et  seq., and have been assigned control number 2060-0258.     This collection of information has an estimated burden averaging  17.5 to 28 hours per response for about 43 responses. These estimates  include time for reviewing instructions, searching existing data  sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed, and completing and  reviewing the collection of information.     An Information Collection Request document and estimates of the  public reporting burden were prepared in connection with the January  11, 1993 regulations. 56 FR 63098; 58 FR 3650. The regulation  modifications contained in this document will not significantly change  the reporting burden that was previously estimated.     Send comments regarding this burden analysis or any other aspect of  this collection of information, including suggestions for reducing the  burden, to Chief, Information Policy Branch, EPA, 401 M Street, SW.,  (Mail Code 2136), Washington, DC 20460; and to the Office of  Information and Regulatory Affairs, Office of Management and Budget,  Washington, DC 20503, marked ``Attention: Desk Officer for EPA.''    D. Regulatory Flexibility Act        The Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601, et seq., requires  each Federal agency to consider potential impacts of its regulations on  small business ``entities.'' Under 5 U.S.C. 604(a), an agency issuing a  notice of proposed rulemaking must prepare and make available for  public comment a regulatory flexibility analysis. Such an analysis is  not required if the head of an agency certifies that a rule will not  have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small  entities, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 605(b).      In the preamble of the January 11, 1993 regulations, the  Administrator certified that those regulations, including the  provisions revised by today's final rule, would not have a significant  impact. 58 FR 3649. The final rule revisions adopted today are not  significant enough to change the economic impact addressed in the  preamble of the January 11, 1993 regulations, which were certified as  not having a significant impact. Pursuant to the provisions of 5 U.S.C.  605(b), I hereby certify that the revised rule will not have a  significant, adverse impact on a substantial number of small entities.    E. Miscellaneous        In accordance with section 117 of the Act, publication of this rule  was preceded by consultation with any appropriate advisory committees,  independent experts, and Federal departments and agencies.    List of Subjects in 40 CFR Part 72        Environmental protection, Acid rain, Air pollution control,  Electric utilities, Permits, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements,  Sulfur dioxide.        Dated: November 14, 1994.  Carol M. Browner,  Administrator.        For the reasons set forth in the preamble, chapter I of title 40 of  the Code of Federal Regulations is amended as follows:    PART 72--[AMENDED]      The authority citation for part 72 continues to read as follows:       Authority: 42 U.S.C. 7601 and 7651 et seq.        2. Section 72.41 is amended by revising paragraphs (c)(5) and  (e)(3)(iv) and adding paragraphs (c)(6), (c)(7), and (e)(1)(iii) to  read as follows:     Sec. 72.41  Phase I substitution plans.      * * * *      (c) * * *      (5) A demonstration that the substitution plan meets the  requirement that each unit under paragraph (a)(2) of this section is  under the control of the owner or operator of each unit under paragraph  (a)(1) of this section that designates the unit under paragraph (a)(2)  of this section as a substitution unit. The demonstration shall be one  of the following:      (i) If the unit under paragraph (a)(1) of this section has one or  more owners or operators that have an aggregate percentage ownership  interest of 50 percent or more in the capacity of the unit under  paragraph (a)(2) of this section or the units have a common operator, a  statement identifying such owners or operators and their aggregate  percentage ownership interest in the capacity of the unit under  paragraph (a)(2) of this section or identifying the units' common  operator. The designated representative shall submit supporting  documentation upon request by the Administrator.     (ii) If the unit under paragraph (a)(1) of this section has one or  more owners or operators that have an aggregate percentage ownership  interest of at least 10 percent and less than 50 percent in the  capacity of the unit under paragraph (a)(2) of this section and the  units do not have a common operator, a statement identifying such  owners or operators and their aggregate percentage ownership interest  in the capacity of the unit under paragraph (a)(2) of this seciton and  stating that each such owner or operator has the contractual right to  direct the dispatch of the electricity that, because of its ownership  interest, it has the right to receive from the unit under paragraph  (a)(2) of this section. The fact that the electricity that such owner  or operator has the right to receive is centrally dispatched through a  power pool will not be the basis for determining that the owner or  operator does not have the contractual right to direct the dispatch of  such electricity. The designated representative shall submit supporting  documentation upon request by the Administrator.     (iii) A copy of an agreement that is binding on the owners and  operators of the unit under paragraph (a)(2) of this section and the  owners and operators of the unit under paragraph (a)(1) of this  section, provides each of the following elements, and is supported by  documentation meeting the requirements of paragraph (c)(6) of this  section:      (A) The owners and operators of the unit under paragraph (a)(2) of  this section must not allow the unit to emit sulfur dioxide in excess  of a maximum annual average SO<INF>2 emissions rate (in lbs/mmBtu),  specified in the agreement, for each year during the period that the  substitution plan is in effect.      (B) The maximum annual average SO<INF>2 emissions rate for the unit  under paragraph (a)(2) of this section shall not exceed 70 percent of  the lesser of: the unit's 1985 actual SO<INF>2 emissions rate; the  unit's 1985 allowable SO<INF>2 emissions rate; the greater of the  unit's 1989 or 1990 actual SO<INF>2 emissions rate; the most stringent  federally enforceable or State enforceable SO<INF>2 emissions  limitation, as of November 15, 1990, applicable to the unit in Phase I;  or the lesser of the average actual SO<INF>2 emissions rate or the most  stringent federally enforceable or State enforceable SO<INF>2 emissions  limitation for the unit for four consecutive quarters that immediately  precede the 30-day period ending on the date the substitution plan is  submitted to the Administrator. If the unit is covered by a non-unitspecific  federally enforceable or State enforceable SO<INF>2 emissions  limitation in the four consecutive quarters or, as of November 15,  1990, in Phase I, the Administrator will determine, on a case-by-case  basis, how to apply the non-unit-specific emissions limitation for  purposes of determining whether the maximum annual average SO<INF>2  emissions rate meets the requirement of the prior sentence. If a nonunit -specific federally enforceable SO<INF>2 emissions limitation is  not different from a non-unit-specific federally enforceable SO<INF>2  emissions limitation that was effective and applicable to the unit in  1985, the Administrator will apply the non-unit-specific SO<INF>2  emissions limitation by using the 1985 allowable SO<INF>2 emissions  rate.      (C) For each year that the actual SO<INF>2 emissions rate of the  unit under paragraph (a)(2) of this section exceeds the maximum annual  average SO<INF>2 emissions rate, the designated representative of the  unit under paragraph (a)(1) of this section must surrender allowances  for deduction from the Allowance Tracking System account of the unit  under paragraph (a)(1) of this section. The designated representative  shall surrender allowances authorizing emissions equal to the baseline  of the unit under paragraph (a)(2) of this section multiplied by the  difference between the actual SO<INF>2 emissions rate of the unit under  paragraph (a)(2) of this section and the maximum annual average  SO<INF>2 emissions rate and divided by 2000 lbs/ton. The surrender  shall be made by the allowance transfer deadline of the year of the  exceedance, and the surrendered allowances shall have the same or an  earlier compliance use date as the allowances allocated to the unit  under paragraph (a)(2) of this section for that year. The designated  representative may identify the serial numbers of the allowances to be  deducted. In the absence of such identification, allowances will be  deducted on a first-in, first-out basis under Sec. 73.35(c)(2) of this  chapter.      (D) The unit under paragraph (a)(2) of this section and the unit  under paragraph (a)(1) of this section shall designate a common  designated representative during the period that the substitution plan  is in effect. Having a common alternate designated representative shall  not satisfy the requirement in the prior sentence.     (E) Except as provided in paragraph (c)(6)(i) of this section, the  actual SO<INF>2 emissions rate for any year and the average actual  SO<INF>2 emissions rate for any period shall be determined in  accordance with part 75 of this chapter.     (6) A demonstration under paragraph (c)(5)(iii) of this section  shall include the following supporting documentation:     (i) The calculation of the average actual SO<INF>2 emissions rate  and the most stringent federally enforceable or State enforceable  SO<INF>2 emissions limitation for the unit for the four consecutive  quarters that immediately preceded the 30-day period ending on the date  the substitution plan is submitted to the Administrator. To the extent  that the four consecutive quarters include a quarter prior to January  1, 1995, the SO<INF>2 emissions rate for the quarter shall be  determined applying the methodology for calculating SO<INF>2 emissions  set forth in appendix C of this part. This methodology shall be applied  using data submitted for the quarter to the Secretary of Energy on  United States Department of Energy Form 767 or, if such data has not  been submitted for the quarter, using the dataprepared for such  submission for the quarter.      (ii) A description of the actions that will be taken in order for  the unit under paragraph (a)(2) of this section to comply with the  maximum annual average SO<INF>2 emissions rate under paragraph  (c)(5)(iii) of this section.      (iii) A description of any contract for implementing the actions  described in paragraph (c)(6)(ii) of this section that was executed  before the date on which the agreement under paragraph (c)(5)(iii) of  this section is executed. The designated representative shall state the  execution date of each such contract and state whether the contract is  expressly contingent on the agreement under paragraph (c)(5)(iii) of  this section.      (iv) A showing that the actions described under paragraph  (c)(6)(ii) of this section will not be implemented during Phase I  unless the unit is approved as a substitution unit.     (7) The special provisions in paragraph (e) of this section.   * * * *      (e) * * *      (1) * * *      (iii) Where an approved substitution plan includes a demonstration  under paragraphs (c)(5)(iii) and (c)(6) of this section.     (A) The owners and operators of the substitution unit covered by  the demonstration shall implement the actions described under paragraph  (c)(6)(ii) of this section, as adjusted by the Administrator in  approving the plan or in revising the permit. The designated  representative may submit proposed permit revisions changing the  description of the actions to be taken in order for the substitution  unit to achieve the maximum annual average SO<INF>2 emissions rate  under the approved plan and shall include in any such submission a  showing that the actions in the changed description will not be  implemented during Phase I unless the unit remains a substitution unit.  The permit revision will be treated as an administrative amendment,  except where the Administrator determines that the change in the  description alters the fundamental nature of the actions to be taken  and that public notice and comment will contribute to the decisionmaking  process, in which case the permit revision will be treated as a  permit modification or, at the option of the designated representative,  a fast-track modification.      (B) The designated representative of the unit under paragraph  (a)(1) of this section shall surrender allowances, and theAdministrator  will deduct allowances, in accordance with paragraph (c)(5)(iii)(C) of  this section. The surrender and deduction of allowances as required  under the prior sentence shall be the only remedy under the Act for a  failure to meet the maximum annual average SO<INF>2 emissions rate,  provided that, if such deduction of allowance results in excess  emissions, the remedies for excess emissions shall be fully applicable.   * * * *      (3) * * *      (iv)(A) If there is a change in the ownership interest of the  owners or operators of any unit under a substitution plan approved as  meeting the requirements of paragraph (c)(5)(i) or (ii) of this section  or a change in such owners' or operators' right to direct dispatch of  electricity from a substitution unit under such a plan and the  demonstration under paragraph (c)(5)(i) or (ii) of this section cannot  be made, then the designated representatives of the units governed by  this plan shall submit a notification to terminate the plan so that the  plan will terminate as of January 1 of the calendar year during which  the change is made.      (B) Where a substitution plan is approved as meeting the  requirements of paragraph (c)(5)(iii) of this section, if there is a  change in the agreement under paragraph (c)(5)(iii) of this section and  a demonstration that the agreement, as changed, meets the requirements  of paragraph (c)(5)(iii) cannot be made, then the designated  representative of the units governed by the plan shall submit a  notification to terminate the plan so that the plan will terminate as  of January 1 of the calendar year during which the change is made.  Where a substitution plan is approved as meeting the requirements of  paragraph (c)(5)(iii) of this section, if the requirements of the first  sentence of paragraph (e)(1)(iii)(A) of this section are not met during  a calendar year, then the designated representative of the units  governed by the plan shall submit a notification to terminate the plan  so that the plan will terminate as of January 1 of such calendar year.     (C) If the plan is not terminated in accordance with paragraphs  (e)(3)(iv)(A) or (B) of this section, the Administrator, on his or her  own motion, will terminate the plan and deduct the allowances required  to be surrendered under paragraph (e)(3)(ii) of this section.     (D) Where a substitution unit and the Phase I unit designating the  substitution unit in an approved substitution plan have a common owner,  operator, or designated representative during a year, the plan shall  not be terminated under paragraphs (e)(3)(iv)(A), (B), or (C) of this  section with regard to the substitution unit if the year is as  specified in paragraph (e)(3)(iv)(D)(1) or (2) of this section and the  unit received from the Administrator for the year, under the Partial  Settlement in Environmental Defense Fund v. Carol M. Browner, No. 93- 1203 (D.C. Cir. 1993) (signed May 4, 1993), a total number of  allowances equal to the unit's baseline multiplied by the lesser of the  unit's 1985 actual SO<INF>2 emissions rate or 1985 allowable SO<INF>2  emissions rate.      (1) Except as provided in paragraph (e)(3)(iv)(D)(2) of this  section, paragraph (e)(3)(iv)(D) of this section shall apply to the  first year in Phase I for which the unit is and remains an active  substitution unit.      (2) If the unit has a Group 1 boiler under part 76 of this chapter  and is and remains an active substitution unit during 1995, paragraph  (e)(3)(iv)(D) of this section shall apply to 1995 and to the second  year in Phase I for which the unit is and remains an active  substitution unit.      (3) If there is a change in the owners, operators, or designated  representative of the substitution unit or the Phase I unit during a  year under paragraph (e)(3)(iv)(D)(1) or (2) of this section and, with  the change, the units do not have a common owner, operator, or  designated representative, then the designated representatives for such  units shall submit a notification to terminate the plan so that the  plan will terminate as of January 1 of the calendar year during which  the change is made. If the plan is not terminated in accordance with  the prior sentence, the Administrator, on his or her own motion, will  terminate the plan and deduct the allowances required to be surrendered  under paragraph (e)(3)(ii) of this section.

[[Page 53371]]  SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: This section provides additional information  by addressing the following questions:  What is being addressed in this document? What are the program changes that EPA proposes to approve? What is involved in this proposed action?  What Is Being Addressed in This Document?      As required under Subchapter V of the Clean Air Act (``the Act'')  as amended (1990), EPA has promulgated regulations which define the  minimum elements of an approvable state operating permits program and  the corresponding standards and procedures by which the EPA will  approve, oversee, or withdraw approval of the state programs (see 57 FR  32250 (July 21, 1992)). These regulations are codified at 40 Code of  Federal Regulations (CFR) part 70. Pursuant to Subchapter V of the Act,  generally known as Title V, and the implementing regulations, states  developed and submitted to EPA programs for issuing operating permits  to all major stationary sources and to certain other sources. Where a  program substantially, but not fully, met the requirements of part 70,  EPA granted the program interim approval. If EPA has not fully approved  a state's operating permit program by the expiration of its interim  approval period, EPA must establish and implement a federal program  under 40 CFR part 71 in that state.     EPA promulgated final interim approval of the Illinois Title V  program on March 7, 1995 (60 FR 12478), and the program became  effective on that date.     Illinois submitted amendments to its Title V program for approval  on May 31, 2001. Illinois intended the amendments to correct interim  approval issues identified in the March 7, 1995 interim approval  action.  What Are the Program Changes That EPA Proposes To Approve?  A. Title V Interim Approval Corrections      In the March 7, 1995 action, EPA identified four interim approval  issues. The following is a description of the issues and their  subsequent resolution. 1. Insignificant Activities     In the interim approval, the EPA discussed Illinois' regulations  relating to insignificant emissions units (IEUs). 40 CFR 70.5(c)  prohibits, in an application, omission of information needed to  determine the applicability of, or to impose, any applicable  requirements, or to evaluate the fee amount required under the schedule  approved pursuant to 40 CFR 70.9. The EPA found that section 201.208 of  the State's administrative code, 35 IAC 201.208, did not require  information on IEUs necessary to meet the requirements of 40 CFR  70.5(c). In addition, the EPA stated that Illinois must amend 35 IAC  201.210(b) to clarify that a source must specifically list in its  permit application the insignificant activities present at its facility  rather than rely solely on a general statement that denotes the  presence of IEUs.     EPA outlined in the final interim approval that, to obtain full  approval, the State must (1) require in section 201.208 that  applications include all necessary information on IEUs to determine the  applicability of or to impose any applicable requirements or fees and  (2) require in section 201.210(b) that sources specifically list the  insignificant activities present at their facilities.     With regard to the first issue, Illinois clarified in its May 31,  2001 submittal that 415 ILCS 5/39.5(5)(c) requires applicants to submit  ``all information, as requested in Agency application forms, sufficient  to evaluate the subject source and its application and to determine all  applicable requirements, pursuant to the Clean Air Act, and regulations  thereunder, this Act and regulations thereunder.'' Section 39.5(5)(g)  further provides that applicants must furnish additional information on  the request of the permitting authority. Finally, section 39.5(5)(i)  provides that applicants must submit supplementary information if the  initial submittal was incomplete or incorrect.     To further clarify that applicants must include in their  applications all information on IEUs necessary to determine  applicability of and compliance with specific applicable requirements,  Illinois will revise form 297-CAAPP to require information regarding  specific applicable requirements which apply to IEUs, and compliance of  the IEUs with those specific applicable requirements prior to receiving  full approval.     EPA addressed IEU issues in a July 10, 1995 document, ``White Paper  for the Streamlined Development of Part 70 Permit Applications'' (White  Paper), a guidance document clarifying Part 70 permit application  requirements. The White Paper provides that ``requirements can normally  be adequately addressed in the permit application with minimal or no  reference to any specific emissions unit or activity, provided that the  scope of the requirement and the manner of its enforcement are clear.''  White Paper, Section II.B.4. However, when an IEU is subject to a  specific applicable requirement, the applicant must list that IEU  individually, along with the specific applicable requirements and  associated monitoring requirements.     In light of these clarifications and Illinois' proper  implementation of this requirement, we have determined that the  Illinois rules and administrative code provide a sufficient basis to  require that permit applicants submit all necessary information  required by 40 CFR 70.5(c).     We also have determined that Illinois need not require sources to  include in their applications specific information on IEUs for purposes  of fee calculation. Illinois Administrative Code section 270.603(b)  states that, ``the amount of the fee shall be based on the allowable  emissions information submitted by the applicant in the fee calculation  portion of its CAAPP application, not including emissions of  insignificant levels or from insignificant activities, pursuant to 35  Ill. Adm. Code 201.''     In the second IEU issue identified in the final interim approval  notice, EPA stated that Illinois must require applicants to list  specifically in their permit applications insignificant units present  at their facilities. However, as noted above, since granting interim  approval EPA has issued guidance which clarifies that 40 CFR 70.5(c)  provides permitting authorities with the flexibility to tailor the  level of information on IEU's required in an application, as long as  the applications include sufficient information to meet the goals of 40  CFR 70.5(c). In particular, EPA stated that permitting authorities  could allow sources ``merely to list in the application the kinds of  insignificant activities that are present at the source or check them  off from a list of insignificant activities approved in the program.''  White Paper, section II.B.3. EPA also stated in ``White Paper Number 2  for Improved Implementation of the Part 70 Operating Permits Program,''  issued March 5, 1996 (White Paper #2), that permitting authorities may  allow applicants to group generically information on IEU's and to list  IEU groups without emissions estimates, unless emission estimates are  needed for another purpose such as determining the amount of permit  fees that are calculated using total source emissions. White Paper #2,  section II.C.2. This approach allows applicants to incorporate into  their applications standard permit conditions with minimal or no  reference to any specific emission unit or activity, provided that the  scope of the requirement and associated monitoring requirements are  [[Page 53372]]  clear. However, applicants must continue to include in their  applications information on IEUs which are exempt due to size or  production rate, in accordance with 40 CFR 70.5(c).     EPA believes that the clarifications made by Illinois and the White  Paper and White Paper #2 are sufficient to address this IEU interim  approval issue. 2. Administrative Amendments     In the final interim approval, EPA stated that the State must amend  415 ILCS 5/39.5(13)(c)(vi) to require the use of the significant  modification procedure to incorporate emission trades into a CAAPP  permit.     Illinois deleted this provision from its operating permit program  in House Bill 3373 that became effective on July 1, 2001. Illinois'  action corrects this interim approval issue because the permitting  authority is now required to determine the appropriate modification  mechanism consistent with Illinois' permit modification procedures and  40 CFR 70.7. 3. Enhanced NSR     In the March 7, 1995 interim approval notice, EPA noted that 415  ILCS 5/39.5(13)(c)(v) allowed incorporation of requirements from  preconstruction permits authorized under a federally approved  preconstruction permit program into a Title V permit through the  administrative amendment process provided for under the enhanced New  Source Review provision of 40 CFR 70.7(d)(1)(v). EPA commented that, to  use this provision, the State must develop and have approved into its  CAAPP program regulations which are substantially equivalent to the  procedural and compliance requirements of 40 CFR 70.7 and 70.8 that  would be applicable to the change if it were subject to review as a  permit modification, and compliance requirements substantially  equivalent to those contained in 40 CFR 70.6. EPA expressed concern  that, without these regulations, the public and EPA cannot track the  issuance and amendments of part 70 permits to ensure that the permits  contain all requirements. The public also needs assurance that a source  will not be able to avoid the requirements of the part 70 process  through a different permitting program such as preconstruction review.     EPA has determined that the existence of this provision in the  Illinois CAAPP program without regulations defining procedures  substantially equivalent to 40 CFR 70.6, 70.7 and 70.8 does not make  the program deficient. Illinois has not developed any regulations to  address this issue. Without the required procedures, the provision is  not usable. If the State ever intends to use this enhanced NSR  provision, it must (1) develop regulations outlining the exact  substantive, procedural and compliance requirements for incorporation  of preconstruction permits into part 70 permits, and (2) submit these  regulations to EPA for review and approval into the CAAPP program.  Until Illinois adopts the necessary ``substantially equivalent''  requirements, the State cannot use the enhanced NSR provision. To  assure that this provision is unused, the Illinois EPA will amend the  State's administrative amendment application form, 273-CAAPP, to delete  the category that enables a source to take advantage of incorporation  of a construction permit through administrative amendment procedures.  Also, the Illinois EPA will submit a letter to the EPA describing that  the Illinois EPA will not use this option until the proper procedures  are in place. Illinois must make the form changes and submit the letter  prior to receiving full approval. 4. Acid Rain     The final interim approval notice stated that for an eventual full  approval of the State's CAAPP, the State must incorporate by reference  the federal acid rain program into the State's its existing CAAPP  program. Illinois developed Senate Bill 0819, which became effective on  August 10, 1997, in part to provide that Subchapter IV-A of the Federal  Clean Air Act and regulations promulgated under the Act, concerning  sources of acid rain deposition, are enforceable under the Illinois  Environmental Protection Act. 415 ILCS 5/39.5(17)(a) now states that,  ``Title IV of the Clean Air Act and regulations promulgated thereunder,  including but not limited to 40 CFR Part 72, as now or hereafter  amended, are applicable to and enforceable under this Act.'' This  legislative change corrects this issue.  B. Other Title V Program Revisions      As discussed in detail below, EPA will address any uncorrected  deficiencies in a notice of deficiency which EPA will publish by  December 1, 2001.  What Is Involved in This Proposed Action?  A. Proposed Action      The EPA proposes full approval of the operating permits program  submitted by Illinois based on the revisions submitted on May 31, 2001.  EPA finds that Illinois has satisfactorily addressed the program  deficiencies identified in EPA's March 7, 1995 interim approval  rulemaking.  B. Citizen Comment Letter on Illinois Title V Program      On May 22, 2000, EPA promulgated a rulemaking that extended the  interim approval period of 86 operating permits programs until December  1, 2001. (65 FR 32035) The action was subsequently challenged by the  Sierra Club and the New York Public Interest Research Group (NYPIRG).  In settling the litigation, EPA agreed to publish a notice in the  Federal Register that would alert the public that they may identify and  bring to EPA's attention alleged programmatic and/or implementation  deficiencies in Title V programs and that EPA would respond to their  allegations within specified time periods if the comments were made  within 90 days of publication of the Federal Register notice.     Citizens commented on what they believe to be deficiencies with  respect to the Illinois Title V program. EPA takes no action on those  comments in today's action and will respond to them by December 1,  2001. As stated in the Federal Register notice published on December  11, 2000, (65 FR 77376), EPA will respond by December 1, 2001 to timely  public comments on programs that have obtained interim approval; and  EPA will respond by April 1, 2002 to timely comments on fully approved  programs. We will publish a notice of deficiency (NOD) when we  determine that a deficiency exists, or we will notify the commenter in  writing to explain our reasons for not making a finding of deficiency.  An NOD will not necessarily be limited to deficiencies identified by  citizens and may include any deficiencies that we have identified  through our program oversight.  Administrative Requirements      Under Executive Order 12866, ``Regulatory Planning and Review'' (58  FR 51735, October 4, 1993), this proposed action is not a ``significant  regulatory action'' and therefore is not subject to review by the  Office of Management and Budget. Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act  (5 U.S.C. 601, et seq.) the Administrator certifies that this proposed  rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial  number of small entities because it merely approves state law as  meeting federal requirements and imposes no additional requirements  beyond those imposed by state law. This rule does not contain any  unfunded mandates and does not significantly or uniquely affect small  governments, as  [[Page 53373]]  described in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (Public Law 104- 4) because it proposes to approve pre-existing requirements under state  law and does not impose any additional enforceable duties beyond that  required by state law. This rule also does not have tribal implications  because it will not have a substantial direct effect on one or more  Indian tribes, on the relationship between the Federal Government and  Indian tribes, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities  between the Federal Government and Indian tribes, as specified by  Executive Order 13175, ``Consultation and Coordination with Indian  Tribal Governments'' (65 FR 67249, November 9, 2000). This rule also  does not have federalism implications because it will not have  substantial direct effects on the states, on the relationship between  the national government and the states, or on the distribution of power  and responsibilities among the various levels of government, as  specified in Executive Order 13132, ``Federalism'' (64 FR 43255, August  10, 1999). The rule merely proposes to approve existing requirements  under state law, and does not alter the relationship or the  distribution of power and responsibilities between the state and the  Federal Government established in the Clean Air Act. This proposed rule  also is not subject to Executive Order 13045, ``Protection of Children  from Environmental Health Risks and Safety Risks'' (62 FR 19885, April  23, 1997) or Executive Order 13211, ``Actions Concerning Regulations  That Significantly Affect Energy Supply, Distribution, or Use'' (66 FR  28355 (May 22, 2001), because it is not a significantly regulatory  action under Executive Order 12866. This action will not impose any  collection of information subject to the provisions of the Paperwork  Reduction Act, 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq., other than those previously  approved and assigned OMB control number 2060-0243. For additional  information concerning these requirements, see 40 CFR part 70. An  agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required to  respond to, a collection of information unless it displays a currently  valid OMB control number.     Section 12(d) of the National Technology Transfer and Advancement  Act of 1995 (NTTA), 15 U.S.C. 272 note, requires federal agencies to  use technical standards that are developed or adopted by voluntary  consensus to carry out policy objectives, so long as such standards are  not inconsistent with applicable law or otherwise impracticable. In  reviewing SIP submissions, EPA's role is to approve state choices,  provided that they meet the criteria of the Act. Absent a prior  existing requirement for the state to use voluntary consensus  standards, EPA has no authority to disapprove a SIP submission for  failure to such standards, and it would thus be inconsistent with  applicable law for EPA to use voluntary consensus standards in place of  a SIP submission that otherwise satisfies the provisions of the Act.  Therefore, the requirements of section 12(d) of the NTTA do not apply.     As required by section 3 of Executive Order 12988 (61 FR 4729,  February 7, 1996), in issuing this proposed rule, EPA has taken the  necessary steps to eliminate drafting errors and ambiguity, minimize  potential litigation, and provide a clear legal standard for affected  conduct. EPA has complied with Executive Order 12630 (53 FR 8859, March  15, 1988) by examining the takings implications of the rule in  accordance with the ``Attorney General's Supplemental Guidelines for  the Evaluation of Risk and Avoidance of Unanticipated Takings' issued  under the executive order, and has determined that the rule's  requirements do not constitute a taking. This rule does not impose an  information collection burden under the provisions of the Paperwork  Reduction Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.).

ACTION: Proposed rule.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  SUMMARY: The Army Corps of Engineers proposes to establish programmatic  regulations for the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan. Congress  approved the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan in section 601  of the Water Resources Development Act of 2000, which was enacted into  law on December 11, 2000. The Act requires the Secretary of the Army to  promulgate programmatic regulations within two years to ensure that the  goals and purposes of the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan are  achieved. We have developed these proposed regulations in response to  that statutory requirement. The proposed regulations establish  processes and procedures that will guide the Army Corps of Engineers  and its partners in the implementation of the Comprehensive Everglades  Restoration Plan.  DATES: We will accept comments until October 1, 2002.  ADDRESSES: If you wish to comment on the proposed regulations, you may  submit your comments by any one of several methods:     1. You may submit written comments to U.S. Army Corps of Engineers,  ATTN: CESAJ-DR-R, P.O. Box 4970, Jacksonville, FL 32232-0019.     2.

You may also access the programmatic regulations web  page at:  http://www.evergladesplan.org/pm/progr_regs.shtml/ .    SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:  I. Background      Section 601(h)(3) of the Water Resources Development Act of 2000,  Public Law 106-541 (114 Stat. 2688) (hereinafter ``WRDA 2000'')  requires the Secretary of the Army, after notice and opportunity for  public comment, to promulgate regulations to ensure that the goals and  purposes of the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan (the Plan)  are achieved. These regulations implement this provision and establish  the administrative structure for carrying out the Plan. They establish  a process: for the development of Project Implementation Reports,  Project Cooperation Agreements, and Operating Manuals that will ensure  that the goals and the objectives of the Comprehensive Everglades  Restoration Plan (CERP) are achieved; to ensure that new information  resulting from changes or unforeseen circumstances, new scientific or  technical information or information that is developed through the  principles of adaptive management contained in the Plan, and future  authorized changes to the Plan will be integrated into the  implementation of the Plan; and to ensure the protection of the natural  system consistent with the goals and purposes of the Plan, including  the establishment of interim goals to provide a means by which the  restoration success of the plan will be evaluated throughout the  implementation process.     In general, the programmatic regulations envision that the goals  and purposes of the Plan will be achieved through the development of  project-specific and system-wide measures. Project specific measures  include but are not limited to project implementation reports, project  cooperation agreements, operating manuals, and design documentation  reports. The more generally applicable system-wide measures include,  but are not limited to, the development of guidance memoranda, system- wide performance measures, the Master Implementation Sequencing Plan,  interim goals, and targets for evaluating progress towards achieving  other water-related needs of the region, including water supply and  flood protection. The interim goals and targets for other water-related  needs are of special significance. They establish incremental targets  to evaluate progress toward the expected level of performance of the  Plan and are used to monitor overall progress toward meeting the goals  and purposes of the Plan. Taken together, the project specific and  system-wide measures form the foundation of the Plan and are critical  to the successful restoration of the South Florida ecosystem.     The South Florida ecosystem is a nationally and internationally  unique and important natural resource. It is also a resource in peril,  having been severely impacted by human activities for over a hundred  years. The Central and Southern Florida Project extends from south of  Orlando to the Florida Keys and is composed of a regional network of  canals, levees, water storage areas, and water control structures.  First authorized by Congress in 1948, the project serves multiple  purposes. The authorized purposes of the project include flood control,  regional water supply for agricultural and urban areas, prevention of  salt water intrusion, water supply to Everglades National Park,  preservation of fish and wildlife, recreation, and navigation. While  fulfilling these authorized purposes, the project has had unintended  adverse effects on the unique natural environment that constitutes the  Everglades and South Florida ecosystem. In 1996, the Army Corps of  Engineers was directed to develop a comprehensive plan to restore and  preserve south Florida's natural ecosystem, while enhancing water  supplies and maintaining flood protection. The resulting plan, which  was submitted to Congress on July 1, 1999, is called the Comprehensive  Everglades Restoration Plan.     The overarching goal of the Plan is the restoration, preservation,  and protection of the South Florida ecosystem while providing for other  water-related needs of the region such as flood protection and water  supply. The Plan contains 68 major components that involve creation of  approximately 217,000 acres of reservoirs and wetland-based water  treatment areas, wastewater reuse plants, seepage management, and  removal of levees and canals in natural areas. These components vastly  increase storage and water supply for the natural system, as well as  for urban and agricultural needs, while maintaining existing Central  and Southern Florida Project purposes. The Comprehensive Everglades  Restoration Plan will restore more natural flows of water, including  sheet flow; improve water quality; and establish more natural  hydroperiods in the South Florida ecosystem. Improvements to native  flora and fauna, including those that benefit threatened and endangered  species, are expected to occur as a result of the restoration of  hydrologic conditions.     In enacting section 601 of WRDA 2000, Congress approved the  Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan as a framework for  modifications to  [[Page 50541]]  the Central and Southern Florida Project. Section 601 of WRDA 2000  contains a variety of provisions associated with implementation of the  Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan, including an authorization  for the construction of four pilot projects and ten initial projects of  the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan.     Section 601(h) of WRDA 2000 states that ``the overarching objective  of the Plan is the restoration, preservation, and protection of the  South Florida ecosystem while providing for other water-related needs  of the region, including water supply and flood protection.'' This  subsection directs that the Plan be implemented to ensure the  protection of water quality in, the reduction of the loss of fresh  water from, and the improvement of the environment of the South Florida  Ecosystem. Implementation of the Plan also seeks to achieve and  maintain the benefits to the natural system and human environment  described in the Plan.     Section 601(h)(2) of WRDA 2000 requires the President and Governor  to enter into a binding agreement ensuring that the water generated by  the Plan will be made available to the natural system. The President  and Governor signed this agreement on January 9, 2002. The agreement  specifies that the State will ensure by regulation, or other  appropriate means, that water made available by each project of the  Plan will not be permitted for a consumptive use or otherwise made  unavailable by the State until such time as sufficient reservations of  water for restoration of the natural system are made under State law in  accordance with the Project Implementation Report for that project and  consistent with the Plan. This agreement also specifies that the State  will monitor and assess the continuing effectiveness of reservations as  long as the project is authorized to achieve the goals and objectives  of the Plan.     Section 601(h)(3) of WRDA 2000 requires that the Secretary of the  Army, after notice and opportunity for public comment, and with the  concurrence of the Governor of Florida and the Secretary of the  Interior, and consultation with the Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of  Florida, the Seminole Tribe of Florida, the Administrator of the  Environmental Protection Agency, the Secretary of Commerce, and other  Federal, State, and local agencies, issue programmatic regulations  within two years of the date of enactment of WRDA 2000 to ensure that  the goals and purposes of the Plan are achieved. The proposed  regulations are a specific response to the requirements of this  section.     Section 601(h)(4) of WRDA 2000 describes the project specific  assurance requirements for Project Implementation Reports, Project  Cooperation Agreements, and Operating Manuals. Finally, section  601(h)(5) contains a Savings Clause that provides protection for  existing legal sources of water that will be eliminated or transferred  due to project implementation and provides for maintenance of the level  of service for flood protection that is in existence on the date of  enactment and in accordance with applicable law.  II. Process for Developing the Proposed Regulations      The Army developed the proposed regulations through an open and  inclusive process that involved numerous meetings, briefings, and  discussions with other Federal, State, and local agencies; the  Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Florida and the Seminole Tribe of  Florida; agricultural, environmental, urban utilities, recreational,  and urban interest groups; and the public. Briefings on the  programmatic regulations were provided to the Governing Board of the  South Florida Water Management District and its Water Resources  Advisory Commission and the South Florida Ecosystem Restoration Task  Force and its Working Group. In addition, programmatic regulations web  pages were developed and posted on the Comprehensive Everglades  Restoration Plan web site ( http://www.evergladesplan.org ).   The web site was used to disseminate information about the programmatic regulations and to provide a place for individuals and organizations to submit comments electronically during the development of the programmatic  regulations. This was designed to identify the major concerns of the  agencies and various groups, prior to publishing the proposed  regulations and soliciting formal public comment.     The Army held an opening round of meetings with agencies, interest  groups, and the public in May and June 2001. The purpose of these  meetings was to discuss the process that would be used to develop the  programmatic regulations and to solicit comments on the major issues  and concerns that should be addressed in developing the regulations.     Following this initial round of meetings, we developed a draft  outline of the programmatic regulations. We then held a second round of  meetings in September and October 2001 with agencies, interest groups,  and the public to solicit comments on the draft outline. We also  consulted with the Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Florida and the  Seminole Tribe of Florida, and sought their comments on the outline.     After the second round of meetings, we developed an initial draft  of the programmatic regulations. We distributed this initial draft to  the public on December 28, 2001, and allowed for informal public  comment until February 15, 2002. We then held meetings with agencies,  tribes, and interest groups, to discuss the initial draft. We also  received written comments on the initial draft that we posted on the  programmatic regulations web site. In addition, the Water Resources  Advisory Commission formed a subcommittee on the programmatic  regulations. The subcommittee met several times to discuss issues  concerning the initial draft and potential solutions to these issues.  The South Florida Ecosystem Restoration Task Force also met several  times after the release of the initial draft to discuss the  programmatic regulations.     Finally, we developed the proposed regulations after considering  all of the information received at the meetings, as well as written  comments that were received from agencies, interest groups, and the  public.  III. Major Issues Addressed in Developing the Programmatic  Regulations  A. General      As discussed, we held numerous meetings with agencies, tribes,  interest groups, and the public. The initial draft regulations released  in December 2001 prompted a number of written comments by agencies,  tribes, interest groups, and the public. The major issues identified in  those comments and how we considered the comments in developing the  proposed rule are described in the following sections.  B. References to Senate Committee Report Language      A number of comments concerned referring to the Senate Environment  and Public Works Committee Report (Senate Report No. 106-362) in the  preamble to the proposed regulations. Some commenters believed that the  Senate Report sets forth guidance for implementing the Plan and  fulfilling the assurances provisions of section 601(h) of WRDA 2000.  Others expressed the opinion that Senate Committee Report 106-362  carries no legislative weight since the bill discussed in Senate  Committee Report 106-362 differs in several critical areas from the  final version of the bill adopted by the full United States Senate. We  have referred  [[Page 50542]]  to the Senate Report in the proposed regulations, like any other part  of the history of the Plan, where we believe it may be helpful to  understanding the statute or the issues involved in interpreting or  implementing the statute.  C. Defining Restoration      Many comments concerned the value of defining restoration in the  regulation. Some commenters expressed the view that a definition is  needed in order to better define what is meant by the phrase  ``restoration, preservation, and protection of the South Florida  ecosystem'' used in section 601 of WRDA 2000.     Some commenters maintained that the Plan is only a framework and  that Congress expected the implementing agencies to propose  improvements to the Plan's goal of restoration through a regular  process of adaptive management. These commenters believed that a  comprehensive definition of restoration, including environmental and  ecological recovery of the natural system, is needed to guide the  process.     While recognizing the theoretical merits of these views, other  commenters felt that this concept of restoration was too open-ended.  These commenters believed that Congress adopted a specific framework  for restoration in enacting WRDA 2000 and that framework was set forth  in the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan. They maintained that  the restoration authorized by this Plan, while extensive, does not  envision restoring the Everglades to its natural condition before the  intervention of humans.     For the purposes of this regulation, we have adopted a middle  ground between these two perspectives. We have defined the term  ``restoration'' to mean the level of recovery and protection described  in the plan that was approved by Congress in enacting WRDA 2000 as a  framework for hydrologic restoration, and any future Congressional  amendments to that framework. However, we have also highlighted in the  definition that the Plan is designed to deliver water to and improve  water quality in the natural system so that it once again exhibits and  sustains essential physical and ecological characteristics that defined  the pre-drainage South Florida ecosystem, including more natural  hydropatterns, and that these hydrological modifications are a  precursor to improvements to native flora and fauna, restoration of key  habitats, and promotion of a pattern of plant communities that form a  gradient from aquatic communities to uplands. Our proposed definition  also envisions using the principles of adaptive management to seek  continuous improvement of the Plan based upon new information resulting  from changed or unforeseen circumstances, new scientific or technical  information, or information developed through the adaptive assessment  principles contained in the Plan, or future authorized changes to the  Plan that are integrated into the implementation of the Plan.     In adopting this definition, we recognize that the Plan envisions  the recovery and maintenance of certain important ecological components  and patterns that are thought to have characterized the natural system.  Achievement of these attributes is expected to result in the overall  improvement of the environment of the South Florida ecosystem,  including improvements to native flora and fauna, including threatened  and endangered species; restoring the presence of key species in  historic habitats; promoting a pattern of plant communities that form a  gradient from aquatic communities to uplands; and providing habitat  within the Everglades natural system to the species that inhabit the  Everglades. These improvements are accomplished generally by increasing  water storage and water supply for the Everglades natural system;  restoring more natural flows of water, including sheet flow;  establishing more natural hydroperiods, including wet and dry season  cycles, natural recession rates, surface water depth patterns, and, in  coastal areas, salinity and mixing patterns; and protecting water  quality for the Everglades natural system as described in the Plan.     It is important to understand that the ``restored'' Everglades of  the future will be different from any version of the Everglades that  has existed in the past. While it will be significantly healthier than  the current system, it will not completely match the pre-drainage  system. The irreversible physical changes made to the ecosystem make a  complete match impossible. The restored Everglades will be smaller and  somewhat differently arranged than the historic ecosystem. However, it  will have recovered those essential hydrological and biological  characteristics that defined the original Everglades and made it unique  among the world's wetlands systems. It will evoke the wildness and  richness of the former Everglades.  D. Partnership With the State of Florida and With Others      Implementation of the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan  will require an effective partnership between the Federal and State  governments. The State of Florida has established a trust fund, the  Save Our Everglades Trust Fund, to pay for a significant portion of the  non-Federal sponsor's share of implementation of the Plan and the South  Florida Water Management District will serve as the non-Federal sponsor  for implementing many of the projects of the Plan. Section 601 of WRDA  2000 recognizes the importance of this constructive relationship and  further encourages this partnership.     The proposed regulations promote the implementation of the  Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan by defining the processes and  procedures needed to accomplish the necessary planning, design,  construction, and operation of the projects authorized pursuant to the  Plan. In addition, the proposed regulations establish a process of  adaptive management where completed projects are monitored and assessed  and changes to the Plan, its operations, or the schedule and sequence  of projects are considered as appropriate to ensure that the goals and  purposes of the Plan are achieved. The processes and requirements  included in the proposed regulations also were developed to take into  account the interests of the South Florida Water Management District,  the State of Florida, or other non-Federal sponsors as the Plan is  implemented. The proposed regulations also recognize that the non- Federal sponsor for some projects of the Plan will be governmental  entities other than the South Florida Water Management District.  E. Consultation      The implementation of the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan  is the responsibility of the Corps of Engineers and the non-Federal  sponsor; however, successful implementation of the Comprehensive  Everglades Restoration Plan requires not just the involvement of the  implementing agencies, but also extensive involvement by other Federal,  State, local agencies, and the Tribes. The proposed regulations  envision that the implementing agencies will consult with the  Department of the Interior, the Environmental Protection Agency, the  Department of Commerce, the Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Florida, the  Seminole Tribe of Florida, the Florida Department of Environmental  Protection, and other Federal, State, and  [[Page 50543]]  local agencies as part of the planning and implementation process. The  consultation provisions ensure that these interested parties are  appropriately involved with the Corps of Engineers and the non-Federal  sponsor in implementing, evaluating, and adapting the Plan.     The consultation provisions contemplate a timely exchange of views  between parties. In other words, consultation is not to be used as a de  facto veto power. Similar to the considerations for setting time limits  for consulting under NEPA (40 CFR 1501.8), the regulations envision  that the Corps of Engineers and the South Florida Water Management  District may set reasonable limits on the amount of time for  consultation, giving due consideration to the size of the proposed  action, the degree to which relevant information is known or  obtainable, the degree to which the action is controversial, the state  of the art of analytical techniques, the number of persons affected,  the consequences of delay, and other time limits imposed on the agency  by law, regulations, or executive order.  F. Amount of Detail in the Proposed Regulations      Many comments addressed the degree of detail in the regulations.  Some believed that the programmatic regulations should be very  detailed, specific, and prescriptive. Others believed that the  programmatic regulations should be more general. Some commenters also  expressed concern that the Federal regulations not infringe on the  sovereignty of the State of Florida or its right to allocate its water  resources. Others sought to ensure that the regulations safeguard the  Federal interest and investment in restoration, preservation, and  protection of the South Florida ecosystem, including Federal properties  such as national parks and wildlife refuges.     The proposed regulations attempt to address these concerns and  provide guidance in implementing the Plan. We recognize that more  detailed guidance memoranda will be needed to assist the implementation  of the Plan. We have determined that the guidance memoranda should not  be included in the programmatic regulations because they will be very  technical, and are intended to provide internal guidance to the  implementing agencies, and also because they still are in development.  This decision is consistent with the view of some who felt that  including the guidance memoranda in the regulations was incompatible  with rule-making procedures because of the changing nature of the  adaptive management process. These commenters were concerned that if  guidance memoranda were included in these regulations, every revision  to them would require us to initiate a rulemaking process. We expect  that revisions may occur frequently for some of these procedures,  particularly during the early stages of implementation of the Plan.     The programmatic regulations contemplate that the guidance  memoranda be developed six months after the effective date of the final  rule published in the Federal Register or December 31, 2003, whichever  is sooner, with the concurrence of the Secretary of the Interior and  the Governor. Even though we are not including the guidance memoranda  in the regulations, we believe that the public should have an  opportunity to review and comment on them in view of its interest in  these matters. Accordingly, the programmatic regulations envision that  we will provide a notice of availability of the guidance memoranda in  the Federal Register and seek public comments before they are  completed. After they are completed, the Corps of Engineers will  consider during the next review and revision of the programmatic  regulations, whether or not a particular guidance memorandum that has  been completed, is appropriate for inclusion in the regulations.  G. Restoration Coordination and Verification (RECOVER)      Many comments focused on the role of RECOVER in implementing the  Plan. Some of the commenters expressed concerns about how best to  integrate individual projects into the Plan to ensure that the goals  and purposes of the Plan are achieved. Others articulated concerns  about the need to use the best scientific information available.  Finally, some urged that RECOVER also focus on achieving the other  water-related needs provided for in the Plan such as water supply and  flood protection, along with restoration benefits.     RECOVER is an interdisciplinary, interagency scientific and  technical team that is described in the Plan. The proposed regulations  recognize that the Restoration Coordination and Verification (RECOVER)  team already is in place and envision using RECOVER to ensure that a  system-wide perspective is applied and that the best available  scientific and technical information will be used during the  implementation, evaluation, and adaptation of the Plan. The Corps of  Engineers and the South Florida Water Management District will oversee  the activities of RECOVER. The regulations also recognize the key role  of the Department of the Interior in RECOVER because of its extensive  experience in managing the Everglades National Park, and provide an  important role for the Department in the Leadership Group of RECOVER,  along with the Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Florida, the Seminole  Tribe of Indians, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the Florida  Department of Environmental Protection, and other Federal, State and  local agencies as appropriate. While RECOVER is not a policy making  body, the regulations outline a series of specific scientific and  technical responsibilities for RECOVER that will assist the  implementing agencies (the Corps of Engineers and the South Florida  Water Management District) in achieving the goals and purposes of the  Plan, particularly restoration of the natural system.     RECOVER will be responsible for, among other things, developing  system-wide performance measures for consideration by the Corps of  Engineers and South Florida Water Management District, in evaluating  projects in achieving the system-wide goals and purposes of the Plan,  preparing Project Implementation Reports, developing and recommending  proposals for a system-wide monitoring plan, conducting assessment  activities for the adaptive management program, considering proposed  revisions to the Plan, and developing recommendations for interim  goals. The proposed regulations memorialize many of the activities  already underway by RECOVER. The proposed regulations make it clear  that RECOVER is a scientific and technical team. Documents prepared by  RECOVER are not self-executing and must be reviewed, discussed,  revised, and/or approved by responsible management officials of the  Corps of Engineers and the South Florida Water Management District, in  consultation with the Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Florida, the  Seminole Tribe of Indians, the U.S. Department of the Interior, the  U.S. Department of Commerce, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the  Florida Department of Environmental Protection, and other Federal,  State and local agencies as appropriate prior to implementation of  management responses based on the results and findings contained  therein.  H. Independent Scientific Review      Some commenters emphasized the need to maintain the system-wide  focus of the Plan during implementation and felt that a mechanism must  be developed to ensure that the best and  [[Page 50544]]  most current scientific information be used throughout implementation.  Other commenters also expressed the view that an independent entity  should be responsible for reviewing the science used to support the  implementation of the Plan. The regulations recognize that, as required  by Section 601(j) of WRDA 2000, an independent scientific review panel  should be established. The proposed regulations do not establish this  panel, but provide for its establishment. The regulations include  provisions for cooperating with the panel, considering the panel's  advice, and responding to the panel's recommendations.  I. Project Implementation Reports      Section 601 of WRDA 2000 establishes a new type of reporting  document called a Project Implementation Report to bridge the gap  between the conceptual level of detail in the Comprehensive Everglades  Restoration Plan and the detail needed for project design. Section  601(h)(4)(A) of WRDA 2000 specifies a number of items required to be in  a Project Implementation Report, including identification of the  appropriate quantity, timing, and distribution of water dedicated and  managed for the natural system, and the identification of the amount of  water to be reserved or allocated for the natural system.     Some comments focused on the need to create a clearly defined  process for the development of Project Implementation Reports, and, in  particular, the formulation and evaluation of individual projects of  the Plan. The report of the Senate Committee on Environment and Public  Works on the Water Resources Development Act of 2000 (Senate Report No.  106-362) defines Project Implementation Reports as follows:      The project implementation report is a new type of reporting  document, similar to a General Reevaluation Report in that it will  contain additional project formulation and evaluation. The project  implementation report also will contain General Design Memorandum  level of detail, or higher, for engineering and design. Some of the  tasks associated with the preparation of the project implementation  report will include: surveys and mapping; geotechnical analyses;  flood damage assessment; real estate analyses; and preparation of  supplemental National Environmental Policy Act documents. The  project implementation reports will bridge the gap between the  programmatic-level design contained in the Plan and the detailed  design necessary to proceed to construction. Furthermore, each  project implementation report will be accompanied by a Project  Management Plan, which will detail schedules, funding requirements,  and resource needs for final design and construction of the project.      The proposed regulations provide guidance for the development of  Project Implementation Reports. They describe the requirements of a  Project Implementation Report, including providing information required  by the State of Florida for the participation of the non-Federal  sponsor in the implementation of various components of the Plan. These  requirements are set forth in Florida Statutes sections 373.1501 and  373.470, which specify the information that must be available before  State agencies can participate in implementation of CERP projects. The  proposed regulations contemplate that the Project Implementation Report  will contain performance evaluations of alternatives in achieving the  system-wide goals and purposes of the Plan, interim goals, and targets  for progress toward other water-related needs. The Project  Implementation Report also will include evaluations designed to ensure,  to the extent practicable and consistent with the system-wide goals and  purposes of the Plan, that the project delivers benefits, including  benefits to the natural system, that would justify the project, in the  context of the then existing Central and Southern Florida Project as  modified by any CERP components that have already been implemented. The  regulations also envision the development of a guidance memorandum that  describes the major tasks necessary to develop a Project Implementation  Report and an outline for the content of the Project Implementation  Report. Finally, the regulations provide for development of a guidance  memorandum establishing procedures for the formulation and evaluation  of projects.  J. Project Cooperation Agreements      The Project Cooperation Agreement is the legal agreement between  the Department of the Army and the non-Federal sponsor that must be  executed before a project can be constructed. Section 601(h) of WRDA  2000 requires that the Secretary not execute a Project Cooperation  Agreement until the State has reserved or allocated water for the  natural system under State law as described in the Project  Implementation Report. Some commenters questioned how the reservation  or allocation would be made in accordance with the Project  Implementation Report and how the Project Cooperation Agreement would  verify this allocation of reservation had, in fact, been made. These  commenters recommended that a guidance memorandum be developed to  outline how the verification would occur. Others commenters were  concerned that the Federal government not infringe on the State's  authority under state law to make and revise reservations as necessary.     We agree that a guidance memorandum should be developed that  outlines how Project Implementation Reports will identify how the  appropriate quantity, timing and distribution of water dedicated and  managed for the natural system will be determined, and how they will  identify the amount of water that is to be reserved or allocated for  the natural system in accordance with the provisions of WRDA 2000. The  proposed regulations state that the Project Cooperation Agreement must  include a finding that the reservation or allocation has been made by  the State as required by Section 601(h) of WRDA 2000. This will provide  the assurances regarding the reservation and Project Implementation  Report that Congress intended without infringing on the State's right  to reserve or allocate water under State law. In addition, the  regulations further specify that the Project Cooperation Agreement  (PCA) include a provision that any change to the reservation or  allocation of water for the natural system made under State law shall  require an amendment to the PCA. Further, the Secretary shall verify,  in consultation with the South Florida Water Management District, the  Florida Department of Environmental Protection, the Environmental  Protection Agency, the Department of Commerce, the Seminole Tribe of  Florida, the Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Florida, and other Federal,  State, and local agencies that the revised reservation or allocation  continues to provide for an appropriate quantity, timing and  distribution of water dedicated and managed for the natural system  after considering any changed circumstances or information since  completion of the Project Implementation Report. Finally, the proposed  regulations recognize that the Project Cooperation Agreement must  include several provisions required by the savings clause of Section  601(h)(5) of WRDA 2000. Accordingly, the Project Cooperation Agreement  includes a provision that prohibits the Corps of Engineers and the non- Federal sponsor from eliminating or transferring existing legal sources  of water until a new source of comparable quantity and quality is  available as that available on the date of enactment of WRDA 2000.  Similarly, in satisfaction of the savings clause requirements, the  regulations specify  [[Page 50545]]  that a Project Cooperation Agreement must include a provision that  existing levels of service for flood protection: (1) On the date of  enactment of WRDA 2000; and (2) in accordance with applicable law, not  be reduced.  K. Operating Manuals      Operating Manuals provide guidance on how projects are to be  operated to ensure that the goals and purposes of the Plan are  achieved. To achieve the goals and purposes of the Plan, individual  projects must be operated as part of a system. Some commenters sought  to ensure that Operating Manuals prepared for individual projects take  into account the system-wide purposes of the Plan. Accordingly, the  proposed regulations envision the development of two kinds of Operating  Manuals. In addition to Project Operating Manuals, a System Operating  Manual will be developed to provide a system-wide plan for operating  projects and other C&SF Project features to ensure that individual  facilities are linked together in a system-wide framework.     The regulations view Project Operating Manuals as supplements to  the System Operating Manual, presenting aspects of the project not  common to the system. The proposed regulations contemplate that a  Project Operating Manual will be developed for each project. A draft  Project Operating Manual will be included as an appendix in the Project  Implementation Report. This will connect the operation of the project  to the expected benefits of the project recommended in the Project  Implementation Report. The final Project Operating Manual is to be  prepared as soon as possible after completion of the operational  testing and monitoring phase of the project.  L. Sequencing and Scheduling of Projects      The Plan consists of 68 components that will be implemented as  approximately 45 separate projects, including pilot projects. The  ``Final Integrated Feasibility Report and Programmatic Environmental  Impact Statement'' dated April 1, 1999, included a sequence and  schedule for implementation of the Plan. In July 2001, the Corps of  Engineers and the South Florida Water Management District updated the  sequence and schedule to incorporate updated information and  requirements from Congress and the Florida legislature. The sequence  and schedule of projects was the subject of many comments. Some  commenters sought to ensure that the sequencing and schedule of  projects would produce restoration benefits early in the implementation  process. Others were apprehensive of this early focus on restoration  benefits and were concerned that other water-related needs of the  region as provided for in the Plan would be postponed until late in the  implementation process. The proposed regulations establish a process  for developing a Master Implementation Sequencing Plan and specify that  projects will be sequenced and scheduled to maximize the achievement of  the goals and purposes of the Plan, including the achievement of the  interim goals at the earliest possible time, to the extent practical  given scientific, technical, funding, contracting, and other  constraints. The Master Implementation Sequencing Plan will also  provide for sequencing and scheduling of projects to ensure, to the  extent practicable and consistent with the system-wide goals of the  Plan, that each project delivers benefits, including benefits to the  natural system, that would justify the project, in the context of the  then existing Central and Southern Florida Project as modified by any  CERP components that have already been implemented. The Master  Implementation Sequencing Plan will base the sequence and schedule of  projects on the best scientific, technical, funding, contracting, and  other information available.     The proposed regulations also envision that the Master  Implementation Sequencing Plan will be revised as necessary to  integrate new information such as updated schedules from Project  Management Plans, the results of pilot projects and other studies,  updated funding information, revisions to the Plan, Congressional or  other authorization and direction, or information from the adaptive  management program, including achievement of the expected performance  level of the Plan and the interim goals.  M. Adaptive Management Program      One of the key components of the Plan is adaptive management.  Adaptive management provides the opportunity to improve the design and  performance of the Plan based on new information. The report of the  Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works on WRDA 2000 (Senate  Report No. 106-362) describes the intent of the adaptive management  program:      The committee does not expect rigid adherence to the Plan as it  was submitted to Congress. This result would be inconsistent with  the adaptive management principles in the Plan. Restoration of the  Everglades is the goal, not adherence to the modeling on which the  April, 1999 Plan was based. Instead, the committee expects that the  agencies responsible for project implementation report formulation  and Plan implementation will seek continuous improvement of the Plan  based upon new information, improved modeling, new technology and  changed circumstances.      The regulations define adaptive management as the process of  improving the understanding of the natural and human systems in the  South Florida ecosystem, specifically as these understandings pertain  to the goals and purposes of the Plan, and to ensure continuous  improvement of the Plan reflective of new information resulting from  changed or unforeseen circumstances, new scientific or technical  information, or information developed through the adaptive assessment  principles contained in the Plan, or future authorized changes to the  Plan. The opportunity for performance improvement offered by the  adaptive management program is crucial for dealing with the  uncertainties of the ecological responses that will occur as the Plan  is implemented. The proposed regulations establish an adaptive  management program to guide implementation of the Plan and recognize  the importance of assessment reports to this process.     The proposed regulations specify that the implementing agencies  will use assessment reports to seek continuous improvement in the Plan.  The proposed regulations provide that in considering how the Plan may  be improved, the Corps of Engineers and non-Federal project sponsor  specifically consider modifying the design or operational plan for a  project of the Plan not yet implemented; modifying the sequence or  schedule for implementation of the Plan; adding new components to the  Plan or deleting components not yet implemented; removing or modifying  a component of the Plan already in place; or a combination of any of  these actions. RECOVER will be responsible for carrying out these  assessment tasks and submitting them to the Corps and the South Florida  Water Management District for review.  N. Revisions to the Plan      We anticipate that the Plan will need to be revised periodically as  part of the adaptive management program to reflect new information and  to improve performance. The proposed regulations provide that a  Comprehensive Plan Modification Report be prepared whenever significant  revisions to the Plan are necessary to ensure that the goals and  purposes of the Plan are achieved. The Comprehensive Plan Modification  Report will be prepared  [[Page 50546]]  using a process consistent with the processes used to develop a Project  Implementation Report. The proposed regulations provide that the final  approved Comprehensive Plan Modification Report will be transmitted to  Congress.  O. Ensuring Achievement of Plan Benefits      The Plan will improve the quantity, quality, timing, and  distribution of water to the South Florida ecosystem. Section 601(f) of  WRDA 2000 specifies that the Secretary in coordination with the non- Federal sponsor prepare Project Implementation Reports prior to  implementation of those projects. Section 601(h)(4)(A) of WRDA 2000  specifies a number of items required to be in a Project Implementation  Report, including identification of the appropriate quantity, timing,  and distribution of water dedicated and managed for the natural system,  and the identification of the amount of water to be reserved or  allocated for the natural system. The reservation or allocation of  water for the natural system will be implemented under State law and  must be made before the Army can execute a Project Cooperation  Agreement for the project. ``State law'' includes reservations or  allocations of water made by Florida's Water Management Districts under  authority of State law.     A number of commenters expressed the view that the Plan required  that water be reserved for the natural system on an 80%-20% basis.  These commenters rely on the report of the Senate Committee on  Environment and Public Works on WRDA 2000 (Senate Report No. 106-362)  that states:      The Plan contains a general outline of the quantities of water  to be produced by each project. According to the Army Corps, 80  percent of the water generated by the Plan is needed for the natural  system in order to attain restoration goals, and 20 percent of the  water generated for use in the human environment. * * * Subject to  future authorizations by Congress, the committee fully expects that  the water necessary for restoration, currently estimated at 80  percent of the water generated by the Plan, will be reserved or  allocated for the benefit of the natural system (Emphasis added).      Although those percentages were appropriate as an initial estimate  for the purpose of evaluating the Plan, the regulations anticipate that  each Project Implementation Report will evaluate and identify water to  be reserved for the natural system and made available for other water- related needs of the region, and that the Plan itself will be  continually evaluated through adaptive management. Accordingly, the  water actually allocated to meet the needs of the natural system and  the water allocated under the Savings Clause may be greater or less  than the initial Plan estimate. Therefore, the regulations do not  contemplate that water will be strictly allocated on an 80%-20% basis,  either system-wide or on a project-by-project basis.     Many commenters questioned how water would be reserved or allocated  for the natural system. These questions focused on how the statutorily- required identification of water reservations and allocations for the  natural system in each Project Implementation Report, would be  coordinated with the actual reservation or allocation process which is  conducted under State law.     Developing the pre-CERP baseline is of central importance to  ensuring attainment of the benefits of the Plan and to resolving this  issue. This baseline represents the conditions in the region on the  date of enactment of WRDA 2000 accounting for natural variations and  including existing legal sources of water. The baseline will establish  the amount of water that is presently delivered by the Central and  Southern Florida Project. The proposed regulations provide that the  pre-CERP baseline will be established by June 30, 2003. The proposed  regulations also provide that each Project Implementation Report will  consider the change of pre-CERP baseline water availability in  identifying the quantity, timing, and distribution of water to be made  available for the natural system by a project component; whether  improvements in water quality are needed in order to ensure that water  delivered to the natural system meets applicable water quality  standards; whether additional quantity, timing, and distribution of  water and/or improved water quality should be made available by  subsequent projects; whether to recommend preparation of a  Comprehensive Plan Modification Report; and whether to recommend that  the State of Florida and its agencies re-examine the reservation or  allocation of water needed under State law in order to meet the needs  of the natural system and such uses identified under the savings  clause.     The Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan was developed as an  integrated set of components or projects that are intended to work  together to successfully achieve the goals and purposes of the Plan.  Although individual projects increase the amount of water available,  the effect of an individual project extends far beyond the location of  the project. Accordingly, it is important that the identification of  water to be reserved for the natural system take into account the  synergistic and regional effect of projects. The proposed regulations  contemplate that a guidance memorandum will be developed to provide  uniform guidance for quantifying water made available by projects and  for identifying the water to be reserved for the natural system. The  proposed regulations also provide direction for the development of the  guidance memorandum.     Some agencies, interest groups, and the public were concerned about  potential variations from the predicted availability of water once  projects actually are implemented and operated. The proposed  regulations provide that development of a Comprehensive Plan  Modification Report be undertaken to determine the need for revisions  to the Plan. The regulations also provide that in the interim during  preparation of the Comprehensive Plan Modification Report, operation of  the project should be consistent with the procedures identified in the  Project Implementation Report and Project Operating Manual.  P. Savings Clause Provisions      Many commenters questioned the effects of implementation of the  Plan on existing legal sources of water and on existing levels of flood  protection. As discussed, Section 601(h)(5)(A) of WRDA 2000 contains a  savings clause provision that is designed to ensure that existing  sources of water and levels of flood protection are preserved. The  report of the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works on WRDA  2000 (Senate Report No. 106-362) describes the intent of this savings  clause as follows:      Elimination of existing sources of water supply is barred until  new sources of comparable quantity and quality of water are  available; existing authorized levels of flood protection are  maintained; and the water compact among the Seminole Tribe of  Florida, the State, and the South Florida Water Management District  is specifically preserved. With respect to flood control, the  committee intends that implementation of the Plan will not result in  significant adverse impact to any person with an existing, legally  recognized right to a level of protection against flooding. The  committee does not intend that, consistent with benefits included in  the Plan, this bill create any new rights to a level of protection  against flooding that is not currently recognized under applicable  Federal or State law.      Although the savings clause uses the term ``existing legal sources  of water,'' it does not define the term. Nor could we find a definition  elsewhere in Federal or State law. We have not defined the term in the  proposed regulations, leaving the definition of an ``existing legal  source''  [[Page 50547]]  of water to be determined on a case-by-case basis after consideration  of all relevant facts. We may include a definition after considering  submitted comments. Currently, the proposed regulations specify that  the Project Implementation Report will include an analysis to determine  if the project will cause an elimination or transfer of existing legal  sources of water. If the project will cause an elimination or transfer  of a source of water, then the Project Implementation report will  include measures to ensure that such elimination or transfer will not  take place until a new source of water of comparable quantity or  quality is available to replace the water that would be lost as a  result of implementation of the Plan. Existing legal sources of water  may include water currently available for agriculture, water supply,  tribal use, or elements of the natural system including the Everglades,  as well as any other existing legal sources.     The proposed regulations require a Project Implementation Report to  include an analysis of the level of service for flood protection that  was in existence on the date of enactment of the statute; and is in  accordance with applicable law. If this analysis shows that the level  of service for flood protection would be reduced by implementation of a  project, then the regulations state that the project or its  implementation plan will be modified to mitigate or eliminate the  adverse effect on flood protection.     Some commenters raised the question of how the Plan would address  opportunities for increased levels of flood protection or the provision  of flood protection in locations where there currently is no flood  protection. The overarching objective of the Plan is the restoration,  preservation, and protection of the South Florida ecosystem while  providing for other water-related needs of the region, including water  supply and flood protection. Accordingly, the proposed regulations  allow for the evaluation of increased levels of flood protection or the  provision of flood protection in areas where there is currently no  flood protection, provided that such flood protection is consistent  with the goals and purposes of the Plan and is in accordance with the  provisions of section 601(f)(2)(B) of WRDA 2000 and other applicable  laws.  Q. Interim Goals      Many comments focused on development of the interim goals. Section  601(h)(3)(c)(i)(III) of WRDA 2000 requires that interim goals be  established to provide a means by which the restoration success of the  Plan may be evaluated throughout the restoration process. Progress  towards meeting the interim goals is to be reported to Congress as part  of the periodic reports required by the Act. While there was widespread  agreement among agencies, tribes, interest groups, and the public that  interim goals should be established to ensure that the goals and  purposes of the Plan are achieved, there were different views about  whether these interim goals should be a part of the programmatic  regulations. Some believed that the interim goals needed to be a part  of the programmatic regulations to ensure that the goals would be met.  They also believed that goals had to be incorporated into the  regulations to enable the public to take part in the process of  establishing the goals. Others were concerned that the statute  specifically required the regulations to set up the process for  establishing interim goals rather than the goals themselves. Additional  commenters were concerned that placing the interim goals in the  programmatic regulations would make goals difficult to adopt and amend,  and that the adaptive management process authorized by section 601 of  WRDA 2000 was incompatible with the Administrative Procedures Act rule- making process. Other commenters were concerned that incorporating the  goals into the regulations would suggest that the goals were meant to  set standards or schedules enforceable in court rather than planning  targets, and assessment and reporting tools.     In addition, during development of the proposed regulations, it was  apparent that there was not complete agreement on exactly what the  interim goals should be. Staff of the implementing agencies required  additional time to model the implementation schedule to evaluate  expected performance at specific points in the implementation process.  This modeling is an important first step in developing incremental  stages (interim goals) for achieving that performance. Moreover, the  South Florida Ecosystem Restoration Task Force and others indicated an  interest in reviewing and discussing interim goals before they were  adopted. Thus, even among those who thought that interim goals should  be included in these regulations, it was clear that more time for  modeling was needed.     The proposed regulations recognize these facts and attempt to  accommodate the views of commenters by establishing the principles that  will guide the development of the interim goals and appropriately  involve the public. The proposed regulations establish the structure  for developing and adopting the interim goals, and make it clear that  interim goals are targets for use of the agencies and Congress in  evaluating the success of the restoration effort. They are not intended  to be standards or schedules enforceable in court.     The Restoration Coordination and Verification (RECOVER) team will  use the principles set forth in the proposed regulations to develop and  recommend a set of interim goals for implementation of the Plan no  later than June 30, 2003. The regulations specify that interim goals  shall reflect the incremental accomplishment of the expected  performance level of the Plan, and will identify improvements in  quantity, timing and distribution of water in five-year increments  beginning in 2005. The interim goals will also include indicators for  water quality improvement and ecological responses, such as increases  in extent of wetlands, improvements in habitat quality, and  improvements in native plant and animal abundance. However, the  regulations also recognize that achievement of improvements in water  quality and desired ecological responses may be dependent on other  programs and activities outside the scope of CERP. The extent of this  dependence on outside programs and activities should be explicitly  assessed and described at the time goals are developed, and should be  taken into account as the CERP is subsequently evaluated relative to  the goals. The interim goals shall be predicted by appropriate models  and tools and shall provide a quantitative basis for evaluating the  restoration success of the Plan during the period of implementation.  The expected level of the Plan is generally represented by the output  of the model run of D-13R as described in the ``Final Integrated  Feasibility Report and Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement''  dated April 1, 1999, as modified by section 601 of WRDA 2000, or any  subsequent modification authorized in law.     The proposed regulations envision that RECOVER will provide its  recommendations to the Corps of Engineers and South Florida Water  Management District for review and discussion. Interim goals will be  memorialized in an agreement to be signed by the Department of the  Army, the Department of the Interior, and the State no later than  December 31, 2003. The Department of the Army, the Department of the  Interior, and the State will provide a notice of availability of the  proposed agreement to the public in the Federal Register, seek public  [[Page 50548]]  comments, and consult with Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Florida, the  Seminole Tribe of Florida, the Environmental Protection Agency, the  Department of Commerce, the Florida Department of Environmental  Protection, and other Federal, State, and local agencies and the South  Florida Ecosystem Restoration Task Force concerning the proposed  interim goals. Finally, the proposed regulations establish a process  for revising the interim goals in five-year increments or sooner, if  appropriate in light of new information.     Finally, some commenters believed that the interim goals should  take into account other water-related needs of the region, including  water supply and flood protection, as provided for in the Plan. Other  commenters believed that the interim goals should not evaluate other  water-related needs of the region. We felt that the interim goals  should focus solely on restoration success because section  601(h)(3)(c)(i)(III) of WRDA 2000 specifies that the interim goals are  to provide a means by which restoration success may be evaluated  throughout the implementation process. The proposed regulations reflect  this view. However, the statute recognizes that providing for other  water-related needs of the region, including water supply and flood  protection, are also objectives of the Plan. Therefore, the proposed  regulations also provide for separately monitoring progress on other  water-related needs of the region as provided for in the Plan during  the implementation process, thus ensuring that all of the goals and  purposes of the Plan will be achieved.  R. Relationship Among Restoration, Performance Measures, and Interim  Goals      In order to comprehend how the Plan will be evaluated to ensure  that its restoration objectives are achieved, it is essential to  understand the relationship among the concepts of restoration,  performance measures, and interim goals. In this regulation,  restoration is defined as the level of recovery and protection to the  South Florida ecosystem described in the Plan approved by Congress,  with such modifications that Congress may provide for in the future. As  the regulations indicate, the concept of restoration in the Plan  approved by Congress was expressed in a level of recovery assessed in  terms of performance measures, consisting chiefly of hydrologic  characteristics. The definition also recognizes that increased flows to  the natural system are expected to restore essential physical and  ecological characteristics that defined the pre-drainage ecosystem,  including more natural hydroperiods, which are a precursor to  improvements to native flora and fauna, presence of key species in  historic habitats, and patterns of plant communities that form a  gradient from aquatic communities to uplands. The regulations recognize  that the concept of restoration anticipates future improvements to the  Plan through adaptive management. The regulations also recognize that  performance measures will continue to be refined and developed  throughout the course of implementing the Plan. Interim goals will show  incremental progress towards reaching the expected performance level of  the Plan at different time intervals during implementation. The  regulations envision that the RECOVER team will provide their  recommendations about interim goals to the Corps of Engineers and South  Florida Water Management District. These recommendations will be  considered during the development of an agreement on interim goals that  is to be finalized by the Army, the Department of the Interior, and the  State of Florida by December 31, 2003. These interim goals will be used  initially to evaluate the success of the restoration effort and will be  refined periodically during the implementation of the Plan as  appropriate to ensure that the overall restoration objectives of the  Plan are achieved.  S. Targets for Other Water-Related Needs of the Region      The overarching objective of the Plan is the restoration,  preservation, and protection of the South Florida ecosystem while  providing for other water-related needs of the region, including water  supply and flood protection. Some commenters urged that, in addition to  the interim goals aimed at evaluating restoration success of the Plan,  the regulations also should provide incremental targets for the other  water-related needs of the region. They believe that this will ensure  that all of the goals and purposes of the Plan are achieved. Others  commented that, if these other incremental targets were included,  progress towards achieving these targets should be evaluated separately  from interim goals.     Identifying incremental targets for the other water-related needs  of the region will help evaluate the success of implementation of the  Plan in achieving the non-restoration goals of the Plan. Therefore, we  have decided to establish in the regulations a mechanism for evaluating  progress towards providing for these other water-related needs. The  regulations provide that by June 30, 2003, RECOVER will develop  recommendations on targets to evaluate progress on achieving the other  water-related needs of the region, for consideration by the Corps of  Engineers and the South Florida Water Management District, in  consultation with others. The Corps of Engineers and the South Florida  Water Management District will also consult with the South Florida  Ecosystem Restoration Task Force in establishing targets for evaluating  progress towards achieving other water-related needs of the region  provided for in the Plan. These targets shall be established by the  Corps of Engineers and the South Florida Water Management District by  December 31, 2003. These targets are intended to facilitate inter- agency planning, monitoring, and assessment throughout the  implementation process and are not intended to be standards or  schedules enforceable in court.     Interim goals, which are directed at restoration success of the  Plan, and targets for achieving the other water-related needs of the  region, which are not directed at restoration, are set out in two  distinct sections to make clear that they are intended to evaluate two  different types of goals of the Plan.     In recognition of the significant technical and scientific analyses  that are needed in the development of interim goals and targets,  RECOVER has already begun the work necessary in order to meet the June  30, 2003 deadline for providing recommendations on interim goals and  targets for other water-related needs to the Corps of Engineers and the  South Florida Water Management District.  T. Role of the Department of the Interior      Several commenters urged that the Department of the Interior play a  significant role in implementation of the Plan because of its  stewardship role over Federal lands and natural resources involved in  the Plan. The regulations give the Department of the Interior a special  concurring role, along with the Governor of the State of Florida, in  the development of six specific guidance memoranda related to important  program-wide aspects of implementing the Plan: (1) General format and  content of Project Implementation Reports; (2) processes for Project  Delivery Team evaluation of alternatives developed for Project  Implementation Reports, their cost effectiveness and impacts; (3)  process for system-wide evaluation of PIR alternatives by RECOVER; (4)  the general content of operating manuals; (5) general processes for the  conduct of assessment activities of RECOVER; and  [[Page 50549]]  (6) the process used in Project Implementation Reports for identifying  the appropriate quantity, timing, and distribution of water dedicated  and managed for the natural system. The regulations also give the  Secretary of the Interior and the Governor of the State of Florida a  concurring role in the Secretary of the Army's determination of the  pre-CERP baseline. They also specify that interim goals will be  established through a formal Interim Goals Agreement between the Corps  of Engineers, the State, and the Department of the Interior. Further,  the Department of the Interior is provided an important role in the  Leadership Group of RECOVER, along with several other Federal and State  agencies and the two Tribes. Finally, the regulations give the  Department of the Interior an important consulting role throughout  implementation of the program, including, among other things,  participation on Project Development Teams; development of the Adaptive  Management Program; selection and revision of hydrologic models;  development of Project Management Plans and Program Management Plans;  development of Project Implementation Reports; development of Operating  Manuals; development, review and revision of changes to the Master  Implementation Sequencing Schedule; recommending and developing  Comprehensive Plan Modification Reports; and developing means for  monitoring progress towards other water-related needs of the region as  provided for in the Plan.  U. Role of South Florida Ecosystem Restoration Task Force      Several commenters suggested that the Programmatic Regulations  create a specific role for the South Florida Ecosystem Restoration Task  Force, an interagency group created by section 528(f) of the Water  Resources Development Act of 1996 (110 Stat. 3770) (hereinafter ``WRDA  96''). The legal basis for the Task Force's role in the restoration  effort is found both in Section 528 of WRDA 96 and in Section 601 of  WRDA 2000. Section 528 envisions that the Task Force will coordinate  programs and research on ecosystem restoration, exchange information,  provide assistance and facilitate resolution of conflicts involving  South Florida ecosystem restoration. In Section 601(j) of WRDA 2000,  the Task Force is also given a consultation responsibility concerning  the establishment of an independent scientific review panel to review  the progress that is being made toward achieving the natural system  restoration goals of the Plan. Some members of the Task Force and its  associated working group represent agencies involved in implementing  CERP under the programmatic regulations, such as the Jacksonville  District Corps of Engineers and the South Florida Water Management  District. As recognized by this regulation, the South Florida Water  Management District and the Jacksonville District already regularly  report to the Task Force and its working group on CERP matters. The  Task Force also has appointed the Water Resources Advisory Commission  (WRAC) of the South Florida Water Management District as an advisory  body to the Task Force. The Corps of Engineers serves on this body and  regularly briefs that body on CERP. The Department of the Army  recognizes the important role that these collaborative groups play in  discussion and resolution of CERP issues.     We expect that informal coordination among the implementing  agencies, the Task Force and its working group and its other advisory  bodies will continue. For example, the Task Force may wish to have  regular briefings on CERP implementation issues, on the Master  Implementation Sequencing Plan, on Project Implementation Reports, or  on Operating Manuals; or the Task Force may decide to have RECOVER  provide the working group with information on work in progress.  Further, we contemplate that the Task Force will determine, on a case- by-case basis, the manner and extent to which it is appropriate for it  to be involved in CERP in order to carry out its existing statutory  responsibilities. If a regular process evolves, it can be incorporated  into revisions of the Programmatic Regulations.     At recent meetings, the Task Force expressed an interest in  consultation on several subjects. Accordingly, this draft regulation  incorporates consultation with the Task Force on those subjects. They  include: interim goals; targets for other water-related needs of the  region as provided for in the Plan; certain assessment reports;  Comprehensive Plan Modification Reports; Pilot Project Technical Data  Reports; and periodic reports to Congress by the Secretary of Army and  Secretary of Interior in consultation with EPA, Department of Commerce,  and the State of Florida. The final regulation may provide for  additional subjects upon which the Task Force may consult, if deemed  appropriate after consideration of public comments.  V. NEPA Compliance      As required by regulations of the Council on Environmental Quality  (40 CFR 1505.1 and 1507.3), agencies must issue regulations identifying  classes of actions generally requiring an Environmental Impact  Statement (EIS), generally not subject to the National Environmental  Policy Act (NEPA), and actions requiring an Environmental Assessment  (EA) of whether a full NEPA EIS is required or not. The Corps of  Engineers has adopted procedures generally implementing NEPA in  Sec. 230 of this chapter. The Programmatic Regulations consider on a  system-wide basis, the kinds of actions needed to implement the Plan,  and apply the principles of Sec. 230 to those activities. The  programmatic regulations identify certain actions which generally  require preparation of a NEPA document (either an Environmental Impact  Statement or an environmental assessment), or which are categorically  excluded from NEPA. Actions, such as the development or revision of  methods or guidance memoranda, are listed as categorically excluded.  Although the development or revision of a method or guidance memorandum  itself would not require a NEPA analysis, use of the method or guidance  memorandum would be analyzed under NEPA, as appropriate, in a decision  document such as a Project Implementation Report.     In general, the NEPA documentation for a particular project will be  included in the Project Implementation Report. For this reason, other  project-specific documents such as the Design Documentation Report,  Project Cooperation Agreement, Project Management Plan, and detailed  plans and specifications for the project are listed as categorically  excluded from NEPA documentation requirements. The Corps recognizes  that these documents may address elements of the project that have a  potential to significantly affect the quality of the human environment,  and fully intends that these effects should be analyzed and considered  as required by NEPA, but believes that this analysis and consideration  can be most effectively accomplished by including one comprehensive  NEPA analysis for each project in the Project Implementation Report,  rather than having piecemeal analyses in each of the supporting  documents.     Some commenters expressed the view that the guidance memorandum for  determining the quantity, timing and distribution of water dedicated  and managed for the natural system in a Project Implementation Report  (PIR) should be analyzed in an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS).  Since the guidance memorandum is procedural and does not affect the  environment, recommend legislation, or determine a  [[Page 50550]]  specific quantity, timing, or distribution of water for a specific  component, it was not considered to be a ``major Federal action'' under  NEPA. It is important to note that NEPA would apply to the decision  made in a PIR for a specific project applying a guidance memorandum to  that project and determining that a certain quantity, timing or  distribution of water was required for the project.     Similar comments were directed at the interim goals. Some  commenters felt that the interim goals were not ``major Federal  actions'' affecting the environment under NEPA. These commenters  regarded the interim goals as evaluation and reporting tools. Other  commenters maintained that the interim goals are planning goals and  that as such should be subject to a full NEPA analysis. In proposing  these regulations, we determined that it was not appropriate at this  time to make a programmatic decision on precisely how NEPA applied to  interim goals because the interim goals have not yet been established  and since the extent to which interim goals will be used in planning is  still under consideration. When specific interim goals are proposed for  adoption, a decision can be made on exactly how NEPA applies. Moreover,  when the Programmatic Regulations are revised for the first time, the  Corps will consider whether interim goals should be listed as  categorically excluded, generally requiring an EIS, or generally  requiring an Environmental Assessment but not necessarily an EIS.  IV. Project Implementation Reports Approved Pursuant to Transition  Rule      Section 601(h)(3)(D) of WRDA 2000 establishes a transition rule for  Project Implementation Reports approved before the date of promulgation  of the programmatic regulations. This transition rule requires that the  Project Implementation Reports be consistent with the Plan. The  transition rule also requires that the preamble of the programmatic  regulations contain a statement concerning the consistency with the  programmatic regulations of the Project Implementation Reports approved  prior to the date of promulgation of those regulations.     A number of Project Implementation Reports are underway currently,  but no Project Implementation Reports have been approved to date. The  Project Implementation Report for the Southern Golden Gates Estates  project in Collier County is scheduled to be completed prior to  promulgation of the final rule. If the final Project Implementation  Report on Southern Golden Gates Estates is approved before the date of  promulgation of the final rule, then the preamble to the final rule  will contain a statement concerning the consistency of that Project  Implementation Report with the programmatic regulations.  V. Concurrence Requirements for This Regulation      The Secretary of the Interior and the Governor are required by  Section 601(h)(3)(B) of WRDA 2000 to provide the Secretary with a  written statement of concurrence or non-concurrence on the proposed  programmatic regulations within 180 days from the end of the public  comment period. This statute specifies that a failure to provide a  written statement of concurrence or nonconcurrence within the 180-day  time frame will be deemed as meeting the concurrency requirements. A  copy of any concurrency or nonconcurrency statement shall be made a  part of the administrative record and be referred to in the final  programmatic regulations. Any nonconcurrency statements shall  specifically detail the reason or reasons for the nonconcurrence.  Throughout the process of developing the proposed regulations, we have  maintained close coordination with the Department of the Interior and  the State of Florida. The Army will give good faith consideration to  the concurrence or non-concurrence statements of the Secretary of  Interior and the Governor. The final regulations will include a  reference to these statements before making a decision to issue final  regulations.  VI. Organization of the Proposed Rule      We have organized the proposed regulations under five major  headings. The first heading, General Provisions, provides the purpose  of the regulations, the applicability of the rule, definitions  pertaining to the regulations and other general information. The second  heading, Program Goals and Responsibilities, describes the goals and  purposes of the Plan; implementation principles; and implementation  responsibilities, consultation, and coordination. The remaining  headings were designed to be consistent with the content required by  section 601(h)(3)(C). These headings are: Comprehensive Everglades  Restoration Plan Implementation Processes; Incorporating New  Information into the Plan; and Ensuring Protection of the Natural  System and Water Availability Consistent with the Goals and Purposes of  the Plan.  VII. Public Comments Solicited      We are soliciting comments and suggestions from the public,  governmental organizations, and other interested parties on the  proposed regulations.     If you wish to comment on this proposed rule, you may submit your  comments and materials by any one of several methods (see ADDRESSES  section). If submitting comments by electronic format, please submit  them in ASCII file format or Word file format and avoid the use of  special characters and any form of encryption. Please include your name  and return e-mail address in your e-mail message. Please note that your  e-mail address will not be retained at the termination of the public  comment period.  VIII. Administrative Requirements  A. Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.)      These regulations do not impose any information collection  requirements for which OMB approval under the Paperwork Reduction Act  is required. Thus, this action is not subject to the Paperwork  Reduction Act.  B. Executive Order 12866, as Amended      Under Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735, October 4, 1993), as  amended, we must determine whether the regulatory action is  ``significant'' and therefore subject to review by the Office of  Management and Budget (OMB) and the requirements of the Executive  Order. The Executive Order defines ``significant regulatory action'' as  one that is likely to result in a rule that may:     (1) Have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more,  or adversely affect in a material way the economy, a sector of the  economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public  health or safety, or State, local, or Tribal governments or  communities;     (2) Create a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an  action taken or planned by another agency;     (3) Materially alter the budgetary impact of entitlements, grants,  user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations of recipients  thereof; or     (4) Raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal  mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles set forth in  the Executive Order.     Pursuant to the terms of Executive Order 12866, as amended, it has  been determined that these regulations are a ``significant regulatory  action'' in light of the provisions of paragraph (4) above. As such,  this action was submitted to OMB for review. Changes made in response  to OMB suggestions or recommendations are documented in the public  record.  [[Page 50551]]  C. Executive Order 13132      Executive Order 13132, entitled ``Federalism'' (64 FR 43255, August  10, 1999), requires the development of an accountable process to ensure  ``meaningful and timely input by State and local officials in the  development of regulatory policies that have federalism implications.''  ``Policies that have federalism implications'' is defined in the  Executive Order to include regulations that have ``substantial direct  effects on the States, on the relationship between the national  government and the States, or on the distribution of power and  responsibilities among the various levels of government.'' These  regulations do not have significant federalism implications. The  proposed regulations define the relationships between the Federal and  State partners in implementing the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration  Plan. These proposed regulations are limited to implementation of the  Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan. It will not have substantial  direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national  government and the States, or on the distribution of power and  responsibilities among the various levels of government, as specified  in Executive Order 13132. Thus, Executive Order 13132 does not apply to  this rule. Nonetheless, the Corps of Engineers has consulted closely  with the State and local officials in developing the proposed rule.  D. Regulatory Flexibility Act      The Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq., as  amended by the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act  (SBREFA) of 1996) generally requires an agency to prepare a regulatory  flexibility analysis of any rule subject to notice-and-comment  rulemaking requirements under the Administrative Procedure Act or any  other statute unless the agency certifies that the rule will not have a  significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.  Small entities include small businesses, small organizations and small  governmental jurisdictions. For purposes of assessing the impacts of  the proposed rule on small entities, a small entity is defined as: (1)  A small business based on SBA size standards; (2) a small governmental  jurisdiction that is a government of a city, county, town, school  district, or special district with a population of less than 50,000;  and (3) a small organization that is any not-for-profit enterprise  which is independently owned and operated and is not dominant in its  field. After considering the economic impacts of the proposed rule on  small entities, we certify that this action will not have a significant  economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. The proposed  regulations only establish processes and governmental relationships  that will be used for implementation of the Comprehensive Everglades  Restoration Plan.  E. Unfunded Mandates Reform Act      We have determined in accordance with the Unfunded Mandates Reform  Act (2 U.S.C. 1501 et seq.):     (a) These regulations will not ``significantly or uniquely'' affect  small governments. A Small Government Agency Plan is not required.  Small governments will only be affected to the extent that they agree  to act as a non-Federal sponsor for implementation of projects for the  Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan. The proposed regulations do  not establish new or different requirements for non-Federal sponsors  for implementation of projects for the Comprehensive Everglades  Restoration Plan.     (b) The proposed regulations will not produce a Federal mandate of  $100 million or greater in any year, and therefore, does not constitute  a ``significant regulatory action'' under the Unfunded Mandates Reform  Act. The regulations define processes and relationships between the  Federal and State partners in implementing the Comprehensive Everglades  Restoration Plan. The regulations do not affect the cost sharing  requirements for non-Federal sponsors in implementing the Plan and  therefore, imposes no new obligations on State or local governments.  F. National Technology Transfer and Advancement Act      Section 12(d) of the National Technology Transfer and Advancement  Act of 1995 (the NTTAA), Public Law 104-113, section 12(d) (15 U.S.C.  272 note), directs us to use voluntary consensus standards in our  regulatory activities unless to do so would be inconsistent with  applicable law or otherwise impractical. Voluntary consensus standards  are technical standards (e.g., materials specifications, test methods,  sampling procedures, and business practices) that are developed or  adopted by voluntary consensus standards bodies. The NTTAA directs us  to provide Congress, through OMB, explanations when we decide not to  use available and applicable voluntary consensus standards. These  regulations do not involve technical standards. Therefore, we did not  consider the use of any voluntary consensus standards.  G. Executive Order 13045      Executive Order 13045, entitled ``Protection of Children From  Environmental Health Risks and Safety Risks'' (62 FR 19885, April 23,  1997), applies to any rule that: (1) Was initiated after April 21,  1997, or for which a notice of proposed rulemaking was published after  April 21, 1998; (2) is determined to be ``economically significant'' as  defined under Executive Order 12866, and (3) concerns an environmental  health or safety risk that we have reason to believe may have a  disproportionate effect on children. If the regulatory action meets all  three criteria, we must evaluate the environmental health or safety  effects of the planned rule on children, and explain why the planned  regulation is preferable to other potentially effective and reasonably  feasible alternatives that we considered. The regulations are not  subject to Executive Order 13045 because it is not an economically  significant regulatory action as defined by Executive Order 12866. The  regulations establish processes for the implementation of the  Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan and define the relationships  between the Federal and State partners for implementation. Furthermore,  they do not concern an environmental health or safety risk that we have  reason to believe may have a disproportionate effect on children.  H. Executive Order 13175      Under Executive Order 13175, we may not issue a regulation that has  substantial, direct effects on one or more Indian tribes, on the  relationship between the Federal government and Indian tribes, or on  the distribution of powers and responsibilities between the Federal  government and Indian tribes, and imposes substantial direct compliance  costs on those communities, and that is not required by statute, unless  the Federal government provides the funds necessary to pay the direct  compliance cost incurred by the Tribal governments, or we consult with  those governments. If we comply by consulting, Executive Order 13175  requires us to provide the Office of Management and Budget, in a  separately identified section of the preamble to the rule, a  description of the extent of our prior consultation with  representatives of affected Tribal governments, a summary of the nature  of their concerns, and a statement supporting the need to issue the  regulation. In addition, Executive Order 13175 requires us to develop  an effective process permitting  [[Page 50552]]  elected officials and other representatives of Indian Tribal  governments ``to provide meaningful and timely input in the development  of regulatory policies on matters that significantly or uniquely affect  their communities.'' The proposed regulations are required by section  601(h)(3) of WRDA 2000. Additionally, the proposed rule does not impose  significant compliance costs on any Indian Tribes. The regulations  establish processes for the implementation of the Comprehensive  Everglades Restoration Plan and define the relationships between the  implementing entities. Accordingly, the requirements of section 3(b) of  Executive Order 13175 do not apply to these regulations. However, the  Corps of Engineers recognizes that two Indian Tribes, the Miccosukee  Tribe of Indians of Florida and the Seminole Tribe of Florida, have a  significant direct interest in the implementation of the CERP and the  framework for its implementation that will be established by these  programmatic regulations. We have thus consulted extensively with these  Tribes in the development of this proposed rule, and have included  requirements for continued consultation in all significant project  implementation components, including program-wide guidance memoranda,  Project Management Plans, Program Management Plans, Project  Implementation Reports, Project Operating Manuals, the System Operating  Manual, and the Master Implementation Sequencing Plan. These Tribes are  also included in the Leadership Group of RECOVER and participate in the  Project Delivery Teams and the South Florida Ecosystem Restoration Task  Force, which has played and will continue to play a consultative role  on many aspects of CERP implementation. Finally, Sec. 385.10(b)  includes a general requirement for consultation with the Tribes  ``throughout the implementation process.''  I. Executive Order 12630      In accordance with Executive Order 12630 entitled ``Governmental  Actions and Interference with Constitutionally Protected Property  Rights,'' the proposed regulations will not effect a taking of private  property or otherwise have taking implications. A takings implication  assessment is not required. The regulations establish processes to be  used in implementing the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan.  J. Civil Justice Reform      In accordance with Executive Order 12988, we have determined that  the proposed regulations do not unduly burden the judicial system and  meets the requirements of sections 3(a) and 3(b)(2) of the Order. The  regulations establish processes to be used in implementing the  Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan and defines the relationships  between the governmental entities that will implement the Plan.  K. Executive Order 13211      On May 18, 2001, the President issued an Executive Order (E.O.  13211) that applies to regulations that significantly affect energy  supply, distribution, and use. Executive Order 13211 requires agencies  to prepare Statements of Energy Effects when undertaking certain  actions. Because the proposed regulations are not expected to  significantly affect energy supplies, distribution, or use, this action  is not a significant energy action and no Statement of Energy Effects  is required.  L. Environmental Documentation      We have determined that these proposed regulations do not  constitute a major Federal action significantly affecting the quality  of the human environment. Therefore, environmental documentation under  the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) is not required for these  proposed regulations. The Corps of Engineers has prepared appropriate  environmental documentation, including a Programmatic Environmental  Impact Statement, for the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan.  Moreover, the proposed regulations establish requirements for the  preparation of appropriate environmental documentation as part of the  implementation process.

Appendix A--Illustrations to Part 385      Authority: Section 601, Pub. L. 106-541, 114 Stat. 2680; 10  U.S.C. 3013(g)(3); 33 U.S.C. 1 and 701; and 5 U.S.C. 301.  Subpart A--General Provisions  Sec. 385.1  Purpose of the programmatic regulations.      (a) The regulations in this part implement the provisions of  section 601(h)(3) of the Water Resources Development Act of 2000,  Public Law 106-541, 114 Stat. 2688 (hereinafter ``WRDA 2000''), which  was enacted on December 11, 2000.     (b) The purpose of these programmatic regulations is to establish  the processes necessary for implementing the Comprehensive Everglades  Restoration Plan (the Plan) to ensure that the goals and purposes of  the Plan are achieved. Some of these processes are project specific,  including, but not limited to, development of Project Implementation  Reports, project-specific performance measures, Project Cooperation  Agreements, plans and specifications, Design Documentation Reports,  Pilot Project Technical Data Reports, and Operating Manuals. Other  processes are of more general applicability, including, but not limited  to, development of program-wide guidance memoranda, system-wide  performance measures, interim goals, targets for monitoring progress on  other goals and purposes of the Plan, and the Master Implementation  Sequencing Plan. Taken together these documents establish the process  by which the programmatic regulations ensure that the restoration  success and other goals and purposes of the Plan are achieved. These  programmatic regulations also describe the relationship among the  various Federal, State, tribal, and local governmental entities charged  with Plan implementation responsibilities.  Sec. 385.2  Applicability of the programmatic regulations.      (a) This part applies to all activities conducted to implement the  Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan.     (b) Nothing in this part shall be interpreted to amend, alter,  diminish, or otherwise affect:     (1) The powers and duties provided under the ``Comprehensive  Everglades Restoration Plan Assurance of Project Benefits Agreement''  dated January 9, 2002 pursuant to section 601(h)(2) of WRDA 2000; or     (2) Any existing legal water rights of the United States, the State  of Florida, the Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Florida, or the Seminole  Tribe of Florida, including rights under the compact among the Seminole  Tribe of Florida, the State, and the South Florida Water Management  District, defining the scope and use of water rights of the Seminole  Tribe of Florida, as codified by section 7 of the Seminole Indian Land  Claims Settlement Act of 1987 (25 U.S.C. 1772e).     (c) This part is intended to aid the internal management of the  implementing agencies and are not intended to create any right or  benefit enforceable at law by a party against the implementing agencies  or their officers. Nothing in this part shall create a right or  expectation to benefits or enhancements, temporary or permanent, in  third parties that are not specifically authorized by Congress in  Section 601 of WRDA 2000.     (d) Nothing in this part is intended to, or shall be interpreted  to, reserve or allocate water or to prescribe the process for reserving  or allocating water or for water management under Florida law. Nor is  this part intended to, nor shall it be interpreted to, prescribe any  process of Florida law.  Sec. 385.3  Definitions.      The following terms are defined for the purposes of this Part 385:     Adaptive management means the process of improving understandings  of the natural and human systems in the South Florida ecosystem,  specifically as these understandings pertain to the goals and purposes  of the Plan, and to seek continuous improvement of the Plan based upon  new information resulting from changed or unforeseen circumstances, new  scientific or technical information, new or updated models, or  information developed through the assessment principles contained in  the Plan, or as future authorized changes to the Plan are integrated  into the implementation of the Plan.     Assessment means the process whereby the actual performance of  implemented projects is measured and interpreted based on analyses of  information obtained from research, monitoring and modeling or other  relevant sources.     Central and Southern Florida (C&SF) Project means the project for  Central and Southern Florida authorized under the heading ``CENTRAL AND  SOUTHERN FLORIDA'' in section 203 of the Flood Control Act of 1948 (62  Stat. 1176) and any modification authorized by any other provision of  law, including section 601 of WRDA 2000.     Component means features of the Plan that include, but are not  limited to, storage reservoirs, aquifer storage and recovery  facilities, stormwater treatment areas, water reuse facilities, canals,  levees, pumps, water control structures, and seepage management  facilities, or the removal of canals, levees, pumps, and water control  structures.     Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan (CERP) means the plan  contained in the ``Final Integrated Feasibility Report and Programmatic  Environmental Impact Statement,'' dated April 1, 1999, as modified by  section 601 of WRDA 2000, or any subsequent modification authorized in  law.     Comprehensive Plan Modification Report means the report prepared by  the Corps of Engineers and the South Florida Management District for  approval by Congress of major modifications to the Plan that are needed  to ensure that the goals and purposes of the Plan are achieved. The  Comprehensive Plan Modification Report describes alternative plans  considered, the recommended modifications to the Plan, and other  economic, environmental, and engineering information, and includes the  appropriate NEPA document.     Concurrence means the issuance of a written statement of  concurrence, or non-concurrence or the failure to provide such a  written statement within a time frame prescribed by law or this part.     Consultation means a process to ensure meaningful and timely input  in the development of system-wide and project-level implementation  reports, manuals, plans, and other documents from Federal, State, and  local agencies, and the Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Florida and the  Seminole Tribe of Florida.

Subpart B--Program Goals and Responsibilities  Sec. 385.8  Goals and purposes of the Comprehensive Everglades  Restoration Plan.      (a) The Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan is a framework  for modifications and operational changes to the Central and Southern  Florida Project that are needed to restore, preserve, and protect the  South Florida ecosystem while providing for other water-related needs  of the region, including water supply and flood protection. The  overarching objective of the Plan is the restoration, preservation, and  protection of the South Florida ecosystem while providing for other  water-related needs of the region, including water supply and flood  protection.     (b) The Corps of Engineers and non-Federal sponsors shall, in  consultation with the Department of the Interior, the Environmental  Protection Agency, the Department of Commerce, the Miccosukee Tribe of  Indians of Florida, the Seminole Tribe of Florida, the Florida  Department of Environmental Protection, and other Federal, State, and  local agencies, implement the Plan to ensure the protection of water  quality in, the reduction of the loss of fresh water from, and the  improvement of the environment of the South Florida Ecosystem and to  achieve and maintain the benefits to the natural system and human  environment described in the Plan, and required pursuant to section 601  of WRDA 2000 for as long as the project is authorized.     (c) The goal of the Plan is to provide the quantity, quality,  timing, and distribution of water necessary to achieve the goals and  purposes of the Plan. The Corps of Engineers and non-Federal sponsors  shall implement the projects of the Plan with the goal of achieving the  expected performance level of the Plan and to seek continuous  improvement of the Plan based upon new information resulting from  changed or unforeseen circumstances, new scientific or technical  information, new or updated models, or information developed through  the adaptive assessment principles contained in the Plan, or future  authorized changes to the Plan integrated into the implementation of  the Plan.  Sec. 385.9  Implementation principles.      The Corps of Engineers and the South Florida Water Management  District and other non-Federal sponsors shall, in consultation with the  Department of the Interior, the Environmental Protection Agency, the  Department of Commerce, the Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Florida, the  Seminole Tribe of Florida, the Florida Department of Environmental  Protection, and other Federal, State, and local agencies, conduct  activities, including program-level activities, necessary to implement  the projects of the Plan. Such activities shall be conducted as part of  an integrated implementation program, in accordance with this part, and  based on the following principles:     (a) Individual projects shall be formulated based on their  contribution to the system-wide goals and purposes of the Plan and the  achievement of the expected performance level of the Plan, as well as  on their ability to provide benefits without regard to projects not yet  implemented.     (b) Interim goals shall be established pursuant to this part to  provide a means for evaluating restoration success at specific time  intervals during implementation. Progress on achieving other water- related needs of the region as provided for in the Plan shall also be  evaluated at specific time intervals during implementation.     (c) Endorsement of the Plan as a restoration framework is not  intended as a constraint on innovation in its implementation through  the adaptive management process. Continuous improvement of the Plan  shall be sought to ensure that new information resulting from changed  or unforeseen circumstances, new scientific or technical information,  or information developed through the adaptive assessment principles  contained in the Plan, or future authorized changes to the Plan are  integrated into the implementation of the Plan. The adaptive management  process provides a means for analyzing performance of the Plan and  assessing progress towards meeting the goals and purposes of the Plan  as well as a basis for improving the performance of the Plan. Improving  the performance of the Plan means either enhancing the benefits of the  Plan in terms of restoration of the natural system while providing for  other water-related needs of the region, including water supply and  flood protection, or delivering Plan benefits at reduced cost.  Sec. 385.10  Implementation responsibilities, consultation, and  coordination.      (a) Implementing agencies. Implementation of the projects of the  Plan shall be the responsibility of the Corps of Engineers and the non- Federal sponsors as the implementing agencies for projects or program- level activities.     (b) Consultation. (1) Consultation with Indian Tribes. (i) In  addition to the provision for consultation with Native  [[Page 50558]]  American Tribes provided for by Executive Order, the Corps of Engineers  and non-Federal sponsors shall consult with and seek advise from the  Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Florida and the Seminole Tribe of  Florida throughout the implementation process to ensure meaningful and  timely input by tribal officials regarding programs and activities  covered by this part.     (ii) In carrying out their responsibilities under section 601 of  WRDA 2000 with respect to the restoration of the South Florida  ecosystem, the Secretary of the Army and the Secretary of the Interior  shall fulfill any obligations to the Indian tribes in South Florida  under the Indian trust doctrine as well as other applicable legal  obligations.     (2) Consultation with agencies. The Corps of Engineers and non- Federal sponsors shall consult with and seek advice from the Department  of the Interior, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Department of  Commerce, the Florida Department of Environmental Protection, and other  Federal, State, and local agencies throughout the implementation  process to ensure meaningful and timely input by those agencies  regarding programs and activities covered under this part. The time  for, and extent of, consultation shall be appropriate for, and limited  by, the activity involved.     (c) Coordination. The Corps of Engineers and the non-Federal  sponsor shall coordinate implementation activities and the preparation  of documents with other Federal, State, and local agencies and the  tribes to fulfill the requirements of Federal and State laws, such as  the Fish and Wildlife Coordination Act, the National Environmental  Policy Act, the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the National  Historic Preservation Act, and the Endangered Species Act.     (d) Timeliness obligations of consultation. Consultation involves  reciprocal obligations: on the part of the Corps of Engineers and the  non-Federal sponsor to involve agencies, tribes, and the public at an  early stage and in such a way to ensure meaningful consultation, and on  the part of the parties consulted to respond in a timely and meaningful  fashion so that the implementation of the Plan is not jeopardized and  so that delays do not result in other adverse consequences to  restoration of the natural system, to the other goals and purposes of  the Plan, or to the public interest. Prescribed time limits set by  regulation are too inflexible for the entire consultation process. It  is expected that the Corps of Engineers and the non-Federal sponsor  will set reasonable time limits for consultation on specific decisions  consistent with the purposes of this part and that the parties  consulted will consult in a timely and meaningful way. This part does  not intend for a delay in consultation to be used as a de facto veto  power. This part authorizes the Corps of Engineers and the non-Federal  sponsor to set reasonable limits on the amount of time for  consultation. In setting reasonable time limits, the agencies may  consider relevant considerations such as sequencing of projects,  planning, contracting and funding, and any factor listed for setting  time limits for consulting under NEPA (40 CFR Sec. 1501.8), including  but not limited to, the nature and size of the proposed action, the  degree to which relevant information is known or obtainable, the degree  to which the action is controversial, the state of the art of  analytical techniques, the number of persons affected, and the  consequences of delay. In addition, the agencies should adhere to all  time limits imposed by law, regulations or executive order. In  appropriate circumstances, the Corps of Engineers and the non-Federal  sponsor may extend the time for consultation upon a showing that delays  will not result in adverse consequences to the implementation of the  Plan, to the restoration of the natural system, to the other goals and  purposes of the Plan, or to the public interest and that relevant  considerations justify a longer time. Failure to consult with, or file  comments in, a timely and meaningful way shall not be a sufficient  reason for extending a consultation or comment period. Nothing in this  part is intended to alter existing time limits established by statute  or other regulations.     (e) South Florida Ecosystem Restoration Task Force. The Department  of the Army recognizes the valuable role that the South Florida  Ecosystem Restoration Task Force, its working group, and its other  advisory bodies play in the discussion and resolution of issues related  to the South Florida ecosystem. The Department of the Army and the  South Florida Water Management District regularly brief the Task Force  on CERP issues and regularly serve on the working group and other  advisory bodies. It is the intent of the Department of the Army that  the Corps of Engineers and the South Florida Water Management District  and other non-Federal sponsors shall continue to provide information  to, and consult with, the South Florida Ecosystem Restoration Task  Force, the Florida-based working group, and advisory bodies to the Task  Force as requested throughout the implementation process for the Plan.  In addition to consultation with the Task Force specified elsewhere in  this part, the Corps of Engineers and the South Florida Water  Management District shall consult with the South Florida Ecosystem  Restoration Task Force, its working group, and its advisory bodies, on  other matters related to the implementation of the Plan, as the Task  Force from time to time may request. Providing information to, or  consulting with, the Task Force usually will occur on a case-by-case  basis.  Subpart C--CERP Implementation Processes  Sec. 385.11  Implementation process for projects.      Generally, the Corps of Engineers and non-Federal sponsors shall  develop and implement projects in accordance with a process that is  shown in figure 1 in Appendix A of this part. This process covers  planning, design, construction and operation of the projects. Typical  steps in this process involve:     (a) Project Management Plan.

In designing individual project components,  Project Delivery Teams shall attempt to stay within the funding target  for the project established in the ``Final Integrated Feasibility  Report and Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement,'' dated April  1, 1999, adjusted for inflation. In cases where it is not feasible to  accomplish the project goals and purposes without exceeding this  target, or where the project ratio of benefits to costs can be  significantly improved by exceeding the target, the PIR shall document  deviations from the funding target in the ``Final Integrated  Feasibility Report and Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement,''  dated April 1, 1999 and explain the need for such deviations.     (i) General. The Corps of Engineers and the South Florida Water  Management District shall, with the concurrence of the Secretary of the  Interior and the Governor, develop a guidance memorandum in accordance  with Sec. 385.5 that describes the processes to be used to formulate  and evaluate alternatives, their costs and benefits, both monetary and  non-monetary, and their cost effectiveness, and the basis for scoping  and selecting the features which comprise the selected alternative.  Project Implementation Reports approved before the date of promulgation  of these regulations or the development of a guidance memorandum may  use whatever method that, in the District Engineer's discretion, and in  cooperation with the non-Federal sponsor, is deemed appropriate and is  consistent with applicable law and the Programmatic Regulations in this  part.     (ii) System formulation and evaluation. The guidance memorandum  shall describe the process for formulating alternatives to optimize  contributions to the system-wide goals and purposes of the Plan by  including each alternative with all of the other components of the Plan  and comparing total benefits and costs of the alternative under both  the with-CERP and the without CERP condition.     (iii) Interim project assessment. The guidance memorandum shall  also include a process for evaluation of each alternative as the next  added increment of the Plan for the purposes of impact assessment,  evaluating the project's contribution toward achieving the interim  goals and targets for other water related needs, determining  appropriate sequencing of the project and determining if the benefits  of the alternative justify its costs without regard to projects not yet  implemented.     (iv) Identification of selected alternative. The guidance  memorandum shall also include a process for identification of the  selected alternative, based on the analyses conducted in paragraphs  (b)(1)(ii) and (iii) of this section. This alternative should be  justified based on the project's contributions to both the system-wide  goals and purposes of the Plan and the interim goals and targets. If  the alternative cannot be justified on a next added basis, it should be  justified based on sequencing factors, dependency of other CERP  projects on its completion, and/or operational considerations. The  Guidance Memorandum shall also include an evaluation of the selected  alternative as the last added increment of the Plan to determine the  incremental benefits and costs of the project in terms of how it  contributes to achievement of the system-wide goals and purposes of the  Plan. This analysis should also identify the extent to which benefits  are dependent on other components of the Plan, and note any benefits  that will also be included in the last added increment analysis for  other projects. The PIR should also include an identification of the  water to be reserved for the natural system, based on the next added  increment analysis.     (c) RECOVER Performance Evaluation of Alternatives for a Project  Implementation Report. (1) The Corps of Engineers and the South Florida  Water Management District shall, with the concurrence of the Secretary  of the Interior and the Governor, develop a guidance memorandum in  accordance with Sec. 385.5 that describes the process to be used by  RECOVER for the evaluation of alternatives developed for the Project  Implementation Report in achieving the goals and purposes of the Plan.     (2) RECOVER shall evaluate the performance of alternatives  developed for the Project Implementation Report towards achieving the  goals and purposes of the Plan using appropriate performance measures.     (3) RECOVER shall prepare information for the Project Delivery Team  describing the results of the evaluations of alternatives developed for  the Project Implementation Report towards achieving the goals and  purposes of the Plan, including, as appropriate, recommendations and  suggestions for improving the performance of the alternatives.

The notice shall indicate that the report has been submitted  for Washington level review.     (3) Headquarters, US Army Corps of Engineers shall coordinate the  Washington level review in accordance with applicable policies and  regulations of the Corps of Engineers. Headquarters, US Army Corps of  Engineers shall administer the 30-day state and agency review of the  Comprehensive Plan Modification Report as required by law.     (4) After completion of the policy review, The Chief of Engineers  shall transmit the Chief of Engineers Report to the Assistant Secretary  of the Army for Civil Works for review.     (5) Upon approval, the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil  Works shall transmit the Comprehensive Plan Modification Report to  Congress.     (6) As appropriate, the non-Federal sponsor may use the  Comprehensive Plan Modification Report as the basis for obtaining  approval under applicable Florida law.     (c) Minor changes to the Plan. The Plan requires a process for  adaptive management and incorporation of new information into the Plan.  As a result of this process, each Project Implementation Report may  make minor adjustments in the Plan. It is not the intent of this  section to require a continual cycle of report writing for minor  changes. Instead, the intent of this section is to develop a  Comprehensive Plan Modification Report for major changes to the Plan  comparable to those that would require a supplement to the programmatic  Environmental Impact Statement. The Corps of Engineers and South  Florida Water Management District may, in their discretion, elect to  prepare a Comprehensive Plan Modification Report for other changes.  Sec. 385.33  Revisions to models and analytical tools.      (a) In carrying out their responsibilities for implementing the  Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan and this part, the Corps of  Engineers, the South Florida Water Management District, and other non- Federal sponsors shall rely on the best available science including  models and other analytical tools for conducting analyses for the  planning, design, construction, operation, and assessment of projects.  The selection of models and analytical tools shall be done in  consultation with the Department of the Interior, the Miccosukee Tribe  of Indians of Florida, the Seminole Tribe of Florida, the Environmental  Protection Agency, the Department of Commerce, the Florida Department  of Environmental Protection, and other Federal, State, and local  agencies.     (b) The Corps of Engineers, the South Florida Water Management  District, and other non-Federal sponsors may, in consultation with the  Department of the Interior, the Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Florida,  the Seminole Tribe of Florida, the Environmental Protection Agency, the  Department of Commerce, the Florida Department of Environmental  Protection, and other Federal, State, and local agencies, periodically  revise models and analytical tools or develop new models and analytical  tools as needed. As necessary, RECOVER shall review the adequacy of  system-wide simulation models and analytical tools used in the  evaluation and assessment of projects, and shall make recommendations  for improvements in models and analytical tools required for the  evaluation and assessment tasks.     (c) The Corps of Engineers and the South Florida Water Management  District shall determine on a case-by-case basis what documentation is  appropriate for revisions to models and analytic tools, depending on  the significance of the changes and their impacts to the Plan. Such  changes may be treated as Minor Changes to the Plan, in accordance with  Sec. 385.32(c) where appropriate.  Sec. 385.34  Changes to the Plan.      (a) The Plan shall be updated to incorporate approved changes to  the Plan resulting from:     (1) Approval by the Secretary of a project to be implemented  pursuant to Sec. 385.13;     (2) Authorization of projects by Congress;     (3) Comprehensive Plan Modification Reports approved by Congress;  or     (4) Other changes authorized by Congress.     (b) The Corps of Engineers and the South Florida Water Management  District shall periodically prepare a document for dissemination to the  public that describes:     (1) The components of the Plan including any approved changes to  the Plan;     (2) The estimated cost of the Plan including any approved changes  to the Plan;     (3) A water budget for the Plan; and     (4) The water that has been reserved or allocated for the natural  system under State law for the Plan.     (c) The Corps of Engineers shall provide annually to the Office of  Management and Budget an updated estimate of total CERP cost, the costs  of individual project components, and an explanation of any changes in  these estimates from the initial estimates contained in the ``Final  Integrated Feasibility Report and Programmatic Environmental Impact  Statement,'' dated April 1, 1999.  Subpart E--Ensuring Protection of the Natural System and Water  Availability Consistent With the Goals and Purposes of the Plan  Sec. 385.35  Achievement of the benefits of the Plan.      (a) Pre-CERP baseline water availability. (1) Not later than June  30, 2003, the Corps of Engineers and the South Florida Water Management  District shall, in consultation with the Department of the Interior,  the Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Florida, the Seminole Tribe of  Florida, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Department of  Commerce, the Florida Department of Environmental Protection, and other  Federal, State, and local agencies, develop the pre-CERP baseline to  determine the quantity, quality, timing, and distribution of water  delivered by the existing Central  [[Page 50570]]  and Southern Florida Project prior to the date of enactment of section  601 of WRDA 2000. In developing the pre-CERP baseline, the Corps of  Engineers and the South Florida Water Management District shall use a  method that is consistent with the guidance memorandum approved in  accordance with paragraph (b)(2) of this section.     (2) Concurrence by the Secretary of the Interior and the Governor  shall be required on the proposed pre-CERP baseline. Within 180 days  from the development of the pre-CERP baseline, or December 31, 2003,  whichever is sooner, or such shorter period that the Secretary of the  Interior and the Governor may agree to, the Secretary of the Interior  and the Governor may provide the Secretary with a written statement of  concurrence or nonconcurrence with the proposed pre-CERP baseline. A  failure to provide a written statement of concurrence or nonconcurrence  within such time frame shall be deemed as meeting the concurrency  requirements of this section. Any nonconcurrency statement shall  specifically detail the reason or reasons for the non-concurrence. The  Corps of Engineers and the South Florida Water Management District  shall give good faith consideration to any nonconcurrency statement,  and take the reason or reasons for the nonconcurrence into account in  the final decision to determine the pre-CERP baseline.     (3) In preparing a Project Implementation Report, the Corps of  Engineers and the South Florida Water Management District shall  determine whether the pre-CERP baseline quantity of water of comparable  quality is still available. The Corps of Engineers and the non-Federal  sponsor shall consider any change in availability of pre-CERP baseline  water and previously reserved water in identifying the quantity,  timing, and distribution of water to be made available for the natural  system by a project component in preparing the Project Implementation  Report. The Project Implementation Report shall consider: whether  additional quantity, timing, and distribution of water should be made  available by subsequent projects; whether improvements in water quality  are needed in order to ensure that water delivered to the natural  system meets applicable water quality standards; whether to recommend  preparation of a Comprehensive Plan Modification Report as described in  Sec. 385.32; and whether to recommend that the State of Florida and its  agencies re-examine the reservation or allocation of water made  pursuant to State law in order to provide for restoration of the  natural system consistent with the Plan. In preparing a Project  Implementation Report, the concurrence provisions of paragraph (a)(2)  of this section shall not apply to a determination of whether the pre- CERP baseline is still available.     (b) Identification of water to be reserved or allocated for the  natural system in the Project Implementation Report. (1) Each Project  Implementation Report shall take into account the pre-CERP baseline  water and previously reserved water in identifying the appropriate  quantity, timing, and distribution of water dedicated and managed for  the natural system, determining whether improvements in water quality  are necessary to ensure that water delivered to the natural system  meets applicable water quality standards; and identifying the amount of  water for the natural system necessary to implement, under State law,  the provisions of section 601(h)(4)(A)(iii)(V) of WRDA 2000.     (2) Section 601(h)(3)(C)(i)(I) of WRDA 2000 requires the  programmatic regulations in this part to establish a process for  development of Project Implementation Reports, Project Cooperation  Agreements, and Operating Manuals that ensure that the goals and  objectives of the Plan are achieved. Section 601(h)(4)(A)(iii)(IV) of  WRDA 2000 provides that Project Implementation Reports shall identify  the appropriate quantity, timing, and distribution of water dedicated  and managed for the natural system. Section 601(h)(4)(A)(iii)(V) of  WRDA 2000 provides that Project Implementation Reports shall identify  the amount of water to be reserved or allocated for the natural system  necessary to implement, under State law, the provisions of section  601(h)(4)(A)(iii)(IV) and (VI) of WRDA 2000. To implement these  provisions and Sec. 385.5, the Corps of Engineers and the South Florida  Water Management District shall, with the concurrence of the Secretary  of the Interior and the Governor, develop a guidance memorandum for use  of the Corps of Engineers and the non-federal sponsor. The guidance  memorandum shall provide a process to be used in the preparation of  Project Implementation Reports for identifying the appropriate  quantity, timing, and distribution of water dedicated and managed for  the natural system; determining whether improvements in water quality  are necessary to ensure that water delivered to the natural system  meets applicable water quality standards; and identifying the amount of  water for the natural system necessary to implement, under State law,  the provisions of section 601(h)(4)(A)(iii) of WRDA 2000.     (i) The guidance memorandum shall generally be based on a system- wide analysis that adds the project recommended in the Project  Implementation Report to the projects of the Plan for which Project  Implementation Reports have already been implemented and may express  the quantity, timing and distribution of water in stage duration  curves; exceedance frequency curves; quantities available in average,  wet, and dry years; or any other method which is based on the best  available science. The guidance memorandum shall also provide for  projects that are hydrologically separate from the rest of the system.  The guidance memorandum also shall address procedures for determining  whether improvements in water quality are necessary to ensure that  water delivered to the natural system meets applicable water quality  standards. These procedures shall ensure that any features to improve  water quality are implemented in a manner consistent with the cost  sharing provisions of the Water Resources Development Acts of 1996 and  2000.     (ii) The guidance memorandum shall generally take into account the  natural fluctuation of water made available in any given year; the  objective of restoration of the natural system; the need for protection  of existing uses transferred to new sources; contingencies for drought  protection; the need to identify the additional quantity, timing, and  distribution of water made available by a new project component while  maintaining a system-wide perspective on the amount of water made  available by the Plan; and the need to determine whether improvements  in water quality are necessary to ensure that water delivered to the  natural system meets applicable water quality standards.     (iii) Project Implementation Reports approved before the date of  promulgation of these regulations or the development of the guidance  memorandum may use whatever method that the Corps of Engineers and the  non-Federal sponsor deem is reasonable and consistent with the  provisions of section 601 of WRDA 2000.     (iv) Nothing in this section is intended to, or shall it be  interpreted to, reserve or allocate water or to prescribe the process  for reserving or allocating water or for water management under Florida  law. Nothing in this section is intended to, nor shall it be  interpreted to, prescribe any process of Florida law.  [[Page 50571]]  Sec. 385.36  Elimination or transfer of existing legal sources of  water.      (a) Pursuant to the provisions of section 601(h)(5)(A) of WRDA  2000, Project Implementation Reports shall include analyses to  determine if existing legal sources of water are to be transferred or  eliminated as a result of project implementation. If implementation of  the project shall cause a transfer or elimination of existing legal  sources of water, then the Project Implementation Report shall include  an implementation plan that ensures that such transfer or elimination  shall not occur until a new source of water of comparable quantity and  quality is available to replace the water to be lost as a result of  implementation of the Plan.     (b) In determining if implementation of a project shall cause an  elimination or transfer of existing legal sources of water, the Corps  of Engineers and the non-Federal sponsor shall include those for:     (1) An agricultural or urban water supply;     (2) Allocation or entitlement to the Seminole Indian Tribe of  Florida under section 7 of the Seminole Indian Land Claims Settlement  Act of 1987 (25 U.S.C. 1772e);     (3) The Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Florida;     (4) Water supply for Everglades National Park; or     (5) Water supply for fish and wildlife.  Sec. 385.37  Flood protection.      (a) General. In accordance with section 601 of WRDA 2000, flood  protection, consistent with restoration, preservation, and protection  of the natural system, is a purpose of the Plan.     (b) Level of service. (1) For each Project Implementation Report,  the level of service for flood protection that:     (i) Was in existence on the date of enactment of section 601 of  WRDA 2000; and     (ii) Is in accordance with applicable law, shall be determined for  the area affected by the project.     (2) The Project Implementation Report shall include analyses to  demonstrate that the level of service for flood protection in paragraph  (b)(1) of this section will not be reduced by implementation of the  project.     (c) Improved and new flood protection benefits. The overarching  objective of the Plan is the restoration, preservation, and protection  of the South Florida Ecosystem while providing for other water-related  needs of the region, including water supply and flood protection. In  preparing the Project Implementation Report, the Corps of Engineers and  the non-Federal sponsor may consider opportunities to provide  additional flood protection consistent with restoration of the natural  system, and the provisions of section 601(f)(2)(B) of WRDA 2000 and  other applicable laws.  Sec. 385.38  Interim goals.      (a) Agreement. The Secretary, the Secretary of the Interior, and  the Governor shall, by December 31, 2003, and in consultation with the  Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Florida, the Seminole Tribe of Florida,  the Environmental Protection Agency, the Department of Commerce, the  Florida Department of Environmental Protection, and other Federal,  State, and local agencies, and the South Florida Ecosystem Restoration  Task Force, execute an Interim Goals Agreement establishing interim  goals to facilitate inter-agency planning, monitoring and assessment so  as to achieve the overarching objectives of the Comprehensive  Everglades Restoration Plan and to ensure the means by which the  restoration success of the Plan may be evaluated, and ultimately  reported to the Congress pursuant to Sec. 385.40 throughout the  implementation process.     (b) Purpose. (1) Interim goals are targets by which the restoration  success of the Plan may be evaluated at specific points by agency  managers, the State, and Congress throughout the overall planning and  implementation process. In addition, interim goals will facilitate  adaptive management and allow the Corps of Engineers and its non- federal sponsors opportunities to make adjustments if actual project  performance is less than anticipated, including recommending any  changes to the Plan. Interim goals are not intended to be standards or  schedules enforceable in court.     (2) To ensure flexibility in implementing the Plan over the next  several decades, and to ensure that interim goals may reflect changed  circumstances or new information resulting from adaptive management,  the interim goals may be modified, consistent with the processes set  forth in paragraph (c) of this section, to reflect new information  resulting from changed or unforeseen circumstances, new scientific or  technical information, new or updated models, or information developed  through the adaptive assessment principles contained in the Plan, or  future authorized changes to the Plan.     (3) The Corps of Engineers and the South Florida Water Management  District and other non-Federal sponsors shall sequence and schedule  projects as necessary to achieve the interim goals and the targets for  achieving progress towards other water-related needs of the region  provided for in the Plan, to the extent practical given funding,  technical, or other constraints.     (4) If the interim goals have not been met or are unlikely to be  met, then the Corps of Engineers and the South Florida Water Management  District shall:     (i) Document why the interim goals have not been met or are  unlikely to be met and either     (ii) Develop a plan of action that achieves the interim goals as  soon as practical consistent with the other objectives of the Plan, and  initiate adaptive management actions pursuant to Sec. 385.31(c) based  on the plan of action; or     (iii) Recommend changes to the interim goals in accordance with  paragraph (b)(2) of this section.     (c) Process for establishing interim goals. (1) In developing  proposed goals for inclusion in the Interim Goals Agreement, the  Secretary, the Secretary of the Interior, and the Governor, shall be  provided with, and consider, the technical recommendations of RECOVER  and any modifications to those recommendations by the Corps of  Engineers or the South Florida Water Management District. These  recommendations shall be provided no later than June 30, 2003.  Thereafter, the Secretary, the Secretary of the Interior, and the  Governor shall provide a notice of availability of the proposed  agreement to the public in the Federal Register, seek public comments,  and consult with the Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Florida, the  Seminole Tribe of Florida, the Environmental Protection Agency, the  Department of the Commerce, the Florida Department of Environmental  Protection, and other Federal, State, and local agencies, and the South  Florida Ecosystem Restoration Task Force. After considering comments of  the public and consulted agencies on the proposed agreement, and  incorporating any suggestions that are appropriate and consistent with  the goals and purposes of the Plan, the Secretary, the Secretary of the  Interior, and the Governor, shall execute the final agreement, and  provide a notice of availability to the public in the Federal Register  by no later than December 31, 2003.     (2) In developing its recommendations for interim goals, RECOVER  shall use the principles in paragraph (d) of this section.     (3) The Secretary, Secretary of the Interior, and the Governor  shall review the proposed interim goals agreement at  [[Page 50572]]  a minimum every five years beginning October 1, 2005, to determine if  the Interim Goals should be revised. Thereafter, the Secretary, the  Secretary of the Interior, and the Governor shall revise the interim  goals as appropriate and execute a new agreement every five years.  However, they may revise interim goals whenever appropriate as new  information becomes available. Any revisions to interim goals shall be  adopted consistent with the process established pursuant to this part.     (d) Principles for developing interim goals. (1) RECOVER, using  best available science and information, shall recommend a set of  interim goals for implementation of CERP, consisting of regional  hydrologic performance targets, improvements in water quality, and  anticipated ecological responses for areas such as, Lake Okeechobee,  the Kissimmee River Region, the Water Conservation Areas, the Lower  East Coast, the Upper East Coast, the Everglades Agricultural Area, and  the Caloosahatchee River, Everglades National Park, Big Cypress  National Preserve, and the estuaries. These interim goals shall reflect  the incremental accomplishment of the expected performance level of the  Plan, and will identify improvements in quantity, quality, timing and  distribution of water in five-year increments beginning in 2005. The  interim goals shall be predicted by appropriate models and tools and  shall provide a quantitative basis for evaluating the restoration  success of the Plan during the period of implementation. The expected  performance level of the Plan is generally represented by the output of  the model run of D-13R as described in the ``Final Integrated  Feasibility Report and Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement''  dated April 1, 1999, as modified by section 601 of WRDA 2000, or any  subsequent modification authorized in law. In developing the interim  goals for the five-year increments, RECOVER shall use the Master  Implementation Sequencing Plan as the basis for predicting the  increments. RECOVER may recommend additional interim goals for  implementation of CERP in addition to those initially developed and may  propose revisions to the initial set of hydrologic interim goals as new  information is gained through adaptive management.     (2) In developing its recommendations for interim goals, RECOVER  shall consider indicators including, but not limited to:     (i) Hydrologic indicators, including:     (A) The amount of water, in addition to the pre-CERP baseline and  assumptions regarding without project conditions, which will be  available to the natural system;     (B) Hydroperiod targets in designated sample areas throughout the  Everglades;     (C) The changes in the seasonal and annual overland flow volumes in  the Everglades which will be available to the natural system;     (D) The frequency of extreme high and low water levels in Lake  Okeechobee;     (E) The frequency of meeting salinity envelopes for the St. Lucie  and Caloosahatchee estuaries; and     (ii) Improvement in water quality; and     (iii) Ecological responses, including:     (A) Increases in total spatial extent of restored wetlands;     (B) Improvement in habitat quality; and     (C) Improvement in native plant and animal abundance.     (3) In developing the interim goals based upon water quality and  expected ecological responses, the Secretary of the Army, the Secretary  of the Interior, and the Governor shall take into consideration the  extent to which actions undertaken by federal, state, tribal, and other  entities under programs not within the scope of this part may effect  achievement of the goals.  Sec. 385.39  Evaluating Progress on achieving other water-related needs  of the region Provided for in the Plan.      (a) Purpose. (1) The overarching objective of the Plan is the  restoration, preservation, and protection of the South Florida  ecosystem while providing for other water-related needs of the region,  including water supply and flood protection. Progress towards providing  for these other water-related needs shall also be evaluated.     (2) As provided for in paragraph (b) of this section, the Corps of  Engineers and the South Florida Water Management District shall  establish targets for evaluating progress towards achieving other  water-related needs of the region, including water supply and flood  protection, throughout the implementation process.     (3) The Corps of Engineers and the South Florida Water Management  District and other non-Federal sponsors shall sequence and schedule  projects as necessary to achieve the targets for other water-related  needs of the region provided for in the Plan, consistent with the  interim goals established pursuant to Sec. 385.38, to the extent  practical given funding, technical, or other constraints.     (4) If the targets for evaluating progress towards achieving other  water-related needs of the region have not been met or are unlikely to  be met, then the Corps of Engineers and the South Florida Water  Management District shall:     (i) Document why the targets have not been met or are unlikely to  be met; and either     (ii) Develop a plan of action that achieves the targets as soon as  practical consistent with the purposes of the Plan and initiate  adaptive management actions pursuant to Sec. 385.31(c) based on the  plan of action; or     (iii) Adopt changes to the targets in accordance with paragraph  (b)(3) of this section.     (b) Process for establishing targets. (1) Not later than June 30,  2003 RECOVER shall develop recommendations on targets to evaluate  progress on achieving the other water-related needs of the region, for  consideration by the Corps of Engineers and the South Florida Water  Management District, in consultation with the Department of the  Interior, the Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Florida, the Seminole  Tribe of Florida, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Department  of Commerce, the Florida Department of Environmental Protection, and  other Federal, State, and local agencies. The Corps of Engineers and  the South Florida Water Management District shall also consult with the  South Florida Ecosystem Restoration Task Force in establishing targets  for evaluating progress towards achieving other water-related needs of  the region provided for in the Plan. These targets shall be established  by the Corps of Engineers and the South Florida Water Management  District by December 30, 2003. Targets for evaluating progress towards  achieving other water-related needs of the region provided for in the  Plan are intended to facilitate inter-agency planning, monitoring, and  assessment throughout the implementation process and are not intended  to be standards or schedules enforceable in court.     (2) In accordance with Sec. 385.18, the Corps of Engineers and the  South Florida Water Management District shall provide the public with  opportunities to review and comment on proposed targets.     (3) The Corps of Engineers and the South Florida Water Management  District shall review the targets for evaluating progress towards  achieving the other water-related needs of the region under the Plan at  a minimum every five years beginning in 2005, to determine if they  should be revised, and revise them as appropriate. However, they may  revise the targets for achieving the other water-related needs of the  [[Page 50573]]  region whenever appropriate as new information becomes available.     (c) Principles for evaluating progress. (1) RECOVER, using best  available science and information, shall recommend a set of targets for  evaluating progress on achieving other water-related needs of the  region provided for in the Plan. These targets shall reflect the  incremental accomplishment of the expected performance level of the  Plan, and will identify improvements in quantity, quality, timing and  distribution of water in five-year increments beginning in 2005. The  targets shall be predicted by appropriate models and tools and shall  provide a quantitative basis for evaluating progress on achieving other  water-related needs of the region provided for in the Plan during the  period of implementation. The expected performance level of the Plan is  generally represented by the output of the model run of D-13R as  described in the ``Final Integrated Feasibility Report and Programmatic  Environmental Impact Statement'' dated April 1, 1999, as modified by  section 601 of WRDA 2000, or any subsequent modification authorized in  law. In developing the targets for the five-year increments, RECOVER  shall use the Master Implementation Sequencing Plan as the basis for  predicting the increments. RECOVER may recommend additional targets for  implementation of CERP in addition to those initially developed and may  propose revisions to the initial set of hydrologic targets as new  information is gained through adaptive management.     (2) In developing its recommendations for targets, RECOVER shall  consider the following indicators, but not limited to:     (i) The frequency of water restrictions in the Lower East Coast  Service Areas at each time increment.     (ii) The frequency of water restrictions in the Lake Okeechobee  Service Areas at each time increment.     (iii) The frequency of meeting salt-water intrusion protection  criteria for the Lower East Coast Service Area at each time increment.  Sec. 385.40  Reports to Congress.      (a) Beginning on October 1, 2005 and periodically thereafter until  October 1, 2036, the Secretary and the Secretary of the Interior shall  jointly submit to Congress a report on the implementation of the Plan  as required by section 601(l) of WRDA 2000. Such reports shall be  completed not less often than every 5 years.     (b) This report shall be prepared in consultation with the  Environmental Protection Agency, the Department of Commerce, the  Seminole Tribe of Florida, the Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Florida,  the Florida Department of Environmental Protection, the South Florida  Water Management District, and other Federal, State, and local agencies  and the South Florida Ecosystem Restoration Task Force.     (c) Such reports shall include a description of planning, design,  and construction work completed, the amount of funds expended during  the period covered by the report, including a detailed analysis of the  funds expended for adaptive management, and the work anticipated over  the next 5-year period and updated estimates of total CERP cost and  individual component costs and an explanation of any changes from the  initial estimates contained in the ``Final Integrated Feasibility  Report and Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement,'' dated April  1, 1999.     (d) In addition, each report shall include:     (1) The determination of each Secretary, and the Administrator of  the Environmental Protection Agency, concerning the benefits to the  natural system and the human environment achieved as of the date of the  report and whether the completed projects of the Plan are being  operated in a manner that is consistent with the requirements of  section 601(h) of WRDA 2000;     (2) Progress towards the interim goals established in accordance  with Sec. 385.38;     (3) Progress towards achieving targets for other water-related  needs of the region provided for in the Plan established pursuant  Sec. 385.39; and     (4) A review of the activities performed by the Secretary pursuant  to section 601(k) of WRDA 2000 and Sec. 385.18 and Se

The decennial census is also used to allocate federal funds and provide essential demographic, social, and economic data about the nation. In addition, the state governments use decennial census data to redistrict their legislatures. A large infrastructure is required to conduct the national population count. For the year 2000 decennial, over 1,000 census offices are involved in data collection and processing. This review focuses on the 520 local offices, of which 130 are early-opening local census offices (ELCOs) and 390 are local census offices (LCOs). These offices represent the largest proportion of the space that the bureau has acquired, totaling over 3.9 million (rentable) square feet throughout the nation. Each ELCO and LCO must meet the bureau's specifications and be outfitted with telecommunications, security and office equipment, furniture, and supplies. The purpose of our review was to determine whether the acquisition of space, equipment and supplies, and other lease-related procurement actions of the Decennial Census Field Office Acquisitions Program, were carried out properly, effectively, and on time. Due to the fast pace of the lease acquisition program and to ensure that our initial observations were provided in time to have an impact on the program, we issued an interim memorandum to the Census Bureau's Deputy Director and Chief Operating Officer on May 7, 1999. Our interim observations, as well as our overall review findings, concern the 2000 decennial but some also highlight lessons learned and issues that may prove to be relevant for the year 2010 decennial. Census/GSA partnership delivered office space but the bureau needs to make a final evaluation of the leasing program when it is complete The Census Bureau and GSA formed a partnership--Joint Venture 2000--as a means to provide the bureau with leased space equipped to conduct the 2000 decennial. The partnership obtained leases, oversaw the build-out construction of offices, arranged for security and for data and voice telecommunications, and provided office equipment and supplies. While LCO office openings were targeted to be completed in three waves ending September 1, 1999, sufficient time was available to complete leasing and preparation of offices that did not meet the schedule. By mid-November, all 520 local census offices were operational. The leasing effort was able to be completed despite two complicating factors: (1) the late finalization of plans resulting from the bureau's need to lease more space than anticipated when a ruling by the Supreme Court limited the use of sampling to non-reapportionment activities, and (2) a strong economy that created a difficult real estate market in which to obtain some short-term, small office leases as well i   U.S. Department of Commerce Office of Inspector General  Final Report IPE-11573 September 2000  as the tradespeople and technicians necessary to prepare the space. Both Census and GSA had to undertake an intensive, sustained effort to deliver the more than 1,000 offices nationwide that are now serving as the infrastructure for the decennial census (see page 6). While there were some difficulties in a few regions, Census and GSA worked reasonably well together to complete this extensive project. The partners have improved communications and working relations since Phase I office openings in late 1998. However, the partnership has been a complex and occasionally cumbersome effort, subject to some strains between the agencies. Although the bureau made an initial assessment of the partnership in the first phase, the bureau also needs to assess its overall costs, benefits, and results soon after the 2000 decennial is completed to help determine whether a similar partnership between the bureau and GSA should be used for the 2010 decennial (see page 9). There are some lessons to be learned from the bureau's real estate operations There are lessons to be learned from the leasing activities for this decennial. The bureau's real estate operations could be improved by ensuring that the area of the market search for space for each ELCO and LCO--the delineated area--is broad enough to ensure adequate competition (see page 14). Specifically, we found in decennial 2000: C Some leases from the initial phase of local office openings were awarded without adequate competition. This was largely because a number of the delineated areas were narrowly drawn, limiting the number of lessors who could bid on the leases. As a result, at those sites, the lease offers were more expensive than anticipated, and Census lost valuable time in again trying to find more affordable space. However, the bureau made a concerted effort to broaden its delineated areas in the second phase of the leasing operations, in which it acquired leased space for 390 LCOs. Greater attention to and standardization of file management across regions would aid management oversight and promote better internal record-keeping and retention of records.  C  The bureau needs to improve planning for decennial leasing and office preparations The bureau was late in finalizing its programmatic plans. According to the bureau, this was largely due to the necessity of waiting for resolution of the sampling controversy by the Supreme Court. But the bureau developed incomplete requirements based on those plans, and sometimes made changes that disrupted operations. This can be demonstrated in the area of telecommunications: (see page 23).  ii   U.S. Department of Commerce Office of Inspector General  Final Report IPE-11573 September 2000  C  Planning for the telecommunications system should have been better coordinated and more focused on the overall requirements. Significant changes to the requirements had to be made to add additional lines for job recruiting activity, a more complex call routing subsystem, and voice mail. These changes increased telecommunications costs and delayed the planned opening and operation of some ELCOs and LCOs.  The bureau needs to expand its use of formal business case analyses The bureau used formal business case analyses to guide its decisions for the leasing and related operations. While the analyses were sometimes incomplete, their use as management tools represented a significant improvement in the bureau's effort to strengthen its management process (see page 26). The bureau's interagency agreement with GSA for the space leasing project still needs to be signed The Census Bureau and GSA developed the Joint Venture 2000 partnership through a memorandum of understanding whereby GSA was to acquire office space and provide telecommunication lines, furniture, supplies, and office equipment based on requirements specified by the bureau. While the partnership seemed to work reasonably well, we found some shortcomings in the memorandum of understanding between the bureau and GSA (see page 28). C The agreement for Phase II of the leasing operations still needs to be signed, especially since it covers the close-out and property disposition services for the leased offices. The draft Census Bureau partnership agreement does not cover the responsibilities of brokers, the extent of their authority, estimated cost for their use, and the responsibilities of the bureau or GSA in managing them. This should have been discussed in the MOU to avoid misunderstandings or unwarranted costs.  C  Census could have made greater use of build-out financing Most of the ELCOs and LCOs must undergo interior alterations (or a ""build-out"") to configure those offices to bureau specifications. The lessor is given the option in negotiations of either including the build-out cost in the rent or receiving a lump sum payment from GSA upon completion of the build-out effort and before bureau occupancy. While the lump-sum payment is generally more advantageous to the government, the bureau made relatively few up-front payments of build-out costs early in the campaign in order to save resources for the most difficult real estate markets at the end. When we first reported this observation to the bureau in April 1999, the Census Bureau had a targeted amount of $8 million to use for up-front build-out expenses. We emphasized, and the bureau agreed, that full iii   U.S. Department of Commerce Office of Inspector General  Final Report IPE-11573 September 2000  commitment of build-out funds could aid in contract negotiations, eliminate the lessors' approximate 12 percent finance costs (which the lessor then recovered through the contract), encourage more timely alterations, and maximize cost savings. In the final series of lease agreements, the bureau, through a prompt directive to the field, took considerably greater advantage of build-out financing and spent a total of approximately $10 million on it. This enabled the bureau to save over $980,000, including over $476,000 in funds put to better use since April 1999 (see page 31).  In its response to our draft report, the Census Bureau concurred with all of the recommendations. Most recommendations, with the exception of recommendation 9, point to the 2010 decennial, and we are in agreement with the bureau that it should capture the lessons learned from the 2000 decennial, build on its successes, and make the recommended improvements where necessary. In that regard, the bureau stated that it plans to initiate an independent evaluation of the partnership with GSA, and it will use the findings from that evaluation as the primary planning tool for the 2010 space and leasing program. Census also said that it concurred with recommendation 9, which called for finalization of the memorandum of understanding between the bureau and GSA for the current decennial, but the bureau did not say that it would conclude such an agreement. We still believe that such an agreement is important to protect the department's interests, especially for the remaining closeout and disposition of property phase. We reiterate our recommendation that the MOU be finalized between the bureau and GSA as soon as possible.  iv   U.S. Department of Commerce Office of Inspector General  Final Report IPE-11573 September 2000  INTRODUCTION Pursuant to the authority of the Inspector General Act of 1978, as amended, the Office of Inspector General conducted an inspection of the Decennial Census Field Office Acquisitions Program, focusing on the Bureau of the Census's efforts to lease office space around the nation for the 2000 decennial. We also reviewed certain aspects of the bureau's acquisition of equipment and supplies needed to operate these offices and conduct the census. Inspections are special reviews that the OIG undertakes to provide agency managers with information about operations, including current and foreseeable problems. Inspections are also performed to detect and prevent fraud, waste, and abuse and to encourage effective, efficient, and economical operations. By highlighting problems, the OIG intends to help managers move quickly to address those identified during the inspection and avoid their recurrence. Inspections may also highlight effective programs or operations, particularly if they may be useful or adaptable for agency managers or program operations elsewhere. We conducted our inspection from January 12 through August 9, 1999, with subsequent updates with bureau managers through February 2000. The inspection was performed in accordance with the Quality Standards for Inspections issued by the President's Council on Integrity and Efficiency. At the conclusion of the inspection, we discussed our observations and recommendations with the bureau's Deputy Director and Chief Operating Officer, the Special Assistant for Field Logistics Operations, and the National Program Manager of the Decennial Census Field Office Acquisitions Program. On May 7, 1999, we provided the Census Bureau with an interim memo on our observations, including some that required immediate attention. Our recommendations in this review concern the 2000 decennial but some also highlight lessons learned and issues that may prove to be relevant for the year 2010 decennial. PURPOSE AND SCOPE The purpose of our review was to determine whether the Census Bureau's acquisition of space and outfitting of offices by the Decennial Census Field Office Acquisitions Program were being carried out properly and would be completed on time. The challenges associated with entering into hundreds of short-term leases for real property across the U.S. and with procuring office equipment and furniture, within a short time-frame, were great. Such a large effort also exposed the bureau to potential fraud, waste, and abuse and therefore constituted areas of inquiry for our review. Our overall objective was to evaluate the bureau's stewardship of government funds and resources in support of the 2000 decennial leasing effort.  1   U.S. Department of Commerce Office of Inspector General  Final Report IPE-11573 September 2000  The scope of our inspection included reviewing and assessing the bureau's overall lease-acquisition strategy, including (1) space requirement estimates, property requests, and project schedules to determine if, overall, these would result in adequate leased space delivered on time, (2) the adequacy of and reasonableness of the costs that Census paid for leased space and other acquisition activities, (3) the adequacy of the acquisition of telecommunications and services, security equipment and services, and office furniture, and (4) the efficiency, effectiveness, and fairness in contracting for the space-related items. Our review focused on the leasing and operational preparation of 520 local offices (130 early-opening local census offices--ELCOs--and 390 local census offices--LCOs) which accounted for most of the rentable square footage. We did not review the leasing of the 13 Regional Census Centers (RCCs) because they were already up and running at the time of our field work. We did not visit the 13 Regional Accuracy and Coverage Evaluation Offices, but we monitored the lease acquisition and office preparation process through interviews with headquarters staff and by following progress recorded in both Census and GSA Internet-based logistics tracking systems. Nor did we include the 494 smaller census field offices and block canvassing field offices, the three Data Capture Centers, or the National Processing Center in the scope of our review. Census has 12 regional offices located in Atlanta, Boston, Charlotte, Chicago, Dallas, Denver, Detroit, Kansas City (Missouri), Los Angeles, New York, Philadelphia, and Seattle. To conduct the 2000 decennial, the bureau opened RCCs in each of these regions and in Puerto Rico. As part of our review, we inspected local office leasing operations handled in six RCCs: Boston, Chicago, Detroit, Kansas City, New York, and Philadelphia, including onsite visits to 14 ELCOs in the Chicago, Detroit, Kansas City, and New York regions. In most cases, we had access to the bureau's detailed leasing files and reviewed the methodology of the leasing operations. Our review also included an analysis of the bureau's interagency agreement with the General Services Administration (GSA), known as the Joint Venture 2000 Partnership, and of the bureau's overall acquisition and procurement processes for the leasing operations, whether conducted through the GSA partnership or by the bureau's direct procurement actions. In conducting our review, we examined correspondence and other documents to determine if the Census/GSA relationship proceeded effectively enough to award the LCO leases on time and within reasonable costs. In doing so, we analyzed a sample of real property leases for temporary office space, lease and purchase actions for office equipment, and the interagency agreements with GSA for supplies and support services. We also conducted interviews with members of the Census Bureau/GSA ""core team,"" Census regional directors and leasing specialists and other staff in six RCCs and visited staff in 14 ELCOs in four regions: Chicago, Detroit, Kansas City, and New York. We also interviewed a human relations consultant hired by the partnership.  2   U.S. Department of Commerce Office of Inspector General  Final Report IPE-11573 September 2000  BACKGROUND The U.S. Constitution requires that a population count be conducted every 10 years for the purpose of apportioning the seats in the House of Representatives among the states. The Bureau of the Census's decennial census, which is the nation's largest statistical data-gathering program, is also used to allocate federal funding, and provide essential demographic, economic and social data for businesses, researchers, educators, governments, and private citizens. In addition, numerous states use decennial census data to redistrict their state legislatures. To satisfy both the Congress and the Administration, the Census Bureau initially issued a dual-track operational plan for the decennial, with one track employing sampling and the other track using traditional census-taking methods, commonly referred to as ""full enumeration."" The bureau had wanted to employ statistical sampling of non-respondents for all purposes: apportionment, legislative redistricting, and the allocation of federal funding. It had supported the sampling strategy in the hope of improving the accuracy of the decennial count while also reducing systematic undercounts. However, in January of 1999, the Supreme Court ruled that the bureau could not employ statistical sampling for the apportionment of congressional seats among the states. This decision did not preclude the use of a sampling process for other purposes, such as state redistricting and allocation of federal funding. After the Supreme Court ruling, the bureau issued a final operational plan utilizing both a traditional count and post-enumeration sampling for an accuracy check. The Department's decision to use both Censustaking methods affected leasing operations since the decision meant that the bureau would need to hire more enumerators, acquire additional space to house and manage them, and provide separate space for quality control involving sampling. At the time of our review, the bureau had already begun the process of opening and operating a national network of 1,044 temporary offices from which employees would collect and process the data for the 2000 decennial. Establishing this office network required the leasing of office space, the leasing and purchasing of furniture and equipment, the installation of computer hardware and software, and the establishment of voice and data line telecommunications. As of February 23, 1999, the bureau finalized its requirements, in accordance with the Supreme Court ruling to follow the traditional, ""full enumeration,"" operational plan but also conduct post-enumeration sampling for an accuracy check. For the first time since the 1970 decennial, Census partnered telecommunications services, and much of the required office offices. The bureau and GSA entered into an agreement, the which the bureau utilized GSA's Public Buildings Service for Service to obtain telecommunication services, and its Federal furniture. with GSA to lease space and acquire equipment and supplies, for its decennial Joint Venture 2000 partnership, through space acquisition, its Federal Technology Supply Service to obtain supplies and  3   U.S. Department of Commerce Office of Inspector General  Final Report IPE-11573 September 2000  Before 1970, Census obtained leased space on its own. In 1970, it enlisted the services of GSA for the first time but was critical of the quality of some of the space GSA had obtained. Some offices were reportedly low-grade or in unsafe neighborhoods, although this was due partly to the uneven quality of available space at that time. As a result of that experience, the bureau decided to conduct its own space acquisition for the 1980 and 1990 decennials. Due to delays in the 2000 decennial budgetary allocations connected with the long-standing sampling debate, the bureau was behind schedule in leasing preparations compared with previous decennials. As a result, the bureau's Deputy Director suggested on February 17, 1998, that the bureau form a partnership with GSA for the 2000 decennial. This partnership was formed and performance measures developed with the involvement of the National Performance Review.1 The partners hoped that by utilizing their own expertise, greater efficiencies would result and advantages would accrue to both agencies. The bureau would be able to focus more on its mission in conducting the decennial, and GSA would be able to demonstrate its service orientation to a major government client with special needs. The basic division of labor was for GSA to provide space, telecommunications, supplies, and some office equipment, while the Census Bureau was to provide lease requirements, specifications, procurement justifications (as required), some oversight and approval of key decisions, and funding for the direct cost of these goods and services, plus GSA's fees. The bureau developed a plan to open offices sequentially and have them perform major decennial functions from June 1, 1998, to December 31, 2000 (see the chart on page 6). The plan called for opening 520 ELCOs and LCOs nationwide as opposed to the 476 that would have been needed had sampling been used to complete the decennial. These offices were to have been delivered in two phases, with 130 ELCOs opened by the end of FY 1998 (Phase I), and 390 LCOs opened by the end of FY 1999 (Phase II). The first phase was operated as a trial run to ensure that the Census/GSA partnership would produce adequate leased space for the required 130 ELCOs within reasonable time and cost objectives. The bureau determined that the first phase was a success and continued the Joint Venture 2000 arrangement with GSA by authorizing the second phase of leasing. The bureau's office structure for the full enumeration plan called for 1,044 offices, including the following: C 13 Regional Census Centers--12 in the continental United States as well as one in Puerto Rico--have been open since March 1998. Through a network of Census field offices, the RCCs manage all census field data collection operations, such as listing addresses, coordinating the Local Update of Census Addresses program, producing and updating maps, working with  The National Performance Review, now renamed the National Partnership for Reinventing Government, is the administration's task force intended to reform major government functions through such initiatives as better customer service, employee empowerment, partnerships, interagency cooperation, and ""reinvention.""  1  4   U.S. Department of Commerce Office of Inspector General  Final Report IPE-11573 September 2000  local participants to provide redistricting data to the states, and recruiting temporary field staff. Each RCC requires a support staff of approximately 135 employees and 14,000 to 26,000 usable square feet of space. C 494 Census Field Offices (CFOs) were opened by March 1999 and after completing their functions, were closed by August, 1999. These offices conducted local recruiting and performed address listing and the subsequent clerical review of address lists. These offices required about 500 usable square feet for four employees.  2  C  520 Local Census Offices were scheduled to be opened, in successive waves, beginning in October 1998. Each LCO office, with an average staff of 44, required between 7,000 and 8,500 usable square feet. The first group of 130 Early Local Census Offices, delivered in Phase I, were initially smaller--consisting of approximately 6,000 square feet of usable space and had to be expanded during Phase II. Phase II saw the scheduled opening of an additional 390 of the larger LCOs beginning in September 1999. LCOs produce enumerator maps and assignments and conduct local recruiting, block canvassing, outreach and promotion, group quarters and service-based enumeration, update leave and enumeration activities, non-response follow-up and address verifications. 13 Regional Accuracy and Coverage Evaluation Offices (ACEROs) were added on to 13 LCOs by September 1999. In addition, the 130 existing ELCOs had to be expanded to add functionally separate space for the Accuracy and Coverage Evaluation survey, which functions as a sampling quality check on the decennial. One National Processing Center and three new Data Capture Centers were opened by September 1999. These centers will check in mail returns and electronically collate questionnaire data. The National Processing Center, in addition to functioning as a Data Capture Center, also processes address lists and questionnaire data.  C  C  These functions are authorized by Public Law 94-171, the Redistricting Data Program.

As shown in the chart above, the procurement of these 520 ELCOs and LCOs was organized into two phases and four waves (waves 4, 9, 10, and 11) within those phases. The Acquisition Process Upon initiating the Phase II LCO leasing operations, the bureau attempted to standardize the site survey process in the hopes of consistently obtaining leased space at reasonable prices. GSA first determined the availability of government-owned or already leased space which could be used for a census office. 6   U.S. Department of Commerce Office of Inspector General  Final Report IPE-11573 September 2000  When government-controlled space was not available, GSA and the bureau jointly identified available privately owned space and went about acquiring it. To promote competition, this process called for conducting market surveys of potential sites, with the most favorable sites receiving a solicitation from GSA to make an offer to the government--a Solicitation for Offer (SFO). This process can be visualized as a funnel in which the selection of options for office space is progressively narrowed (see figure 1).  Figure 1 - The Acquisition Funnel  Sites Surveyed  Sites Approved  Solicitations for Offers Issued  Offers Made  Best Offer Accepted  7   U.S. Department of Commerce Office of Inspector General  Final Report IPE-11573 September 2000  Generally, the more options that Census has in each stage of the acquisition process--such as the more sites surveyed, the identification of many eligible sites, or the more SFOs sent out--the more offers generated, and, hence, the more alternatives available for the bureau at competitive prices. Site surveys constitute an especially important stage because surveying a large number of sites allows the bureau and GSA to better pinpoint the most desirable properties, and to better choose those sites that should receive SFOs. If a number of quality offers are generated, the bureau is then in a good position to state its preferences and to allow GSA to bargain for and obtain preferred space at a good price.  8   U.S. Department of Commerce Office of Inspector General  Final Report IPE-11573 September 2000  OBSERVATIONS AND CONCLUSIONS I. Census/GSA Partnership Delivered Office Space but the Bureau Needs to Make a Final Evaluation of the Leasing Program When It Is Complete  All 520 ELCO and LCO Census offices were successfully opened. Working under guidelines set by the bureau and with the aid of the bureau's own leasing specialists, the Census/GSA partnership succeeded in leasing, overseeing the build-out of offices, arranging for data and voice telecommunications and security systems, and providing office equipment and supplies. This was done reasonably on schedule although there were glitches and slippages, as can be expected in an undertaking of this magnitude. Lessons learned from Phase I leasing helped the bureau tackle the later phase of leasing and office preparation. Despite slippages and some later reports of office quality problems, we found that offices of good or at least reasonable quality were opened in sufficient time to not jeopardize operations. However, the Census/GSA collaboration, given the scope of the effort, was not easy. We are recommending that the bureau evaluate the overall results of its collaboration with GSA shortly after the 2000 decennial offices are closed, to help make an early decision on whether the bureau wishes to employ a similar leasing strategy for the 2010 decennial. Offices Opened in Time for Operations The partnership clearly learned important lessons from Phase I and adapted its operations for Phase II. As the Director of the Census Bureau testified in early 2000,3 the partnership had to secure these decennial office leases while the nation experienced a strong economy. It was more difficult to obtain short-term, small office leases in a tight real estate market. More time and effort, therefore, had to be spent both by the bureau and GSA staff in locating sites and negotiating leases. The office preparation process was harder to manage in a period when carpenters, electricians, plumbers, and telephone and computer technicians were also in short supply due to the construction boom. However, none of these difficult conditions proved insurmountable. Census learned from the experience of Phase I that the partnership's resources were stretched thin in efforts to open all 130 ELCOs by October 1, 1998. Thus, it knew that it would not be able to open the remaining 390 offices by a single target date. The partnership planned to open the 390 LCOs in three successive waves with initial target dates of July 1, August 1, and September 1, 1999, with some  Prepared Testimony of Dr. Kenneth Prewitt, Director, U.S. Bureau of the Census, at the U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Government Reform, Subcommittee on the Census, Hearing on Preparations for the Decennial Census, February 8, 2000  3  . 9   U.S. Department of Commerce Office of Inspector General  Final Report IPE-11573 September 2000  leeway after those dates for the completion of late offices. Although 17 Phase I offices were not open by October 1, 1998, only 12 Phase II offices did not meet the September 1, 1999 target date. In other words, in Phase I, 13 percent of LCOs did not meet the target date, while in Phase II, only 3 percent were not opened by the three scheduled dates. The New York region, with its overheated real estate market, had some of the most difficult problems in securing adequate space, delaying the start of build-out and telecommunications installations. The Seattle region had delays due to the phone installation contractors. Other dense metropolitan regions--Boston, Los Angeles and Chicago--had similar but less daunting challenges. By June 15, 1999, 18 out of the remaining 390 offices had serious ""red-flag"" problems and were in danger of the lease not being secured or the office not being able to open. The problems included such things as disputes over the terms of the lease, deals falling through, the search for alternative space, or unavailable contractors. By July 15, the red-flags had been reduced to 9, but cautionary ""yellow flags"" concerning potentially disruptive details of LCO preparation were on the upswing from 17 in mid-June to 35 in mid-July. More than half of the red-flags (5 out of 9) were in one region--New York.4 Nonetheless, by mid-November, with the exception of the LCO in Glendale, California, which had delays connected with the city permitting process, all 520 local census offices nationwide were operational. During October and November, 1999, the bureau did not need a full staff and was hiring ""skeleton crews"" for each LCO--an LCO manager, 3 assistant managers for recruiting, administration, and field operations, respectively, and an administrative assistant--who set up their offices and launched personnel recruiting drives. If an office was not open in October or early November, the staff was able to use nearby LCOs to do recruiting work. The full office staff of 44 temporary workers was not needed at each LCO until December, so a sufficient time margin was available to bring on line those offices that were not yet operational by the target opening date. These margins were AugustSeptember for waves 9 and 10 with target opening dates of July 1 or August 1, 1999, and Octobermid-November for the final wave 11 with a September 1, 1999, target date. While outside the scope of this review, we note that in the period from June 1, 1998, to March 1, 1999, the partnership also opened 494 census field offices and block canvas field offices. These were considerably smaller store-front style spaces, reportedly not nearly as difficult for the partnership to lease. In addition, as a result of the bureau's new operational plan for a traditional count with a sampling quality check, each of the original 130 ELCOs needed approximately 1000 more square feet Not all of the New York offices turned out to be adequate and problems persist. In late February, the bureau was reportedly attempting to correct persistent problems at the Harlem LCO with trash, rodents, plumbing leaks, a malfunctioning sprinkler system, and frequent lack of running water. The bureau is considering a move if necessary. 4  10   U.S. Department of Commerce Office of Inspector General  Final Report IPE-11573 September 2000  of space for an additional room with a separate entrance for Accuracy and Coverage Evaluation activities and more storage space. Combined with the need for the 13 new ACEROs, the expanded ELCOs constituted an additional 143 expansion projects for the partnership to complete in addition to the 1015 offices already planned and in various stages of leasing. At the end of February 2000, only 4 of the expansion projects had not been completed. The Seattle Region had the most difficulty nationwide with the inefficiency of its telecommunications contractors. Telecommunication installation in the nation's Pacific Northwest was often delayed because of the long distances installers or repair personnel had to travel. A total of 17,000 telephone lines nationwide were installed and are operational. In our visits to 14 ELCOs, we found that the offices provided pleasant and well-designed space with acceptable layout and apparently good workflow, although one ELCO was a bit crowded. There were acceptable lavatory facilities in 12 of the14 offices, but one office had frequent problems with the residential-grade toilets that had been installed, and another ELCO had the lavatories inconveniently located. We found a functional mix of permanent and disposable furniture, operating security systems, and acceptable public access or parking space at all offices. Staff were attending to all the above problems. We also found safety concerns, given the location of one ELCO in a high-crime area, some computer problems still being worked on, a high noise level in one Chicago LCO, and, at all ELCOs visited, problems with telephone systems (see page 22). A Working Partnership Each regional Census/GSA partnership had to be forged at the local level, where staff adjusted their roles to those of their partners and to the specific requirements, obstacles, and work pressures faced in getting the offices open. Overall, the partnership with GSA appeared to be working and improved as the initial group of offices were secured. The Field Division actively monitored the dynamics and effectiveness of the partnership at the regional level, and took steps to improve working relations between the bureau and GSA in a few regions in Phase II. A consultant 5 identified both strengths and weaknesses in the leasing process, thereby enabling the Joint Venture 2000 national core team to clarify roles in Phase II and strengthen collaboration in those regions that were having difficulties. Given the intensity and demands of their task, there were a few understandable strains, discussed below, but Census and GSA staffs were able to get the job done according to the bureau's stringent requirements and within an acceptable schedule.  Monroe-Cook & Associates, ""Presentation Report: Qualitative Evaluation of Joint Venture 2000 Communications Perspective,"" September 1998.  5  11   U.S. Department of Commerce Office of Inspector General  Final Report IPE-11573 September 2000  Although each regional partnership was subject to the same demanding timetable, in many regions communications and cooperation were quite good, but in some regions the strains of the acquisition process affected the level of communication and the willingness of the partners to act as a team. Team members also developed contrasting perspectives on the partnership, which contributed to tensions in some regions during Phase I and less so in Phase II. Census Bureau leasing specialists and project managers, for example, sometimes believed that GSA often emphasized getting the job done at the expense of ""getting it done right."" GSA staff and managers, on the other hand, tended to believe that bureau staff often emphasized procedure and doing more searching than necessary at the expense of getting the job done efficiently. They were under pressure to get their Census work done quickly, because, as they put it, the bureau was ""not our only client."" In a few regions, bureau staff and managers felt that GSA was treating them as just another client, not as the ""prime customer"" as GSA had promised. In part, these misperceptions between GSA and the bureau resulted from Census needs and requirements not being communicated by GSA managers down to their street-level staff, a flaw that was largely corrected in Phase II. The partnership management team devised a division of labor that was incorporated in the MOU but the matter of oversight was not addressed. From a consultant's partnership surveys 6 and our interviews, we learned that bureau staff in a number of regions and in both phases expressed varying degrees of dissatisfaction with such matters as their limited participation in market surveys and the amount of information shared between Census and GSA. GSA managers and staff, however, occasionally felt constrained both by the many bureau requirements--such as the need for a good location in relation to population, public access, and, if possible, a modern infrastructure that would support computers--and the bureau staff's double-checking. In Phase II, these tensions and communications problems were considerably alleviated by weekly partnership team meetings allowing each side to feel far more comfortable with their partner's mode of operation. Overall, tensions varied across regions, but tended to be higher in those activities where Census and GSA regional team members had overlapping responsibilities (see appendix, page 36). We found that differences arose between the bureau and GSA's Public Building Service on tasks that required the most collaboration, such as market surveys or the evaluation of offers from potential lessors. Bureau staff often questioned whether (1) the market survey included enough good choices, (2) offers were coming in at a favorable or reasonable price, and (3) GSA was obtaining the best deal for the bureau. In one region, GSA management replaced a project director to keep the relationship with the bureau flexible and communications open. In most regions however, teams were able to work things out, Surveys conducted by Alternative Solutions, Inc., a partnership contractor, were cited in ""Securing Space and Services to Support Field Operations: A Business Case Analysis,"" U.S. Bureau of the Census, November 1998. 6  12   U.S. Department of Commerce Office of Inspector General  Final Report IPE-11573 September 2000  maintain good working relationships, and overcome the largely surmountable difficulties that accompany high-pressure collaborative work of this kind and reflect normal frustrations with an unwieldy partnership tasked with completing a large project on a fixed schedule. The bureau should assess the benefits and costs of its partnership with GSA The question remains whether a similar partnership between the bureau and GSA, or a arrangement, should be used to secure leased space for the 2010 decennial. Although an initial assessment of the partnership,7 before retaining GSA as its partner and agent overall costs, benefits, and results of the partnership still need to be assessed either by an independent party soon after the 2000 decennial is completed. modified the bureau made in Phase II, the the bureau or by  In responding to our draft report, the Census Bureau concurs with our recommendation that an evaluation of the Census/GSA partnership model should be performed. The Bureau intends to initiate such an evaluation by an independent party after the completed closing of the LCOs in the fall of 2000 and to use the findings from the evaluation as the primary planning tool for the 2010 space and leasing program. The bureau agrees with our assessment that the partnership learned important lessons from Phase I of the agreement and successfully adapted its operations for Phase II.  Alternative Solutions, Inc. positively characterized the partnership in Phase I. This was cited in the Business Case Analysis, U.S. Bureau of the Census, November 1998.

There Are Some Lessons to Be Learned from the Bureau's Real Estate Operations  While the Census/GSA partnership did succeed in getting all of the LCOs open before the end of November, there are some ""lessons learned"" and best practices that can be applied during the 2010 decennial. For example, during the initial phases of the ELCO/LCO leasing program, the bureau sometimes limited its ability to obtain leased space by defining ELCO delineated boundaries too narrowly. However, we found that Phase II leasing efforts were significantly improved because the bureau expanded the size of the geographical areas it considered for obtaining leased space. In addition, we noted that RCC leasing-related file management should be improved. A. The bureau initially drew lease delineated areas too narrowly  A number of leases from the initial phase of local office openings were awarded without adequate competition. This lack of competition resulted primarily from the fact that many of the delineated areas for specific leases were narrowly drawn, thereby limiting the number of lessors who could bid on the leases. As a result, at a number of sites, the leases were more expensive than anticipated, and the Census Bureau had to expand its delineated areas and begin the lease acquisition process again. This lost valuable time. Delineated areas refer to the specified geographic area within which the government will consider renting office space. It was the Census Bureau's responsibility to define the delineated area for each local census office for GSA. GSA and, in some regions, bureau personnel conducted market surveys within the delineated area to identify potential lessors. Once potential offerors were identified, a solicitation was prepared by GSA, citing the delineated area identified that is then issued only to the identified potential offerors. Once received, formal offers were then negotiated until one site was chosen for the ELCO or LCO, representing what was supposed to be the best overall value to the government.8 The delineated areas were developed by the bureau based on the combination of several factors such as population density and dispersal, public access, and logistical considerations (which were especially important in geographically large, thinly populated congressional districts). The bureau had a stated goal of placing at least one ELCO or LCO in each congressional district and the ELCO/LCO coverage areas often correlate closely with existing congressional districts. Nevertheless, Census had sound protocols for setting ELCO/LCO boundaries and these boundaries did not always match those of  Normally, the federal government would advertise its lease requirements for a given delineated area before the issuance of a solicitation to maximize interest among potential lessors. In the case of the decennial, however, the bureau and GSA opted to rely on market surveys because of the large number and relatively small size of offices to be leased.  8  14   U.S. Department of Commerce Office of Inspector General  Final Report IPE-11573 September 2000  congressional districts. The ELCO/LCO coverage area boundaries were modified by interim estimates of population and households so that ELCO and LCO offices could be centrally located, where possible. In planning Phase I ELCOs, several regional offices drew some delineated areas too narrowly in an attempt to precisely place offices. This created problems, initially, in the effort to secure office space at a reasonable cost and within acceptable time frames. For instance, the ELCO in Norristown, Pennsylvania, an outlying suburb of Philadelphia, had only one lessor submit an offer because the delineated area was limited to the municipal boundaries of Norristown (see figure 2). Norristown is only one of several municipalities within the area where the ELCO could have been placed. The Norristown lease is expensive for the area. The landlord originally quoted $29.50/square foot, more than 13 percent over the highest average class A office space in Philadelphia.9 The $29.50/square foot quote included unlimited heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) and unlimited use of the 6,600 square foot (usable) space. The bureau--through GSA--entered into negotiations and rejected this offer as too high. However, the landlord persisted through hard bargaining and charged additional costs for overtime HVAC and daytime janitorial services. The bureau and GSA estimate that the lease as signed will cost approximately $27.60/square foot, but if the office sees heavy overtime usage, the cost could be considerably higher. For instance, overtime HVAC of $20/hour for only 10 hours each week would add an overtime utility cost of $10,400, or approximately $1.50 square foot in additional rent for the 24-month lease. Nonetheless, the bureau agreed to the lease because the Norristown ELCO was already behind schedule, and the bureau was reluctant to take the additional time needed to expand the delineated area and start over.

This is the same data that the bureau used in developing its baseline leasing budget and Phase II leasing study.  9  15   U.S. Department of Commerce Office of Inspector General  Final Report IPE-11573 September 2000  Figure 4: Delineated Area Within the Norristown, Pennsylvania, LCO Boundaries  Legend ,, Census ELCO Congressional District LCO Boundary Delineated Area LCO Coverage Area  Another example is the small delineated area specified for the ELCO in Troy, Michigan, a northern suburb of the city of Detroit (see figure 3). Regional bureau personnel in Detroit believed that one particular light industrial center was well situated for the office in terms of population distribution and logistical placement. They assumed that at least one of the landlords in this industrial center would make space available for the ELCO. The delineated area was therefore drawn to encompass this particular business center which covered only one third of a square mile. The area also included a small municipal airport, further reducing the number of potential landlords.  16   U.S. Department of Commerce Office of Inspector General  Final Report IPE-11573 September 2000  However, when GSA and the bureau contacted potential lessors, none were interested in leasing to the government. A lease was later signed on another property located outside the original delineated area, but only after a significant delay.10 The office did not open on schedule. In fact, the Troy ELCO was the last ELCO in the nation to begin operations. The impact of this was that temporary bureau employees were not hired in time and key operations were delayed, including block canvassing. During our inspection, we observed temporary decennial workers who had been bused in 255 miles from Cincinnati, Ohio, because of the shortage of local workers. As a result of narrowly defined delineated areas during Phase I, the bureau's options of available lease space were limited, resulting in higher costs--as was the case with the Norristown ELCO. In other cases, such as the Troy ELCO, the bureau had to expand the delineated areas and repeat its effort to acquire space, which compressed the available lead time before the offices were due to open. This led to higher costs and delays in operations in Phase I.  Class A Detroit office space outside the central business district ranges in cost from $18/square foot to $24/square foot. The Troy ELCO was leased at an annual rate of approximately $18.50/sf. See the Society of Industrial and Office Realtors, Comparative Statistics of Industrial and Office Real Estate Markets, 1998, page 230.  10  17   U.S. Department of Commerce Office of Inspector General  Final Report IPE-11573 September 2000  Figure 3 - Troy Michigan ELCO Boundary and the Original Delineated Area  18   U.S. Department of Commerce Office of Inspector General  Final Report IPE-11573 September 2000  We noted a concerted effort by Census to broaden its delineated areas in Phase II of the leasing operations for the acquisition of leased space for 390 LCOs. Rather than describing narrow areas--sometimes with a block-by-block description--entire groups of municipalities have been used as delineated areas for many Phase II LCOs. The result has been greater competition and relatively greater access to space while maintaining the required leasing schedule.11 We recommend that in the 2010 decennial, the bureau draw its delineated areas as broadly as possible to increase competition between potential offerors for LCO lease space. This greater competition should not only reduce the bureau's overall lease costs, but should also ensure that it has alternative space available when unforeseen difficulties prevent a lease award.  The Census Bureau, in responding to our draft report, agreed with our recommendation to draw delineated areas as broadly as possible in the 2010 decennial. The bureau states that it will make additional efforts in 2010 to address the issue of adequate competition in the lease acquisition process, based, in part, on the Census 2000 experience. The bureau commented that initially smaller boundaries were draw in Phase I with the intention of expanding these boundaries where necessary. The bureau noted, however, that with the accelerated schedule and the late start of the actual space acquisition process, GSA did not have time in Phase I to conduct additional market surveys as the delineated areas were expanded--a problem that was corrected in Phase II by drawing larger boundaries from the outset. B. The lease project needs to improve file management  Department of Commerce bureaus are required to maintain adequate and easily retrievable documentation of their essential transactions.12 The bureau's leasing files, however, varied in quality between regions and were often not complete. Complete and organized files were necessary for the bureau to (1) maintain oversight and management of the leasing and build-out process, (2) ensure and document a fair and transparent process of competition, (3) record transactions between the bureau and GSA, and (4) fulfill its responsibilities as a lessee. Pressures to acquire leased space, however, tended to push staff to set aside the work of maintaining files. Although both partners must keep their own files, the Census Bureau tended to rely on GSA since GSA is obliged to keep the complete 11  Unfortunately, some of these gains have not been realized due to delays in installing telecommunications  services. 12  U.S. Department of Commerce, Department Administrative Order (DAO) 205-1, Section 4.01.  19   U.S. Department of Commerce Office of Inspector General  Final Report IPE-11573 September 2000  original contractual files. Census headquarters did not insist on a standard method of maintaining the files and did not develop standards for file contents until Phase II. The bureau's working files need not be identical to GSA's, but they should be adequate for the bureau to maintain proper oversight of the leasing process and to manage its responsibilities as the tenant of leased properties. To maintain oversight of the leasing and build-out process, the bureau should have on hand and keep essential documents, such as abstracts of Solicitations for Offers (SFOs), abstracts of offers, copies of the leases and amendments to leases, floor plans, as well as necessary documents relating to the installation of high-speed data circuit lines, the telephone system, security system, buildout plans, construction progress, and delivery of furniture and supplies. According to the Joint Venture 2000 definition of roles in the LCO space acquisition process (see page 36), the bureau had specific responsibilities to conduct market survey inspections, assess security requirements, collect crime statistics, prepare architectural drawings, approve SFOs, and approve the final offer. Documentation of these agreements and activities is necessary for the bureau to manage the leasing process, resolve disputes, and oversee GSA's activities on behalf of the bureau. The completeness and the organization of files varied among the regions we visited. In some regions, the files concerning leased properties were largely complete with just a few items missing, but in other regions some key documents were missing from all folders. Most of these were working documents, but some documents, such as occupancy agreements, should be retained according to the applicable record schedule.13 Some regions had organized series of folders and indexes, while other regions had workable but less structured systems of organization. Most regions' files were organized by office leased, but one region had files organized by functional document, such as leases or occupancy agreements. The Phase II ""kick-off"" meeting included a number of useful checklists and tables assigning responsibility for the work on each LCO site. However, we found that the regional personnel were not always using these tools to guide their work nor keeping them as records. In the Chicago RCC, records were in good order, but in the other RCCs visited we found the following:  The retention and disposal of types of documents common to several agencies is authorized by the General Records Schedule. For instance, routine procurement files should be destroyed 6 years and 3 months after final payment, while supply management files should be destroyed when 2 years old. See General Records Schedule 3 , National Archives and Records Administration, transmittal No. 8, December 1998, pages 3-4. In addition, agencies must keep their own record schedules to cover the management of agency-specific documents.  13  20   U.S. Department of Commerce Office of Inspector General  Final Report IPE-11573 September 2000  C  In the Philadelphia RCC, there were no delineated area maps or other description of the delineated areas in four out of 12 ELCO files. Maps indicating the delineated areas should have been included in the SFOs and retained in the files. In the Detroit RCC, efforts were made to make the files complete, but essential documents such as occupancy agreements and some survey information, requested from GSA, had not been received. In New York RCC, potential sites were hard to find, so few surveys had been done. Even so, the files held incomplete survey information. A leasing specialist informed us that the regional office had requested survey documents and occupancy agreements from GSA on a number of occasions, but not all the documents had been provided. In the Kansas City RCC, the files were orderly, highly organized, and essentially complete. Two occupancy agreements for government leased-space, however, had not been sent by GSA regional staff to the RCC prior to occupancy and had not been signed by the assistant regional census manager even though the bureau had already taken occupancy of the space. In the Boston RCC, the available files that we examined were meticulous, but contained only copies of the occupancy agreements and the leases. There were no surveys or correspondence included in the files that we reviewed. We were later informed that other files, the day-to-day working files, were not made available for our inspection.  C  C  C  C  The bureau cited a number of reasons for these inconsistencies. First, the bureau and GSA were primarily focused on securing leased space. The maintenance of files was not as obvious or critical as other documentation systems, such as the on-line Intranet schedule tracking or cost reporting system, even though the contents of the files may undergird those systems. Even through the headquarters Field Division emphasized the need to maintain files early in the leasing process, and sent a memo to Census regions mid-way in Phase II instructing them to clean up their files, some regions still found little time for routine file maintenance. Second, since bureau staffers were aware that complete files were kept by GSA, they did not always insist on obtaining copies of relevant documents for their own files. Finally, in some regions, either the bureau was slow to request copies of essential documents from GSA, or GSA was reportedly slow or failed to send requested copies. When essential file documents or information are missing, the necessary for management oversight and appropriate internal enough information in the files to either understand or resolve disagreements between the bureau and GSA. In addition, the 21 bureau lacks the detailed information record-keeping. There may not be matters, especially in cases of bureau may be failing to retain   U.S. Department of Commerce Office of Inspector General  Final Report IPE-11573 September 2000  documents it is requested to maintain by either a general or Census-specific record retention schedule. Accurate records are essential in all phases of leasing, including the build-out, telecommunications and tenancy phases. Greater standardization of census leasing file management should be prescribed and overseen by the Field Division.  In responding to our draft report, the Census Bureau concurs with our recommendation to create a standardized system of file management for use in all Regional Census Centers in the 2010 decennial leasing operations and to ensure that staff comply with applicable record retention schedules. We trust that the bureau will also emphasize full compliance with such a standardized system of file management. The bureau also notes that the Field Division's regional space leasing staff are finalizing an action plan for the retention of the 2000 decennial lease files in accordance with record retention requirements and the 2010 evaluation and planning needs, and have begun work with the Regional Census Centers (RCCs) and GSA to do so.  22   U.S. Department of Commerce Office of Inspector General  Final Report IPE-11573 September 2000  III.  The Bureau Needs to Improve Planning for Decennial Leasing and Office Preparations  The budget and programmatic uncertainty stemming from the sampling controversy made decennial planning more difficult and protracted. Once the Supreme Court's decision came in January 1999, the bureau was under considerable pressure to finalize plans and regain lost time. We found that in telecommunications, especially, Census developed less than complete requirements and then had to make necessary changes to plans, which sometimes disrupted operations and adversely affected the lease project's cost and schedule, or both. We also note that planning has been aided through the use of formal business case analyses. A. Improved planning for telecommunications is needed The bureau had to make significant changes to its requirements for the telecommunications system once it became apparent that the original plans and estimates of telephone usage were inadequate. In addition, because of budget uncertainty, spending for the telecommunications system was initially conservative and not sufficiently focused on overall system requirements. As a result, the bureau's telecommunications contractors had to install additional lines for job recruiting, a more complex call routing subsystem, and voice mail. These changes increased telecommunications costs and delayed the planned opening and operation of some ELCOs and LCOs. Conducting the 2000 decennial requires the extensive use of sophisticated telecommunication systems. Telecommunications technology is necessary for data collection from the public, interoffice communication, recruiting, and computer data transfer among offices. Without well functioning telecommunications systems, the ELCOs and LCOs cannot operate effectively and adequately support the decennial. We found significant problems with the systems planning for voice telecommunications in the bureau's ELCOs and LCOs. We observed that the ELCOs did not have enough lines and system capacity to handle a large volume of calls. Two other commonly cited system problems (not user error) were dropped calls during transfer and unanswered calls routed to other phones in a seemingly random pattern. The bureau made numerous incremental changes to the LCO telecommunications requirements, complicating telecommunications system design and installation. One example of changing requirements was a job recruiting line with an 800 number that was originally planned to service all potential recruits for temporary jobs. However, approximately 5 months after installation of the original system, bureau officials found that the high capacity line was inadequate because it could not handle the enlarged volume of calls. As a result, the bureau had to reroute all recruitment calls automatically to the nearest ELCO or LCO. This change caused other requirements to change. For instance, all ELCOs and  23   U.S. Department of Commerce Office of Inspector General  Final Report IPE-11573 September 2000  LCOs had to be fitted with voice mail to handle job line calls that came in after hours or when all their lines were busy. Inadequate bureau planning was the principal cause of this problem. For example, to determine the capacity needed for the telecommunications system, the Decennial Recruiting Office had to estimate the number of temporary staff and the number of calls that the staff would be generating and receiving. The bureau required input from regional offices, the Decennial Field Operations Office, the Partnership Office, the PAMS/ADAMS Division, and at least six other bureau offices to determine how much capacity would be needed for the system. Unfortunately, the process for collecting the data was not well organized. The offices submitted their data to bureau planners at different times, often making changes afterwards. This rather undisciplined effort resulted in incorrect estimates. Another important reason the requirements kept changing was budgetary uncertainty. Ongoing disagreements over decennial operations and funding between the Administration and the Congress led to delays in, and uncertainty regarding, the bureau's future budgetary allocations. As a result, the bureau tended to spend conservatively on its systems and to design the system to match its perceived budget, rather than to meet the estimated technical needs of the ELCOs/LCOs. Finally, often inadequate coordination of installation services between the telecommunications vendors and GSA or bureau personnel resulted in many wasted hours of government employee time and increased contractor costs. During deployment of the system in the ELCOs, the bureau used more than 55 installation subcontractors of widely differing ability, causing installation delays and operational disruptions at some ELCOs. Many offices required a second or third visit from the vendor to correct problems with the phone system. Other telecommunications problems were highlighted in the bureau's documents and include: C ELCO staff reported difficulty in adapting to the new, more complex, telephone system--due to a lack of sufficient training and hands-on experience with the new system. The original system was badly configured and calls frequently could not be routed to the intended recipient, resulting in inefficient interoffice communications. The original contractor required a significant cost increase to provide voice mail in each LCO and was unable to provide two additional phone lines for each of the Accuracy and Coverage Evaluation offices needed under the finalized plan.  C  C  24   U.S. Department of Commerce Office of Inspector General  Final Report IPE-11573 September 2000  The cumulative effect of these problems was that the telecommunications system originally deployed in the ELCOs had to be completely replaced by a new system approximately 5 months after the first installation. The old system's configuration problems and insufficient capacity to meet the bureau's existing and continually expanding decennial 2000 requirements made it inadequate. The cost of the system that was replaced, including additional costs for wiring and servicing that system, was at least $7 million. The new system, a more capable model from the same manufacturer, appeared to meet the bureau's requirements. However, deployment delays and increased costs have also occurred with the new system. Managers in the bureau's Telecommunications Office estimated that as a result of the delays, 5 to10 percent of the LCOs' telecommunications were not operational according to schedule. Clearly, the bureau needs to plan its telecommunications system requirements more thoroughly to minimize changes. Bureau officials have suggested that the changing telecommunications requirements stemmed from the Supreme Court's January 1999 ruling. While it is true that more phone capacity was needed for additional LCOs required by the ruling, the need for greater jobs line capacity and voice mail existed before the court decision, according to officials in the Department's Office of Telecommunications Management (OTM). For the next decennial, the bureau should provide better centralized coordination of the many offices that supply information needed for planning its telecommunication system capacity requirements well in advance of the leasing of its field offices and be able to promptly inform planners of any changes in their needs. Additionally, the bureau should coordinate planning with the OTM and provide the OTM with a detailed plan for the 2010 telecommunications procurement and systems deployment before the systems are purchased so that it may analyze and provide advice to improve the overall plan. The bureau should also regularly update OTM as the systems procurement and deployment unfold in preparation for the 2010 decennial.  In responding to our draft report, the Census Bureau concurred with three of our recommendations: a) to ensure that lessons learned from the installation of telecommunications systems in the 2000 decennial are captured for the 2010 decennial; b) to ensure that there is early and centralized coordination and gathering of information on offices' capacity requirements for the 2010 decennial census; and c) to coordinate with and provide the Department's Office of Telecommunications Management (OTM) with a detailed plan for 2010 telecommunications procurement and systems deployment before any systems are purchased. The bureau noted that the decision to open the ELCOs one year earlier than scheduled had an adverse impact on the evaluation and planning for capacity requirements, and that the process of planning for the decennial 2000 telecommunication system would have benefitted from more centralized  25   U.S. Department of Commerce Office of Inspector General  Final Report IPE-11573 September 2000  coordination and better communications between the headquarters offices, the RCCs, and the local offices. B. The bureau should improve its use of formal business case analyses  To guide its process for making critical decisions related to the 2000 decennial, Census started using a systematic case approach--known as formal business case analysis--to guide its decision-making, help the bureau assess the results of Phase I, and move to Phase II. We found this trend to be a positive development and encourage the bureau to formalize and expand the use of such analyses to make formal justifications easier, improve accountability for managers and resources, and arrive at wellinformed decisions. However, we also observed that the business case analysis process used in leasing and contractual decision-making were sometimes flawed because the analyses were not complete or the options studied were limited. For example, when the bureau realized that it was having problems with its Phase I (ELCO) telecommunications, it drafted a business case analysis to lay out the problems with the system and the options available to correct them. The draft business case document listed the options of hiring different contractors to finish the deployment of LCO telecommunications systems and indicated that using two different contracting options would result in a higher quality system at a lower cost. The draft document appropriately laid out three options for addressing the telecommunications problems. However, the bureau never finalized the document and ultimately chose an option that--while not a great departure from the listed options--was not included in the draft document. Insufficient planning was primarily responsible for the implementation of the original inadequate telecommunications system. In considering replacement of the system, the bureau should have accurately detailed all of the options available and then finalized its planning documents for Census management's review and to help ensure that managers have all relevant information available to them when making final decisions (see page 23). In a second example, Census developed a business case for proceeding from Phase I to Phase II of the Joint Venture 2000 leasing partnership. This analysis provided considerable detail on the actual costs that the bureau was incurring in Phase I and forecast the expected cost of continuing with GSA into Phase II. However, the business case included flawed assumptions in its analysis to proceed to Phase II of the lease project. Specifically, the Phase II business case analysis used cost estimates for Class A office space by geographic region. In reality, the ideal space needed by Census was light industrial and strip mall-retail which is typically less expensive than Class A office space. As a result, the Phase II analysis overestimated costs, as well as the savings claimed in the leasing business case analysis. Nonetheless, we believe that the bureau benefitted from preparing the business case analysis in that it 26   U.S. Department of Commerce Office of Inspector General  Final Report IPE-11573 September 2000  provided management with some useful market information on costs and potential availability of lease space. In summary, although we found that the business case analyses that we reviewed had some flaws, we believe that their use as a management tool should improve the bureau's decision-making process. We recommend that the bureau expand its use of formal business case analyses to guide its managers' decisions.  In responding to our draft report, the Census Bureau concurred with our recommendation to expand the use of formal business case analyses as a management tool in the 2010 decennial. However, the bureau did not concur with our statement that the business case analysis used for Phase II of the 2000 decennial was flawed because cost estimates for Class A office space were used. It disagreed that estimates based on light industrial and strip mall retail space would have been appropriate. Although typically less expensive than Class A office space, the bureau said that light industrial and strip mall retail space was not widely used for it was often either not available or did not have the infrastructure in place for necessary voice and data communications lines and therefore required longer lead times for installation.  27   U.S. Department of Commerce Office of Inspector General  Final Report IPE-11573 September 2000  IV.  Space Leasing Project Lacks an Adequate Interagency Agreement with GSA  The Census Bureau and GSA were to formalize their partnership agreement through a memorandum of understanding (MOU). The agreement was to spell out the roles, responsibilities and rights of each agency: the bureau was responsible for setting the broad specifications and requirements and providing the project funding; GSA was responsible for identifying and leasing space throughout the United States and arranging for the data and voice telecommunications, office furniture, and supplies. The two agencies agreed that there would be a separate MOU for each of the two leasing phases. The Phase I MOU, dated February 17, 1998, was used to acquire temporary space for approximately 402 census field offices, 130 ELCOs, and the corresponding telecommunications, office furniture, and supplies. The Phase II MOU was to be used to authorize GSA to proceed with the leasing of the remaining 390 LCOs. The bureau and GSA signed the Phase II MOU on November 17, 1998, and began performance under it before receiving all of the required Commerce Department clearances. As a result, the Department advised the bureau in December 1998 that the agreement was not final. The Phase II MOU has since been revised several times. As of March 29, 2000, it had not been signed by GSA. To manage a project as large as the 2000 decennial, a well-constructed MOU is necessary for each party to understand its rights and responsibilities under the partnership. Such an MOU should be formally constructed so that it provides clear guidance to the parties and minimizes potential disputes. We found that the Phase I MOU and the Phase II draft agreements were missing several key elements and the initial Phase II draft MOU included a citation that prevented agreement between the parties. The partnership agreement lacked key elements In examining the Joint Venture 2000 partnership agreement, we found that it did not adequately define the use of commercial brokers, nor did it cite a legal authority acceptable to both parties, to govern the treatment of funds and disposition of receipts. Use of commercial brokers The use of commercial brokers was provided for in the Phase I MOU. However, the exact responsibilities of these brokers, the extent of their authority, the estimated cost for their use, and which party (the bureau or GSA) is responsible for managing them were not discussed in the MOU.  28   U.S. Department of Commerce Office of Inspector General  Final Report IPE-11573 September 2000  While some of the details on the use of brokers could have been dealt with outside the MOU, we believe that the cost, authority, and oversight issues regarding brokers should have been in the MOU. The lack of detail concerning the use of commercial brokers can lead to misunderstandings and possibly to the government becoming subject to unauthorized obligations. The use of commercial brokers also adds to the cost of the leases through the addition of brokers' fees. This is true even where the landlord pays the commercial brokerage fees because such costs are included in the landlord's lease rate. The MOU should have fully described the use of commercial brokers: under what circumstances they would be used; whether GSA, the bureau, or the lessor would be responsible for commissions; and the limits of their authority. We recommend that the bureau refrain from using commercial brokers in the 2010 decennial leasing operations until the terms of their use are worked out with GSA, if applicable, and with individual lessors.  The Census Bureau, noting that approximately 6 percent of the Census 2000 acquisitions involved the services of GSA contract real estate brokers, concurred with our recommendation that commercial brokers should not be used in the 2010 decennial leasing operations until the terms of their use are worked out in general policy and with individual lessors. Census and GSA need to sign revised Phase II MOU As we indicated above, the bureau and GSA signed a Phase II MOU on November 17, 1998, and began performance under it before receiving all of the required Commerce Department clearances. After the bureau was advised by the Department, in December 1998, that the agreement was not final, the Phase II MOU has since been revised several times. On September 30, 1999, the bureau sent the revised draft MOU for the ELCO/LCO lease program to GSA after it was approved by the Department's Office of General Counsel, the Chief Financial Officer, and other appropriate officials. However, GSA reviewed the draft and determined that under its specific authority it is exempted from adhering to the Economy Act. The Department's Office of General Counsel now agrees with GSA's position and needs to delete citation of the Economy Act in the draft MOU. As of July 25, 2000, the Office of General Counsel had still not revised the MOU thus leaving the project ungoverned by an agreement between the parties. The Department should work closely with the bureau and with GSA to finalize an MOU, especially since the MOU covers the close-out and property disposition services for the leased offices. In the future, if the bureau enters into another agreement associated with the decennial leasing operations, or any other activity, it should make sure that the agreement receives appropriate approvals from the Department before the agreement is 29   U.S. Department of Commerce Office of Inspector General  Final Report IPE-11573 September 2000  finalized and any work is started. This includes agreements that do not have money directly associated with them.  In its response to our draft report, the Census Bureau concurred with our recommendation to finalize a memorandum of understanding between the bureau and GSA. However, the bureau notes that despite the lack of a signed MOU for Phase II, all work has been accomplished, with the exception of office close-out and the disposition of property. The bureau makes no mention of rectifying the lack of any present formal agreement between the bureau and GSA. We believe that such an agreement is still needed and reiterate our recommendation for the finalization of an MOU in the current 2000 decennial, however late in the process.  30   U.S. Department of Commerce Office of Inspector General  Final Report IPE-11573 September 2000  V.  The Bureau Could Have Made Greater Use of Build-Out Financing  Many of the census offices, once leased, must be ""built out"" to configure the office according to the Census Bureau's specifications. While each office has mostly open space, the following enclosed spaces are needed in each LCO: a manager's office, approximately 120 square feet (SF); a break room (200 SF); a multipurpose room (400 SF); a training room (650 SF); and a central storage room (750 SF). If an attached quality-control Accuracy and Coverage Evaluation office (200 SF) is part of the LCO, slab-to-slab walls and a separate entrance are also required. Such alterations include tearing down or putting up walls and doors, building ramps to ensure compliance with the Americans With Disabilities Act, and improving electrical systems. During final lease negotiations, the lessor is given the option to include the cost of the build-out in the rent or to receive a lump sum payment for alterations of the leased space--payable upon completion of the build-out effort, but before occupancy. If the lessor chooses to finance the project through a commercial lender, the lessor's finance costs will be included in the rent charged to the government. While the bureau encouraged some up-front payment of build-out costs, thereby eliminating finance costs, this was emphasized far more in the later waves of the partnership's campaign. During our review, we learned that the Phase II office acquisition budget included a targeted amount of $8 million for office build-out payments to lessors. This fund was to be used to finance lessor build-out costs in the form of up-front lump-sum payments or to otherwise encourage offers in tight markets. Up-front build-out payments have three distinct advantages in that they C provide for the completion of the office build-outs at a lower cost to the government by eliminating the lessors' finance costs (approximately 12 percent per annum for construction loans), which would otherwise be included in the lease rate; encourage more offers from lessors (since construction loans are a disincentive for some lessors), thereby improving the competitive framework for the negotiation of these leases and GSA's bargaining position on the bureau's behalf; enable the build-outs to be done more quickly, given the tendency of landlords to delay beginning the build-out to lessen their own borrowing costs.  C  C  The bureau did not utilize the same proportion of build-out funds in earlier waves 19 as it did in waves 1011. In wave 4, the wave in which the ELCO's were leased, the bureau expended only $697,419. Before April 1999, few of these targeted funds had been used because the bureau intended to retain these funds to use as added incentives in negotiations in what they correctly anticipated would be the most difficult markets. The leasing projects assumed to be most difficult were scheduled in the last waves--waves 10 and 11. However appropriate this strategy might have been, we were 31   U.S. Department of Commerce Office of Inspector General  Final Report IPE-11573 September 2000  concerned that if the bureau waited too long to utilize these funds, it might not use a large part of this targeted amount and would thereby miss an opportunity to reduce its overall leasing costs. In mid-April, we met with the bureau's Venture 2000 project managers to discuss maximizing potential savings by using all the targeted funds for lessor build-out costs. The bureau readily agreed and issued a memo on April 20, 1999, reminding its regional personnel and GSA of the availability of these funds for lease build-out in the final wave, wave 11. The memo directed the bureau's regional directors to use lump-sum payment for alterations ""whenever requested by the offeror or when it will encourage the submission of responsive offers.""14 In our May 7, 1999, interim memo to the bureau, we also recommended that the bureau personnel work with GSA to increase the use of such lessor payments during the final stage of space acquisition to help obtain better lease terms, timely alterations, and cost savings. The Census regional directors responded by committing a total of $5,635,763 in the final leasing stage, wave 11, for lump-sum payments for alterations, which brought total funds expended to $10,074,116 in Phase II, exceeding their targeted amount of $8 million. The total up-front build-out payments for both phases (ELCOs and LCOs) came to $10,771,535. Given that the finance costs for construction loans are characteristically about 12 percent per year, we calculate that the bureau, in making lump-sum alteration payments, has avoided internal finance costs of over $1.7 million and, considering that the Treasury must expend funds earlier to make these payments, has reduced its total outlays for contracts by at least $980,000.15 Of the $5,635,763 expended for up-front build-out costs in wave 11, following our April request that the bureau maximize use of these funds, we estimate that the funds put to better use come to over $476,000 for the remaining 15 months of the lease term. This was accomplished, in part, by the prompt response of the bureau to our April discussion and the recommendation in the May 1999 interim memo. We recommend that the bureau study the impact and usefulness of providing lump sum financing in this decennial and consider expanding its use in the 2010 decennial.  14 15  Decennial Logistics Planning Memorandum No. 99-D-28, April 20, 1999.  Total finance costs avoided by the government include estimated 12 percent construction costs, minus the current 5.24 percent borrowing costs due to the sale of government securities. For the 15-month period we calculated borrowing costs at 5.01 percent for the first year and 5.53 percent for three months of a second year in Treasury constant maturity securities plus one-eighth of a percentage point for administrative costs. These earlier up-front expenditures by the bureau resulted in a net 6.76 percent savings per year to the federal government. However, the bureau has avoided internal costs to the decennial census of the entire estimated 12 percent per year because the Treasury's borrowing costs are rarely passed on to government agencies. See Federal Reserve Statistical Release, July 19, 1999; interest rates for July 15, 1999.  32   U.S. Department of Commerce Office of Inspector General  Final Report IPE-11573 September 2000  The Census Bureau concurred with our recommendation to evaluate the usefulness of providing upfront financing to lessors for build-out costs related to the 2000 decennial leasing and will give full consideration to expanding its use in the 2010 decennial. In response to our statement that ""Census could have made greater use of build-out financing,"" the bureau noted that the opening of the 130 ELCOs made this kind of up-front financing very difficult because there were insufficient FY 1998 funds available for use of widespread, lump-sum payments for space alterations. Such funds were not specifically requested until FY 1999.  33   U.S. Department of Commerce Office of Inspector General  Final Report IPE-11573 September 2000  RECOMMENDATIONS We recommend that the Director of the Bureau of the Census take appropriate steps to: 1. Conduct an evaluation of the Joint Venture 2000 partnership shortly after the conclusion of the 2000 decennial so that the bureau will have a timely, objective, and complete picture of the Census/GSA partnership model to use in planning for the 2010 decennial. The evaluation should include outcomes, benefits and costs, and notable management successes and problems or ""lessons learned"" in all phases (see page 9). Draw delineated areas as broadly as possible in the space acquisition process for the 2010 decennial to increase competition between potential offerors of LCO lease space, to reduce the bureau's overall leasing costs and to ensure that it has alternative space available when unforeseen difficulties prevent a lease award (see page 14). Create a standardized system of file management for use in all Regional Census Centers in the 2010 decennial leasing operations and ensure that Census leasing staff comply with applicable record retention schedules (see page 19). Ensure that the lessons learned from the installation of the 2000 decennial telecommunications systems are recorded so that they may serve as a basis for planning and implementation in 2010 (see page 23). Ensure that there is more centralized coordination between the offices that supply information needed for planning the bureau's space and capacity requirements for the 2010 decennial well in advance of the leasing of its field offices (see page 23). Coordinate planning with Department's Office of Telecommunications Management (OTM) and provide the OTM with a detailed plan for the 2010 telecommunications procurement and systems deployment before any systems are purchased so that it may analyze and provide advice to improve the overall plan. Update that office regularly as the systems procurement and deployment unfold in preparation for the 2010 decennial (see page 23). Expand the use of formal business case analyses as a management tool in the 2010 decennial to guide decision-making (see page 26).  2.  3.  4.  5.  6.  7.  34   U.S. Department of Commerce Office of Inspector General  Final Report IPE-11573 September 2000  8.  If commercial brokers are used in the 2010 decennial leasing operations, ensure that the terms of their use, degree of responsibility, commissions structure, and limits of their authority are worked out in general policy and with individual lessors (see page 28). Work closely with the Department and GSA to finalize a memorandum of understanding between the bureau and GSA. Ensure that any future agreements associated with this or future decennials receive appropriate approvals from the Department of Commerce before they are signed and any new work is started (see page 28). Evaluate the usefulness of providing up-front financing to lessors for build-out costs related to the 2000 decennial leasing and consider expanding its use in 2010 (see page 31).  9.  10.  35   U.S. Department of Commerce Office of Inspector General  Final Report IPE-11573 September 2000  Appendix A  Major Steps In The Venture 2000 Leasing Acquisition Process C GSA contacts current or former lessors and local real estate brokers and reviews current USG-owned property for availability. Census Bureau RCC or field staff conduct ""windshield surveys"" of vacant offices, obtain and forward addresses to GSA. GSA screens privately owned space possibilities according to the bureau's requirements and schedules market survey inspections. Both GSA and the bureau conduct market surveys, assess security requirements, collect crime statistics and existing floor plans. If necessary, GSA draws new floor plans and calculates total square footage. The bureau approves or rejects sites for the Solicitation for Offers. The bureau prepares preliminary architectural drawings (for build out of walls, or door demolition or construction) and sends them to GSA for inclusion in the SFOs. Both GSA and the bureau customize SFOs according to specific markets; the bureau approves each SFO prior to issuance. GSA issues SFOs to potential offerors, reviews offers received, and shares SFOs and abstracts of offers with the bureau. GSA schedules the offer negotiations and conducts the negotiations either via telephone or in person. Bureau leasing specialists are included as observers but not as active participants. Best and final offers are requested, received, and evaluated by GSA. Abstracts of offers, including any exception to requirements, are shared with the bureau, which must concur with the award for it to be finalized. The bureau decides on security system requirements, GSA awards the lease, and a copy is provided to the bureau within 15 days. 36  C  C  C  C C  C  C  C  C  C   C  GSA leads preparation of the acquired space with build-out plans and progress, installation of T-1 data circuit lines, the telephone system, and delivery of furniture and supplies.

A community may document                              its eligibility under the LMI requirement using one                              of three methods: 1) utilization of 1990 census data;                              2) conducting a community/project area-wide income                              survey, or; 3) conducting a random sample survey of                              the community/project benefit area.                             The first step of the LMI documentation                              process is to identify the boundaries of the area                              that will benefit from the project. The area that                              will benefit from the project activities is the ""universe""                              that will be used to determine whether at least 51.0                              percent of the population are low-to-moderate income.                              For example, a water tower project or sewage treatment                              plant project would likely have a community-wide benefit.                              In comparison, extension of water or sewer lines would                              principally benefit households in a target area. All                              homes in the project area should be surveyed. Each                              non-contiguous project area should be surveyed separately                              and must meet the minimum of 51 percent LMI on its                              own.

The random sample survey must include proportionate                              representation of households throughout the area of                              benefit.                                                             Because the typical rate of                              completed surveys by mail is between 25 and 50 percent                              and door-to-door is between 76 and 90 percent, over-sampling                              is recommended in order to receive the minimum number                              of completed usable surveys.                                                             One method of selection is                              to begin at one location in the universe and systematically                              proceed from that point. In a 500 household universe,                              for example, requiring 250 completed surveys, every                              second household could be interviewed to ensure representative                              results. The interviewers could begin at the starting                              location and proceed systematically through the project                              area, interviewing every other household. Any household                              selected by this procedure at which an interview could                              not be conducted could be replaced by the next household,                              which would have been skipped. If a mailing list is                              used to determine those households to be surveyed,                              the mailing list must coincide with the addresses                              on the surveys and the map.

Local governments should take into consideration                              staffing, and environmental review costs when determining                              administration need. CDAP funds requested for grant                              administration should be detailed on the "" Administration                              Costs Which Will Be Paid Out of CDAP"" form .

However,                              be advised that CDAP funds can only be used to pay                              for its portion of the costs of an audit when a ""single                              audit"" is required by A-133.

STATE AND                              FEDERAL COMPLIANCE AREAS                                Each applicant must agree to comply                              with all applicable federal and state requirements.                              These can have a significant impact on the costs and                              complexity of a project. Applicants who receive a                              grant award will be expected to submit signed assurances                              that they will comply with all federal mandates. Some                              areas which applicants must comply with include:                              1. The National Environmental Policy                              Act (NEPA) establishes procedures for protecting the                              environment. In order to use the CDAP funds awarded                              to a local government, the grantee has to comply with                              environmental procedures, standards and guidelines                              mandated by NEPA and all other applicable environmental                              regulations (e.g., prime farmland protection, historic                              preservation, floodplain hazards, etc.). Applicants                              may conduct environmental reviews during the application                              phase. Costs associated with the application phase                              review are reimbursable by the department for those                              applicants that are awarded a CDAP grant.                              2. The Interagency Wetland Policy                              Act of 1989 requires applicants to certify that the                              proposed project is compatible with established State                              of Illinois policy regarding wetlands (i.e., to minimize                              the destruction of existing wetlands in Illinois as                              a result of state and state-supported activity).                              3. The Illinois Endangered Species                              Protection Act and the Illinois Natural Area Preservation                              Act require consultation with the Endangered Species                              Consultation Program of the Illinois Department of                              Natural Resources to assure compliance. The consultation                              process must be implemented to avoid or minimize adverse                              impacts to state listed species and their essential                              habitats that may result from the actions of state                              and local units of government. Applicants must certify                              the completion of the consultation process for all                              non-exempt proposed projects.                              4. The Davis-Bacon Prevailing                              Wage Act requires the payment of prevailing wages                              for all construction funded in whole or in part with                              federal funds, including funds passed through to private                              firms. If your project involves construction and/or                              equipment installation, you should contact the department                              so a determination can be made concerning the applicability                              of federal labor standards.                                                             5. The Uniform Relocation Assistance                              and Real Property Acquisition Policies Act of 1987                              applies to federally assisted activities that involve                              the acquisition of real property or the displacement                              of persons, including displacement caused by rehabilitation                              and demolition activities. Any person or business                              displaced as a direct result of federal assistance                              must be provided with Uniform Relocation benefits.                                                             6. Equal Opportunity and Fair                              Housing Accessibility Laws require that CDAP grantees                              administer their project in a manner that affirmatively                              furthers equal opportunity and fair housing.

ACTION: Final rule.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  SUMMARY: The Army promulgates this final rule to establish programmatic  regulations for the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan. Congress  approved the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan in section 601  of the Water Resources Development Act of 2000, which was enacted into  law on December 11, 2000. The Act requires the Secretary of the Army to  promulgate programmatic regulations to ensure that the goals and  purposes of the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan are achieved.  We have developed this final rule in response to that statutory  requirement. The rule establishes processes and procedures that will  guide the Army Corps of Engineers in the implementation of the  Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan.     Today's action completes a rulemaking that began on August 2, 2002  with the publication of proposed regulations. The final rule contain a  number of revisions that respond to public comments on the proposed  regulations.  DATES: This rule is effective December 12, 2003.

You may also access the programmatic  regulations Web page at:  http://www.evergladesplan.org/pm/progr_regs.cfm/ .     SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:   I. Background      Section 601(h)(3) of the Water Resources Development Act of 2000,  Public Law 106-541 (114 Stat. 2688) (hereinafter ``WRDA 2000'')  requires the Secretary of the Army, after notice and opportunity for  public comment, to promulgate regulations to ensure that the goals and  purposes of the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan (the Plan)  are achieved. These final regulations fulfill this requirement and  establish the administrative structure for carrying out the Plan.     The programmatic regulations establish a process: for the  development of Project Implementation Reports, Project Cooperation  Agreements, and Operating Manuals that will ensure that the goals and  the objectives of the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan (CERP)  are achieved; to ensure that new information resulting from changes or  unforeseen circumstances, new scientific or technical information or  information that is developed through the principles of adaptive  management contained in the Plan, and future authorized changes to the  Plan will be integrated into the implementation of the Plan; and, to  ensure the protection of the natural system consistent with the goals  and purposes of the Plan, including the establishment of interim goals  to provide a means by which the restoration success of the Plan will be  evaluated throughout the implementation process.     The programmatic regulations recognize that the Everglades are a  critical national resource in which the public has an important  interest. Restoration of the Everglades involves many complicated  issues involving ecosystem restoration, other water-related needs of  the region, novel scientific and technical information and technology,  and adaptive management. The final regulations envision a comprehensive  process to involve the public, and the agencies that represent them, in  important decisions involved in implementing the project.     In general, the programmatic regulations envision that the goals  and purposes of the Plan will be achieved through the development of  project-specific and system-wide measures. Project specific measures  include but are not limited to Project Implementation Reports, Project  Cooperation Agreements, Pilot Project Technical Data Reports, and  Operating Manuals. The more generally applicable system-wide measures  include, but are not limited to, the development of guidance memoranda,  the Master Implementation Sequencing Plan, interim goals for evaluating  the restoration success of the Plan, and interim targets for evaluating  progress towards achieving other water-related needs of the region,  including water supply and flood protection. The interim goals for  evaluating the restoration success of the Plan and interim targets for  other water-related needs are of special significance. They establish  incremental targets to evaluate progress toward the expected level of  performance of the Plan and are used to monitor overall progress toward  meeting the goals and purposes of the Plan. Taken together, the project  specific and system-wide measures form the foundation of the Plan and  are critical to the successful restoration of the South Florida  ecosystem.     The South Florida ecosystem is a nationally and internationally  unique and important natural resource. It is also a resource in peril,  having been severely affected by human activities for over a hundred  years. The Central and Southern Florida Project extends from south of  Orlando to the Florida Keys and is composed of a regional network of  canals, levees, water storage areas, and water control structures.  First authorized by Congress in 1948, the project serves multiple  objectives. The objectives of the project include flood control,  regional water supply for agricultural and urban areas, prevention of  salt water intrusion, water supply to Everglades National Park,  preservation of fish and wildlife, recreation, and navigation. While  fulfilling these objectives, the project has had unintended adverse  effects on the unique natural environment that constitutes the  Everglades and South Florida ecosystem. In 1996, the Army Corps of  Engineers was directed to develop a comprehensive plan to restore,  preserve, and protect South Florida's natural ecosystem while providing  for the water-related needs of the region, including flood control, the  enhancement of water supplies, and other objectives of the Central and  South Florida Project. The resulting plan, which was submitted to  Congress on July 1, 1999, is called the Comprehensive Everglades  Restoration Plan.     The overarching goal of the Plan is the restoration, preservation,  and protection of the South Florida ecosystem while providing for other  water-related needs of the region, such as flood protection and water  supply. As submitted to Congress, the Plan contained 68 major  components that anticipated the creation of approximately 217,000 acres  of reservoirs and wetland-based water treatment areas, wastewater reuse  plants, seepage management, and the removal of levees and canals in  natural areas. These components vastly increase storage and water  supply for the natural system, as well as for urban and agricultural  needs, while continuing to fulfill the original objectives of the  existing Central and Southern Florida Project. The Comprehensive  Everglades Restoration Plan will restore more natural flows of water,  including sheet flow; improve water quality; and  [[Page 64201]]  establish more natural hydroperiods in the South Florida ecosystem.  Improvements to fish and wildlife habitat, including those that benefit  threatened and endangered species, are expected to occur as a result of  the restoration of hydrologic conditions. This will promote the  recovery of native flora and fauna, including threatened and endangered  species.     In enacting section 601 of WRDA 2000, Congress approved the  Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan as a framework for  modifications to the Central and Southern Florida Project. Section 601  of WRDA 2000 contains a variety of provisions associated with  implementation of the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan,  including an authorization for the construction of four pilot projects  and ten initial projects of the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration  Plan.     Section 601(h) of WRDA 2000 states, ``the overarching objective of  the Plan is the restoration, preservation, and protection of the South  Florida ecosystem while providing for other water-related needs of the  region, including water supply and flood protection.'' This section  directs that the Plan be implemented to ensure the protection of water  quality in, the reduction of the loss of fresh water from, and the  improvement of the environment of the South Florida Ecosystem.  Implementation of the Plan also seeks to achieve and maintain the  benefits to the natural system and human environment described in the  Plan.     Section 601(h)(2) of WRDA 2000 requires the President and Governor  to enter into a binding agreement ensuring that the water generated by  the Plan will be made available to the natural system. The President  and Governor signed this agreement on January 9, 2002. The agreement  specifies that the State will ensure by regulation, or other  appropriate means, that water made available by each project in the  Plan will not be permitted for a consumptive use or otherwise made  unavailable by the State until such time as sufficient reservations of  water for the restoration of the natural system are made under State  law in accordance with the Project Implementation Report for that  project and consistent with the Plan. This agreement also specifies  that the State will monitor and assess the continuing effectiveness of  reservations as long as the project is authorized in order to achieve  the goals and objectives of the Plan.     Section 601(h)(3) of WRDA 2000 requires that the Secretary of the  Army, after notice and opportunity for public comment, and with the  concurrence of the Governor of Florida and the Secretary of the  Interior, and in consultation with the Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of  Florida, the Seminole Tribe of Florida, the Administrator of the  Environmental Protection Agency, the Secretary of Commerce, and other  Federal, State, and local agencies, issue programmatic regulations  within two years of the date of enactment of WRDA 2000 to ensure that  the goals and purposes of the Plan are achieved. This regulation is  promulgated in furtherance of these statutory requirements.     Section 601(h)(4) of WRDA 2000 describes the project specific  assurance requirements for Project Implementation Reports, Project  Cooperation Agreements, and Operating Manuals. Finally, section  601(h)(5) contains a savings clause that provides protection for  existing legal sources of water that will be eliminated or transferred  due to project implementation and provides for maintenance of the  levels of service for flood protection that were in existence on the  date of enactment of WRDA 2000 and in accordance with applicable law.  II. Process for Developing the Programmatic Regulations      The Department of the Army developed the programmatic regulations  through an open and inclusive process that involved numerous meetings,  briefings, and discussions with other Federal, State, and local  agencies; the Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Florida and the Seminole  Tribe of Florida; agricultural, environmental, urban utilities,  recreational, and urban interest groups; and the public. Briefings on  the programmatic regulations were provided to the Governing Board of  the South Florida Water Management District and its Water Resources  Advisory Commission and the South Florida Ecosystem Restoration Task  Force and its Working Group. In addition, programmatic regulations web  pages were developed and posted on the Comprehensive Everglades  Restoration Plan web site ( http://www.evergladesplan.org ).    The web site was used to disseminate information about the programmatic  regulations and to provide a place for individuals and organizations to  submit comments electronically during the development of the programmatic  regulations. This was designed to identify the major concerns of the  agencies and various groups, prior to publishing the proposed regulations  and soliciting formal public comment.     The Army held an opening round of meetings with agencies, interest  groups, and the public in May and June 2001. The purpose of these  meetings was to discuss the process that would be used to develop the  programmatic regulations and to solicit comments on the major issues  and concerns that should be addressed in developing the regulations.     Following this initial round of meetings, the Army developed a  draft outline of the programmatic regulations. We then held a second  round of meetings in September and October 2001 with agencies, interest  groups, and the public to solicit comments on the outline. We also  consulted with the Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Florida and the  Seminole Tribe of Florida, and sought their comments on the draft  outline.     After the second round of meetings, we developed an initial draft  of the programmatic regulations. We distributed this initial draft to  the public on December 28, 2001, and allowed informal public comment  until February 15, 2002. We then held meetings with agencies, tribes,  and interest groups, to discuss the initial draft. We also received  written comments on the initial draft that were posted on the  programmatic regulations web site. In addition, the Water Resources  Advisory Commission formed a subcommittee on the programmatic  regulations. The subcommittee met several times to discuss issues  concerning the initial draft and potential ways of addressing these  issues. The South Florida Ecosystem Restoration Task Force also met  several times after the release of the initial draft to discuss the  programmatic regulations.     The proposed rule was published in the Federal Register on August  2, 2002 and the public was allowed to submit comments on the  regulations until October 1, 2002. During the comment period, we held a  public meeting in Miami on September 10, 2002 and a public meeting in  West Palm Beach on September 19, 2002. We also consulted with the  Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Florida and the Seminole Tribe of  Florida and held a number of informal meetings with interested groups.  The comments submitted on the proposed rule and the transcripts of the  two public meetings were posted on the programmatic regulations web  site after the close of the public comment period.     On February 6, 2003, the Council for Environmental Quality hosted a  public meeting in Washington. The purpose of the public meeting, which  was facilitated by the Council on Environmental Quality, was to provide  an opportunity for interested parties to clarify comments filed on the  proposed rule. Representatives of the Department  [[Page 64202]]  of the Army, the Department of the Interior, and the State, as well as  representatives of other Federal agencies were in attendance to listen  to these views. Additionally, the meeting afforded attendees an  opportunity to engage directly with each other. This open dialogue was  especially useful in developing a thorough understanding of the  parties' views.     This final rule was developed after considering all of the  information received at the meetings, as well as written comments that  were received from agencies, interest groups, and the public.  III. Discussion of Final Rule      We received approximately 820 comments on the proposed regulations  issued on August 2, 2002. Of these comments, approximately 800 were  individual or form letters from the public. In general, these letters  requested that the proposed regulations be revised to: give the  Department of the Interior a greater voice in approving CERP documents  and participating in RECOVER; to strengthen the independence of the  independent scientific review panel to ensure that its reviews are  objective, and to incorporate the interim goals in the final  regulations. We also received approximately 25 letters from various  types of organizations, members of Congress, Federal, State, and local  agencies, the Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Florida, and the Seminole  Tribe of Florida. These letters included detailed comments on the  recommendations and specific proposals for revisions in a number of  areas.     All of the comments were generally supportive of the effort to  issue final regulations. We have carefully considered all of these  comments in developing today's final rule. The following paragraphs  include a description of the significant issues raised by these  comments and a discussion of how these issues were addressed in the  final regulations. In reviewing these comments, we sought to reconcile  different points of view and to find consensus solutions to common  concerns. In a few instances this was not possible because the parties  simply held diametrically opposing views. In these instances, our  decisions on proposed revisions were guided by our judgment as to what  would best fulfill Congressional intent with respect to the goals and  purposes of CERP. The final rule remains similar to the proposed rule  in organization and structure, but contains the substantive and  editorial changes that were made to address the issues raised by the  comments. The Army is confident that these final programmatic  regulations provide an excellent framework for the implementation of  CERP as envisioned by Congress.  IV. Discussion of Comments  A. Amount of Detail in the Proposed Regulations      A number of commenters shared their views on the appropriate level  of detail that should be contained in the regulations. Some commenters  believed that the programmatic regulations should be very detailed and  directive in terms of specific procedures and outcomes. Others believed  that the programmatic regulations should be process-oriented and  provide a general framework for implementing CERP. A few of these  commenters also expressed concern that the Federal regulations not  infringe on the sovereignty of the State of Florida or its right to  allocate its water resources. Others sought to ensure that the  regulations safeguard the Federal interest and investment in  restoration, preservation, and protection of the South Florida  ecosystem, including Federal properties within South Florida, such as  national parks and wildlife refuges.     The final regulations attempt to recognize these diverse views. We  made a number of changes to the proposed rule in order to clarify the  procedures and processes specified in the regulations to ensure that  the goals and purposes of the Plan are achieved. As in the proposed  rule, the final regulations also call for the development of detailed  guidance memoranda in the future to specifically address issues of  system-wide import. In striking a balance between process and  specificity, we strove to address those matters that could be  specifically dealt with now while avoiding being so prescriptive that  we would lose the flexibility to respond to new technical and  scientific information revealed during implementation of the Plan.  B. Guidance Memoranda      A number of commenters raised concerns about the guidance memoranda  described in the proposed regulations. These concerns varied but, in  general, related to either the substantive matters addressed in the  guidance memoranda or the process for finalizing the guidance  memoranda. Some commenters felt that the concurrence provisions  contained in the proposed regulations would delay finalizing the  guidance memoranda. Others felt that the concurrence provisions in the  proposed regulations did not give the Secretary of the Interior or the  Governor of Florida an appropriate role in approving the guidance  memoranda because it appeared that the Secretary of the Army could  finalize these documents after giving good faith consideration to  comments from the Department of the Interior and the Governor,  notwithstanding the fact that either or both officials had concerns  about finalizing the regulations.     Some commenters believed that the scheduled completion dates for  developing the guidance memoranda were unrealistic and should be  changed. Others expressed the view that issues addressed in the  guidance memoranda should be covered in the programmatic regulations.  In addition, they were concerned that the guidance memoranda did not  have the same legal status as the programmatic regulations and thus  would not have the same legal import. These commenters stated that if  the material intended for inclusion in the guidance memoranda was not  included in the final rule then the guidance memoranda should be  included in the programmatic regulations at the next revision. Several  commenters also believed that the proposed regulations gave an  inappropriate role to the South Florida Water Management District in  the development of the guidance memoranda. One commenter requested that  an additional guidance memorandum be developed to provide a procedure  for determining if implementation of a project will cause the  elimination or transfer of existing legal sources of water. The  Seminole Tribe commented that ``existing legal source'' of water is a  new concept not found in Florida statutes or regulations. The Tribe  requested that the programmatic regulations set up a process for  defining ``existing legal source'' of water and addressing how an  ``existing legal source'' of water would be replaced to comply with the  savings clause.     The comments reflected a difference of opinion with respect to  whether certain issues should be addressed in the guidance memoranda or  the programmatic regulations and whether the Department of the Interior  and the Governor of Florida should have concurrence over the guidance  memoranda, as they do with regard to the programmatic regulations. Some  of the commenters believe that the issues that are proposed for  discussion in the guidance memoranda should be included in the  regulations because they cover processes and matters of system-  [[Page 64203]]  wide applicability. Alternatively, they believe that if guidance  memoranda must be developed, they should later be incorporated into the  regulations. These commenters believe that for these reasons the  Secretary of the Interior and the State of Florida should have a  concurrence right in the guidance memoranda regardless of whether the  guidance memoranda are included in the regulations. Other commenters  expressed the view that guidance memoranda should not be included in  the regulations because they address technical or detailed matters  instead of the system-wide procedural matters Congress intended would  be addressed in the programmatic regulations. These commenters believed  that it would be inappropriate to give the Secretary of the Interior  and the Governor of Florida a concurrence right over these documents  because the statute authorizing CERP provides for concurrence in the  programmatic regulations only.     The final regulations contain revisions in response to these  comments. In attempting to address the views of those who commented  that the Secretary of the Interior and Governor of Florida should be  given a greater role in the development of the guidance memoranda and  that the South Florida Water Management District had an inappropriate  role in developing the guidance memoranda, the final rule clarifies  that the South Florida Water Management District and the Corps of  Engineers work together in developing the guidance memoranda but the  final approval is by the Secretary of the Army, after public notice and  comment and with the concurrence of the Secretary of the Interior and  the Governor of Florida. We believe that this change in the regulations  assures that the South Florida Water Management District plays an  important role in the development of the guidance memorandum, but  preserves the ability of the Secretary of the Army to make a final  decision on the guidance memorandum with the concurrence of the  Secretary of the Interior and the Governor.     The approval process for the guidance memoranda parallels the  statutory concurrence process for the programmatic regulations. We  deleted the language in the proposed regulations that said the Army  would give ``good faith consideration'' to the concurrence or non- concurrence statements of the Secretary of the Interior and the  Governor before approving the guidance memoranda. Our intent is to  issue guidance memoranda that have been concurred in by the Secretary  of the Interior and the Governor. We agree that the old language in the  proposed regulations did not communicate adequately this intent.  Instead, it suggested that the Army simply had to fulfill a ministerial  coordination requirement by asking the Secretary of the Interior and  the Governor whether they concurred or non-concurred in the guidance  memorandum. This language did not convey the Army's intent to actively  seek the concurrence of the Secretary of the Interior and the Governor  prior to approving the guidance memoranda. The new language gives the  Secretary of the Interior and the Governor the same concurrence  opportunity they have on the programmatic regulations and assures that  they have an appropriate role in the Department of the Army's adoption  of these important documents. While concurrence or non-concurrence on  the six guidance memoranda in Sec.  385.5(b) is not required by law and  will require additional time to fulfill, we believe it is appropriate  to provide for this process because of the significance of these  documents.     We believe that the public should have an opportunity to review and  comment on the guidance memoranda because of their significance.  Accordingly, the final regulations state that the public will be  advised by notice in the Federal Register when the guidance memoranda  are ready for review and comment. The final rule requires that the  guidance memoranda should be developed within a year of the effective  date of the programmatic regulations with the concurrence of the  Secretary of the Interior and the Governor.     We have determined that the guidance memoranda should not be  included in the programmatic regulations at this time for several  reasons. First, they are still being developed, second, they will be  very technical, and third, they will provide internal guidance to the  agencies implementing CERP. This decision is consistent with the view  of commenters who felt that including the guidance memoranda in the  programmatic regulations was incompatible with structured, formal rule- making processes. These commenters felt that rulemaking processes would  not accommodate recurring revisions to published technical documents,  like the guidance memoranda, which will require periodic changes to  accommodate new information. These commenters were concerned that if  guidance memoranda were included in these regulations, every revision  of them would require us to initiate a rulemaking process. While we  determined that the guidance memoranda should not be included in the  programmatic regulations at this time, we preserve the opportunity to  include the guidance memoranda in the programmatic regulations during  the next review and revision of the programmatic regulations.     The final regulations no longer contemplate that a separate  guidance memorandum will be developed for the system-wide evaluation of  Project Implementation Report alternatives by RECOVER. We concluded  that this subject should be addressed in the guidance memorandum for  the formulation and evaluation of alternatives for Project  Implementation Reports and that a separate guidance memorandum on this  subject was unnecessary.     The final regulations also require the development of an additional  guidance memorandum that will be used by agency personnel to identify  if an elimination or transfer of ``existing legal sources of water''  will occur as a result of implementation of the Plan. This guidance  memorandum will ensure the fulfillment of the savings clause  requirements of section 601 (h)(5)(a) of WRDA 2000 that are designed to  ensure that ``existing legal sources of water'' are preserved. There  was general agreement among commenters that a definition is required  for the phrase, ``existing legal sources of water'' but there was wide  disagreement among the commenters about what the phrase actually means  or who determines what an ``existing legal source of water'' is. The  term is not defined in WRDA 2000 or elsewhere in Federal or Florida  State law. Some commenters felt the term should include all water in  the South Florida ecosystem that was not discharged to tide at the time  WRDA 2000 was enacted. Other commenters emphasized that the term used  in the statute, ``existing legal sources'' is a broad term which  indicates that all water in the South Florida ecosystem should be  covered by the requirements of the savings clause. Several commenters  felt that the determination of what constitutes an ``existing legal  source of water'' is not a decision for the Secretary of the Army to  make. They argued that the Secretary of the Army should defer to the  State of Florida on this issue because the determination of what  constitutes an existing legal source of water involves a matter of  state law. The new guidance memorandum contemplated in the regulations  will establish procedures for identifying what constitutes ``an  existing legal source of water'' and for determining  [[Page 64204]]  when an existing legal source of water has been eliminated or  transferred.  C. Goals and Purposes of the Plan      The comments reflected different views on the goals and purposes of  the Plan. A number of commenters felt the proposed regulations did not  place enough emphasis on the restoration objectives of the Plan and  recommended that the regulations be revised to clearly state that the  restoration objectives of the Plan are a priority. Another commenter  believed that the language in the proposed regulations concerning the  goals and purposes of the Plan was vague. This commenter suggested that  the language be replaced with the description of the goals and  objectives of the Plan contained in the April 1999 ``Final Integrated  Feasibility Report and Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement.''  Finally, several commenters believed that the regulation should include  all of the goals and purposes of the Plan, including providing for  other water-related needs of the region.     To respond to these comments we have included a definition of the  goals and purposes of the Plan in the final regulations that follows  the language of WRDA 2000. This definition specifies that the  overarching goal of the Plan is the restoration, preservation, and  protection of the South Florida ecosystem while providing for other  water-related needs of the region, including water supply and flood  protection. We believe the open and collaborative process set forth in  these regulations for the implementation of the Plan provides the  greatest assurance that all the goals and the purposes of the Plan will  be achieved. This regulation emulates the successful, open and  collaborative process that produced the Comprehensive Everglades  Restoration Plan and we are confident that these same processes will  ensure that the goals and purposes of the Plan are fulfilled as  intended by Congress.     Several commenters also expressed the view that the proposed  regulations should not have tied performance of the Plan, and  particularly the development of interim goals, to the model run  identified as D-13R in the April 1999 ``Final Integrated Feasibility  Report and Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement.'' These  commenters maintained that implementation modeling conducted after  completion of the feasibility report demonstrated the potential for  improving the Plan with regard to the restoration of the ecosystem.     We have removed the references to D-13R in the final regulations  because we agree that it may be possible to produce ecosystem  restoration benefits beyond those contemplated in D-13R. We will  further evaluate the performance of the Plan in accordance with the  adaptive management provisions of the regulations to determine whether  it is possible to realize any improvements in the performance of the  Plan with regard to ecosystem restoration while providing for other  water-related needs of the region. We will make adjustments to the Plan  to the extent these improvements can be realized consistent with the  overall goals and purposes of the Plan. As indicated, we have deleted  the reference to D-13R in the hope that it may be possible to improve  the Plan's performance with respect to ecosystem restoration consistent  with the statutory and budgetary framework approved by Congress.  D. Defining Restoration      Several commenters expressed concern about the definition of  restoration contained in the proposed regulations. Some commenters felt  that restoration should be defined in terms of hydrologic and ecologic  targets, not the level of performance contained in the April 1999 Final  Integrated Feasibility Report and Programmatic Environmental Impact  Statement'' as was contemplated in the proposed regulations. They  believe that implementing the Plan in accordance with hydrologic and  ecologic targets, and making adjustments as necessary through adaptive  management, is a more effective way to ensure that system-wide  restoration occurs. In particular, the Everglades Coalition commented  that, ``* * * the yellow book provides only a framework for  restoration, and does not clearly describe the essential ecological  characteristics of a sustainable restored Everglades. * * * It is  necessary to keep the definition of restoration * * * based on  ecological necessity and not anticipated performance. This structure is  necessary for the adaptive management process to be successful in  making meaningful improvements to the plan.'' Another commenter stated  that the definition of restoration must clearly specify that  restoration is ``an absolute priority above all others.''     Other commenters expressed the view that the definition of  restoration must take into account certain relevant provisions of WRDA  2000. These commenters point out that the purpose of the Plan was not  to provide for the restoration of the South Florida ecosystem without  regard to other considerations. They note that restoration is not an  open-ended abstract term; WRDA 2000 states that the Plan must take into  account ``the other water-related needs of the region,'' and contains a  prohibition against eliminating or transferring ``existing legal  sources of water'' until new sources of water of comparable quantity  and quality are available to replace the water that is lost as a result  of implementation of the Plan. These commenters pointed out that the  definition of restoration must recognize that Congress authorized the  Plan as a framework for restoring the South Florida ecosystem and that  the restoration that actually occurs is a result of the specific  projects that Congress later authorizes in fulfillment of the Plan.     Other commenters believed that the definition should recognize the  important role that ``getting the water right'' plays in restoration.  Getting the water right involves delivering water to the ecosystem in  the right quantity and quality at the right time and place. Another  commenter held a somewhat similar view, believing that the definition  should emphasize the importance of hydroperiod and water quality in  fulfilling the restoration objective since natural system conditions  are a result of water quality and hydroperiod conditions.     Other commenters expressed the view that the definition of  restoration in the proposed regulations was not scientifically  credible. These commenters believed that to be credible from a  scientific perspective, the definition of restoration must take into  account other considerations that are relevant to the ecological  condition of the South Florida ecosystem. For example, state and local  restoration and water quality programs affect the South Florida  ecosystem as well. Additionally, some commenters pointed out that there  is no consensus among scientists about the specific ecological  parameters that constitute successful ``restoration.'' As an example,  there is no agreement on what the goal should be for the population of  specific species of plants, fish, or birds.     To some extent, the disagreement surrounding the definition of  restoration reflects the underlying concern of affected parties that  the definition of restoration will not take their interests into  account. Certain parties are concerned that if the definition of  restoration does not assign a proper role to science in fulfilling the  objectives of the Plan, the implementation of the Plan will be driven  by political compromises. These parties are concerned that as Federal  and State governments move forward with implementation of the Plan, the  restoration goals of the Plan  [[Page 64205]]  will be preempted by water supply and flood protection needs. In this  regard, the Natural Resources Defense Council urged that the  programmatic regulations must ``preclude the achievement of water  supply and flood protection goals at the expense of restoration  goals.'' Other commenters are concerned that the other water-related  goals of the region will be ignored in an effort to advance an elusive  and constantly changing vision of restoration favored by scientists,  instead of the Plan approved by Congress. All commenters emphasized the  importance of developing an appropriate definition of restoration so  that CERP projects are properly sequenced and appropriations wisely  spent.     The final regulations contain a new definition of restoration that  responds to these comments. The regulations define restoration as the  recovery and protection of the South Florida ecosystem so that it once  again achieves and sustains the essential hydrological and biological  characteristics that defined this ecosystem in an undisturbed  condition. This definition acknowledges that, as authorized by  Congress, the restored South Florida ecosystem will be significantly  healthier than the current system but will be smaller and somewhat  differently arranged than the historic ecosystem. Also, there may be  different degrees of restoration in different areas of the ecosystem.  The irreversible physical changes made to the South Florida ecosystem  make a complete return to the historic ecosystem impossible. However,  the restored ecosystem will have recovered those essential hydrological  and biological characteristics that defined the undisturbed South  Florida ecosystem and made it unique among the world's wetlands  systems.     The new definition of restoration recognizes that the restoration  goal of the Plan is to achieve a healthy and functioning ecosystem that  once again exhibits the essential characteristics of the undisturbed  South Florida ecosystem. The definition acknowledges that, as  authorized by Congress, the restored ecosystem will be different than  the historic ecosystem. In so doing, the definition affords flexibility  to allow for adaptive management and the accommodation of other water- related needs of the region, as the Plan is implemented through  individual projects specifically authorized by Congress.     The definition of restoration recognizes implicitly that science  will be the foundation of restoration, but it also assumes, as noted  throughout the programmatic regulations, that in all phases of  implementation of the Plan both restoration and the other goals and  purposes of the Plan should be achieved. The definition also recognizes  that we must act within the legislative framework that has been  approved by Congress in WRDA 2000 and later may be approved by Congress  in future authorization acts.  E. Amount of Water Provided for Restoration      Some commenters expressed the view that the regulations must  include a statement that new water generated by the Plan will be  reserved for the natural system on an 80%-20% basis. These commenters  note that the report of the Senate Committee on Environment and Public  Works on WRDA 2000 (Senate Report No. 106-362) states:      The Plan contains a general outline of the quantities of water  to be produced by each project. According to the Army Corps, 80  percent of the water generated by the Plan is needed for the natural  system in order to attain restoration goals, and 20 percent of the  water generated for use in the human environment. * * * Subject to  future authorizations by Congress, the committee fully expects that  the water necessary for restoration, currently estimated at 80  percent of the water generated by the Plan, will be reserved or  allocated for the benefit of the natural system (Emphasis added).      These commenters believed that the 80%-20% ratio should be set  forth in the regulations as a generalized planning goal for reserving  or allocating new water to the natural system. They are concerned that  the 80%-20% ratio was not identified in the proposed regulations as a  planning goal. On a different but related note, several commenters felt  that a water budget should be developed for the South Florida ecosystem  to ensure that the restoration goals of the Plan are achieved.     Other commenters observed that the 80%-20% ratio was merely the  initial estimate of the new water that would be produced by the Plan  and therefore, could be allocated or reserved for the benefit of the  natural system. These commenters maintain that the goal of the Plan is  to provide whatever water is needed for restoration of the natural  system, irrespective of the 80%-20% ratio. These commenters point out  that individual components of the Plan may produce amounts of water  different from this initial estimate. In fact, some commenters pointed  out that the 80%-20% ratio was part of a scenario called D-13R4, which  was not included in the framework Plan (D-13R) authorized by Congress.     We understand the desire of the commenters to assure sufficient  water will be allocated or reserved for the benefit of the natural  system. To accomplish this result, we believe that it is necessary to  preserve the ability to adapt to new information as the Plan is  implemented. Therefore, the regulations do not contemplate the  allocation of water on a rigid 80%-20% basis, either system-wide or  project-by-project. Instead, the final regulations ensure that adequate  water will be allocated or reserved for the benefit of the natural  system without regard to this ratio by requiring that each Project  Implementation Report evaluate and identify water to be reserved for  the natural system and made available for other water-related needs of  the region, and that the Plan itself be continually evaluated through  adaptive management to assure that adequate water is allocated or  reserved on a system-wide basis.     The final rule also provides that the Corps of Engineers and the  South Florida Water Management District will determine the total  quantity of water that is expected to be generated by implementation of  the Plan, including the quantity expected to be generated for the  natural system to attain restoration goals as well as the quantity  expected to be generated for use in the human environment, and will  periodically update that estimate, as appropriate, based upon changed  or unforeseen circumstances, new scientific and technical information,  new or updated modeling, and congressionally authorized projects or  modifications to the Plan. In addition, the final regulations envision  that a water budget for the Plan will be developed and disseminated  annually to the public. These regulatory provisions will ensure that  adequate water will be reserved or allocated to the natural system as  intended by Congress.  F. Independent Scientific Review and External Peer Review      A number of commenters were concerned that the proposed regulations  did not provide for the establishment of an independent scientific  review panel. They noted that section 601(j) of WRDA 2000 requires that  the Secretary of the Army, the Secretary of the Interior, and the  Governor, in cooperation with the Task Force establish an independent  scientific review panel convened by a body, such as the National  Academy of Sciences, to review the Plan's progress toward achieving the  natural system restoration goals of the Plan. These commenters feel  that the panel must operate independently of the Corps of  [[Page 64206]]  Engineers, the State, and the Department of the Interior and believe  that the programmatic regulations should address how the implementing  agencies would work with the panel. One commenter also felt that the  proposed regulations did not provide an appropriate role for the Task  Force in the establishment of the independent scientific review panel.     The Department of the Army embraces the use of independent  scientific review and external peer review. The successful  implementation of CERP requires that appropriate decisions be made  about significant scientific and technical issues. These extremely  technical, often controversial, issues will be presented in various  reports and documents generated by numerous sources, including the  Corps of Engineers, the South Florida Water Management District,  Everglades National Park, the Fish and Wildlife Service, the Florida  Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission, and various Federal, State,  and local agencies. Independent scientific review and external peer  review will ensure that the decisions made in implementing CERP are  based on appropriate data and sound science that is clearly presented  to decision makers.     There was some confusion evident in comments and public meetings  regarding the panel that will be established to perform the section  601(j) functions and other independent scientific review, particularly  the standing panel currently used by the South Florida Ecosystem  Restoration Task Force (Task Force). In February 1999, the Task Force  endorsed ``the establishment of an ongoing outside scientific review  panel * * * as an essential component to ensure an effective adaptive  management process for South Florida Ecosystem restoration.'' In  September 1999, in fulfillment of the Task Force's resolution, the  Department of the Interior entered into a five-year cooperative  agreement with the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) to establish the  Committee on Restoration of the Greater Everglades Ecosystem (CROGEE).  CROGEE provides scientific advice to the Task Force and its member  agencies and that the Committee will review and make recommendations on  the scientific and technical aspects and elements relating to the South  Florida ecosystem.     The section 601(j) panel will be independent of CROGEE or any other  panel. Its only mission will be to carry out section 601(j).     Acting on a proposal from the Department of the Army, the Secretary  of the Army, the Secretary of the Interior, and the Governor, in  consultation with the South Florida Ecosystem Restoration Task Force,  agreed to designate the National Academy of Sciences to convene the  initial independent scientific panel that will perform the tasks  required by Section 601(j) of the Water Resources Development Act of  2000. The final regulations contain new language that identifies the  National Academy of Sciences as the entity that will convene the  initial independent scientific review panel. These regulations also  acknowledge that the South Florida Ecosystem Restoration Task Force has  played a role in choosing the National Academy of Science as the  initial organization to convene the panel, and the Task Force will play  a role in the establishment of the panel. The final regulations state  that we will enter into an agreement with the National Academy of  Sciences to convene the independent scientific review panel. This  agreement shall be for a period of five years with options for  extensions in five-year increments. The final regulations include a  statement recognizing that independent scientific review is crucial for  ensuring that the best available science is used in the implementation  of the Plan. The regulations recognize the continuing role of the Task  Force to consult on decisions to exercise the option to extend the  agreement. The regulations recognize the continuing role of the Task  Force in designation of the organization to convene future panels and  to consult on establishment of the panel upon expiration of the initial  agreement.     The final regulations state that the Secretary of the Army, the  Secretary of the Interior, and the Governor shall finalize any  agreements and procedures necessary to provide for the operation and  funding of the independent scientific review panel and establish this  panel within six months of the effective date of the programmatic  regulations.     The final regulations set forth the expectation that the National  Academy of Sciences will use established practices for assuring the  independence of members and that the review panel will include members  reflecting a balance of the knowledge, training, and experience  suitable to comprehensively review and assess the Plan's progress  towards achieving restoration goals. WRDA 2000 provides very specific  direction that the panel is ``to review the Plan's progress toward  achieving the natural system restoration goals of the Plan.'' This  specific requirement will be the focus of the agreement and the mission  of the independent scientific review panel. The independent panel's  tasks include those activities that are necessary to review the Plan's  progress towards achieving the restoration goals of the Plan. In  addition, in accordance with WRDA 2000, the panel will produce a  biennial report to Congress, the Secretary of the Army, the Secretary  of the Interior, and the Governor that includes an assessment of  ecological indicators and other measures of progress in restoring the  ecology of the natural system, based on the Plan.     To further insure the independence of the panel, the regulations  provide that the panel will not be assigned, and may not accept, other  tasks, nor may it provide advice on other matters to any entity, public  or private. Its sole mission is to review the Plan's progress toward  achieving the natural system restoration goals of the Plan and to  produce the section 601(j) report.     The final regulations provide that the agreement with the section  601(j) panel will specifically recognize that the agencies may provide  for other independent scientific panels and peer review to address  specific scientific or technical questions. The regulations provide for  an external peer review process to review documents, reports,  procedures, or to address specific scientific or technical questions or  issues. Draft Pilot Project Technical Reports and draft assessment  reports are specifically designated to be externally peer reviewed.  G. Restoration Coordination and Verification (RECOVER)      Many comments focused on the role of RECOVER in implementing the  Plan. Some of the commenters felt that the responsibilities of RECOVER  were not clearly identified in the proposed regulations. They suggested  that these responsibilities should be organized according to three  major missions `` assessment, evaluation, and planning. Another  commenter felt the final regulations should clearly state that RECOVER  is not an independent body but that it is instead an interagency group  that prepares work products for consideration by others. Some  commenters believe that the final regulation should emphasize that  RECOVER is composed of agency personnel with scientific expertise.  Several commenters believed that the Department of the Interior should  have a co-leadership role over RECOVER along with the Corps of  Engineers and the South Florida Water Management District.  [[Page 64207]]      RECOVER's origins trace back to the April 1999 ``Final Integrated  Feasibility Report and Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement.''  RECOVER is an interdisciplinary, interagency scientific and technical  team that was designed to perform system-wide analyses. In reviewing  the comments on the proposed regulations, we felt that some  misunderstanding might exist concerning the role of RECOVER. For  example, some commenters suggested that RECOVER should be an  independent body because independent science plays an important role in  implementing the Plan. While RECOVER is a science-based group because  many of its members possess scientific expertise, it is not an  independent agency. It is an interagency group consisting of members  from governmental entities The role of RECOVER is to promote an  integrated view within the implementing agencies on matters relevant to  the implementation of the Plan in order to ensure that the goals and  purposes of the Plan are achieved. Independent scientific research will  be used to gain perspectives on these issues from outside parties and  will be provided by entities other than RECOVER.     The final regulations recognize that RECOVER is an existing,  presently functioning interagency team. The final regulations are  consistent with the description of RECOVER in the Plan and envision  that RECOVER will play an important role in ensuring that a system-wide  perspective is applied and that the best available scientific and  technical information is used during the development, implementation,  and evaluation of the Plan. The final regulations address a number of  issues. They recognize that the Corps of Engineers and the South  Florida Water Management District will oversee the activities of  RECOVER. The final regulations also identify the members of the RECOVER  Leadership Group, which includes the program managers from the Corps of  Engineers and the South Florida Water Management District, the  Environmental Protection Agency, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric  Administration, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the U.S. Geological  Survey, Everglades National Park, the Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of  Florida, the Seminole Tribe of Florida, the Florida Department of  Agriculture and Consumer Services, the Florida Department of  Environmental Protection, and the Florida Fish and Wildlife  Conservation Commission. The diverse membership of the Leadership Group  assures that the views of Federal agencies, State agencies, and Tribes  are appropriately represented. The final regulations outline a series  of specific scientific and technical duties RECOVER will perform to  assist the Corps of Engineers and the non-Federal sponsors in achieving  the goals and purposes of the Plan, particularly restoration of the  natural system. We have grouped these duties under the three major  missions of RECOVER--assessment, evaluation, and planning/integration  activities.     Again, the final regulations indicate that RECOVER is an  interagency, interdisciplinary, scientific and technical team. The  regulations state that the documents prepared by RECOVER are to be  provided to the Corps of Engineers and the South Florida Water  Management District for consideration as they carry out their  responsibilities in implementing the Plan. The regulations specify that  the Corps of Engineers and the SFWMD will consult with other Federal  agencies, state agencies, local agencies and Tribes, as they consider  the information that is provided by RECOVER.     Several commenters expressed the view that RECOVER is an advisory  body that is subject to the Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA). We  concluded that FACA does not apply to RECOVER. FACA contains an  exception for meetings ``held exclusively between Federal officials and  elected officers of State, local, and tribal governments,'' where those  meetings ``are solely for the purposes of exchanging views,  information, or advice relating to the management or implementation of  Federal programs established pursuant to public law that explicitly or  inherently share intergovernmental responsibilities or  administration.'' Unfunded Mandates Act, Public Law 104-4, 109 Stat.  48, 65 (1995), 2 U.S.C. 1501, 1534 et seq. RECOVER's meetings and  activities fall within this exception. Another commenter noted that  FACA does not apply to the South Florida Ecosystem Restoration Task  Force, pursuant to WRDA 1996 and proposed that RECOVER be made an  advisory committee to the South Florida Ecosystem Restoration Task  Force to avoid the application of FACA. Because we have determined FACA  does not apply to RECOVER's meetings and activities, we do not believe  this action is necessary.  H. Reservation or Allocation of Water for the Natural System      The provisions in the proposed regulations concerning the  reservation or allocation of water for the natural system were of  interest to a number of parties. A brief discussion of the legislative  foundation of these provisions proves helpful in understanding these  comments.     The Plan authorized in WRDA 2000 is a framework plan designed to  improve the distribution of water to the South Florida ecosystem. In  accordance with section 601(f) of WRDA 2000, the Secretary of the Army,  in coordination with the non-Federal sponsor, must prepare a Project  Implementation Report before proceeding with an individual project that  is included in the Plan. Section 601(h)(4)(A) of WRDA 2000 states that  the Project Implementation Report must, among other items, identify the  amount of water to be reserved or allocated for the natural system in  order to provide for the appropriate quantity, timing, and distribution  of water dedicated and managed for the natural system, and comply with  applicable water quality and permitting standards. Section  601(h)(4)(B)(2) of WRDA 2000 specifies that the reservation or  allocation of water for the natural system will be implemented under  State law and must be made before the Department of the Army can  execute a Project Cooperation Agreement for a project.     Several commenters expressed concern about the process for  verifying that a reservation or allocation of water for the natural  system has been made under State law. One commenter believed that the  regulations should clarify the process for determining reservations by  establishing a restoration target of water to be reserved or  established for each area of the ecosystem. Another commenter requested  that the Corps of Engineers develop procedures for verifying that the  reservation or allocation of water identified in the Project  Implementation Report has been executed under State law. Two commenters  believed that the requirement to amend the Project Cooperation  Agreement (PCA) whenever the State revises the reservation limits the  State's discretion to make appropriate reservations under State law.  These commenters also believe that the requirement to revise the PCA is  unnecessary as the State is required to make reservations that are  consistent with the requirements of the President-Governor agreement of  January 9, 2002, and that agreement is specifically enforceable in  court. Both the State of Florida and the South Florida Water Management  District expressed the view that in enacting WRDA 2000, Congress had  not preempted State water law and that the programmatic regulations  should not impede or interfere with Florida water law. Several  commenters  [[Page 64208]]  were concerned that under the proposed regulations, changes to  reservations or allocations of water could be made without the same  congressional and public involvement that occurred for the initial  reservation. Several Senators, while recognizing that reservations may  need to be revised, expressed the view that because Congress approves  projects based on a quantification of water, it also has a  responsibility to ensure that when any change to a reservation of water  occurs, that the Project Cooperation Agreement be changed to account  for de minimus changes or changes consistent with the purposes of the  Plan, or that the change be authorized by Congress.     Many commenters observed that the proposed regulations did not  address the possibility that the actual performance of a project or  project component might not meet the performance expected in the  Project Implementation Report (PIR). As explained, WRDA 2000 requires  that the Secretary not execute a Project Cooperation Agreement until a  reservation or allocation of water for the natural system has been  executed under State law. This raises the potential for problems under  the provisions in WRDA 2000 that require sufficient reservations of  water for the restoration of the natural system to be made under State  law in accordance with the PIR for that project and provisions in the  savings clause of WRDA 2000 that prohibit the elimination or transfer  of existing legal sources of water. The problem arises if the actual  performance of a project does not meet the projections of the water to  be produced by the project or component laid out in the PIR. This led  us to conclude that the final regulations must contain a discussion of  what actions should be taken if a project or component does not perform  as expected. This issue arises because the performance of a project or  component will impact the reservation of the appropriate quantity,  timing, and distribution of water dedicated and managed for the natural  system, and whether a new source of water supply of comparable quantity  and quality has been provided to replace an existing legal source, as  required by the savings clause. The amount of water identified in the  PIR is only a projection and the actual amount of water produced by a  project will only be known when the project has been operated. The  proposed regulations also were designed not to interfere in the State  reservation process while providing, consistent with Congressional  intent, that the reservation remain consistent with the agreements  reached between the State and Federal government in the Project  Cooperation Agreement.     The proposed regulations recognized that reservations or  allocations of water are a State responsibility. We attempted to ensure  that the purpose of CERP reservations were met in the final regulations  by requiring that the Project Cooperation Agreement include a finding  that the required reservation has been made before execution of a  Project Cooperation Agreement and by providing that the parties execute  an amendment to the agreement if there is a change in the reservations.  The final regulations also specify that ``State law'' includes  reservations or allocations of water made by the South Florida Water  Management District or the Florida Department of Environmental  Protection under authority of Florida law. The intent was to preserve  the State's control over its reservation and allocation process while  also protecting the Federal interest in proceeding with the project  only if adequate water had been reserved for the natural system.     In order to clarify our process and provide further assurances to  concerned parties, the final regulations include provisions which state  that prior to the execution of the Project Cooperation Agreement, the  District Engineer will verify that the initial reservation has been  made by the State, and that the District Engineer's verification will  be referred to in the Project Cooperation Agreement and made available  to the public. This provision is consistent with the right of third  parties to enforce the reservation provisions of the President-Governor  agreement of January 9, 2002. The final regulations retain the  provision in the proposed regulations that reservations or allocations  of water are a State responsibility and that any change to the  reservation or allocation of water for the natural system made under  State law will require an amendment to the Project Cooperation  Agreement. The final regulations also retain the provision in the  proposed regulations that the District Engineer will, in consultation  with other agencies and the Tribes, make a determination, after  considering any changed circumstances or new information since  completion of the PIR, that the revised reservation or allocation  continues to provide for an appropriate quantity, timing, and  distribution of water dedicated and managed for the natural system and  satisfies the requirements of the project-specific assurances of CERP.     The final regulations also provide that the Secretary of the Army  will notify the appropriate committees of Congress if a change in  reservation is made after approval of the PIR. The Secretary's and the  State's reasons for changing the reservation and information about any  new or changed circumstances will also be provided to Congress. This  provision will assist Congressional oversight of any project, and its  oversight of the integrity of the reservation process.     We feel that these measures provide adequate assurances that the  requirements of WRDA 2000 will be followed while not infringing upon  the authority of the State of Florida. The open process also ensures  both government and public oversight.  I. Interim Goals      Many comments focused on development of the interim goals. As  background, section 601(h)(3)(c)(i)(III) of WRDA 2000 requires that the  ``Programmatic regulations * * * establish a process * * * to ensure  the protection of the natural system consistent with the goals and  purposes of the Plan, including the establishment of interim goals to  provide a means by which the restoration success of the Plan may be  evaluated throughout the implementation process.'' Interim goals  provide a means of tracking restoration performance and for  periodically evaluating the accuracy of predictions of system responses  to the effects of the Plan. Progress towards meeting the interim goals  is to be reported to Congress as part of the periodic reports required  by WRDA 2000.     There was universal agreement among agencies, tribes, interest  groups, and the public that interim goals will be useful for measuring  the restoration success of the Plan; however, there was disagreement  about whether the interim goals should be included in the final  programmatic regulations. Some commenters believed that WRDA 2000  required that the interim goals be included in the programmatic  regulations. In contrast, other commenters maintained that WRDA 2000  merely required that the regulations develop ``a process'' for  establishing interim goals, and did not require that the goals  themselves be in the regulations. Other commenters expressed views that  did not relate to statutory considerations. Some of these commenters  believed that it was important to include the interim goals in the  programmatic regulations to give them appropriate visibility and to  ensure that the interim goals are actually met. These commenters also  believed that including the interim goals in the regulations would have  the additional benefit of enabling the public to take part in the  process of establishing the goals. Another group of  [[Page 64209]]  commenters realized that we could not include the interim goals in the  regulations now but urged that they be made a part of the regulations  at a later time. In this regard, five Senators wrote: ``We understand  that the interim goals will not be ready to include in the regulations  before they are finalized, but we urge the Corps to include these goals  when they are established rather than relegating them to guidance  documents.'' Two Congressmen commented that the final rule should  provide for ``adoption of interim restoration goals once the  programmatic regulations are completed.''     Other comments maintained that interim goals should not be included  in the programmatic regulations. Some pointed out that the Plan  incorporates adaptive management, continuously assessing and adapting  to new information and circumstances. They believe that incorporating  fixed goals into regulations is inconsistent with adaptive management.  Some commenters maintain that the rulemaking process is structured and  cumbersome and that it is impractical to establish and amend interim  goals through such a time-consuming process. These commenters believe  that placing the interim goals in the programmatic regulations would  delay the process of adopting and amending the goals, which is  inconsistent with the concept of adaptive management. Other commenters  were also concerned with delays but their concerns relate to  identifying the interim goals in an Interim Goals Agreement independent  of the regulations and making this agreement subject to the concurrence  of the Secretary of the Interior and the Governor. These commenters  maintain that the statute only grants the Secretary of the Interior and  the Governor a concurrence right in the programmatic regulations and  extending this right to the Interim Goals Agreement will simply cause  delays.     In reviewing the comments, it was apparent that there was  significant disagreement on exactly what the interim goals should be.  One commenter observed that the interim goals should not include  ecological goals as that could subvert the hydrological basis for the  Plan. Most commenters who maintained that interim goals must be  included in the regulations did not give examples or provide  descriptions of the interim goals. Even those who thought that interim  goals should be included in the final regulations recognized that  additional time was required to perform more modeling related to the  interim goals. These commenters understood the importance of modeling  in establishing interim goals that are an effective measure of the  Plan's progress toward restoration. A number of commenters, including  the Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Florida, expressed a desire to  review and comment on the interim goals before they are set forth in  the Interim Goals Agreement.     As a threshold matter, we think it is important to acknowledge the  significance of the interim goals. The interim goals provide the  yardstick that will measure the success of the restoration effort. It  will not be possible to fairly measure the success or failure of the  Plan without appropriate interim goals. The final regulations establish  principles that will guide the development of the interim goals and the  execution of the Interim Goals Agreement discussed in Sec.  385.38(a).  These principles will appropriately involve Tribes, governmental  interests and the public in the process. The regulations do not contain  the specific interim goals because more time is needed to model them to  satisfaction; therefore, the final regulations retain the concept of  establishing the interim goals in an Interim Goals Agreement. The  regulations provide that the public will have the opportunity to review  and comment on the Interim Goals Agreement before the agreement is  finalized. The regulation also makes clear that interim goals are  targets for use by the agencies and Congress in evaluating the success  of the restoration effort. They are not standards or schedules  enforceable in court. The final regulations provide for the development  and use of interim goals that include water quality and ecological  indicators in addition to indicators characteristic of anticipated  hydrological performance. These indicators will be helpful in making  meaningful judgments about the performance of the Plan.     In order to address the concern that interim goals be given  appropriate visibility, and to clarify the relationship between the  interim goals and the programmatic regulations, the final regulations  also contain a new section, 385.1(c), that clarifies our interpretation  of the statutory assurances provided for in section 601(h) of WRDA 2000  and how the processes, tools and enforcement mechanism established in  this section of the Act constitute an integrated framework for assuring  that the goals and purposes of the Plan are achieved. The section  clarifies that the programmatic regulations provide a process for  developing tools, including Project Implementation Reports, Project  Cooperation Agreements, Operating Manuals, interim goals, and other  tools established in the regulations, which are used to guide the  planning implementation and evaluation of the project. Section 601(h)  also provides an enforcement mechanism, the Agreement between the  President and the Governor, under which the State is to ensure, by  regulation or other appropriate means, that water made available by  each project in the Plan shall not be permitted for a consumptive use  or otherwise made unavailable by the State until such time as  sufficient reservations of water for the restoration of the natural  system are made under State law in accordance with the project  implementation report and consistent with the Plan. The President and  the Governor signed this Agreement on January 9, 2002.     The new Sec.  385.1(c) further directs the Secretary of the Army to  ensure that the public understands the linkage between the process,  tools, and enforcement mechanism and can monitor the effectiveness of  this integrated framework in assuring that the goals and purposes of  the Plan are achieved, as provided for in the programmatic regulations,  by providing for public notice and comment in the development of the  tools; providing notice of final action on tools; making available on  the world-wide web or by other appropriate means final, and where  appropriate draft, copies of all tools; and explaining through these  regulations and by other appropriate means the process for developing  the tools, the linkage between the process, tools and enforcement  mechanism, and the means by which these elements constitute an  integrated framework for assuring that the goals and purposes of the  Plan are achieved.     The Restoration Coordination and Verification (RECOVER) team will  use the principles set forth in the proposed regulations to develop and  recommend by no later than six months after the effective date of the  programmatic regulations, a set of interim goals for implementation of  the Plan. This date was set in recognition of the completion dates for  the pre-CERP baseline and the Master Implementation Sequencing Plan.  RECOVER has already begun work in order to meet the deadline.     The final regulations specify that the interim goals will identify  improvements in quantity, timing, and distribution of water in five- year increments that begin in 2005, with the goals reflecting the  results expected to be achieved by 2010 and for each five-year  increment thereafter. As stated, the interim goals also will include  indicators for water quality improvement and ecological responses,  [[Page 64210]]  such as increases in extent of wetlands, improvements in habitat  quality, and improvements in native plant and animal abundance. While  hydrologic interim goals will assess the Plan's success in restoring  the hydrology of the region, we believe that the development and use of  indicators for water quality improvement and ecological responses is  necessary to assess the Plan's success in achieving the ultimate goal  of restoration of a healthy ecosystem. The final regulations recognize  that programs and activities that are independent of CERP may influence  the achievement of improvements in water quality and desired ecological  responses. The extent of the influence of these programs and activities  should be assessed and described at the time goals are developed, and  should be taken into account as the Plan is subsequently evaluated  relative to its goals and purposes. In addition, the final regulations  include specific water quality indicators for RECOVER to consider.     The final regulations envision that RECOVER will provide its  recommendations to the Army Corps of Engineers, the South Florida Water  Management District, and the Department of the Interior for  consideration. A proposed Interim Goals Agreement shall be developed by  the Secretary of the Army, the Secretary of the Interior and the  Governor in consultation with the Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of  Florida, the Seminole Tribe of Florida, the Environmental Protection  Agency, the Department of the Commerce, other Federal, State, and local  agencies, and the South Florida Ecosystem Restoration Task Force.  Interim goals will be memorialized in an agreement to be signed by the  Secretary of the Army, the Secretary of the Interior, and the Governor  of the State of Florida no later than one year after the effective date  of the programmatic regulations. The Secretary of the Army will provide  a notice of availability of the proposed agreement to the public in the  Federal Register, seek public comments, and execute the final agreement  with the Secretary of the Interior and the Governor.     As discussed previously, the final regulations do not envision that  interim goals will be included in the programmatic regulations  themselves. The regulations provide that the Department of the Army  will memorialize the Interim Goals Agreement in appropriate Corps of  Engineers guidance. However, the regulations do establish requirements  that are triggered if the interim goals are not achieved as  anticipated. If the interim goals have not been met or are unlikely to  be met, then the Corps of Engineers and the South Florida Water  Management District must determine why the goals have not been met or  are unlikely to be met and either initiate adaptive management actions  to achieve the interim goals as soon as practical, consistent with the  purposes of the Plan and consistent with the interim targets, or  recommend changes to the interim goals.     Finally, the final regulations establish a process for revising the  interim goals in five-year increments or sooner, if appropriate, in  light of new information.  J. Interim Targets for Other Water-Related Needs of the Region      The overarching objective of the Plan is the restoration,  preservation, and protection of the South Florida ecosystem while  providing for other water-related needs of the region, including water  supply and flood protection. Identifying incremental targets for the  other water-related needs of the region will help evaluate the success  of implementation of the Plan in achieving the non-restoration goals of  the Plan. The proposed regulations included provisions establishing a  process for evaluating progress on meeting the other water-related  needs of the region.     These provisions drew comments from several parties. One commenter  suggested that the process for developing targets for other water- related needs of the region should closely parallel the process for  developing the restoration-related interim goals. Two commenters  believed that the date specified in the proposed regulations for  RECOVER to provide recommendations on the targets should be extended  because the targets are influenced by information that will be  developed in connection with the pre-CERP baseline and the Master  Implementation Sequencing Plan. One commenter expressed the view that  the targets for other water-related needs should not be established  before the adoption of the restoration-related interim goals. Other  commenters were concerned that the proposed regulations did not address  the question of how issues would be resolved if conflicts arise between  achieving the interim goals and the targets for other water-related  needs.     The final regulations provide that by not later than six months  after the effective date of the programmatic regulations, RECOVER will  recommend interim targets for the other water-related needs of the  region, that are consistent with the interim goals. The Secretary of  the Army and the Governor, in consultation with others, including the  South Florida Ecosystem Restoration Task Force, will develop the  interim targets. RECOVER already has begun work in order to meet the  deadline. The final regulations specify that the Secretary of the Army  and the Governor will establish the targets within one year of the  effective date of the programmatic regulations, but not prior to the  execution of the Interim Goals Agreement. Like interim goals directed  at evaluating the restoration success of the Plan, interim targets for  other water-related needs of the region will be incorporated into  appropriate agency guidance.     The final regulations retain the idea of drawing a distinction  between interim goals, which are directed at evaluating the restoration  success of the Plan, and interim targets for achieving the other water- related needs of the region. In the regulations, we use the term  ``interim'' in front of the term ``targets'' to show that the interim  targets for other water-related needs, which evaluate progress towards  providing for these purposes, are parallel to the interim goals, which  measure restoration success.     Like the provisions for interim goals, the final regulations  specify that the interim targets will identify improvements in  quantity, timing and distribution of water in five-year increments that  begin in 2005, with the targets reflecting the results expected to be  achieved by 2010 and for each five-year increment thereafter. The  interim targets will include indicators for the frequency of water  restrictions in various areas and the frequency of meeting salt-water  intrusion protection criteria for different areas. Again, like the  provisions for interim goals, the final regulations do establish  requirements that are triggered if the interim targets are not achieved  as anticipated. If the interim targets have not been met or are  unlikely to be met, then the Corps of Engineers and the South Florida  Water Management District must determine why the targets have not been  met or are unlikely to be met and either initiate adaptive management  actions to achieve the interim targets as soon as practical, consistent  with the purposes of the Plan and consistent with the interim goals, or  recommend changes to the interim targets.     Finally, the final regulations make clear that the interim targets  are intended to facilitate inter-agency planning, monitoring, and  assessment throughout the implementation process and are not standards  or schedules enforceable in court.  [[Page 64211]]  K. Role of the Department of the Interior      Several commenters recommended that the Department of the Interior  be given a more prominent role in implementation of the Plan because it  administers significant lands and natural resources involved in the  Plan. These commenters felt that the concurrence provisions in the  proposed regulations diminished the role of the Department of the  Interior envisioned in WRDA 2000. They felt that the concurrence  provisions in the proposed regulations did not give the Secretary of  the Interior an appropriate role in approving the guidance memoranda  because the Secretary of the Army could finalize these documents after  giving good faith consideration to comments from the Secretary of the  Interior, notwithstanding the fact that the Secretary of the Interior  might have concerns about finalizing the regulations. In addition,  these commenters believe that the Department of the Interior should  have a concurrence role on other programmatic decisions such as  Comprehensive Plan Modification Reports, the Master Implementation  Sequencing Plan, and System Operating Manual. Other commenters noted  that the concurrence process in WRDA 2000 only extends to the  programmatic regulations and that section 601(h)(3)(C)(ii) expressly  prohibits the requirement for concurrence on Project Implementation  Reports, Project Cooperation Agreements, Operating Manuals for  individual projects, and other documents relating to the development,  implementation, and management of individual features of the Plan  unless concurrence is provided for in other laws. These commenters did  not favor giving the Department of the Interior a greater role in  implementing the Plan.     The final regulations give the Department of the Interior a  concurrence role, along with the Governor of the State of Florida, in  the development of six specific guidance memoranda related to important  program-wide aspects of implementing the Plan. These guidance memoranda  address the: (1) General format and content of Project Implementation  Reports; (2) processes for evaluation of alternatives developed for  Project Implementation Reports, their cost effectiveness and impacts;  (3) general content of operating manuals; (4) general processes for the  conduct of assessment activities of RECOVER; (5) process for  identifying if an elimination or transfer of existing legal sources of  water will occur as a result of implementation of the Plan; and (6)  process used in Project Implementation Reports for identifying the  appropriate quantity, timing, and distribution of water dedicated and  managed for the natural system. In accordance with section  601(h)(3)(c)(ii) of WRDA 2000, the regulations prohibit concurrence by  the Secretary of the Interior and the Governor of Florida on Project  Implementation Reports, Project Cooperation Agreements, Operating  Manuals for individual projects, and other documents relating to  individual features of the Plan.     We revised the concurrence provisions in the final regulations so  that the approval process for the guidance memoranda parallels the  statutory concurrence process for the programmatic regulations. We  deleted the language in the proposed regulations that said the Army  would give ``good faith consideration'' to the concurrence or non- concurrence statements of the Secretary of the Interior and the  Governor before approving the guidance memoranda. This language did not  communicate adequately our intent to obtain the concurrence of the  Secretary of the Interior and the Governor. Instead, it suggested that  the Army simply had to fulfill a ministerial coordination requirement  by asking the Secretary of the Interior and the Governor whether they  concurred or non-concurred in the guidance memorandum. We felt that  this language did not convey the Army's intent to actively seek the  concurrence of the Secretary of the Interior and the Governor prior to  approving the guidance memoranda.     The final regulations also provide that the Department of the  Interior will play a significant role in addressing other issues  related to the Plan. Like the proposed regulations, the final rule  gives the Secretary of the Interior, along with the Governor of the  State of Florida, a concurring role in the Secretary of the Army's  determination of the pre-CERP baseline. The final regulations also  envision that interim goals will be established through a formal  Interim Goals Agreement among the Secretary of the Army, the Secretary  of the Interior, and the Governor. Further, the Department of the  Interior plays an important role in the Leadership Group of RECOVER,  along with several other Federal and State agencies and Tribes.     Finally, the regulations give the Department of the Interior an  important consulting role throughout implementation of the program,  including, among other things, participation on Project Delivery Teams;  selection and revision of hydrologic models; development of the  Adaptive Management Program, Project Implementation Reports, Operating  Manuals, and Comprehensive Plan Modification Reports; development,  review and revision of changes to the Master Implementation Sequencing  Plan; and the development of the means for monitoring progress towards  other water-related needs of the region as provided for in the Plan.     Read together, we believe that these provisions give the Department  of the Interior as well as the Governor of the State of Florida an  important and appropriate role in implementing the Plan. This prominent  role is consistent with Interior's natural resources stewardship and  land management responsibilities.  L. Role of South Florida Ecosystem Restoration Task Force      Several commenters felt that the proposed regulations did not give  the South Florida Ecosystem Restoration Task Force (``Task Force'') an  appropriate role in Plan implementation. The Task Force is an  interagency group created by section 528(f) of the Water Resources  Development Act of 1996 (110 Stat. 3770) (hereinafter ``WRDA 1996'')  More specifically, the Miccosukee Tribe and the Seminole Tribe  expressed the view that the Task Force could play a constructive role  in facilitating an open discussion of issues related to implementation  of the Plan among Federal, State, Tribal, and local interests. The  Seminole Tribe also commented that information about alternatives  developed for Project Implementation Reports should be shared with the  Task Force before the completion of the draft Project Implementation  Report.     The responsibilities of the Task Force are found in section 528 of  WRDA 1996 and section 601 of WRDA 2000. In general, section 528  envisions that the Task Force will coordinate programs and research on  ecosystem restoration, exchange information, provide assistance and  facilitate resolution of conflicts involving the restoration of the  South Florida ecosystem. Section 601 of WRDA 2000 gives the Task Force  a consultation responsibility concerning the establishment of an  independent scientific review panel to review the progress that is  being made toward achieving the natural system restoration goals of the  Plan.     The final regulations recognize that the Task Force can play a  constructive role in Plan implementation. The regulations acknowledge  the benefits that result from sharing issues with the  [[Page 64212]]  Task Force and set forth the intention of the agencies involved in  implementing the Plan to regularly report to the Task Force as they do  currently. We will continue to regularly report to the Task Force and  its working group on Plan implementation matters and we expect that the  Task Force will continue to provide valuable input regarding  implementation of the Plan.     The South Florida Water Management District and the Jacksonville  District already regularly report to the Task Force and its working  group on CERP matters. We expect that informal coordination among the  implementing agencies, the Task Force and its working group and its  other advisory bodies will continue. For example, the Task Force may  wish to have regular briefings on CERP implementation issues, on the  Master Implementation Sequencing Plan, on Project Implementation  Reports, or on Operating Manuals; or the Task Force may decide to have  RECOVER provide the working group with information on work in progress.  Further, we contemplate that the Task Force will determine, on a case- by-case basis, the manner and extent to which it is appropriate for it  to be involved in CERP in order to carry out its existing statutory  responsibilities.     The final regulations assure that the Task Force will be informed  of certain matters of significance. They specifically state that the  Task Force will be notified of and given an opportunity to review and  provide comment on a variety of issues, including but not limited to,  interim goals, Project Implementation Reports, Pilot Project Design  Reports, Pilot Project Technical Data Reports, the pre-CERP baseline,  assessment reports, guidance memoranda, Master Implementation  Sequencing Plan, Comprehensive Plan Modification Reports, periodic CERP  updates, and reports to Congress. Finally, the regulations require that  the Task Force shall be provided with information on the alternatives  developed and evaluated for the Project Implementation Reports before  completion of the draft Project Implementation reports.  M. Consultation      There was general agreement among those commenting on the proposed  regulations that it is important for the agencies implementing the Plan  to consult with interested parties. The Corps of Engineers and non- Federal sponsors are responsible for implementation of the Plan.  However, successfully implementing the Plan requires more than the  involvement of these parties, it also requires extensive involvement by  Tribes, Federal, State and local agencies.     One commenter recommended that the Tribal consultation provisions  in the proposed regulations be revised to specifically state that the  consultation with Tribes should be conducted on a government-to- government basis. This commenter also felt that the Federal trust  responsibility for Tribes should not be tied to one Executive Order  alone.     Other commenters expressed concerns about the time that would be  allowed for consultations. Several commenters expressed the view that  the time allowed for consultation should reflect the complexity of the  task or issue under review. Another commenter suggested that the  Tribes, agencies, and public be informed of the closing dates for  consultation.     The final regulations contemplate that the implementing agencies  will consult fully and openly with the Department of the Interior, the  Environmental Protection Agency, the Department of Commerce, the  Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Florida, the Seminole Tribe of Florida,  the Florida Department of Environmental Protection, and other Federal,  State, and local agencies as the Plan is implemented. These  consultation provisions ensure that interested parties are  appropriately involved in implementing, evaluating, and modifying the  Plan when necessary. The final regulations specifically state that the  consultation with the Tribes will be conducted on a government-to- government basis and in compliance with applicable laws, Executive  Orders, and regulations.     The final regulations contemplate that the consultations on Plan  related matters will facilitate a timely exchange of views among the  parties. This will ensure that the consultation process is not used as  a tool to delay or veto actions. The final regulations also envision  that the Corps of Engineers and the non-Federal sponsor will set  reasonable limits on the time for consultations and inform parties of  those limits, after giving appropriate consideration to the  significance of the proposed action, the degree to which relevant  information is known or obtainable, the degree to which the action is  controversial, the state of the art of analytical techniques, the  number of persons affected, the consequences of delay, and other time  limits imposed on the agency by law, regulations, or Executive Order.  N. Operating Manuals      The provisions in the proposed regulations on Operating Manuals  were of interest to a number of commenters. These manuals provide  operational guidance that is intended to ensure that the goals and  purposes of the Plan are achieved. Project operating manuals provide  guidance on operational concerns relevant to individual projects.  System Operating Manuals provide guidance on operational concerns  related to projects in the aggregate to ensure that projects function  in a coordinated, systematic way. Several commenters expressed concerns  that the proposed regulations would allow unconstrained deviations from  the approved Operating Manuals because of provisions in the regulations  that allowed for adjustments during years when substantial deviations  from expected rainfall and runoff occur, or when required for adaptive  management reasons. These commenters also were concerned that the  precise circumstances in which these temporary deviations would be  allowed were not specified. Another commenter expressed the view that  the final regulations should include a provision that would ensure any  changes to Operating Manuals are consistent with the goals and purposes  of the Plan. Finally, one commenter felt that the final regulations  should include a provision stating that the drought contingency plans  that are mentioned in the regulations discussing Operating Manuals  should be consistent with the Seminole Tribe's water rights compact.     The final regulations retain the concept of developing Project  Operating Manuals and System Operating Manuals. They contain new  provisions that allow for public review and comment before they are  finalized. The regulations also specify that the System Operating  Manual will be developed by December 31, 2005. They contemplate that a  Project Operating Manual will be developed for each project and that a  draft Project Operating Manual will be included as an appendix in the  Project Implementation Report. This will ensure that the operation of  the project is linked to the expected benefits of the project  recommended in the Project Implementation Report. The final regulations  state that the final Project Operating Manual will be prepared as soon  as possible after completion of the operational testing and monitoring  phase of the project. Additionally, a provision has been added to the  regulations that will require modifications to operating manuals to be  consistent with the goals and purposes of the Plan. We have deleted the  proposed provision of concern regarding yearly adjustments and have  [[Page 64213]]  described the circumstances for allowing temporary deviations due to  emergencies and unplanned minor deviations. The final regulations also  require that the drought contingency plans be consistent with the  Seminole water rights compact.  O. Master Implementation Sequencing Plan      Several parties commented on the provisions in the proposed  regulations concerning the Master Implementation Sequencing Plan. This  Master Implementation Sequencing Plan, identified as the framework for  restoration of the South Florida ecosystem, covers 68 components that  will be implemented as approximately 45 separate projects. The proposed  regulations establish a process for developing a Master Implementation  Sequencing Plan and a process for specifying that projects will be  sequenced and scheduled to maximize the achievement of the goals and  purposes of the Plan, including the achievement of the interim goals  and interim targets at the earliest possible time, to the extent  practical given scientific, technical, funding, contracting, and other  constraints. One commenter felt that the Master Implementation  Sequencing Plan should reflect the formulation and evaluation  provisions and the results of Plan efforts currently underway. Another  commenter believed that the Master Implementation Sequencing Plan  should take into account the savings clause of WRDA 2000.     The final regulations contemplate that the Master Implementation  Sequencing Plan will be developed within one year of the effective date  of the programmatic regulations, following consultation with the  Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Florida, the Seminole Tribe of Indians,  the U. S. Department of the Interior, the U.S. Department of Commerce,  U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the Florida Department of  Environmental Protection, and other Federal, State and local agencies,  as well as in consultation with the South Florida Ecosystem Restoration  Task Force. They provide for sequencing and scheduling projects to  ensure that each project delivers benefits, including benefits to the  natural system, that justify the project, in the context of the then  existing Central and Southern Florida Project, as modified by any Plan  components that already have been implemented. The final regulations  envision that the Master Implementation Sequencing Plan will base the  sequence and schedule of projects on the best scientific, technical,  funding, contracting, and other information available. They also state  that the Master Implementation Sequencing Plan will be revised as  necessary to integrate new information such as updated schedules from  Project Management Plans, the results of pilot projects and other  studies, updated funding information, revisions to the Plan,  Congressional or other authorization and direction, or information from  the adaptive management program, including achievement of the expected  performance level of the Plan and the interim goals and targets.  P. Adaptive Management Program      Several commenters thought that it was important to modify the  proposed regulation's provisions concerning adaptive management in  order to reinforce the importance of this management concept in  implementing the Plan. Adaptive management is a crucial element of the  Everglades Restoration Plan. It involves refining the Plan during its  implementation to respond to new information or technologies to ensure  that the goals and purposes of the Plan are fulfilled. The report of  the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works on WRDA 2000  (Senate Report No. 106-362) contains a discussion of that committee's  expectations with respect to adaptive management:      The committee does not expect rigid adherence to the Plan as it  was submitted to Congress. This result would be inconsistent with  the adaptive management principles in the Plan. Restoration of the  Everglades is the goal, not adherence to the modeling on which the  April 1999 Plan was based. Instead, the committee expects that the  agencies responsible for project implementation report formulation  and Plan implementation will seek continuous improvement of the Plan  based upon new information, improved modeling, new technology and  changed circumstances.      One commenter suggested that the definition of adaptive management  be revised to clarify its meaning. Another commenter pointed out that  the Corps of Engineers and the South Florida Water Management District  currently are in the process of updating the Plan to ensure that it is  based on the latest available information and modeling. This commenter  recommended that a direction to complete this update be included in the  final regulations since the Plan is based on information and  projections that are approximately five years old.     The final regulations contain a new definition of adaptive  management. The regulations define adaptive management to mean:      The continuous process of seeking a better understanding of the  natural system and human environment in the South Florida ecosystem,  and seeking continuous refinements in and improvements to the Plan  to respond to new information resulting from changed or unforeseen  circumstances, new scientific and technical information, new or  updated modeling; information developed through the assessment  principles contained in the Plan; and future authorized changes to  the Plan in order to ensure that the goals and purposes of the Plan  are fulfilled.      The final regulations also provide for the establishment of an  adaptive management program that will guide the implementation of the  Plan. This program will be used to assess the responses of the South  Florida ecosystem to the Plan and to determine whether these responses  match expectations, including anticipated performance levels. If the  interim goals or targets are not achieved as anticipated, the Corps of  Engineers and the South Florida Water Management District must  determine why not, followed by either adaptive management actions to  achieve the goals or targets as soon as practicable, or revisions to  the goals or targets as appropriate.     The final regulations envision that the Corps of Engineers and the  South Florida Water Management District, based on technical information  developed by RECOVER, will prepare periodic assessment reports as part  of this adaptive management program. These reports will be externally  peer reviewed and used by the implementing agencies in consultation  with others to evaluate whether the goals and purposes of the Plan are  being achieved and to determine whether improvements to the Plan are  warranted. The reports should prove invaluable in gaining an  understanding of the Plan's effectiveness and in ensuring that its  goals and purposes are fulfilled. The regulations also provide that in  considering how the Plan may be improved, the Corps of Engineers and  non-Federal project sponsor specifically shall consider modifying the  design or operational plan for a project of the Plan not yet  implemented; modifying the sequence or schedule for implementation of  the Plan; adding new components to the Plan or deleting components not  yet implemented; removing or modifying a component of the Plan already  in place; or a combination of any of these actions.     The final regulations also specify that periodic CERP updates shall  be performed, beginning within six months of the effective date of the  programmatic regulations and whenever necessary to ensure that the  goals and purposes of  [[Page 64214]]  the Plan are achieved, but not any less often than every five years.  The periodic CERP updates will be accomplished by the Corps of  Engineers and the South Florida Water Management District, in  consultation with Tribes, Federal, State, and local agencies, to  conduct an evaluation of the Plan using new or updated modeling that  includes the latest scientific, technical, and planning information.  The periodic CERP updates will provide a basis for determining if  management actions are necessary to seek improvements in the Plan based  upon new information resulting from changed or unforeseen  circumstances, new scientific and technical information, new or updated  modeling; information developed through the assessment principles  contained in the Plan; and future authorized changes to the Plan. The  final regulations direct that as part of the periodic CERP update, the  Corps of Engineers and the South Florida Water Management District will  determine the total quantity of water that is expected to be generated  by implementation of the Plan, including the quantity needed for the  natural system and human environment.     The consultation provisions of the proposed regulations have been  expanded to provide that the Corps of Engineers and the South Florida  Water Management District also shall consult with the South Florida  Restoration Task Force in conducting the evaluation of the Plan. The  final regulations no longer provide for review of the assessment report  by the independent science review panel. The independent science review  panel will prepare its own report to Congress with its independent  assessment of ecological indicators. It was deemed appropriate to keep  these reports separate in order to provide for a truly comprehensive  review of Plan performance and to ensure the independence of the  science review panel by insulating it from any other aspect of Plan  implementation or assessment beyond its statutory mission.  Q. Comprehensive Plan Modification Reports      We anticipate that the Plan will need to be revised periodically as  part of the adaptive management program to reflect new information and  to improve performance. The final regulations provide that a  Comprehensive Plan Modification Report shall be prepared whenever  significant revisions to the Plan are necessary to ensure that the  goals and purposes of the Plan are achieved. The Comprehensive Plan  Modification Report will be prepared using a process that parallels the  process for developing a Project Implementation Report. The final  regulations provide that the final approved Comprehensive Plan  Modification Report shall be transmitted to Congress. The final  regulations also provide that the Comprehensive Plan Modification  Report will include updated water budget information for the Plan,  including the total quantity of water that is expected to be generated  by implementation of the Plan, the quantity needed for the natural  system in order to attain restoration goals, and the quantity generated  for use in the human environment. In general, Plan modifications should  be consistent with achieving the interim goals and targets. In some  cases, the process of developing a Comprehensive Plan Modification  Report (which includes consultation with Federal, State, and local  agencies and public notice and comment) could identify necessary  changes to the interim goals or targets. In this case, the goals or  targets would be revised accordingly, as provided for in the final  regulations.     We did not receive any comments on the proposed regulations  provisions concerning Comprehensive Plan Modification Reports. We did  make several changes in the proposed regulations to conform to the  general comments made on other sections and to provide more detailed  information related to these reports. For example, the final  regulations state that the Comprehensive Plan Modification Report will  be initiated at the discretion of the Corps of Engineers and South  Florida Water Management District, in consultation with Federal, State,  and local agencies and the Tribes. The regulations also set forth a  series of general requirements related to the preparation of these  reports.  R. Pre-CERP Baseline      The provisions in the proposed regulations concerning the pre-CERP  baseline were of interest to a number of parties. Developing the pre- CERP baseline is an important step in ensuring that the goals and  purposes of the Plan are fulfilled in accordance with WRDA 2000. This  baseline is a tool for estimating hydrological conditions in the South  Florida ecosystem on the date of enactment of WRDA 2000. It will be  used to aid in the determination if existing legal sources of water  will be eliminated or transferred as a result of project implementation  and for determining the water made available by the Plan.     A number of commenters expressed concerns about the concurrence  provisions for the pre-CERP baseline. These commenters pointed out that  WRDA 2000 only granted concurrence rights to the Secretary of the  Interior and the Governor on the programmatic regulations. They believe  that extending this concurrence process to the pre-CERP baseline was  unnecessary and would cause delays in developing the baseline. Two  commenters believed that the pre-CERP baseline should include all  existing legal sources of water and also should include the levels of  service for flood protection. One commenter observed that the  requirement in the proposed rule that the pre-CERP baseline was to be  consistent with the guidance memorandum for identifying the appropriate  quantity, timing, and distribution of water to be dedicated and managed  for the natural system might not be developed before the pre-CERP  baseline is determined.     The final regulations provide guidance on developing the pre-CERP  baseline. They envision that the pre-CERP baseline will include  information on the quantity, timing, distribution, and quality of water  in the South Florida ecosystem on the date of enactment of WRDA 2000.  The regulations state that the pre-CERP baseline will be supported by  appropriate documentation and will include a description of the  assumptions on which it is based. Additional work performed by the  Corps and the South Florida Water Management District with regard to  the pre-CERP baseline indicates that the pre-CERP baseline does not  need to be tied to the methodology for identification of water to be  reserved for the natural system as these are two separate analyses. The  final regulations require that the recommended project be compared to  the pre-CERP baseline and other appropriate information to determine if  an elimination or transfer of legal sources of water will be caused by  implementation of the project. Therefore, the final regulations do not  contain the provision from the proposed regulations that require the  Corps of Engineers and South Florida Water Management District, when  determining the pre-CERP baseline, to use a method consistent with the  guidance memorandum that contains instructions for identifying the  appropriate quantity, timing, and distribution of water dedicated and  managed for the natural system.     The final regulations provide that within six months of the  effective date of the programmatic regulations, the Corps of Engineers  and the South Florida Water Management District shall, in consultation  with Tribes, Federal, State, and local agencies develop the pre-CERP  baseline and  [[Page 64215]]  present it to the Secretary of the Army for consideration, memorialized  in an appropriate document. The regulations state that the pre-CERP  baseline shall be developed with the concurrence of the Secretary of  the Interior and the Governor. The language gives the Secretary of the  Interior and the Governor the same concurrence opportunity they had on  the programmatic regulations. While this concurrence process is not  required by law and will require additional time to fulfill, we believe  it is appropriate to provide for this process because of the  significance of the pre-CERP baseline.     Additionally, the final regulations specify that pre-CERP baseline  water availability is one of the factors that will be assessed in each  Project Implementation Report when determining the water that needs to  be reserved for the natural system. In order to ensure that the levels  of service for flood protection are not reduced, we have added a  provision that requires each Project Implementation Report to include  an analysis that considers the operational conditions included in the  pre-CERP baseline.  S. Shortfall in Performance by a Project      Several commenters noted that the proposed regulations did not  provide guidance on what actions should be taken when the amount of  water generated by a project is less than the amount estimated when the  Project Implementation Report was prepared. These commenters believe  that such a shortfall in performance should be shared in an equitable  manner among project purposes. One commenter proposed that, if a  component does not produce the water expected, the shortfall should be  shared equally. Another commenter proposed that if the actual  operations of a component do not produce the amount of water expected  for the natural system and other water-related needs of the region,  ``the shortfall be shared between all anticipated uses on a pro rata  basis of what the project was expected to produce for each use.'' Other  commenters want to ensure that the needs of the natural system and the  savings clause requirements are provided first, before additional water  for agricultural and urban needs is provided.     The proposed regulations did not address the shortfall question.  Since the framework Plan includes 68 components that have different  functions, we do not consider one general rule concerning shortfalls in  performance to be appropriate. One unvarying rule for all projects  might also create problems under the savings clause. The final  regulations provide that the Project Implementation Report (PIR) will  include a plan for interim operations of the project in the event that  the project fails to provide the quantity, timing, or distribution of  water described in the PIR. The plan will take into account the  specific purposes of the specific project component addressed in the  PIR and the overall goals and purposes of the Plan. Under the final  regulations, management actions must be taken as part of the adaptive  management program to make permanent adjustments for shortfalls in  performance on a system-wide basis.  T. Elimination or Transfer of Existing Legal Sources of Water      Several commenters noted that the proposed regulations did not  contain a definition of the term ``existing legal sources of water.''  Section 601(h)(5)(A) of WRDA 2000 contains a savings clause provision  that is designed to ensure that an existing legal source of water is  not eliminated or transferred until a replacement source of water of  comparable quantity and quality as was available on the date of  enactment of WRDA 2000 is available. The statute states that ``the  Secretary and the non-Federal sponsor shall not eliminate or transfer  existing legal sources of water, including those for--(i) agricultural  or urban water supply; (ii) allocation or entitlement to the Seminole  Indian Tribe of Florida * * * (iii) the Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of  Florida; (iv) water supply for Everglades National Park; (v) water  supply for fish and wildlife.''     The report of the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works  on WRDA 2000 (Senate Report No. 106-362) describes the intent of the  prohibition against the elimination or transfer of legal sources of  water as follows:      Elimination of existing sources of water supply is barred until  new sources of comparable quantity and quality of water are  available; existing authorized levels of flood protection are  maintained; and the water compact among the Seminole Tribe of  Florida, the State, and the South Florida Water Management District  is specifically preserved.      Although WRDA 2000 uses the term ``existing legal sources of  water,'' it does not define the term; nor could we find a definition of  this term elsewhere in Federal or State law. Several commenters  believed that the term should include all sources of water. According  to this view, a legal source of water that was available on the date of  enactment of WRDA 2000 would include water that was accessible and  could have been used on that date, as well as water that actually was  used or permitted to be used on that date. These commenters pointed out  that the statute refers to existing legal ``sources'' not existing  legal ``uses.'' Other commenters believed that existing legal sources  of water should be limited to water permitted for consumptive use.  Still others believed that the term was further limited to consumptive  uses that not only were permitted, but also were actually used, on the  date of enactment. One commenter suggested that a guidance memorandum  be developed that defines an existing legal source of water and  provides guidance for determining if the implementation of a project  will cause an elimination or transfer of an existing legal source of  water.     The final regulations provide for the development of a guidance  memorandum that will define ``existing legal sources of water.'' This  guidance memorandum also will describe the process for determining if  existing legal sources of water are to be eliminated or transferred and  for determining if a new source of water of comparable quantity and  quality as that available on the date of enactment of WRDA 2000 is  available to replace the water to be lost as a result of implementation  of the Plan.     The final regulations also state that the Project Implementation  Report will include an analysis to determine if the project will cause  an elimination or transfer of existing legal sources of water. The  final regulations also state that the recommended project will be  compared to the pre-CERP baseline and other appropriate information to  determine if an elimination or transfer of legal sources of water will  be caused by implementation of the project. If the project will cause  an elimination or transfer of a source of water, then the Project  Implementation report will include measures to ensure that such  elimination or transfer will not take place until a new source of water  of comparable quantity or quality is available to replace the water  that would be lost as a result of implementation of the Plan.     In accordance with WRDA 2000, the regulations make clear that the  Secretary of the Army and the non-Federal sponsor will not eliminate  existing legal sources of water, including those for agricultural or  urban water supply, an allocation or entitlement of the Seminole Tribe  of Florida, the Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Florida, water supply  for Everglades National Park, and water supply for fish and wildlife.  Some commenters wanted the  [[Page 64216]]  regulation to include a definition for urban water supply. We have not  included a definition of urban water supply because we believe that  such a definition should be more appropriately developed with the  definition of existing legal sources of water that will be defined in  the required guidance memorandum.  U. Flood Protection      The WRDA 2000 provisions concerning the maintenance of flood  protection were of interest to several commenters. Section 601(h)(5)(B)  of WRDA 2000 contains a savings clause provision that is designed to  ensure that levels of service for flood protection are not reduced by  implementation of a project. This provision specifically states  ``implementation of the Plan shall not reduce levels of service for  flood protection that are `` (i) in existence on the date of enactment  of this Act; and (ii) in accordance with applicable law.''     The report of the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works  on WRDA 2000 (Senate Report No. 106-362) describes the intent of the  flood protection savings clause as follows:      With respect to flood control, the committee intends that  implementation of the Plan will not result in significant adverse  impact to any person with an existing, legally recognized right to a  level of protection against flooding. The committee does not intend  that, consistent with benefits included in the Plan, this bill  create any new rights to a level of protection against flooding that  is not currently recognized under applicable Federal or State law.      Several commenters felt that the final regulations should contain  additional guidance on how to interpret the provisions providing for  the maintenance of flood protection. One commenter believed that the  savings clause provisions for flood protection also should be extended  to the natural system and should be interpreted to prevent the transfer  of excessive water to the natural system. This commenter also felt that  the final regulations should define the term ``in accordance with  applicable law.'' Some commenters questioned how the Plan would address  opportunities for increased levels of flood protection or the provision  of flood protection in locations where there currently is no flood  protection. These commenters felt that the regulation should specify  that during the implementation of the Plan, the Project Delivery Teams  will consider opportunities for providing additional flood protection.     We have concluded that the existing levels of service for flood  protection for a particular area should be determined on a project-by- project basis. Accordingly, the final regulations specify that Project  Implementation Reports will include an appropriate analysis and  consider the operational conditions included in the pre-CERP baseline  to demonstrate that the levels of service for flood protection that  were in existence on the date of enactment of WRDA 2000 and is in  accordance with applicable law will not be reduced by the project. The  Project Implementation Report process provides numerous opportunities  for the Project Delivery Team, the public, and the South Florida  Ecosystem Restoration Task Force, to examine the levels of service of  flood protection provided by previous projects and any law applicable  to the specific area affected by the Project Implementation Report.  Finally, the regulations acknowledge that the overarching objective of  the Plan is the restoration, preservation, and protection of the South  Florida ecosystem while providing for other water-related needs of the  region, including water supply and flood protection. Accordingly, the  final regulations provide for the evaluation of additional flood  protection, provided that such flood protection is consistent with the  other goals and purposes of the Plan.  V. NEPA Compliance      The Council on Environmental Quality regulations that implement the  National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) (40 CFR 1505.1 and 1507.3),  specify that agencies must issue regulations identifying typical  classes of actions that normally require environmental impact  statements, that normally do not require either an environmental impact  statement or an environmental assessment (categorical exclusions), or  that normally require environmental assessments but not necessarily  environmental impact statements. The Corps of Engineers has adopted  procedures fulfilling this requirement in 33 CFR 230. The final  regulations consider the actions needed to implement the Plan on a  system-wide basis and apply the principles of 33 CFR 230 to those  actions to ensure that the provisions of NEPA are fulfilled. The  regulations identify certain actions that generally require preparation  of a NEPA document (either an Environmental Impact Statement or an  environmental assessment) or that do not require the preparation of a  NEPA document because they are subject to a categorical exclusion under  NEPA.     The final regulations envision that ordinarily the NEPA  documentation for a particular project will accompany the Project  Implementation Report. For this reason, other project-specific  documents such as the Project Cooperation Agreement, Project Management  Plan, and plans and specifications for the project are listed as  categorically excluded from NEPA documentation requirements. It is  important to note that identifying a document as being categorically  excluded from NEPA does not mean that the environmental effects of the  action covered by that document will not be analyzed as required under  NEPA. The Corps of Engineers will fully analyze and consider these  effects at an appropriate time as required by NEPA. This analysis will  be accomplished at the time the Corps of Engineers develops its  specific project proposal in the Project Implementation Report. This  process accords with NEPA's provisions on timing (40 CFR 1502.5 and  1508.23) and its admonishment to avoid duplication (Sec.  1500.4) and  improper segmentation of Federal actions (Sec.  1502.4).     Some commenters expressed the view that the guidance memorandum for  determining the quantity, timing and distribution of water dedicated  and managed for the natural system in a Project Implementation Report  (PIR) should be analyzed in an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS).  Since the guidance memorandum is procedural and does not affect the  environment, recommend legislation, or determine a specific quantity,  timing, or distribution of water for a specific component, it is not  considered a ``major Federal action'' under NEPA. As noted, the  specific project proposal, which is governed by the guidance  memorandum, will be subject to a full NEPA analysis in the Project  Implementation Report.     Similar comments were directed at the interim goals. Some  commenters felt that the interim goals were not ``major Federal  actions'' affecting the environment under NEPA. These commenters  regarded the interim goals as evaluation and reporting tools. Other  commenters maintained that the interim goals are planning goals and  that as such should be subject to a full NEPA analysis. We have  determined that the interim goals and interim targets do not require  separate NEPA analysis. Interim goals are means by which the  restoration success of the Plan may be evaluated; interim targets are  means by which progress towards other water-related needs of the region  may be evaluated. The Plan itself has undergone NEPA analysis. Future  decisions about the environment that involve interim goals and interim  targets will be analyzed in other NEPA documents. Projects implementing  the Plan will be analyzed under NEPA in Project  [[Page 64217]]  Implementation Reports. This will include an analysis of how the  project contributes to the goals and purposes of the Plan, including  the interim goals and interim targets. The effect of sequencing on the  achievement of interim goals and interim targets will be analyzed under  NEPA through the Master Implementation Sequencing Plan. The effect of  changes to CERP on the achievement of interim goals and interim targets  will also be analyzed under NEPA through the Comprehensive Plan  Modification Report. For this reason, we have listed interim goals and  interim targets as categorically excluded from NEPA. This is consistent  with the NEPA implementing regulations, which specify the NEPA analyses  should be structured to avoid duplication and improper segmentation of  Federal actions.     Some commenters felt that Project Cooperation Agreements, Project  Management Plans and Program Management Plans should not be  categorically excluded from NEPA. The Project Cooperation Agreement is  a written agreement between the non-Federal sponsor and the Federal  government setting forth the Federal and non-Federal responsibilities  for implementing the project. The Project Cooperation Agreement does  not select among project alternatives, it merely sets forth the  parties' contractual understandings with regard to a project proposal  that previously has been selected in the Project Implementation Report.  For this reason, we continue to believe that it is appropriate to  extend a categorical exclusion to Project Cooperation Agreements;  however, the Corps of Engineers will not conclude a Project Cooperation  Agreement for a project before the environmental consequences of that  project have been considered fully in an appropriate NEPA document  accompanying a Project Implementation Report. Project Management Plans  and Program Management Plans are administrative documents setting  schedules and assigning tasks between the local sponsor and the Federal  government. Accordingly, those items continue to be listed as  categorically excluded in the final rule.  W. Outreach      Several commenters suggested that the outreach provisions in the  proposed regulations be revised. A number of commenters requested  inclusion of their community-based group as a specific entity with  which to consult. Several commenters believed that the proposal did not  make clear the need for effective outreach throughout the  implementation process, not just during the planning phase. In  addition, several commenters believed that specific measurement tools  were needed to monitor the effectiveness of the outreach effort and the  minority contracting provisions. One commenter suggested that the  regulations ensure that information is provided to socially and  economically disadvantaged individuals and communities about potential  or anticipated contracting opportunities. One commenter suggested that  the regulations specify that meetings with the public should be  scheduled at times and locations that are convenient to the public.     In the final regulations, we have broadened the definition of  public to include community-based organizations. The regulations  clarify that the public outreach provisions apply throughout the entire  process of implementing the plan. The regulations also add a provision  that public meetings and workshops will be held at times and locations  that facilitate participation by the public. The final regulations also  contain a provision to provide additional information to socially and  economically disadvantaged individuals and communities about potential  contracting opportunities, noting that the means chosen must be  consistent with the outreach provisions of CERP and with other  applicable provisions of Federal law. The intent of this provision is  to share information with the public in a way that is allowable and  consistent with the Federal Acquisition Regulations, the Competition in  Contracting Act, and other applicable provisions of law and  regulations.  X. Formulation and Evaluation of Alternatives      The final regulations explain that the Project Implementation  Report is a document that provides information on plan formulation and  evaluation, engineering and design, estimated benefits and costs,  environmental effects, and the additional information that is necessary  for the Secretary of the Army to approve the project for  implementation, or for Congress to authorize the project for  implementation. Several commenters felt that changes should be made to  the provisions in the proposed regulations concerning the formulation  and evaluation of alternatives for Project Implementation Reports. Some  commenters believe that alternatives should be formulated, evaluated,  and justified on their ability to provide system-wide benefits. One  commenter felt that the language in the proposed regulations, which  requires system formulation and evaluation to compare ``total benefits  and costs of the alternative under both the with-CERP and without-CERP  condition,'' is vague. The same commenter stated that the proposed  regulation's inclusion of the evaluation of a selected alternative as  the last-added increment of the Plan was superfluous, because the  proposed regulations already require proposed alternatives to be  evaluated on the basis they contribute to the achievement of the goals  and purposes of the Plan. One commenter believed that constraining plan  formulation within the funding target for the project established by  the April 1999 ``Final Integrated Feasibility Report and Programmatic  Environmental Impact Statement'' was not appropriate and would inhibit  full consideration of alternatives. Another commenter believed that the  proposed regulations envisioned an overly narrow definition of cost  effectiveness. Some comments cautioned that the formulation and  evaluation of alternatives should not mimic traditional Corps of  Engineers planning principles because in their view, traditional Corps  of Engineers planning has focused on the quantification of benefits at  customary civil works projects, rather than achieving the unique goal  of restoring an entire ecosystem. There was general agreement that the  formulation and evaluation of alternatives should not elevate the goal  of fulfilling the other water-related needs of the region over the goal  of fulfilling the ecological needs of the South Florida ecosystem  simply because the benefits of fulfilling the other water-related needs  are readily quantifiable and the benefits of fulfilling the ecological  needs are not. This is consistent with section 601(h) of WRDA 2000  which states that the overarching objective of the Plan is the  restoration, preservation, and protection of the South Florida  ecosystem while providing for other water-related needs of the region,  including water supply and flood protection; and with section  601(f)(2), which states that the Secretary of the Army may determine  that an activity under CERP is justified by the environmental benefits  to be derived by the South Florida ecosystem, with no further economic  justification required, provided the activity is cost-effective.     The final regulations remove the provision that constrains plan  formulation to stay within the funding target for the project  established in the April 1999 ``Final Integrated Feasibility Report and  Programmatic  [[Page 64218]]  Environmental Impact Statement.'' Instead, the final regulations  require that the Project Implementation Report include a discussion of  any significant changes in cost or scope of the project from that  presented in the April 1999 Report. They also require that in preparing  Project Implementation Reports, the Corps of Engineers and the non- Federal sponsor will formulate and evaluate alternative plans in order  to optimize the project's contributions toward achieving the goals and  purposes of the Plan on a system-wide basis in the most cost-effective  manner, while also ensuring that the selected option provides benefits  that justify costs on a next-added increment basis. The final  regulations call for the development of a guidance memorandum that will  describe the processes to be used to formulate and evaluate alternative  plans and their associated monetary and non-monetary benefits and costs  and the basis for justifying and selecting an alternative to be  recommended for implementation. To aid the formulation and evaluation  process, the final regulations also include definitions for the terms  ``alternative plan,'' ``justified,'' and ``optimize.'' The definition  of ``justified'' makes clear, consistent with section 601(f)(2) of WRDA  2000 that restoration benefits need not be quantified or monetized to  justify costs, provided that the activity is justified by the  environmental benefits derived by the South Florida ecosystem and is  cost-effective. The regulations make clear that the project described  in the April 1999 ``Final Integrated Feasibility Report and  Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement,'' will be one of the  alternative plans that will be evaluated. They also specify that the  selected alternative plan will be the plan that maximizes net benefits  while still being justified as the next-added increment. Under the  final regulations, alternative plans that are not justified on a next- added increment basis will not be selected. Finally, we have revised  figure 2 in Appendix A to better describe the formulation and  evaluation activities conducted during the development of the Project  Implementation Report.     In publishing these final regulations, we emphasize that the  discussion in the regulations on plan formulation and evaluation should  not be construed to elevate water supply and flood control benefits,  which historically have been easier to quantify and place a monetary  value on, over environmental restoration benefits, which are more  difficult to quantify.  Y. References to Senate Committee Report Language      One commenter was concerned about references to the Senate  Environment and Public Works Committee Report (Senate Report No. 106- 362) in the preamble of the proposed regulations. This commenter  expressed the view that Senate Committee Report 106-362 carries no  legislative weight since the bill discussed in Senate Committee Report  106-362 differs in several critical areas from the final version of the  bill adopted by the full United States Senate. We agree that the final  statute differed in several areas from the bill discussed in the report  and must be read with this limitation in mind. We have referred to the  Senate Report in the preamble to the final regulations only where it  provides relevant and reliable information to aid the understanding of  issues involved in implementing the Plan.  V. Project Implementation Reports Approved Pursuant to Transition Rule      Section 601(h)(3)(D) of WRDA 2000 establishes a transition rule for  Project Implementation Reports approved before the date of promulgation  of the programmatic regulations. This transition rule requires that the  Project Implementation Reports be consistent with the Plan. The  transition rule also requires that the preamble of the programmatic  regulations contain a statement concerning the consistency with the  programmatic regulations of Project Implementation Reports that were  approved prior to the date of issuance of the final regulations.  Accordingly, this preamble specifically states that no Project  Implementation Reports have been approved before the date of issuance  of the final programmatic regulations.  VI. Concurrence Process for This Regulation      The Secretary of the Interior and the Governor are required by  section 601(h)(3)(B) of WRDA 2000 to provide the Secretary of the Army  with a written statement of concurrence or non-concurrence on the final  programmatic regulations. The Secretary of Interior and the Governor  shall provide concurrence or non-concurrence within 180 days of being  provided with a copy of the final regulations.     The Department of the Army has sought to communicate openly and  fully with the Department of the Interior and the State of Florida  during the course of developing these regulations. We believe that this  communication has improved the content of the regulations and led to a  full understanding of the views of these parties. The concurrency  statements of the Department of the Interior and the State of Florida  are included as an appendix to this document.  VII. Organization of the Final Regulations      We have organized the final regulations in five subparts. The first  subpart, ``General Provisions,'' sets forth the purpose of the  regulations, the applicability of the regulations, definitions  pertaining to the regulations and other general information. The second  subpart, ``Program Goals and Responsibilities,'' describes the goals  and purposes of the Plan, implementation principles, implementation  responsibilities, and consultation and coordination expectations. The  remaining subparts were designed to be consistent with the content  required by section 601(h)(3)(C). These subparts are: ``Comprehensive  Everglades Restoration Plan Implementation Processes,'' ``Incorporating  New Information into the Plan,'' and ``Ensuring Protection of the  Natural System and Water Availability Consistent with the Goals and  Purposes of the Plan.''  VIII. Administrative Requirements  A. Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.)      The final regulations do not impose any information collection  requirements for which Office of Management and Budget (OMB) approval  under the Paperwork Reduction Act is required. Thus, this action is not  subject to the Paperwork Reduction Act.  B. Executive Order 12866, as Amended      Under Executive Order 12866 ( 58 FR 51735 , October 4, 1993), as  amended, we must determine whether the regulatory action is  ``significant'' and therefore subject to review by the Office of  Management and Budget and the requirements of the Executive Order. The  Executive Order defines ``significant regulatory action'' as one that  is likely to result in a rule that may:     (1) Have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more,  or adversely affect in a material way the economy, a sector of the  economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public  health or safety, or State, local, or Tribal governments or  communities;     (2) Create a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an  action taken or planned by another agency;     (3) Materially alter the budgetary impact of entitlements, grants,  user fees,  [[Page 64219]]  or loan programs or the rights and obligations of recipients thereof;  or     (4) Raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal  mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles set forth in  the Executive Order.     Pursuant to the terms of Executive Order 12866, as amended, it has  been determined that the final regulations are a ``significant  regulatory action'' in light of the provisions of paragraph (4) above.  As such, this action was submitted to OMB for review. Changes made in  response to OMB suggestions or recommendations are documented in the  public record.  C. Executive Order 13132      Executive Order 13132, entitled ``Federalism'' ( 64 FR 43255 , August  10, 1999), requires the development of an accountable process to ensure  ``meaningful and timely input by State and local officials in the  development of regulatory policies that have Federalism implications.''  ``Policies that have Federalism implications'' is defined in the  Executive Order to include regulations that have ``substantial direct  effects on the States, on the relationship between the national  government and the States, or on the distribution of power and  responsibilities among the various levels of government.'' Although the  final regulations define the relationships between the Federal and  State partners, it is limited to implementation of the Comprehensive  Everglades Restoration Plan. It will not have substantial direct  effects on the States, on the relationship between the national  government and the States, or on the distribution of power and  responsibilities among the various levels of government, within the  meaning of Executive Order 13132. Nevertheless, the Corps of Engineers  has consulted closely with the State and local officials in developing  the final regulations.  D. Regulatory Flexibility Act      The Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), as amended (5 U.S.C. 601 et  seq.) generally requires an agency to prepare a regulatory flexibility  analysis of any rule subject to notice-and-comment rulemaking  requirements under the Administrative Procedure Act or any other  statute unless the agency certifies that the rule will not have a  significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.  Small entities include small businesses, small organizations and small  governmental jurisdictions. For purposes of assessing the impacts of  the proposed rule on small entities, a small entity is defined as: (1)  A small business based on SBA size standards; (2) a small governmental  jurisdiction that is a government of a city, county, town, school  district, or special district with a population of less than 50,000;  and (3) a small organization that is any not-for-profit enterprise  which is independently owned and operated and is not dominant in its  field. We certify that this action will not have a significant economic  impact on a substantial number of small entities. The final regulations  only establish processes and governmental relationships that will be  used for implementation of the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration  Plan.  E. Unfunded Mandates Reform Act      We have determined in accordance with the Unfunded Mandates Reform  Act (2 U.S.C. 1501 et seq.):     (a) The final regulations will not ``significantly or uniquely''  affect small governments. A Small Government Agency Plan is not  required. Small governments will only be affected to the extent that  they agree to act as a non-Federal sponsor for implementation of  projects for the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan. The final  regulations do not establish new or different requirements for non- Federal sponsors for implementation of projects for the Comprehensive  Everglades Restoration Plan. The Savings Clause ensures that small  governments, including public water utilities, will not be impacted by  the loss of an existing legal source of water, or existing levels of  service for flood protection that were in effect on the date of  enactment of WRDA 2000, and in accordance with applicable law.     (b) The final regulations will not produce a Federal mandate of  $100 million or greater in any year, and therefore, do not constitute a  ``significant regulatory action'' under the Unfunded Mandates Reform  Act. The final regulations define processes and relationships between  the Federal and State partners in implementing the Comprehensive  Everglades Restoration Plan. The regulations do not affect the cost  sharing requirements for non-Federal sponsors in implementing the Plan  and therefore, impose no new obligations on State or local governments.  F. National Technology Transfer and Advancement Act      Section 12(d) of the National Technology Transfer and Advancement  Act of 1995 (the NTTAA), Public Law 104-113, section 12(d) (15 U.S.C.  272 note), directs us to use voluntary consensus standards in our  regulatory activities unless to do so would be inconsistent with  applicable law or otherwise impractical. Voluntary consensus standards  are technical standards (e.g., materials specifications, test methods,  sampling procedures, and business practices) that are developed or  adopted by voluntary consensus standards bodies. The NTTAA directs us  to provide Congress, through OMB, explanations when we decide not to  use available and applicable voluntary consensus standards. These  regulations do not involve technical standards. Therefore, we did not  consider the use of any voluntary consensus standards.  G. Executive Order 13045      Executive Order 13045, as amended, entitled ``Protection of  Children From Environmental Health Risks and Safety Risks'' (62 FR  19885, April 23, 1997), applies to any rule that: (1) Was initiated  after April 21, 1997, or for which a notice of proposed rulemaking was  published after April 21, 1998; (2) is determined to be ``economically  significant'' as defined under Executive Order 12866, and (3) concerns  an environmental health or safety risk that we have reason to believe  may have a disproportionate effect on children. If the regulatory  action meets all three criteria, we must evaluate the environmental  health or safety effects of the planned rule on children, and explain  why the planned regulation is preferable to other potentially effective  and reasonably feasible alternatives that were considered. The final  regulations are not subject to Executive Order 13045 because it is not  an economically significant regulatory action as defined by Executive  Order 12866. The final regulations establish processes for the  implementation of the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan and  define the relationships between the Federal and State partners for  implementation. Furthermore, the regulations do not concern an  environmental health or safety risk that we have reason to believe may  have a disproportionate effect on children.  H. Executive Order 13175      Under Executive Order 13175, we may not issue a regulation that has  substantial, direct effects on one or more Indian tribes, on the  relationship between the Federal government and Indian tribes, or on  the distribution of powers and responsibilities between the Federal  government and Indian tribes, and imposes substantial direct compliance  costs on those communities, and that is not required by statute, unless  the Federal government provides the funds necessary to pay the direct  [[Page 64220]]  compliance cost incurred by the Tribal governments, or we consult with  those governments. If we comply by consulting, Executive Order 13175  requires us to provide the Office of Management and Budget, in a  separately identified section of the preamble to the rule, a  description of the extent of our prior consultation with  representatives of affected Tribal governments, a summary of the nature  of their concerns, and a statement supporting the need to issue the  regulation. In addition, Executive Order 13175 requires us to develop  an effective process permitting elected officials and other  representatives of Indian Tribal governments ``to provide meaningful  and timely input in the development of regulatory policies on matters  that significantly or uniquely affect their communities.'' The final  regulations are required by section 601(h)(3) of WRDA 2000.  Additionally, the final regulations do not impose significant  compliance costs on any Indian Tribes. The regulations establish  processes for the implementation of the Comprehensive Everglades  Restoration Plan and define the relationships between the implementing  entities. Accordingly, the requirements of section 3(b) of Executive  Order 13175 do not apply to these final regulations. However, the Corps  of Engineers recognizes that two Indian Tribes, the Miccosukee Tribe of  Indians of Florida and the Seminole Tribe of Florida, have a  significant direct interest in the implementation of the CERP and the  framework for its implementation that will be established by these  programmatic regulations. We have thus consulted extensively with these  Tribes in the development of the regulations, and have included  requirements for continued consultation in all significant project  implementation components, including program-wide guidance memoranda,  Project Management Plans, Program Management Plans, Project  Implementation Reports, Project Operating Manuals, the System Operating  Manual, and the Master Implementation Sequencing Plan. These Tribes  also are included in the Leadership Group of RECOVER and participate in  the Project Delivery Teams and the South Florida Ecosystem Restoration  Task Force, which has played and will continue to play a consultative  role on many aspects of CERP implementation. Finally, Sec.  385.10(b)  includes a general requirement for consultation with the Tribes  ``throughout the implementation process.''  I. Executive Order 12630      In accordance with Executive Order 12630 entitled ``Governmental  Actions and Interference with Constitutionally Protected Property  Rights,'' the final regulations will not effect a taking of private  property or otherwise have taking implications. Therefore, a takings  implication assessment is not required. The final regulations establish  processes to be used in implementing the Comprehensive Everglades  Restoration Plan and in and of itself does not address property needs.  J. Civil Justice Reform      In accordance with Executive Order 12988, we have determined that  the final regulations do not unduly burden the judicial system and meet  the requirements of sections 3(a) and 3(b)(2) of the Executive Order.  The final regulations establish processes to be used in implementing  the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan and define the  relationships between the governmental entities that will implement the  Plan.  K. Executive Order 13211      On May 18, 2001, the President issued an Executive Order (E.O.  13211) that applies to regulations that significantly affect energy  supply, distribution, and use. Executive Order 13211 requires agencies  to prepare Statements of Energy Effects when undertaking certain  actions. Because the final regulations are not expected to  significantly affect energy supplies, distribution, or use, this action  is not a significant energy action and no Statement of Energy Effects  is required.  L. Executive Order 13272      On August 13, 2002, the President issued an Executive Order (E.O.  13272) that requires that agencies review draft rules to assess and  take appropriate account of the potential impact on small businesses,  small governmental jurisdictions, and small organizations, as provided  for in the Regulatory Flexibility Act, as amended (5 U.S.C. 601 et  seq.) We have determined that this action will not have a significant  economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. The final  regulations only establish processes and governmental relationships  that will be used for implementation of the Comprehensive Everglades  Restoration Plan.  M. Environmental Documentation      As required by the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), the  Department of the Army prepares appropriate environmental documentation  for its activities affecting the quality of the human environment. We  have determined that the final regulations do not constitute a major  Federal action significantly affecting the quality of the human  environment. Therefore, environmental documentation under the National  Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) is not required for the final  regulations. One commenter expressed the view that an Environmental  Impact Statement was necessary for the regulations. The Corps of  Engineers has prepared appropriate environmental documentation,  including a Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement, for the  Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan. Today's final regulations do  not implement any of the features of the Plan. Rather, the final  regulations identify the processes to be followed in implementing  features of the Plan. Moreover, the final regulations establish  requirements for the preparation of appropriate environmental  documentation as part of the implementation process. Accordingly, we  continue to believe that an EIS is not warranted.

Subpart A--General Provisions  Sec.  385.1  Purpose of the programmatic regulations.      (a) The programmatic regulations of this part implement the  provisions of section 601(h)(3) of the Water Resources Development Act  of 2000, Public Law 106-541, 114 Stat. 2688 (hereinafter ``WRDA  2000''), which was enacted on December 11, 2000.     (b) The purpose of the programmatic regulations of this part is to  ensure that the goals and purposes of the Comprehensive Everglades  Restoration Plan (the Plan) are achieved and to establish the processes  necessary for implementing the Plan. Some of these processes are  project specific, including, but not limited to, development of Project  Implementation Reports, Project Cooperation Agreements, plans and  specifications, Pilot Project Technical Data Reports, and Operating  Manuals. Other processes are of more general applicability, including,  but not limited to, development of program-wide guidance memoranda,  interim goals, interim targets, and the Master Implementation  Sequencing Plan. Taken together, these processes will ensure that the  restoration purposes and other goals of the Plan are achieved. The  regulations of this part also describe the relationship among the  various entities responsible for implementation of the Plan.     (c) Section 601(h) of WRDA 2000 establishes an integrated framework  for assuring that the goals and purposes of the Plan are achieved. This  framework includes tools for planning, implementation, and evaluation;  a process for developing these tools in an open public process, with  input from other Federal, State, and local agencies; and an enforcement  mechanism to ensure that the requirements of the statute are carried  out.     (1) Tools.     (i) The specific planning tool established by section 601(h) is the  Project Implementation Report.     (ii) The specific implementation tools established by section  601(h) are Project Cooperation Agreements and Operating Manuals.     (iii) The specific evaluation tool established by section 601(h) is  the interim goals for evaluating the restoration success of the Plan.     (iv) In addition to the specific planning, implementation, and  evaluation tools established by section 601(h), the regulations of this  part establish additional tools, including but not limited to, Project  Management Plans, Program Management Plans, Comprehensive Plan  Modification Reports, the Master Implementation Sequencing Plan, and  interim targets for evaluating progress towards achieving the other  water related needs of the region.     (2) Processes. The regulations of this part establish the processes  for developing these tools. Consistent with section 601(h), these  regulations have been developed, after notice and opportunity for  public content, with the concurrence of the Secretary of the Interior  and the Governor, and in consultation with the Seminole Tribe of  Florida, the Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Florida, the Administrator  of the Environmental Protection Agency, the Secretary of Commerce, the  Florida Department of Environmental Protection, and other Federal,  State, and local agencies.     (3) Enforcement mechanism. The specific enforcement mechanism  established by Section 601(h) is the ``Comprehensive Everglades  Restoration Plan Assurance of Project Benefits Agreement,'' dated  January 9, 2002, between the President and the Governor, under which  the State shall ensure, by regulation or other appropriate means, that  water made available by each project in the Plan shall not be permitted  for a consumptive use or otherwise made unavailable by the State until  such time as sufficient reservations of water for the restoration of  the natural system are made under State law in accordance with the  project implementation report and consistent with the Plan.     (4) Public information. The Secretary of the Army shall ensure that  the public understands the linkage between the processes, tools, and  enforcement mechanism and can monitor the effectiveness of this  integrated framework in assuring that the goals and purposes of the  Plan are achieved, as provided for in the regulations of this part, by:     (i) Providing for public notice and comment in the development of  planning, implementation, and evaluation tools;     (ii) Providing notice of final action on planning, evaluation, and  implementation tools;     (iii) Making available to the public on a web site or by other  appropriate means final, and where appropriate draft, copies of all  planning, evaluation, and implementation tools; and     (iv) Explaining through the regulations of this part and by other  appropriate means the process for developing the tools, the linkage  between the process, tools, and enforcement mechanism, and the means by  which these elements constitute an integrated framework for assuring  that the goals and purposes of the Plan are achieved.  Sec.  385.2  Applicability of the programmatic regulations.      (a) This part applies to all activities conducted to implement the  [[Page 64222]]  Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan.     (b) As used in this part, the Secretary of the Army acts through  the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works with respect to the  Army's civil works program pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 3016.     (c) Nothing in this part shall be interpreted to amend, alter,  diminish, or otherwise affect:     (1) The rights, powers and duties provided under the  ``Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan Assurance of Project  Benefits Agreement,'' dated January 9, 2002 pursuant to section  601(h)(2) of WRDA 2000; or     (2) Any existing legal water rights of the United States, the State  of Florida, the Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Florida, or the Seminole  Tribe of Florida, including rights under the compact among the Seminole  Tribe of Florida, the State, and the South Florida Water Management  District, defining the scope and use of water rights of the Seminole  Tribe of Florida, as codified by section 7 of the Seminole Indian Land  Claims Settlement Act of 1987 (25 U.S.C. 1772e).     (d) This part is intended to aid the internal management of the  implementing agencies and is not intended to create any right or  benefit enforceable at law by a party against the implementing agencies  or their officers. Nothing in this part shall create a right or  expectation to benefits or enhancements, temporary or permanent, in  third parties that are not specifically authorized by Congress in  section 601 of WRDA 2000.     (e) Nothing in this part is intended to, or shall be interpreted  to, reserve or allocate water or to prescribe the process for reserving  or allocating water or for water management under Florida law. Nor is  this part intended to, nor shall it be interpreted to, prescribe any  process of Florida law.  Sec.  385.3  Definitions.      For the purposes of this part, the following terms are defined:     Adaptive management means the continuous process of seeking a  better understanding of the natural system and human environment in the  South Florida ecosystem, and seeking continuous refinements in and  improvements to the Plan to respond to new information resulting from  changed or unforeseen circumstances, new scientific and technical  information, new or updated modeling; information developed through the  assessment principles contained in the Plan; and future authorized  changes to the Plan in order to ensure that the goals and purposes of  the Plan are fulfilled.     Alternative plan means a plan that consists of a system of  structural and/or nonstructural measures, strategies, or programs  formulated to achieve, fully or partially, the goals and purposes of  the Plan, as further defined in section 1.6.1 of the Water Resources  Council's ``Economic and Environmental Guidelines for Water and Related  Land Resources Implementation Studies,'' dated March 10, 1983.     Assessment means the process whereby the actual performance of  implemented projects is measured and interpreted based on analyses of  information obtained from research, monitoring, modeling, or other  relevant sources.     Central and Southern Florida (C&SF) Project means the project for  Central and Southern Florida authorized under the heading ``CENTRAL AND  SOUTHERN FLORIDA'' in section 203 of the Flood Control Act of 1948 (62  Stat. 1176) and any modification authorized by any other provision of  law, including section 601 of WRDA 2000.     Component means features of the Plan that include, but are not  limited to, storage reservoirs, aquifer storage and recovery  facilities, stormwater treatment areas, water reuse facilities, canals,  levees, pumps, water control structures, and seepage management  facilities; the removal of canals, levees, pumps, and water control  structures; and operational changes.     Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan (CERP) means the plan  contained in the ``Final Integrated Feasibility Report and Programmatic  Environmental Impact Statement,'' dated April 1, 1999, as modified by  section 601 of WRDA 2000, and any subsequent modification authorized in  law.     Comprehensive Plan Modification Report means the report prepared  for approval by Congress of major changes to the Plan that are  necessary to ensure that the goals and purposes of the Plan are  achieved. The Comprehensive Plan Modification Report describes the  formulation and evaluation of alternatives, recommended modifications  to the Plan, and other economic, environmental, and engineering  information, and includes the appropriate NEPA document.     Concurrence means the issuance of a written statement of  concurrence or the failure to provide such a written statement within a  time frame prescribed by law or this part.     Consultation means a process to ensure meaningful and timely input  in the development of program and project activities, reports, manuals,  plans, and other documents from Federal, State, and local agencies, the  Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Florida, and the Seminole Tribe of  Florida.     Coordination means the formal exchange of information and views, by  letter, report, or other prescribed means, between the Corps of  Engineers and the non-Federal sponsor and another agency or tribe,  including but not limited to, the exchange of information and views  regarding the development of Project Implementation Reports, Operating  Manuals, and Comprehensive Plan Modification Reports. Coordination  activities are required by and in accordance with purposes and  procedures established by Federal policy (public law, executive order,  agency regulation, memorandum of agreement, and other documents that  memorialize policy of the Corps of Engineers).     Cost-effective means the least costly way of attaining a given  level of output or performance, consistent with the goals and purposes  of the Plan and applicable laws.     Design Agreement means the agreement between the Corps of Engineers  and a non-Federal sponsor concerning cost sharing for activities  related to planning, engineering, design, and other activities needed  to implement the Plan.     Dispute means any disagreement between the agencies or tribes  associated with implementation of the Plan that cannot be resolved by  the members of a Project Delivery Team or RECOVER and that is elevated  to decision makers at the respective agencies or tribes.     District Engineer means the District Engineer of the Corps of  Engineers, Jacksonville District.     Division Engineer means the Division Engineer of the Corps of  Engineers, South Atlantic Division.     Drought contingency plan means the plan required by Sec.   222.5(i)(5) of this chapter and described in implementing Engineer  Regulation ER 1110-2-1941 ``Drought Contingency Plans,'' and means a  plan contained within an Operating Manual that describes procedures for  dealing with drought situations that affect management decisions for  operating projects.     Environmental and economic equity means the fair treatment of all  persons regardless of race, color, creed, national origin, or economic  status, including environmental justice, and the provision of economic  opportunities for small business concerns controlled by socially and  economically disadvantaged individuals, including individuals with  [[Page 64223]]  limited English proficiency, in the implementation of the Plan.     Environmental justice means identifying and addressing,  disproportionately high and adverse human health or environmental  effects of a Federal agency's programs, policies, and activities on  minority and low-income populations, in accordance with applicable  laws, regulations, and Executive Orders.     Evaluation means the process whereby the performance of plans and  designs relative to desired objectives is forecast through predictive  modeling and other tools.     Expected performance level means the projected level of benefits to  the natural system and human environment described in the Plan.     External peer review means a process to review and validate the  scientific and technical processes and information developed for  implementation of the Plan that is independent of the agencies involved  in the implementation of the Plan.     Goals and purposes of the Plan means the restoration, preservation,  and protection of the South Florida ecosystem while providing for other  water-related needs of the region, including water supply and flood  protection.     Governor means the Governor of the State of Florida.     Guidance memorandum means the specific procedure, process, or other  guidance specified in Sec.  385.5(b) that is developed and approved by  the Secretary of the Army with the concurrence of the Secretary of the  Interior and the Governor.     Improved or new flood protection benefits means increased or new  levels of service for flood protection that are identified in a Project  Implementation Report and approved as a purpose of the project.     Independent scientific review means the process established  pursuant to section 601(j) of WRDA 2000 to review the Plan's progress  toward achieving the natural system restoration goals of the Plan.     Individual feature of the Plan means a component or group of  components of the Plan related to and limited to one specific project  of the Plan.     Interim goal is a means by which restoration success of the Plan  may be evaluated throughout the implementation process. Interim goals  provide a means of tracking restoration performance, as well as a basis  for reporting on the progress made at specified intervals of time  towards restoration of the South Florida ecosystem, and for  periodically evaluating the accuracy of predictions of system responses  to the effects of the Plan.     Interim target is a means by which the success of the Plan in  providing for other water-related needs of the region, including water  supply and flood protection, may be evaluated throughout the  implementation process. Interim targets provide a means of tracking  Plan performance, as well as a basis for reporting on progress made at  specified intervals of time towards providing for other water-related  needs of the region, and for periodically evaluating the accuracy of  predictions of system responses to the effects of the Plan.     Justified has the same meaning as in section 601(f)(2) of WRDA 2000  which states that the Secretary of the Army, in carrying out any  activity to restore, preserve, or protect the South Florida ecosystem,  may determine that an activity is justified by the environmental  benefits derived by the South Florida ecosystem and no further economic  justification for the activity is required, if the Secretary determines  that the activity is cost-effective.     Levels of service for flood protection means the expected  performance of the Central and Southern Project and other water  management systems in the South Florida ecosystem, consistent with  applicable law, for a specific area or region.     Master Implementation Sequencing Plan means the document that  describes the sequencing and scheduling for the projects of the Plan.     Mediation means a non-binding dispute resolution process designed  to assist the disputing parties to resolve a disagreement.

Subpart B--Program Goals and Responsibilities  Sec.  385.8  Goals and purposes of the Comprehensive Everglades  Restoration Plan.      (a) The Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan (CERP) is a  framework for modifications and operational changes to the Central and  Southern Florida Project. The overarching objective of the Plan is the  restoration, preservation, and protection of the South Florida  ecosystem while providing for other water-related needs of the region,  including water supply and flood protection.     (b) The Corps of Engineers, the South Florida Water Management  District, and other non-Federal sponsors shall, in consultation with  the Department of the Interior, the Environmental Protection Agency,  the Department of Commerce, the Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Florida,  the Seminole Tribe of Florida, the Florida Department of Environmental  Protection, and other Federal, State, and local agencies, implement the  Plan, as authorized by Congress, to ensure the protection of water  quality in, the reduction of the loss of fresh water from, and the  improvement of the environment of the South Florida ecosystem and to  achieve and maintain the benefits to the natural system and human  environment described in the Plan, and required pursuant to section 601  of WRDA 2000, for as long as the project is authorized.     (c) The goal of the Plan is to restore, preserve, and protect the  South Florida ecosystem while providing for other water-related needs  of the region. The Plan is designed to accomplish this by providing the  quantity, quality, timing, and distribution of water necessary to  achieve and sustain those essential hydrological and biological  characteristics that defined the undisturbed South Florida ecosystem.  As authorized by Congress, the restored South Florida ecosystem will be  significantly healthier than the current system; however it will not  completely replicate the undisturbed South Florida ecosystem and some  areas may more closely replicate the undisturbed ecosystem than others.  Initial modeling showed that most of the water generated by the Plan  would go to the natural system in order to attain restoration goals,  and the remainder of the water would go for use in the human  environment. The Corps of Engineers, the South Florida Water Management  District, and other non-Federal sponsors shall ensure that Project  Implementation Reports identify the appropriate quantity, timing, and  distribution of water to be dedicated and managed for the natural  system that is necessary to meet the restoration goals of the Plan. In  accordance with the ``Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan  Assurance of Project Benefits Agreement,'' dated January 9, 2002  pursuant to section 601(h)(2) of WRDA 2000, the South Florida Water  Management District or the Florida Department of Environmental  Protection shall make sufficient reservations of water for the natural  system under State law in accordance with the Project Implementation  Report for that project and consistent with the Plan before water made  available by a project is permitted for a consumptive use or otherwise  made unavailable.     (d) The Corps of Engineers and non-Federal sponsors shall implement  the Plan in a manner to continuously improve the expected performance  level of the Plan based upon new information resulting from changed or  unforeseen circumstances, new scientific and technical information, new  or updated modeling; information developed through the adaptive  assessment principles contained in the Plan; and future authorized  changes to the Plan integrated into the implementation of the Plan.  Sec.  385.9  Implementation principles.      The Corps of Engineers and the South Florida Water Management  District and other non-Federal sponsors shall, in consultation with the  Department of the Interior, the Environmental Protection Agency, the  Department of Commerce, the Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Florida, the  Seminole Tribe of Florida, the Florida Department of Environmental  Protection, and other Federal, State, and local agencies, conduct  activities, including program-level activities, necessary to implement  the Plan. Such activities shall be conducted as part of an integrated  implementation program, in accordance with this part, and based on the  following principles:     (a) Individual projects shall be formulated, evaluated, and  justified based on their ability to contribute to the goals and  purposes of the Plan and on their ability to provide benefits that  justify costs on a next-added increment basis.     (b) Interim goals shall be established in accordance with Sec.   385.38 to provide a means for evaluating restoration success of the  Plan at specific time intervals during implementation. Interim targets  to evaluate progress on  [[Page 64227]]  providing for other water-related needs of the region provided for in  the Plan shall be established in accordance with Sec.  385.39. Interim  goals and interim targets shall be consistent with each other.     (c) Endorsement of the Plan as a restoration framework is not  intended as a constraint on innovation during implementation through  the adaptive management process. Continuous improvement of the Plan  shall be sought to ensure that new information resulting from changed  or unforeseen circumstances, new scientific and technical information,  new or updated modeling; information developed through the assessment  principles contained in the Plan; and future authorized changes to the  Plan are integrated into the implementation of the Plan. The adaptive  management process provides a means for analyzing the performance of  the Plan and assessing progress towards meeting the goals and purposes  of the Plan as well as a basis for improving the performance of the  Plan. Improving the performance of the Plan means enhancing the  benefits of the Plan in terms of restoration of the natural system  while providing for other water-related needs of the region, including  water supply and flood protection.  Sec.  385.10  Implementation responsibilities, consultation, and  coordination.      (a) Implementing agencies. Implementation of the Plan shall be the  responsibility of the Corps of Engineers and the non-Federal sponsors.     (b) Consultation. (1) Consultation with tribes. (i) In addition to  any other applicable provision for consultation with Native American  Tribes, including but not limited to, laws, regulations, executive  orders, and policies the Corps of Engineers and non-Federal sponsors  shall consult with and seek advice from the Miccosukee Tribe of Indians  of Florida and the Seminole Tribe of Florida throughout the  implementation process to ensure meaningful and timely input by tribal  officials regarding programs and activities covered by this part.  Consultation with the tribes shall be conducted on a government-to- government basis.     (ii) In carrying out their responsibilities under section 601 of  WRDA 2000 with respect to the restoration of the South Florida  ecosystem, the Secretary of the Army and the Secretary of the Interior  shall fulfill any obligations to the Indian tribes in South Florida  under the Indian trust doctrine as well as other applicable legal  obligations.     (2) Consultation with agencies. The Corps of Engineers and non- Federal sponsors shall consult with and seek advice from the Department  of the Interior, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Department of  Commerce, the Florida Department of Environmental Protection, and other  Federal, State, and local agencies throughout the implementation  process to ensure meaningful and timely input by those agencies  regarding programs and activities covered under this part. The time  for, and extent of, consultation shall be appropriate for, and limited  by, the activity involved.     (c) Coordination. The Corps of Engineers and the non-Federal  sponsor shall coordinate implementation activities and the preparation  of documents with other Federal, State, and local agencies and the  tribes to fulfill the requirements of all applicable Federal and State  laws, including but not limited to, the Fish and Wildlife Coordination  Act, the National Environmental Policy Act, the Clean Air Act, the  Clean Water Act, the National Historic Preservation Act, the Coastal  Zone Management Act, the Marine Mammal Protection Act, and the  Endangered Species Act.     (d) Timeliness obligations of consultation. Consultation involves  reciprocal obligations: on the part of the Corps of Engineers and the  non-Federal sponsor to involve agencies, tribes, and the public at an  early stage and in such a way to ensure meaningful consultation, and on  the part of the parties consulted to respond in a timely and meaningful  fashion so that the implementation of the Plan is not jeopardized and  so that delays do not result in other adverse consequences to  restoration of the natural system, to the other goals and purposes of  the Plan, or to the public interest generally. Prescribed time limits  set by regulation are too inflexible for the entire consultation  process. It is expected that the Corps of Engineers and the non-Federal  sponsor will set reasonable time limits for consultation on specific  decisions consistent with the purposes of this part and that the  parties will consult in a timely and meaningful way. The Corps of  Engineers and the non-Federal sponsor recognize that the time limits  established for each specific decision will be proportionate to the  complexity of the decision and will take into account the resources of  the entity with whom the consultation is occurring in order to allow  consultation to occur in a meaningful way. This part does not intend  for a delay in consultation to be used as a de facto veto power. This  part authorizes the Corps of Engineers and the non-Federal sponsor to  set reasonable limits on the amount of time for consultation. In  setting reasonable time limits, the agencies and tribes may consider  relevant considerations such as sequencing of projects, planning,  contracting and funding, and any factor listed for setting time limits  for consulting under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) (40  CFR 1501.8), including but not limited to, the nature and size of the  proposed action, the degree to which relevant information is known or  obtainable, the degree to which the action is controversial, the state  of the art of analytical techniques, the number of persons affected,  and the consequences of delay. In engaging in consultation, the Corps  of Engineers and non-Federal sponsor shall inform the agencies, tribes,  and public of the ending date for consultation. In addition, the  agencies and tribes should adhere to all time limits imposed by law,  regulations or executive order. In appropriate circumstances, the Corps  of Engineers and the non-Federal sponsor may extend the time for  consultation upon a showing that delays will not result in adverse  consequences to the implementation of the Plan, to the restoration of  the natural system, to the other goals and purposes of the Plan, or to  the public interest and that relevant considerations justify a longer  time. Failure of an agency, tribe or the public to engage in  consultation with the Corps of Engineers and the non-Federal sponsor,  or file comments in, a timely and meaningful way shall not be a  sufficient reason for extending a consultation or comment period.  Nothing in this part is intended to alter existing time limits  established by statute or other regulations.     (e) South Florida Ecosystem Restoration Task Force. The Department  of the Army recognizes the valuable role that the South Florida  Ecosystem Restoration Task Force (Task Force), its working group, and  its other advisory bodies play in the discussion and resolution of  issues related to the South Florida ecosystem. The Corps of Engineers  and the South Florida Water Management District regularly brief the  Task Force on the Plan and regularly serve on the working group and  other advisory bodies. The Corps of Engineers and the South Florida  Water Management District and other non-Federal sponsors shall continue  to provide information to, and consult with, the South Florida  Ecosystem Restoration Task Force, the Florida-based working group, and  advisory  [[Page 64228]]  bodies to the Task Force as appropriate throughout the implementation  process for the Plan. In addition to consultation with the Task Force  specified elsewhere in this part, the Corps of Engineers and the South  Florida Water Management District shall consult with the South Florida  Ecosystem Restoration Task Force, its working group, and its advisory  bodies, on other matters related to the implementation of the Plan, as  the Task Force from time to time may request. Pursuant to the  provisions of WRDA 1996, the Task Force shall provide general input  concerning the implementation of the Plan. The Task Force shall provide  recommendations to the Secretary of the Army regarding the  implementation of the Plan, as provided in this part. The Secretary of  the Army shall notify the Task Force to ensure it is afforded an  opportunity to review and provide recommendations on reports and  products, including but not limited to, interim goals and interim  targets, Project Implementation Reports, Pilot Project Design Reports,  Pilot Project Technical Data Reports, the pre-CERP baseline, assessment  reports, guidance memoranda, Master Implementation Sequencing Plan,  Comprehensive Plan Modification Reports, periodic CERP updates, and  reports to Congress prepared pursuant to Sec.  385.40.  Subpart C--CERP Implementation Processes  Sec.  385.11  Implementation process for projects.      Generally, the Corps of Engineers and non-Federal sponsors shall  develop and implement projects in accordance with the process that is  shown in figure 1 in Appendix A of this part.

The Project Management Plan describes  the activities, tasks, and responsibilities that will be used to  produce and deliver the products necessary to implement the project.     (b) Project Implementation Report. The Project Implementation  Report provides information on plan formulation and evaluation,  engineering and design, estimated benefits and costs, and environmental  effects to bridge the gap between the conceptual design included in the  Plan and the detailed design necessary to proceed to construction. The  Project Implementation Reports will also set forth additional  information and analyses necessary for the Secretary of the Army or  Congress to approve the project for implementation.     (c) Plans and specifications. During this phase, final design of  the project is completed and plans and specifications are prepared.  Plans and specifications contain the information necessary to bid and  construct the project.     (d) Real estate acquisition. The lands, easements, and rights-of  way, and relocations necessary for the project are acquired prior to  construction.     (e) Construction. This phase is the actual construction of a  project's components and includes an interim operation and monitoring  period to ensure that the project operates as designed.     (f) Operation. After construction of the project has been  completed, it is operated in accordance with the System Operating  Manual and the Project Operating Manual.     (g) Monitoring and assessment. After the project has been  constructed, monitoring is conducted as necessary to assess the  effectiveness of the project and to provide information that will be  used for the adaptive management program.  Sec.  385.12  Pilot projects.      (a) The Plan includes pilot projects to address uncertainties  associated with certain components such as aquifer storage and  recovery, in-ground reservoir technology, seepage management, and  wastewater reuse. The purpose of the pilot projects is to develop  information necessary to better determine the technical feasibility of  these components prior to development of a Project Implementation  Report.     (b) Prior to initiating activities on a pilot project, the Corps of  Engineers and the non-Federal sponsor shall develop a Project  Management Plan as described in Sec.  385.24.     (c) Project Implementation Reports shall not be necessary for pilot  projects. Prior to implementing a pilot project, the Corps of Engineers  and the non-Federal sponsor shall prepare a Pilot Project Design  Report.     (1) The Pilot Project Design Report shall contain the technical  information necessary to construct the pilot project including  engineering and design, cost estimates, real estate analyses, and  appropriate NEPA documentation.     (2) The Pilot Project Design Report shall include a detailed  operational testing and monitoring plan necessary to develop  information to assist in better determining the technical feasibility  of certain components prior to development of a Project Implementation  Report.

(1) In implementing the Plan, the Corps of Engineers  shall comply with the requirements of NEPA (42 U.S.C. 4371, et seq.)  and applicable implementing regulations, including determining whether  a specific action, when considered individually and cumulatively, will  have a significant impact on the human environment.     (2) As appropriate, other agencies shall be invited to be  cooperating agencies in the preparation of NEPA documentation pursuant  to Sec.  230.16 of this chapter.     (3) The District Engineer is the NEPA official responsible for  compliance with NEPA for actions conducted to implement the Plan.  Unless otherwise provided for by this part, NEPA coordination for  implementation of the plan shall follow the NEPA procedures established  in part 230 of this chapter.     (b) Actions normally requiring an Environmental Impact Statement  (EIS). (1) In addition to the actions listed in Sec.  230.6 of this  chapter, actions normally requiring an EIS are:     (i) Comprehensive Plan Modification Reports;     (ii) System Operating Manual or significant changes to the System  Operating Manual;     (iii) Project Implementation Reports, including the draft Project  Operating Manual when included in the Project Implementation Report;     (iv) Pilot Project Design Reports, including the detailed  operational testing and monitoring plan; and     (v) Project Operating Manuals for any project where a Project  Implementation Report is not prepared, or significant changes to  Project Operating Manuals.

GX240-79-7164646	"Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan Programmatic Regulations Initial Draft  December 2001   Introduction These programmatic regulations, once promulgated, will become part of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR). The CFR is the foundation of the Federal Register publication system. It is an annual codification of the rules of the Federal agencies. The basic structure of the CFR consists of a hierarchy of designated CFR units. These units are Titles (broad area subject), Chapter (rules of a sing le issuing agency), Part (unified body of rules concerning a single function or specific subject), and Section (short presentation of one regulatory function). The Corps of Engineers has decided to place the programmatic regulations in the CFR under Title 33  Navigation and Navigable Waters, Chapter II  Corps of Engineers, Department of the Army, in a new part, Part 385, entitled ""Programmatic Regulations for the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan."" This initial draft is being circulated to the public for discussion purposes. This initial draft is expected to be revised following coordination with agencies, groups , and the public. The Department of the Army and the Office of Management and Budget will also review the draft programmatic regulations before they are published in the Federal Register as a proposed rule. This initial draft of the programmatic regulations uses the format required for placement of a proposed rule in the Federal Register in accordance with the Federal Register Document Drafting Handbook (October 1998 Revision) except for the addition of line numbers to the text and not being double -spaced.   INITIAL DRAFT REGULATION 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46  DECEMBER 2001 Billing Code # 3710- 92  DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE Department of the Army, Corps of Engineers 33 CFR Part 385 RIN 0710- AA49 Programmatic Regulations for the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan AGENCY: Army Corps of Engineers, DOD. ACTION: Proposed Rule. SUMMARY: The Army Corps of Engineers proposes to establish programmatic regulations for the Comprehensive Everglades Re storation Plan. Congress approved the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan in section 601 of the Water Resources Development Act of 2000 (114 Stat. 2680), which was enacted on December 11, 2000. The Act also requires the Secretary of the Army to promulgate programmatic regulations within two years to ensure that the goals and purposes of the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan are achieved. We have developed this proposed rule in response to that statutory requirement. The proposed rule establishes processes and procedures that will guide the Army Corps of Engineers and its partners in the implementation of the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:   INITIAL DRAFT REGULATION 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46  DECEMBER 2001  I. Background The purpose of these programmatic regulations is to establish a process : for the development of Project Implementation Reports, Project Cooperation Agreements, and Operating Manuals that ensure that the goals and the objectives of the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan are achieved; to ensure that new information resulting from changes or unforeseen circumstances, new scientific or technical information or information that is developed through the principles of adaptive management contained in the Plan, or future authorized changes to the Plan are integrated into the implementation of the Plan; and to ensure the protection of the natural system consistent with the goals and purposes of the Plan, including the establishment of interim goals to provide a means by which the restoration success of the plan may be evaluated throughout the implementation process. The south Florida ecosystem is a nationally and internationally unique and important natural resource. It is also a resource in peril, having been severely impacted by human activities for over a hundred years. The Central & Southern Florida Project extends from south of Orlando to the Florida Keys and is composed of a regional network of canals, levees, storage areas, and water control structures. First authorized by Congress in 1948, the project serves multiple purposes. The authorized purposes of the project include flood control, regional water supply for agricultural and urban areas, prevention of salt water intrusion, water supply to Everglades National Park, preservation of fish and wildlife, recreation, and navigation. For over 50 years, the Central & Southern Florida Project has performed its authorized functions well. However, the project also has had unintended adverse effects on the unique natural environment that constit utes the Everglades and south Florida ecosystem. In 1992, the Army Corps of Engineers was directed to develop a comprehensive plan to restore and preserve south Florida's natural ecosystem, while enhancing water supplies and maintaining flood protection. The resulting plan, which was submitted to Congress on July 1, 1999, is called the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan. The overarching goal of the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan (the Plan) is the restoration, preservation and protection of the south Florida ecosystem while providing for other water- related needs of the region such as flood protection and water supply. The Plan contains 68 major components that involve creation of approximately 217,000 acres of reservoirs and wetland - based water treatment areas, wastewater reuse plants, seepage management, and removal of levees and canals in natural areas. These components vastly increase storage and water supply for the natural system, as well as for urban and agricultural needs, while maintaining existing Central and Southern Florida Project purposes. The Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan will restore more natural flows of water, including sheet flow; improve water quality; and establish more natural hydroperiods in the south Florida ecosystem. Improvements to native flora and fauna, including threatened and endangered species, are expected to occur as a result of the restoration of hydrologic conditions. Section 601 of Public Law 106- 541, the Water Resources Development Act of 2000 (114 Stat. 2680) approved the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan as a framework for  4   INITIAL DRAFT REGULATION 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46  DECEMBER 2001  modifications to the Central and Southern Florida Project. Section 601 also authorized four pilot projects and ten initial projects of the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan and contains other provisions associated with implementation of the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan. Section 601(h)(3) of the Water Resources Development Act of 2000 (114 Stat. 2688) requires that the Secretary of the Army, after notice and opportunity for public comment, and with the concurrence of the Governor of Florida and the Secretary of the Interior, and consultation with the Seminole Tribe of Indians of Florida, the Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Florida, the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, the Secretary of Commerce, and other Federal, State, and local agencies, promulgate programmatic regulations to ensure that the goals and purposes of the Plan are achieved. This proposed rule is in response to the requirements of the Water Resources Development Act of 2000. II. Process for Developing the Proposed Rule We developed the proposed rule through an open and inclusive process that involved numerous meetings, briefings, and discussions with other Federa l, State, and local agencies; the Miccosukee and Seminole Tribes; agricultural, environmental, urban utilities, recreational, and urban interest groups; and the public. Briefings on the programmatic regulations were provided to the Governing Board of the South Florida Water Management District and its Water Resources Advisory Commission and the South Florida Ecosystem Restoration Working Group. In addition, programmatic regulations web pages were developed and posted on the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan web site (www.evergladesplan.org). The web site was used to post information about the programmatic regulations and to provide a place for individuals and organizations to submit comments electronically during the development of the programmatic regulations. The process we used to develop the programmatic regulations was designed to identify the major concerns of the agenc ies and the various groups and to find middle ground to the greatest extent possible prior to publishing the proposed rule and soliciting formal public comment. We held an initial round of meetings with agencies, agricultural, environmental, urban utilities, recreational, and urban interest groups, and the public in May and June 2001. The purpose of these meetings was to discuss the process that would be used to develop the programmatic regulations and to solicit comments on the major issues a nd concerns that should be addressed in developing the regulations. Following the initial round of meetings, we developed a draft outline of the programmatic regulations. We then held a second round of meetings in September and October 2001 with agencies, agricultural, environmental, urban utilities, recreational, and urban interest groups, and the public to solicit comments on the draft outline. After the second round of meetings were held, we developed an initial draft of the programmatic regulations and distributed this initial draft to the public in December  5   INITIAL DRAFT REGULATION 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46  DECEMBER 2001  2001. We then held numerous discussions and meetings with agencies, governments, and agricultural, environmental, urban utilities, recreational, a nd urban interest groups, to discuss the initial draft. Finally, we developed the proposed rule after considering all the information received at the meetings that were held as well as written comments that were received. III. Major Issues Addressed in Developing the Programmatic Regulations A. General As described in the previous section, we held numerous meetings with agencies, governments, agricultural, environmental, urban utilities, recreational, and urban interest groups, and the public. They raised a number of issues and concerns that were considered in the development of the proposed rule. B. Partnership with the State of Florida Implementation of the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan requires a partnership between the Federal and State governments. The South Florida Water Management District will be the non- Federal sponsor for many of the projects of the Plan. The State of Florida has established a funding mechanism, the Save Our Everglades Trust Fund, to fund the State's share of implementation of the Plan. Section 601 of the Water Resources Development Act of 2000 recognizes and encourages this partnership and the proposed rule is consistent with this intent. The report of the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works on the Water Resources Development Act of 2000 (Senate Report No. 106- 362) describes this partnership: ""Subsection (h) does more than provide the necessary assurances. It also defines the relation among the various Federal, State and local governmental entities charged with Plan implementation responsibilities. The subsection places procedural and substantive requirements on both the Federal Government and the State of Florida. Most importantly, subsection (h) strikes a careful balance between the Federal interest in ensuring that predicted Plan benefits, including benefits to Federal lands, are attained, and the State's interest in: ensuring that Stateowned or managed lands also receive predicted Plan benefits; and preserving its traditional sovereignty over the reservation and allocation of water within the State's boundaries."" The proposed rule provides a framework for the implementation of the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan by defining the processes and procedures needed to accomplish the necessary planning, design, construction, and operation of the projects of the Plan. The processes and requirements included in the proposed rule were also developed to compliment, but not interfere with the rights and responsibilities of the South Florida Water Management District, the State of Florida, or other non- Federal sponsors in implementing the Plan. The proposed rule also recognizes that the nonFederal sponsor for some projects will be governmental entities other than the South Florida Water Management District. C. Consultation  6   INITIAL DRAFT REGULATION 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46  DECEMBER 2001  Successful implementation of the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan requires not just the involvement of the implementing agencies, but extensive involvement by other Federal, State, and local agencies and the tribes. Although implementation of the Plan is the responsibility of the Corps of Engineers and the non- Federal sponsor, the proposed rule provides that the implementing agencies consult with the Department of the Interior, the Florida Department of Enviro nmental Protection, the Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Florida, the Seminole Tribe of Florida, and other Federal, State, and local agencies as part of the implementation process. The consultation provisions ensure that these agencies and governments are integrally involved with the Corps of Engineers and the non- Federal sponsor in implementing the Plan. D. Amount of Detail in the Proposed Rule Many agencies, agricultural, environmental, urban utilities, recreational, and urban interest groups, and the public were concerned about the amount of detail in the regulations. Some believed that the programmatic regulations should be very detailed, specific, and prescriptive. Others believed that the programmatic regulations should only define the ""rules of engagement"" between the Corps of Engineers and its non- Federal project sponsors. In addition, some were concerned that these Federal regulations not infringe on the sovereignty of the State of Florida or interfere with the State's right to allocate its water resources. Others were concerned that the programmatic regulations ensure that the Federal interest and investment in restoration, preservation, and protection of the south Florida ecosystem, including Federal properties such as national parks and wildlife refuges be protected. The proposed rule attempts to balance these differing concerns and interests. The proposed rule includes a number of processes that are necessary to guide the implementation process. We recognize that more detailed protocols and procedures are needed as well to assist implementation. We believe that, because for the most part the protocols and procedures will be very detailed and technical, they should not be included in the programmatic regulations. Additionally, if protoco ls and procedures were included in the programmatic regulations, any revision to them would require us to initiate a formal rulemaking process even for minor revisions. However, given the importance of protocols and procedures and the impact that they will have on implementation, we believe that the public should have the opportunity to review and comment on the protocols and procedures before they are adopted. The proposed rule provides that opportunities for public comment be provided before any protocols and procedures are adopted. The proposed rule also provides for the development of certain protocols and provides guidance for their development. E. Implementation Principles Section 601 of the Water Resources Development Act of 2000 states that the ove rarching objective of the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan is the restoration, preservation, and protection of the south Florida ecosystem while providing for other water- related needs of the region, including water supply and flood protection. So me agencies, agricultural, environmental, urban utilities, recreational, and urban interest groups, and the public were concerned about having a set of goals to guide implementation of the Plan. They rely on the report of the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works on the Water Resources Development Act of 2000  7   INITIAL DRAFT REGULATION 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47  DECEMBER 2001  (Senate Report No. 106- 362) which states, ""Further, the committee expects that the implementing agencies will make every effort to accelerate the delivery of Plan benefits to t he natural system to the extent practicable. It is estimated that 3 to 5 acres of land in the South Florida ecosystem are lost per day under current conditions. Time is of the essence in this restoration effort."" The proposed rule establishes a number of implementation principles such as sequencing and scheduling projects to accelerate system- wide restoration, preservation, and protection benefits that are intended to guide the implementation process consistent with the overarching objective of the Plan. F. Restoration Coordination and Verification (RECOVER) Some agencies, agricultural, environmental, urban utilities, recreational, and urban interest groups, and the public were concerned about integration of the individual projects that co mprise the Plan to ensure that the goals and purposes of the Plan are achieved. They were concerned that there be a system- wide focus during implementation and that there be a way to ensure that the best scientific information on restoration is used. Some agencies, agricultural, environmental, urban utilities, recreational, and urban interest groups, and the public were concerned that there be a focus on achieving the other waterrelated benefits of the Plan, in addition to the restoration benefits. The proposed rule provides that the Corps of Engineers and the South Florida Water Management District establish the Restoration Coordination and Verification (RECOVER) team, a team that is functioning already. RECOVER is an interdisciplinary, interagency team that will ensure that a system- wide perspective is maintained throughout the implementation process. Specifically, RECOVER will be responsible for developing system- wide performance measures for restoration as well as other water- related needs, evaluating projects from a system- wide perspective in the preparation of Project Implementation Reports, conducting adaptive assessment activities, developing and evaluating proposed revisions to the Plan, and developing recommendations for interim goals. The proposed rule formalizes many of the activities already underway by RECOVER. G. Independent Scientific Review Some agencies, agricultural, environmental, urban utilities, recreational, and urban interest groups, and the public were conc erned that the implementation process needs to include independent scientific review. Section 601(j) of the Water Resources Development Act of 2000 requires the establishment of an independent scientific review panel. The proposed rule does not establish t he panel, but it does include provisions for cooperating with the panel and considering the advice and recommendations made by the panel. H. Project Implementation Reports Section 601 of the Water Resources Development Act of 2000 establishes a new type o f reporting document called a Project Implementation Report to bridge the gap between the conceptual level of detail in the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan and the detail needed for project design. Agencies, agricultural, environmental, urban utilities, recreational, and urban interest groups, and the public were concerned that a clearly defined process was needed for the development of Project Implementation Reports, and 8   INITIAL DRAFT REGULATION 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46  DECEMBER 2001  in particular the formulation and evaluation of projects. The report of the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works on the Water Resources Development Act of 2000 (Senate Report No. 106- 362) defines Project Implementation Reports: "" The project implementation report is a new type of reporting document, simila r to a General Reevaluation Report in that it will contain additional project formulation and evaluation. The project implementation report also will contain General Design Memorandum level of detail, or higher, for engineering and design. Some of the task s associated with the preparation of the project implementation report will include: surveys and mapping; geotechnical analyses; flood damage assessment; real estate analyses; and preparation of supplemental National Environmental Policy Act documents. The project implementation reports will bridge the gap between the programmatic- level design contained in the Plan and the detailed design necessary to proceed to construction. Furthermore, each project implementation report will be accompanied by a project Management Plan, which will detail schedules, funding requirements, and resource needs for final design and construction of the project."" The proposed rule provides guidance for the development of Project Implementation Reports. The proposed rule provides for development and adoption of a protocol that describes the major tasks to develop a Project Implementation Report and a protocol that provides an outline for the content of the Project Implementation Report. The proposed rule also provides for development and adoption of a protocol for the formulation and evaluation of projects. I. Project Cooperation Agreements The Project Cooperation Agreement is the legal agreement between the Department of the Army and the non- Federal sponsor that must be executed before a project can be constructed. Section 601(h) of the Water Resources Development Act of 2000 requires that the agreement not be executed until the State has reserved or allocated water for the natural system as described in the Project Implementation Report. A number of agencies, agricultural, environmental, urban utilities, recreational, and urban interest groups, and the public were concerned about how to make sure that the reservation or allocation is made in accordance with the Project Implementation Report. The proposed rule provides that the District Engineer verify that this reservation or allocation has been made by the State as identified in the Project Implementation Report. This will provide the assurances that Congress intended without infringing on the State's right to reserve or allocate water under State law. The proposed rule also establishes that the Project Cooperation Agreement include a provision that the reservation or allocation remain in effect and not be diminished, unless the Secretary of the Army agrees, for as long as the Plan is authorized. This provision is intended to protect the Federal interest and investment in the Plan and the need to ensure that the goals and purposes of the Plan are achieved. The propos ed rule provides that the Project Cooperation Agreement include a provision that prohibits the Corps of Engineers or the non- Federal sponsor from eliminating or transferring existing legal sources of water until a new source of comparable quantity and  9   INITIAL DRAFT REGULATION 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46  DECEMBER 2001  quality is available. This provision implements the Savings Clause provisions of section 601 of the Water Resources Development Act of 2000. It is designed to prevent harm to existing legal sources of water including those for agricultural or urban water supply, the Miccosukee or Seminole Tribes, water supply for Everglades National Park, and water supply for fish and wildlife. Also in compliance with the Savings Clause provisions, the proposed rule provides that the Project Cooperation Agreement include a provision that existing levels of flood protection not be reduced. J. Operating Manuals Operating Manuals provide rules and procedures on how to operate the completed projects. To achieve the goals and purposes of the Plan, individual projects must be operated as part of a system. Operating manuals encompass both individual projects and the entire system. Agencies, agricultural, environmental, urban utilities, recreational, and urban interest groups, and the public were concerned with ensuring that operating manuals be consistent with the goals and purposes of the Plan. The proposed rule establishes the development of two different types of Operating Manuals. A System Operating Manual will be developed to provide a system- wide water control plan t hat ensures that the operation of individual projects is linked together into a system- wide framework. A Project Operating Manual will be developed for each project. The draft Project Operating Manual will be incorporated into the Project Implementation Report. This connects operation of the project to the expected benefits of the project recommended in the Project Implementation Report. The Project Operating Manual should be consistent with the System Operating Manual. The final Project Operating Manual will be prepared before completion of the operational testing and monitoring phase. K. Sequencing and Scheduling of Projects The Plan consists of 68 components that will be implemented as approximately 45 separate projects, including pilot projects. The ""Final Integrated Feasibility Report and Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement"" dated April 1, 1999, included a sequence and schedule for the Plan. In July 2001, the Corps of Engineers and the South Florida Water Management District updated the sequence and schedule to include updated information and requirements from Congress and the Florida legislature. Agencies, agricultural, environmental, urban utilities, recreational, and urban interest groups, and the public were concerned about ho w projects would be sequenced and scheduled. Some were concerned that the sequencing and schedule ensure that restoration benefits occur early in the implementation process. Others were concerned that other benefits of the Plan would be postponed until very late in the implementation process. The proposed rule establishes a process for developing a Master Implementation Sequencing Plan. The Master Implementation Sequencing Plan will include the schedule and sequencing of projects based on the best funding, technical, contracting, and other information available. The proposed rule provides that projects will be sequenced and scheduled to accelerate system- wide restoration, preservation, and protection benefits while providing for the  10   INITIAL DRAFT REGULATION 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46  DECEMBER 2001  other water- related needs of the region, including water supply and flood protection. However, funding, technical, and other constraints could affect the sequence and schedule of projects. The proposed rule provides that the Master Implementation Sequencing Plan be revised as necessary to incorporate new information such as updated schedules from approved Project Management Plans, the results of pilot projects and other studies, updated funding information, revisions to the Plan, Congressional or other authorization and direction, or information from the adaptive assessment program. It may also be necessary to revise the Master Implementation Sequencing Plan to better achieve the interim goals. L. Adaptive Assessment Program One of the key aspects of implementation of the Plan is adaptive assessment. Adaptive assessment provides the flexibility needed to modify the plan based on new information. The report of the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works on the Water Resources Development Act of 2000 (Senate Report No. 106- 362) describes the intent of the adaptive assessment program: ""The committee does not expect rigid adherence to the Plan as it was submitted to Congress. This result would be inconsistent with the adaptive assessment principles in the Plan. Restoration o f the Everglades is the goal, not adherence to the modeling on which the April, 1999 Plan was based. Instead, the committee expects that the agencies responsible for project implementation report formulation and Plan implementation will seek continuous improvement of the Plan based upon new information, improved modeling, new technology and changed circumstances."" The flexibility offered by the adaptive assessment program is crucial for dealing with the uncertainties of the ecological responses that will occur as the Plan is implemented. The proposed rule establishes an adaptive assessment program to guide implementation. RECOVER will be responsible for carrying out adaptive assessment tasks and for developing necessary procedures to guide adaptive assessment. If undesirable responses are detected, RECOVER will prepare a report with recommendations for correcting the problem. These recommendations could include changes to operations, changes to the Plan, changes to the implementation sequencing or scheduling, or some combination of these. M. Revisions to the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan We anticipate that the Plan will need to be revised periodically to reflect new information or to improve performance based on the results of adaptive assessment. The proposed rule provides that a Comprehensive Plan Modification Report be prepared whenever significant revisions to the Plan are necessary to ensure that the goals and purposes of the Plan are achieved. Therefore, the Comprehensive Plan Modification Report will be an update or supplement to the ""Final Integrated Feasibility Report and Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement"" dated April 1, 1999. After the Comprehensive Plan Modification Report is reviewed and approved by the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works, it will be transmitted to Congress for approval. N. Ensuring Achievement of Project Benefits  11   INITIAL DRAFT REGULATION 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46  DECEMBER 2001  Section 601(f) of the Water Resources Development Act of 2000 (114 Stat. 2686) requires the preparation and approval of Project Impleme ntation Reports prior to implementation of Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan projects. The Act specifies a number of items required to be in a Project Implementation Report, including identification of the appropriate quantity, timing, and distribution of water dedicated and managed for the natural system, and the identification of the amount of water to be reserved or allocated for the natural system. The reservation or allocation of water for the natural system will be implemented under State law. The Secretary of the Army cannot execute a Project Cooperation Agreement for the project until the reservation or allocation is made under State law. ""State law"" includes reservations or allocations of water made by Florida's Water Management Districts under authority of state law. Some groups expressed a view that the Plan required that water be reserved for the natural system on an 80%- 20% basis. These groups rely on the report of the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works on the Water Resources Development Act of 2000 (Senate Report No. 106- 362) that states, "" The Plan contains a general outline of the quantities of water to be produced by each project. According to the Army Corps, 80 percent of the water generated b y the Plan is needed for the natural system in order to attain restoration goals, and 20 percent of the water generated for use in the human environment.... Subject to future authorizations by Congress, the committee fully expects that the water necessary for restoration, currently estimated at 80 percent of the water generated by the Plan, will be reserved or allocated for the benefit of the natural system"" (Emphasis added). Although those percentages were appropriate as an initial estimate for the purpose o f developing the Plan, the regulations anticipate that each Project Implementation Report will evaluate and identify water to be reserved for the natural system, and that the Plan itself will be continually evaluated through adaptive assessment. The needs of the natural system and the water required to be allocated under the Savings Clause may be a greater or less percentage than the initial Plan estimate. Therefore, these regulations do not require that water for each project be strictly allocated on an 80 % 20% basis. For the same reasons, it is not appropriate to establish a fixed allocation of water as an interim goal. Agencies, agricultural, environmental, urban utilities, recreational, and urban interest groups, and the public expressed a number of concerns about the identification of water to be reserved or allocated for the natural system. These concerns were mostly focused on how the identification of water to be reserved or allocated for the natural system, which is a requirement o f the Project Implementation Report, would be coordinated with the actual reservation or allocation process which is conducted under State law. Central to ensuring achievement of the benefits of the Plan is the development of the preCERP baseline. This baseline represents the conditions in the region on the date of enactment of the Water Resources Development Act of 2000 (December 11, 2000). The baseline establishes existing deliveries of water by the Central and Southern Florida Project. The proposed rule provides that each Project Implementation Report consider the loss of pre- CERP baseline water availability in identifying the quantity, timing, and distribution of water to be made available for the natural system by a project comp onent.  12   INITIAL DRAFT REGULATION 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45  DECEMBER 2001  The PIR may also consider other remedial actions, including, but not limited to: whether additional quantity, timing, and distribution of water should be made available by subsequent projects; whether to recommend preparation of a Comprehensive Plan Modification Report; or whether to recommend that the State of Florida and its agencies re- examine the reservation or allocation of water needed under State law in order to meet the needs of the natural system. The Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan was developed as an integrated set of components or projects that are intended to work together to successfully achieve the goals and purposes of the Plan. Although individual projects increase the amount of water available, the effect of an individual project extends far beyond the location of the project. Accordingly, it is important that the identification of water to be reserved for the natural system take into account the synergistic and regional effect of projects. The proposed rule provides that a protocol be developed to provide a uniform system- wide procedure for quantifying water made available by projects and for identifying the water to be reserved for the natural system. The proposed rule also provides direction for the development of the protocol. Some agencies, agricultural, environmental, urban utilities, recreational, and urban interest gr oups, and the public were concerned about potential variations from the predicted availability of water once projects are actually implemented and operated. The proposed rule provides that development of a Comprehensive Plan Modification Report be undertaken to determine the need for revisions to the Plan. The proposed rule also provides that in the interim during preparation of the Project Implementation Report, operation of the project should be consistent with the purposes of the project component as aut horized by Congress. In the absence of specific purposes for a project component in the Congressional authorization, then the operation of a project component generally should be based on providing water in accordance with the following priorities: the first operational priority will be uses transferred from existing legal sources of water, then ""new water"" for restoration of the natural system, and then ""new water"" for other uses of wate r. O. Savings Clause Provisions Many agencies, groups, and the public were concerned about the effects of implementation on existing legal sources of water and on existing levels of flood protection. The report of the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works on the Water Resources Development Act of 2000 (Senate Report No. 106- 362) describes the intent of the savings clause provisions: ""Elimination of existing sources of water supply is barred until new sources of comparable quantity a nd quality of water are available; existing authorized levels of flood protection are maintained; and the water compact among the Seminole Tribe of Florida, the State, and the South Florida Water Management District is specifically preserved. With respect to flood control, the committee intends that implementation of the Plan will not result in significant adverse impact to any person with an existing, legally recognized right to a level of protection against flooding. The committee does not intend that, co nsistent with benefits included in  13   INITIAL DRAFT REGULATION 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46  DECEMBER 2001  the Plan, this bill create any new rights to a level of protection against flooding that is not currently recognized under applicable Federal or State law."" The savings clause provisions of section 601(h)(5)(A) of the Water Resources Development Act of 2000 (114 Stat. 2690) are intended to provide protection to existing legal sources of water. The proposed rule provides that the Project Implementation Report include analyses to determine if the project will cause such a transfer. If the project will cause a transfer, then the Project Implementation report will include an implementation plan that ensures that such transfer will not take place until after the project is constructed and operating as intended. In accordance with the provisions of section 601(h)(5)(B) of the Water Resources Development Act of 2000 (114 Stat. 2690), the proposed rule also provides that the Project Implementation Report include analyses of the existing level of service for flood protection. If the existing level of service would be adversely affected, then the proposed rule provides that the recommended plan be modified to mitigate or eliminate the adverse effect. The proposed rule also allows for the evaluation of increased levels of flood protection, provided that it is consistent with the goals and purposes of the Plan and is practical. P. Interim Goals Section 601(h)(3)(c)(i)(III) of the Water Resources Development Act of 2000 (114 Stat. 2689) requires that interim goals be established to provide a means by which the restoration success of the Plan may be evaluated throughout the restoration process. Progress towards meeting the interim goals is to be reported to Congress as part of the periodic reports required by the Act. While there was widespread agreement among agencies, agricultural, environmental, urban utilities, recreational, and urban interest groups, and the public that interim goals should be established to ensure that the goals and purposes of the Pla n are achieved, there were different views about whether these interim goals should be a part of the programmatic regulations. Some believed that the interim goals needed to be a part of the programmatic regulations to ensure that the goals would be met. Their basis for this was the report of the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works on the Water Resources Development Act of 2000 (Report 106- 362) which states, ""In developing the programmatic regulations, the Federal and State partners should establish interim goals -- expressed in terms of restoration standards-- to provide a means by which the restoration success of the Plan may be evaluated throughout the implementation process. The restoration standards should be quantitative and measurable at specific points in the Plan implementation."" They also believed that goals had to be incorporated into the regulations to enable the public to take part in the process of establishing the goals Others were concerned that the statute specifically required the re gulations to set up the process for establishing interim goals rather than the goals themselves. Some were concerned that placing the interim goals in the programmatic regulations would make goals cumbersome to adopt and amend. Some were concerned that inc orporating the goals themselves into the regulations would suggest that goals were meant to set standards or schedules enforceable in court rather than planning targets, and assessment and reporting tools.  14   INITIAL DRAFT REGULATION 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45  DECEMBER 2001  The proposed rule attempts to balance these comp eting views, while making it clear that interim goals are not intended to be standards or schedules enforceable in court. The proposed rule establishes the process for developing the interim goals. Development of the technical basis for interim goals will be carried out by the interagency Restoration Coordination and Verification (RECOVER) team and includes a number of opportunities for public and agency comment. Interim goals will be memorialized through an agreement signed by the Department of the Army, t he Department of the Interior, and the State of Florida. The periodic reports to Congress that are required by section 601(l) of the Water Resources Development Act of 2000 will include information on progress towards meeting the interim goals. The proposed rule also provides a process for revising the interim goals when necessary. IV. Project Implementation Reports Approved Pursuant to Schedule and Transition Rule Section 601(h)(3)(D) of the Water Resources Development Act of 2000 (114 Stat. 2689) provides a schedule and transition rule for Project Implementation Reports approved before the date of promulgation of the programmatic regulations. The requirement for Project Implementation Reports approved pursuant to the schedule and transition rule is that they be consistent with the Plan. A number of Project Implementation Reports are currently underway, but no Project Implementation Reports have been approved to date. The Project Implementation Report for the Southern Golden Gates Estates project in Collier County is currently scheduled to be completed prior to promulgation of the final rule. If the final Project Implementation Report on Southern Golden Gates Estates is approved before the date of promulgation of the final rule, then the preamble to the final rule will contain a statement concerning the consistency of that Project Implementation Report with the programmatic regulations. The Water Preserve Areas and Indian River Lagoon feasibility studies, which include a number of Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan components, have been underway for some time and are nearing completion. We anticipate that the final feasibility reports will be submitted to Congress later this year. Following promulgation of the final rule, we anticipate preparing Special Project Implementation Reports and submitting them to Congress. The Special Project Implementation Reports will address water quantification and identification of water to be reserved for the natural system using the protocols developed pursuant to these programmatic regulations. V. Concurrence Requirements Section 601(h)(3)(B) of the Water Resources Development Act of 2000 (114 Stat. 2688) requires that the Secretary of the Interior and the Governor provide the Secretary with a written statement of concurrence or nonconcurrence on the proposed programmatic regulations within 180 days from the end of the public comment period. We maintained close coordination with the Department of the Interior and the State of Florida throughout the process for developing the proposed rule. The final rule will include a reference to the  15   INITIAL DRAFT REGULATION 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45  DECEMBER 2001  concurrence or non- concurrence statements of the Secretary of the Interior and the Governor of Florida on the proposed rule. VI. Organization of the Proposed Rule We have organized the proposed rule under four major headings. The first heading provides the purpose and scope of the rule, definitions needed for the rule, and other information required by Section 601(h)(3)(C) of the Water Resources Development Act of 2000 (114 Stat. 2688). The remaining headings were designed to be consistent with the content required by Section 601(h)(3)(C). These headings are: Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan Implementation Processes; Incorporating New Information into the Plan; and Ensuring P rotection of the Natural System Consistent with the Goals and Purposes of the Plan. VII. Public Comments Solicited We solicit comments or suggestions from the public, other concerned governmental agencies, or any other interested party concerning this proposed rule. If you wish to comment on this proposed rule, you may submit your comments and materials by any one of several methods (see ADDRESSES section). If submitting comments by electronic format, please submit them in ASCII file format or Word file format and avoid the use of special characters and any form of encryption. Please include your name and return e- mail address in your e- mail message. Please note that the e- mail address will be closed out at the termination of the public comment period. VIII. Administrative Requirements A. Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.) This rule does not impose any information collection requirements for which OMB approval under the Paperwork Reduction Act is required. Thus, this action is not subject to the Paperwork Reduction Act. B. Executive Order 12866 Under Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735, October 4, 1993), we must determine whether the regulatory action is ""significant"" and therefore subject to review by the Office of Management a nd Budget (OMB) and the requirements of the Executive Order. The Order defines ""significant regulatory action"" as one that is likely to result in a rule that may: (1) Have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more, or adversely affect in a material way the economy, a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local, or Tribal governments or communities; (2) Create a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency; (3) Materially alter the budgetary impact of entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations of recipients thereof; or  16   INITIAL DRAFT REGULATION 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46  DECEMBER 2001  (4) Raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles set forth in the Executive Order. Pursuant to the terms of Executive Order 12866, it has been tentatively determined that this rule is a ""significant regulatory action"" in light of the provisions of paragr aph (4) above. As such, this action will be submitted to OMB for review. Changes made in response to OMB suggestions or recommendations will be documented in the public record. C. Executive Order 13132 Executive Order 13132, entitled ""Federalism"" (64 FR 43255, August 10, 1999), requires us to develop an accountable process to ensure ""meaningful and timely input by State and local officials in the development of regulatory policies that have federalism implications."" ""Policies that have federalism implications"" is defined in the Executive Order to include regulations that have ""substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government."" This rule does not have significant federalism implications. The proposed rule defines the relationships between the Federal and State partners in implementing the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan. The proposed rule is limit ed to implementation of the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan and, therefore, has little incremental impact on State and local governments and their activities. It will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government, as specified in Executive Order 13132. Thus, Executive Order 13132 does not apply to this rule. D. Regulatory Flexibility Act The Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq., as amended by the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act (SBREFA) of 1996) generally requires an agency to prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis of any rule subject to notice- andcomment rulemaking requirements under the Administrative Procedure Act or any other statute unless the agency certifies that the rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small organizations and small governmental jurisdictions. For purposes of assessing the impacts of the proposed rule on small entities, a small entity is defined as: (1) A small business based on SBA size standards; (2) a small governmental jurisdiction that is a government of a city, county, town, school district, or special district with a population of less than 50,000; and (3) a small organization that is any not- for- profit enterprise which is independently owned and operated and is not domina nt in its field. After considering the economic impacts of the proposed rule on small entities, we certify that this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. The proposed rule only establishes processes and governmental relationships that will be used for implementation of the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan. E. Unfunded Mandates Reform Act  17   INITIAL DRAFT REGULATION 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46  DECEMBER 2001  In accordance with the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act (2 U.S.C. 1501 et seq.): (a) This rule, as proposed, will not ""significantly or uniquely"" affect small governments. A Small Government Agency Plan is not required. Small governments will only be affected to the extent that they agree to act as non- Federal sponsor for implementation of projects for the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan. The proposed rule does not establish new or different requirements for non- Federal sponsors for implementation of projects for the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan. (b) This rule, as proposed, will not produce a Federal mandate of $100 million or greater in any year, that is, it is not a ""significant regulatory action"" under the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act. The proposed rule defines processes and relationships between the Federal and State partners in implementing the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan. The proposed rule does not affect the cost sharing requirements for non- Federal sponsors in implementing the Plan and therefore, imposes no new obligations on State or local governments. F. National Technology Transfer and Advancement Act Section 12(d) of the National Technology Transfer and Advancement Act of 1995 (the NTTAA), Public Law 104- 113, section 12(d) (15 U.S.C. 272 note), directs us to use voluntary consensus standards in our regulatory act ivities unless to do so would be inconsistent with applicable law or otherwise impractical. Voluntary consensus standards are technical standards (e.g., materials specifications, test methods, sampling procedures, and business practices) that are developed or adopted by voluntary consensus standards bodies. The NTTAA directs us to provide Congress, through OMB, explanations when we decide not to use available and applicable voluntary consensus standards. This rule does not involve technical standards. There fore, we did not consider the use of any voluntary consensus standards. G. Executive Order 13045 Executive Order 13045, entitled Protection of Children From Environmental Health Risks and Safety Risks (62 FR 19885, April 23, 1997), applies to any rule that: (1) Was initiated after April 21, 1997, or for which a notice of proposed rulemaking was published after April 21, 1998; (2) is determined to be ""economically significant"" as defined under Executive Order 12866, and (3) concerns an environmental hea lth or safety risk that we have reason to believe may have a disproportionate effect on children. If the regulatory action meets all three criteria, we must evaluate the environmental health or safety effects of the planned rule on children, and explain why the planned regulation is preferable to other potentially effective and reasonably feasible alternatives that we considered. This proposed rule is not subject to Executive Order 13045 because it is not an economically significant regulatory action as defined by Executive Order 12866. The proposed rule establishes processes for the implementation of the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan and defines the relationships between the Federal and State partners for implementation. Furthermore, it does not concern an environmental health or safety risk that we have reason to believe may have a disproportionate effect on children. H. Executive Order 13084  18   INITIAL DRAFT REGULATION 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46  DECEMBER 2001  Under Executive Order 13084, we may not issue a regulation that is not required by statute, if it significantly or uniquely affects the communities of Indian Tribal governments and imposes substantial direct compliance costs on those communities, unless the Federal government provides the funds necessary to pay the direct compliance cost incurred by the Tribal governments, or we consult with those governments. If we comply by consulting, Executive Order 13084 requires us to provide the Office of Management and Budget, in a separately identified section of the preamble to the rule, a description of the extent of our prior consultation with representatives of affected Tribal governments, a summary of the nature of their concerns, and a statement supporting the need to issue the regulation. In addition, Executive Order 13084 requires us to develop an effective process permitting elected officials and other representatives of Indian Tribal governments ""to provide meaningful and timely input in the development of regulatory policies on matters that significantly or uniquely affect their communities."" The proposed rule is required by section 601(h)(3) of the Water Resources Development Act of 2000 (114 Stat. 2688). Additionally, the proposed rule does not significantly or uniquely affect the communities of Indian Tribal governments, nor does it impose significant co mpliance costs on them. The proposed rule establishes processes for the implementation of the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan and defines the relationships between the implementing entities. Accordingly, the requirements of section 3(b) of Execut ive Order 13084 do not apply to this rule. I. Executive Order 12630 In accordance with Executive Order 12630 entitled ""Governmental Actions and Interference with Constitutionally Protected Property Rights"", the proposed rule will not effect a taking of pr ivate property or otherwise have taking implications. A takings implication assessment is not required. The proposed rule establishes processes to be used in implementing the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan. J. Civil Justice Reform In accordance with Executive Order 12988, we have determined that the proposed rule does not unduly burden the judicial system and meets the requirements of sections 3(a) and 3(b)(2) of the Order. The proposed rule establishes processes to be used in implementing the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan and defines the relationships between the governmental entities that will implement the Plan. K. Executive Order 13211 On May 18, 2001, the President issued an Executive Order (EO 13211) that applies to regulations that significantly affect energy supply, distribution, and use. Executive Order 13211 requires agencies to prepare Statements of Energy Effects when undertaking certain actions. Because this proposed rule is not expected to significantly affect energy supplies, distribution, or use, this action is not a significant energy action and no Statement of Energy Effects is required. L. Environmental Documentation We have determined that this proposed rule does not constitute a major Federal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment. Therefore, environmental  19   INITIAL DRAFT REGULATION 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46  DECEMBER 2001  documentation under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) is not required for this proposed rule. The Corps of Engineers has prepared appropriate environmental documentatio n, including a Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement, for the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan. Moreover, this proposed regulation establishes requirements for the preparation of appropriate environmental documentation as part of the impleme ntation process. We have identified actions in this regulation which generally require preparation of a NEPA document (either an Environmental Impact Statement or an environmental assessment), or which are categorically excluded from NEPA. Our intent is to reduce controversy over whether NEPA is required for individual actions by taking a systematic look at the kinds of actions needed to implement the Plan, and to apply the principles of 230 of this chapter to Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan activities. Certain individual actions, such as development, adoption or revision of methods or protocols, are listed as categorically excluded. We have determined that development, adoption, or revision of a method or protocol itself would not require NEPA, and that use of the method or protocol could be analyzed under NEPA, if appropriate, in a decision document such as a Project Implementation Report.

The Corps of Engineers and the South Florida Water Management District, in consultation with the Department of the Interior, the Florida Department of Environmental Protection, the Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Florida, the Seminole Tribe of Florida, and other Federal, State, and local agencies, shall develop the pre- CERP baseline to determine the quantity, timing, and distribution of water made available by the existing Central and Southern Florida Project on the date of enactment of section 601 of the Water Resources Development Act of 2000 (114 Stat. 2680). (b) Pre- CERP Baseline Water Availability. To the extent practical, each Project Implementation Report shall consider whether the pre- CERP baseline quantity of water available for the natural system is still available for the natural system. If not, the Project Implementation Report shall consider the loss of pre- CERP baseline water availability in identifying the quantity, timing, and distribution of water to be made available for the natural system by a project component. The Project Implementation Report may also consider other remedial actions, including, but not limited to: whether additional quantity, timing, and distribution of water should be made available by subsequent projects; whether to recommend preparation of a Comprehensive Plan Modification Report as described in 385.28; or whether to recommend that the State of Florida and its agencies re- examine the reservation or allocation of water needed under State law in order to meet the needs of the natural system. (c) Identification of Water to be Reserved or Allocated for the Natural System in the Project Implementation Report. (1) Each Project Implementation Report shall ident ify the appropriate quantity, timing, and distribution of water dedicated and managed for the natural system and shall identify the amount of water to be reserved or allocated for the natural system. (2) The Corps of Engineers and the South Florida Wate r Management District shall develop and adopt a protocol in accordance with 385.8 for preparing Project Implementation Reports that identifies the appropriate quantity, timing, and distribution of water dedicated and managed for the natural system and ide ntifies the amount of water to be reserved or allocated for the natural system. (i) Project Implementation Reports approved before the date of promulgation of these programmatic regulations or the adoption of the protocol may use whatever method that, in the District Engineer's discretion, and in cooperation with the South Florida Water Management District and the State of Florida, is deemed appropriate. (ii) The protocol shall take into account the natural fluctuation of water made available in any given year; the objective of restoration of the natural system; the need for protection of existing uses transferred to new sources; the need to maintain existing levels of flood protection; contingencies for drought protection; and the need to identify the additional quantity, timing, and distribution of water made available by a new  50   INITIAL DRAFT REGULATION 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46  DECEMBER 2001  project component while maintaining a system- wide perspective on the amount of water made available by the Plan. (iii) The protocol may express the quantity, timing and distribution of water in stage duration curves; exceedance frequency curves; quantities available in average, wet, and dry years; or any other method which, in the District Engineer's discretion, and in cooperation with the South Florida Water Management District and the State of Florida, is deemed appropriate. (iv) The protocol shall provide for re- examination of actual performance after a project component has been in operation for an appropriate period of time. (d) Variations from Predicted Availability of Water. If, after re- examination of the actual performance of a project component, the Corps of Engineers and the South Florida Water Management District judge that the actual long- term performance of a project component will not meet the quantity, timing, or distribution of water anticipated to be made available by the Project Implementation Report, then: (1) the Corps of Engineers and the South Florida Water Management District shall determine if revisions to the Plan are necessary. If so, then the Corps of Engineers and the South Florida Water Management District shall prepare a Comprehensive Plan Modification Report in accordance with 385.28; and (2) in the interim during preparation of this Project Implementation Report, operation of the project shall be consistent with the p urposes of the project component as authorized by Congress. In the absence of specific purposes for a project component in the Congressional authorization, then the operation of a project component generally shall be based on providing water in accordance with the following priorities: (i) uses transferred from an existing legal source of water to the new source made available by that project, (ii) new water for restoration of the natural system, and (iii) new water for other uses of water. 385.31 Compliance with Savings Clause Provisions. (a) Elimination or Transfer of Existing Legal Sources of Water. Project Implementation Reports shall include analyses to determine if existing legal sources of water are to be transferred as a result of project implementation. If implementation of the project shall cause a transfer of existing legal sources of water, then the Project Implementation Report shall include an implementation plan that ensures that such transfer shall not occur until after the project is constructed and operating as intended. (b) Existing Level of Service for Flood Protection. (1) The level of service for flood protection that is in existence on the date of enactment of section 601 of the Water Resources Development Act of 2000 (114 Stat. 2680) and in accordance with applicable law shall be determined. To the extent practical, the pre- CERP baseline shall be used in determining the existing level of service for flood protection. (2) The plan recommended in the Project Implementation Report shall be evaluated to determine if the level of service for flood protection that is in existence on  51   INITIAL DRAFT REGULATION 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45  DECEMBER 2001  the date of enactment of section 601 of the Water Resources Development Act of 2000 (114 Stat. 2680) and in accordance with applicable law will b e reduced by implementation of the recommended plan. If so, then the recommended plan shall be modified as necessary to ensure that adverse effects on the existing level of service are mitigated or eliminated. (3) In developing alternative plans for eva luation during the preparation of the Project Implementation Report, the Corps of Engineers and the non- Federal sponsor may consider opportunities to provide greater levels of service or to provide flood protection in locations where there is currently no flood protection, provided that greater levels of service or the provision of flood protection is consistent with the goals and purposes of the Plan and the provisions of section 601(f)(2)(B) of the Water Resources Development Act of 2000 (114 Stat.2686). 385.32 Interim Goals .

Proposed rule.  SUMMARY: The Army Corps of Engineers proposes to establish programmatic regulations for the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan. Congress approved the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan in section 601 of the Water Resources Development Act of 2000, which was enacted into law on December 11, 2000. The Act requires the Secretary of the Army to promulgate programmatic regulations within two years to ensure that the goals and purposes of the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan are achieved. We have developed these proposed regulations in response to that statutory requirement. The proposed regulations establish processes and procedures that will guide the Army Corps of Engineers and its partners in the implementation of the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan. DATES: We will accept comments until October 1, 2002. ADDRESSES: If you wish to comment on the proposed regulations, you may submit your comments by any one of several methods: 1.

You may also access the programmatic regulations web page at: http://www.evergladesplan.org/pm/ progr_regs.shtml/.  I. Background Section 601(h)(3) of the Water Resources Development Act of 2000, Public Law 106541 (114 Stat. 2688) (hereinafter ``WRDA 2000'') requires the Secretary of the Army, after notice and opportunity for public comment, to promulgate regulations to ensure that the goals and purposes of the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan (the Plan) are achieved. These regulations implement this provision and establish the administrative structure for carrying out the Plan. They establish a process: for the development of Project Implementation Reports, Project Cooperation Agreements, and Operating Manuals that will ensure that the goals and the objectives of the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan (CERP) are achieved; to ensure that new information resulting from changes or unforeseen circumstances, new scientific or technical information or information that is developed through the principles of adaptive management contained in the Plan, and future authorized changes to the Plan will be integrated into the implementation of the Plan; and to ensure the protection of the natural system consistent with the goals and purposes of the Plan, including the establishment of interim goals to provide a means by which the restoration success of the plan will be evaluated throughout the implementation process. In general, the programmatic regulations envision that the goals and purposes of the Plan will be achieved through the development of projectspecific and system-wide measures. Project specific measures include but are not limited to project implementation reports, project cooperation agreements, operating manuals, and design documentation reports. The more generally applicable system-wide measures include, but are not limited to, the development of guidance memoranda, system-wide performance measures, the Master Implementation Sequencing Plan, interim goals, and targets for evaluating progress towards achieving other waterrelated needs of the region, including water supply and flood protection. The interim goals and targets for other waterrelated needs are of special significance. They establish incremental targets to evaluate progress toward the expected level of performance of the Plan and are used to monitor overall progress toward meeting the goals and purposes of the Plan. Taken together, the project specific and system-wide measures form the foundation of the Plan and are  critical to the successful restoration of the South Florida ecosystem. The South Florida ecosystem is a nationally and internationally unique and important natural resource. It is also a resource in peril, having been severely impacted by human activities for over a hundred years. The Central and Southern Florida Project extends from south of Orlando to the Florida Keys and is composed of a regional network of canals, levees, water storage areas, and water control structures. First authorized by Congress in 1948, the project serves multiple purposes. The authorized purposes of the project include flood control, regional water supply for agricultural and urban areas, prevention of salt water intrusion, water supply to Everglades National Park, preservation of fish and wildlife, recreation, and navigation. While fulfilling these authorized purposes, the project has had unintended adverse effects on the unique natural environment that constitutes the Everglades and South Florida ecosystem. In 1996, the Army Corps of Engineers was directed to develop a comprehensive plan to restore and preserve south Florida's natural ecosystem, while enhancing water supplies and maintaining flood protection. The resulting plan, which was submitted to Congress on July 1, 1999, is called the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan. The overarching goal of the Plan is the restoration, preservation, and protection of the South Florida ecosystem while providing for other water-related needs of the region such as flood protection and water supply. The Plan contains 68 major components that involve creation of approximately 217,000 acres of reservoirs and wetland-based water treatment areas, wastewater reuse plants, seepage management, and removal of levees and canals in natural areas. These components vastly increase storage and water supply for the natural system, as well as for urban and agricultural needs, while maintaining existing Central and Southern Florida Project purposes. The Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan will restore more natural flows of water, including sheet flow; improve water quality; and establish more natural hydroperiods in the South Florida ecosystem. Improvements to native flora and fauna, including those that benefit threatened and endangered species, are expected to occur as a result of the restoration of hydrologic conditions. In enacting section 601 of WRDA 2000, Congress approved the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan as a framework for modifications to  VerDate Jul<25>2002  17:25 Aug 01, 2002  Jkt 197001  PO 00000  Frm 00002  Fmt 4701  Sfmt 4702  E:\FR\FM\02AUP3.SGM  pfrm17  PsN: 02AUP3   Federal Register / Vol. 67, No. 149 / Friday, August 2, 2002 / Proposed Rules the Central and Southern Florida Project. Section 601 of WRDA 2000 contains a variety of provisions associated with implementation of the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan, including an authorization for the construction of four pilot projects and ten initial projects of the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan. Section 601(h) of WRDA 2000 states that ``the overarching objective of the Plan is the restoration, preservation, and protection of the South Florida ecosystem while providing for other water-related needs of the region, including water supply and flood protection.'' This subsection directs that the Plan be implemented to ensure the protection of water quality in, the reduction of the loss of fresh water from, and the improvement of the environment of the South Florida Ecosystem. Implementation of the Plan also seeks to achieve and maintain the benefits to the natural system and human environment described in the Plan. Section 601(h)(2) of WRDA 2000 requires the President and Governor to enter into a binding agreement ensuring that the water generated by the Plan will be made available to the natural system. The President and Governor signed this agreement on January 9, 2002. The agreement specifies that the State will ensure by regulation, or other appropriate means, that water made available by each project of the Plan will not be permitted for a consumptive use or otherwise made unavailable by the State until such time as sufficient reservations of water for restoration of the natural system are made under State law in accordance with the Project Implementation Report for that project and consistent with the Plan. This agreement also specifies that the State will monitor and assess the continuing effectiveness of reservations as long as the project is authorized to achieve the goals and objectives of the Plan. Section 601(h)(3) of WRDA 2000 requires that the Secretary of the Army, after notice and opportunity for public comment, and with the concurrence of the Governor of Florida and the Secretary of the Interior, and consultation with the Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Florida, the Seminole Tribe of Florida, the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, the Secretary of Commerce, and other Federal, State, and local agencies, issue programmatic regulations within two years of the date of enactment of WRDA 2000 to ensure that the goals and purposes of the Plan are achieved. The proposed regulations are a specific response to the requirements of this section. Section 601(h)(4) of WRDA 2000 describes the project specific assurance requirements for Project Implementation Reports, Project Cooperation Agreements, and Operating Manuals. Finally, section 601(h)(5) contains a Savings Clause that provides protection for existing legal sources of water that will be eliminated or transferred due to project implementation and provides for maintenance of the level of service for flood protection that is in existence on the date of enactment and in accordance with applicable law. II. Process for Developing the Proposed Regulations The Army developed the proposed regulations through an open and inclusive process that involved numerous meetings, briefings, and discussions with other Federal, State, and local agencies; the Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Florida and the Seminole Tribe of Florida; agricultural, environmental, urban utilities, recreational, and urban interest groups; and the public. Briefings on the programmatic regulations were provided to the Governing Board of the South Florida Water Management District and its Water Resources Advisory Commission and the South Florida Ecosystem Restoration Task Force and its Working Group. In addition, programmatic regulations web pages were developed and posted on the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan web site (http:// www.evergladesplan.org). The web site was used to disseminate information about the programmatic regulations and to provide a place for individuals and organizations to submit comments electronically during the development of the programmatic regulations. This was designed to identify the major concerns of the agencies and various groups, prior to publishing the proposed regulations and soliciting formal public comment. The Army held an opening round of meetings with agencies, interest groups, and the public in May and June 2001. The purpose of these meetings was to discuss the process that would be used to develop the programmatic regulations and to solicit comments on the major issues and concerns that should be addressed in developing the regulations. Following this initial round of meetings, we developed a draft outline of the programmatic regulations. We then held a second round of meetings in September and October 2001 with agencies, interest groups, and the public to solicit comments on the draft outline.  50541  We also consulted with the Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Florida and the Seminole Tribe of Florida, and sought their comments on the outline. After the second round of meetings, we developed an initial draft of the programmatic regulations. We distributed this initial draft to the public on December 28, 2001, and allowed for informal public comment until February 15, 2002. We then held meetings with agencies, tribes, and interest groups, to discuss the initial draft. We also received written comments on the initial draft that we posted on the programmatic regulations web site. In addition, the Water Resources Advisory Commission formed a subcommittee on the programmatic regulations. The subcommittee met several times to discuss issues concerning the initial draft and potential solutions to these issues. The South Florida Ecosystem Restoration Task Force also met several times after the release of the initial draft to discuss the programmatic regulations. Finally, we developed the proposed regulations after considering all of the information received at the meetings, as well as written comments that were received from agencies, interest groups, and the public. III. Major Issues Addressed in Developing the Programmatic Regulations A. General As discussed, we held numerous meetings with agencies, tribes, interest groups, and the public. The initial draft regulations released in December 2001 prompted a number of written comments by agencies, tribes, interest groups, and the public. The major issues identified in those comments and how we considered the comments in developing the proposed rule are described in the following sections. B. References to Senate Committee Report Language A number of comments concerned referring to the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee Report (Senate Report No. 106362) in the preamble to the proposed regulations. Some commenters believed that the Senate Report sets forth guidance for implementing the Plan and fulfilling the assurances provisions of section 601(h) of WRDA 2000. Others expressed the opinion that Senate Committee Report 106362 carries no legislative weight since the bill discussed in Senate Committee Report 106362 differs in several critical areas from the final version of the bill adopted by the full United States Senate. We have referred  VerDate Jul<25>2002  17:25 Aug 01, 2002  Jkt 197001  PO 00000  Frm 00003  Fmt 4701  Sfmt 4702  E:\FR\FM\02AUP3.SGM  pfrm17  PsN: 02AUP3   50542  Federal Register / Vol. 67, No. 149 / Friday, August 2, 2002 / Proposed Rules plant communities that form a gradient from aquatic communities to uplands. Our proposed definition also envisions using the principles of adaptive management to seek continuous improvement of the Plan based upon new information resulting from changed or unforeseen circumstances, new scientific or technical information, or information developed through the adaptive assessment principles contained in the Plan, or future authorized changes to the Plan that are integrated into the implementation of the Plan. In adopting this definition, we recognize that the Plan envisions the recovery and maintenance of certain important ecological components and patterns that are thought to have characterized the natural system. Achievement of these attributes is expected to result in the overall improvement of the environment of the South Florida ecosystem, including improvements to native flora and fauna, including threatened and endangered species; restoring the presence of key species in historic habitats; promoting a pattern of plant communities that form a gradient from aquatic communities to uplands; and providing habitat within the Everglades natural system to the species that inhabit the Everglades. These improvements are accomplished generally by increasing water storage and water supply for the Everglades natural system; restoring more natural flows of water, including sheet flow; establishing more natural hydroperiods, including wet and dry season cycles, natural recession rates, surface water depth patterns, and, in coastal areas, salinity and mixing patterns; and protecting water quality for the Everglades natural system as described in the Plan. It is important to understand that the ``restored'' Everglades of the future will be different from any version of the Everglades that has existed in the past. While it will be significantly healthier than the current system, it will not completely match the pre-drainage system. The irreversible physical changes made to the ecosystem make a complete match impossible. The restored Everglades will be smaller and somewhat differently arranged than the historic ecosystem. However, it will have recovered those essential hydrological and biological characteristics that defined the original Everglades and made it unique among the world's wetlands systems. It will evoke the wildness and richness of the former Everglades. D. Partnership With the State of Florida and With Others Implementation of the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan will require an effective partnership between the Federal and State governments. The State of Florida has established a trust fund, the Save Our Everglades Trust Fund, to pay for a significant portion of the non-Federal sponsor's share of implementation of the Plan and the South Florida Water Management District will serve as the non-Federal sponsor for implementing many of the projects of the Plan. Section 601 of WRDA 2000 recognizes the importance of this constructive relationship and further encourages this partnership. The proposed regulations promote the implementation of the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan by defining the processes and procedures needed to accomplish the necessary planning, design, construction, and operation of the projects authorized pursuant to the Plan. In addition, the proposed regulations establish a process of adaptive management where completed projects are monitored and assessed and changes to the Plan, its operations, or the schedule and sequence of projects are considered as appropriate to ensure that the goals and purposes of the Plan are achieved. The processes and requirements included in the proposed regulations also were developed to take into account the interests of the South Florida Water Management District, the State of Florida, or other non-Federal sponsors as the Plan is implemented. The proposed regulations also recognize that the non-Federal sponsor for some projects of the Plan will be governmental entities other than the South Florida Water Management District. E. Consultation The implementation of the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan is the responsibility of the Corps of Engineers and the non-Federal sponsor; however, successful implementation of the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan requires not just the involvement of the implementing agencies, but also extensive involvement by other Federal, State, local agencies, and the Tribes. The proposed regulations envision that the implementing agencies will consult with the Department of the Interior, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Department of Commerce, the Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Florida, the Seminole Tribe of Florida, the Florida Department of Environmental Protection, and other Federal, State, and  to the Senate Report in the proposed regulations, like any other part of the history of the Plan, where we believe it may be helpful to understanding the statute or the issues involved in interpreting or implementing the statute. C. Defining Restoration Many comments concerned the value of defining restoration in the regulation. Some commenters expressed the view that a definition is needed in order to better define what is meant by the phrase ``restoration, preservation, and protection of the South Florida ecosystem'' used in section 601 of WRDA 2000. Some commenters maintained that the Plan is only a framework and that Congress expected the implementing agencies to propose improvements to the Plan's goal of restoration through a regular process of adaptive management. These commenters believed that a comprehensive definition of restoration, including environmental and ecological recovery of the natural system, is needed to guide the process. While recognizing the theoretical merits of these views, other commenters felt that this concept of restoration was too open-ended. These commenters believed that Congress adopted a specific framework for restoration in enacting WRDA 2000 and that framework was set forth in the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan. They maintained that the restoration authorized by this Plan, while extensive, does not envision restoring the Everglades to its natural condition before the intervention of humans. For the purposes of this regulation, we have adopted a middle ground between these two perspectives. We have defined the term ``restoration'' to mean the level of recovery and protection described in the plan that was approved by Congress in enacting WRDA 2000 as a framework for hydrologic restoration, and any future Congressional amendments to that framework. However, we have also highlighted in the definition that the Plan is designed to deliver water to and improve water quality in the natural system so that it once again exhibits and sustains essential physical and ecological characteristics that defined the pre-drainage South Florida ecosystem, including more natural hydropatterns, and that these hydrological modifications are a precursor to improvements to native flora and fauna, restoration of key habitats, and promotion of a pattern of  VerDate Jul<25>2002  17:25 Aug 01, 2002  Jkt 197001  PO 00000  Frm 00004  Fmt 4701  Sfmt 4702  E:\FR\FM\02AUP3.SGM  pfrm17  PsN: 02AUP3   Federal Register / Vol. 67, No. 149 / Friday, August 2, 2002 / Proposed Rules local agencies as part of the planning and implementation process. The consultation provisions ensure that these interested parties are appropriately involved with the Corps of Engineers and the non-Federal sponsor in implementing, evaluating, and adapting the Plan. The consultation provisions contemplate a timely exchange of views between parties. In other words, consultation is not to be used as a de facto veto power. Similar to the considerations for setting time limits for consulting under NEPA (40 CFR 1501.8), the regulations envision that the Corps of Engineers and the South Florida Water Management District may set reasonable limits on the amount of time for consultation, giving due consideration to the size of the proposed action, the degree to which relevant information is known or obtainable, the degree to which the action is controversial, the state of the art of analytical techniques, the number of persons affected, the consequences of delay, and other time limits imposed on the agency by law, regulations, or executive order. F. Amount of Detail in the Proposed Regulations Many comments addressed the degree of detail in the regulations. Some believed that the programmatic regulations should be very detailed, specific, and prescriptive. Others believed that the programmatic regulations should be more general. Some commenters also expressed concern that the Federal regulations not infringe on the sovereignty of the State of Florida or its right to allocate its water resources. Others sought to ensure that the regulations safeguard the Federal interest and investment in restoration, preservation, and protection of the South Florida ecosystem, including Federal properties such as national parks and wildlife refuges. The proposed regulations attempt to address these concerns and provide guidance in implementing the Plan. We recognize that more detailed guidance memoranda will be needed to assist the implementation of the Plan. We have determined that the guidance memoranda should not be included in the programmatic regulations because they will be very technical, and are intended to provide internal guidance to the implementing agencies, and also because they still are in development. This decision is consistent with the view of some who felt that including the guidance memoranda in the regulations was incompatible with rule-making procedures because of the changing nature of the adaptive management process. These commenters were concerned that if guidance memoranda were included in these regulations, every revision to them would require us to initiate a rulemaking process. We expect that revisions may occur frequently for some of these procedures, particularly during the early stages of implementation of the Plan. The programmatic regulations contemplate that the guidance memoranda be developed six months after the effective date of the final rule published in the Federal Register or December 31, 2003, whichever is sooner, with the concurrence of the Secretary of the Interior and the Governor. Even though we are not including the guidance memoranda in the regulations, we believe that the public should have an opportunity to review and comment on them in view of its interest in these matters. Accordingly, the programmatic regulations envision that we will provide a notice of availability of the guidance memoranda in the Federal Register and seek public comments before they are completed. After they are completed, the Corps of Engineers will consider during the next review and revision of the programmatic regulations, whether or not a particular guidance memorandum that has been completed, is appropriate for inclusion in the regulations. G. Restoration Coordination and Verification (RECOVER) Many comments focused on the role of RECOVER in implementing the Plan. Some of the commenters expressed concerns about how best to integrate individual projects into the Plan to ensure that the goals and purposes of the Plan are achieved. Others articulated concerns about the need to use the best scientific information available. Finally, some urged that RECOVER also focus on achieving the other water-related needs provided for in the Plan such as water supply and flood protection, along with restoration benefits. RECOVER is an interdisciplinary, interagency scientific and technical team that is described in the Plan. The proposed regulations recognize that the Restoration Coordination and Verification (RECOVER) team already is in place and envision using RECOVER to ensure that a system-wide perspective is applied and that the best available scientific and technical information will be used during the implementation, evaluation, and adaptation of the Plan. The Corps of Engineers and the South Florida Water Management District will oversee the activities of RECOVER. The  50543  regulations also recognize the key role of the Department of the Interior in RECOVER because of its extensive experience in managing the Everglades National Park, and provide an important role for the Department in the Leadership Group of RECOVER, along with the Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Florida, the Seminole Tribe of Indians, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the Florida Department of Environmental Protection, and other Federal, State and local agencies as appropriate. While RECOVER is not a policy making body, the regulations outline a series of specific scientific and technical responsibilities for RECOVER that will assist the implementing agencies (the Corps of Engineers and the South Florida Water Management District) in achieving the goals and purposes of the Plan, particularly restoration of the natural system. RECOVER will be responsible for, among other things, developing systemwide performance measures for consideration by the Corps of Engineers and South Florida Water Management District, in evaluating projects in achieving the system-wide goals and purposes of the Plan, preparing Project Implementation Reports, developing and recommending proposals for a system-wide monitoring plan, conducting assessment activities for the adaptive management program, considering proposed revisions to the Plan, and developing recommendations for interim goals. The proposed regulations memorialize many of the activities already underway by RECOVER. The proposed regulations make it clear that RECOVER is a scientific and technical team. Documents prepared by RECOVER are not self-executing and must be reviewed, discussed, revised, and/or approved by responsible management officials of the Corps of Engineers and the South Florida Water Management District, in consultation with the Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Florida, the Seminole Tribe of Indians, the U.S. Department of the Interior, the U.S. Department of Commerce, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the Florida Department of Environmental Protection, and other Federal, State and local agencies as appropriate prior to implementation of management responses based on the results and findings contained therein. H. Independent Scientific Review Some commenters emphasized the need to maintain the system-wide focus of the Plan during implementation and felt that a mechanism must be developed to ensure that the best and  VerDate Jul<25>2002  17:25 Aug 01, 2002  Jkt 197001  PO 00000  Frm 00005  Fmt 4701  Sfmt 4702  E:\FR\FM\02AUP3.SGM  pfrm17  PsN: 02AUP3   50544  Federal Register / Vol. 67, No. 149 / Friday, August 2, 2002 / Proposed Rules resource needs for final design and construction of the project.  most current scientific information be used throughout implementation. Other commenters also expressed the view that an independent entity should be responsible for reviewing the science used to support the implementation of the Plan. The regulations recognize that, as required by Section 601(j) of WRDA 2000, an independent scientific review panel should be established. The proposed regulations do not establish this panel, but provide for its establishment. The regulations include provisions for cooperating with the panel, considering the panel's advice, and responding to the panel's recommendations. I. Project Implementation Reports Section 601 of WRDA 2000 establishes a new type of reporting document called a Project Implementation Report to bridge the gap between the conceptual level of detail in the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan and the detail needed for project design. Section 601(h)(4)(A) of WRDA 2000 specifies a number of items required to be in a Project Implementation Report, including identification of the appropriate quantity, timing, and distribution of water dedicated and managed for the natural system, and the identification of the amount of water to be reserved or allocated for the natural system. Some comments focused on the need to create a clearly defined process for the development of Project Implementation Reports, and, in particular, the formulation and evaluation of individual projects of the Plan. The report of the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works on the Water Resources Development Act of 2000 (Senate Report No. 106362) defines Project Implementation Reports as follows: The project implementation report is a new type of reporting document, similar to a General Reevaluation Report in that it will contain additional project formulation and evaluation. The project implementation report also will contain General Design Memorandum level of detail, or higher, for engineering and design. Some of the tasks associated with the preparation of the project implementation report will include: surveys and mapping; geotechnical analyses; flood damage assessment; real estate analyses; and preparation of supplemental National Environmental Policy Act documents. The project implementation reports will bridge the gap between the programmatic-level design contained in the Plan and the detailed design necessary to proceed to construction. Furthermore, each project implementation report will be accompanied by a Project Management Plan, which will detail schedules, funding requirements, and  The proposed regulations provide guidance for the development of Project Implementation Reports. They describe the requirements of a Project Implementation Report, including providing information required by the State of Florida for the participation of the non-Federal sponsor in the implementation of various components of the Plan. These requirements are set forth in Florida Statutes sections 373.1501 and 373.470, which specify the information that must be available before State agencies can participate in implementation of CERP projects. The proposed regulations contemplate that the Project Implementation Report will contain performance evaluations of alternatives in achieving the systemwide goals and purposes of the Plan, interim goals, and targets for progress toward other water-related needs. The Project Implementation Report also will include evaluations designed to ensure, to the extent practicable and consistent with the system-wide goals and purposes of the Plan, that the project delivers benefits, including benefits to the natural system, that would justify the project, in the context of the then existing Central and Southern Florida Project as modified by any CERP components that have already been implemented. The regulations also envision the development of a guidance memorandum that describes the major tasks necessary to develop a Project Implementation Report and an outline for the content of the Project Implementation Report. Finally, the regulations provide for development of a guidance memorandum establishing procedures for the formulation and evaluation of projects. J. Project Cooperation Agreements The Project Cooperation Agreement is the legal agreement between the Department of the Army and the nonFederal sponsor that must be executed before a project can be constructed. Section 601(h) of WRDA 2000 requires that the Secretary not execute a Project Cooperation Agreement until the State has reserved or allocated water for the natural system under State law as described in the Project Implementation Report. Some commenters questioned how the reservation or allocation would be made in accordance with the Project Implementation Report and how the Project Cooperation Agreement would verify this allocation of reservation had, in fact, been made. These commenters recommended that a guidance memorandum be developed to outline  how the verification would occur. Others commenters were concerned that the Federal government not infringe on the State's authority under state law to make and revise reservations as necessary. We agree that a guidance memorandum should be developed that outlines how Project Implementation Reports will identify how the appropriate quantity, timing and distribution of water dedicated and managed for the natural system will be determined, and how they will identify the amount of water that is to be reserved or allocated for the natural system in accordance with the provisions of WRDA 2000. The proposed regulations state that the Project Cooperation Agreement must include a finding that the reservation or allocation has been made by the State as required by Section 601(h) of WRDA 2000. This will provide the assurances regarding the reservation and Project Implementation Report that Congress intended without infringing on the State's right to reserve or allocate water under State law. In addition, the regulations further specify that the Project Cooperation Agreement (PCA) include a provision that any change to the reservation or allocation of water for the natural system made under State law shall require an amendment to the PCA. Further, the Secretary shall verify, in consultation with the South Florida Water Management District, the Florida Department of Environmental Protection, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Department of Commerce, the Seminole Tribe of Florida, the Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Florida, and other Federal, State, and local agencies that the revised reservation or allocation continues to provide for an appropriate quantity, timing and distribution of water dedicated and managed for the natural system after considering any changed circumstances or information since completion of the Project Implementation Report. Finally, the proposed regulations recognize that the Project Cooperation Agreement must include several provisions required by the savings clause of Section 601(h)(5) of WRDA 2000. Accordingly, the Project Cooperation Agreement includes a provision that prohibits the Corps of Engineers and the non-Federal sponsor from eliminating or transferring existing legal sources of water until a new source of comparable quantity and quality is available as that available on the date of enactment of WRDA 2000. Similarly, in satisfaction of the savings clause requirements, the regulations specify  VerDate Jul<25>2002  17:25 Aug 01, 2002  Jkt 197001  PO 00000  Frm 00006  Fmt 4701  Sfmt 4702  E:\FR\FM\02AUP3.SGM  pfrm17  PsN: 02AUP3   Federal Register / Vol. 67, No. 149 / Friday, August 2, 2002 / Proposed Rules that a Project Cooperation Agreement must include a provision that existing levels of service for flood protection: (1) On the date of enactment of WRDA 2000; and (2) in accordance with applicable law, not be reduced. K. Operating Manuals Operating Manuals provide guidance on how projects are to be operated to ensure that the goals and purposes of the Plan are achieved. To achieve the goals and purposes of the Plan, individual projects must be operated as part of a system. Some commenters sought to ensure that Operating Manuals prepared for individual projects take into account the system-wide purposes of the Plan. Accordingly, the proposed regulations envision the development of two kinds of Operating Manuals. In addition to Project Operating Manuals, a System Operating Manual will be developed to provide a system-wide plan for operating projects and other C&SF Project features to ensure that individual facilities are linked together in a system-wide framework. The regulations view Project Operating Manuals as supplements to the System Operating Manual, presenting aspects of the project not common to the system. The proposed regulations contemplate that a Project Operating Manual will be developed for each project. A draft Project Operating Manual will be included as an appendix in the Project Implementation Report. This will connect the operation of the project to the expected benefits of the project recommended in the Project Implementation Report. The final Project Operating Manual is to be prepared as soon as possible after completion of the operational testing and monitoring phase of the project. L. Sequencing and Scheduling of Projects The Plan consists of 68 components that will be implemented as approximately 45 separate projects, including pilot projects. The ``Final Integrated Feasibility Report and Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement'' dated April 1, 1999, included a sequence and schedule for implementation of the Plan. In July 2001, the Corps of Engineers and the South Florida Water Management District updated the sequence and schedule to incorporate updated information and requirements from Congress and the Florida legislature. The sequence and schedule of projects was the subject of many comments. Some commenters sought to ensure that the sequencing and schedule of projects would produce restoration benefits early in the implementation process. Others were apprehensive of this early focus on restoration benefits and were concerned that other water-related needs of the region as provided for in the Plan would be postponed until late in the implementation process. The proposed regulations establish a process for developing a Master Implementation Sequencing Plan and specify that projects will be sequenced and scheduled to maximize the achievement of the goals and purposes of the Plan, including the achievement of the interim goals at the earliest possible time, to the extent practical given scientific, technical, funding, contracting, and other constraints. The Master Implementation Sequencing Plan will also provide for sequencing and scheduling of projects to ensure, to the extent practicable and consistent with the system-wide goals of the Plan, that each project delivers benefits, including benefits to the natural system, that would justify the project, in the context of the then existing Central and Southern Florida Project as modified by any CERP components that have already been implemented. The Master Implementation Sequencing Plan will base the sequence and schedule of projects on the best scientific, technical, funding, contracting, and other information available. The proposed regulations also envision that the Master Implementation Sequencing Plan will be revised as necessary to integrate new information such as updated schedules from Project Management Plans, the results of pilot projects and other studies, updated funding information, revisions to the Plan, Congressional or other authorization and direction, or information from the adaptive management program, including achievement of the expected performance level of the Plan and the interim goals. M. Adaptive Management Program One of the key components of the Plan is adaptive management. Adaptive management provides the opportunity to improve the design and performance of the Plan based on new information. The report of the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works on WRDA 2000 (Senate Report No. 106 362) describes the intent of the adaptive management program: The committee does not expect rigid adherence to the Plan as it was submitted to Congress. This result would be inconsistent with the adaptive management principles in the Plan. Restoration of the Everglades is the goal, not adherence to the modeling on which the April, 1999 Plan was based.  50545  Instead, the committee expects that the agencies responsible for project implementation report formulation and Plan implementation will seek continuous improvement of the Plan based upon new information, improved modeling, new technology and changed circumstances.  The regulations define adaptive management as the process of improving the understanding of the natural and human systems in the South Florida ecosystem, specifically as these understandings pertain to the goals and purposes of the Plan, and to ensure continuous improvement of the Plan reflective of new information resulting from changed or unforeseen circumstances, new scientific or technical information, or information developed through the adaptive assessment principles contained in the Plan, or future authorized changes to the Plan. The opportunity for performance improvement offered by the adaptive management program is crucial for dealing with the uncertainties of the ecological responses that will occur as the Plan is implemented. The proposed regulations establish an adaptive management program to guide implementation of the Plan and recognize the importance of assessment reports to this process. The proposed regulations specify that the implementing agencies will use assessment reports to seek continuous improvement in the Plan. The proposed regulations provide that in considering how the Plan may be improved, the Corps of Engineers and non-Federal project sponsor specifically consider modifying the design or operational plan for a project of the Plan not yet implemented; modifying the sequence or schedule for implementation of the Plan; adding new components to the Plan or deleting components not yet implemented; removing or modifying a component of the Plan already in place; or a combination of any of these actions. RECOVER will be responsible for carrying out these assessment tasks and submitting them to the Corps and the South Florida Water Management District for review. N. Revisions to the Plan We anticipate that the Plan will need to be revised periodically as part of the adaptive management program to reflect new information and to improve performance. The proposed regulations provide that a Comprehensive Plan Modification Report be prepared whenever significant revisions to the Plan are necessary to ensure that the goals and purposes of the Plan are achieved. The Comprehensive Plan Modification Report will be prepared  VerDate Jul<25>2002  17:25 Aug 01, 2002  Jkt 197001  PO 00000  Frm 00007  Fmt 4701  Sfmt 4702  E:\FR\FM\02AUP3.SGM  pfrm17  PsN: 02AUP3   50546  Federal Register / Vol. 67, No. 149 / Friday, August 2, 2002 / Proposed Rules actually allocated to meet the needs of the natural system and the water allocated under the Savings Clause may be greater or less than the initial Plan estimate. Therefore, the regulations do not contemplate that water will be strictly allocated on an 80%20% basis, either system-wide or on a project-byproject basis. Many commenters questioned how water would be reserved or allocated for the natural system. These questions focused on how the statutorily-required identification of water reservations and allocations for the natural system in each Project Implementation Report, would be coordinated with the actual reservation or allocation process which is conducted under State law. Developing the pre-CERP baseline is of central importance to ensuring attainment of the benefits of the Plan and to resolving this issue. This baseline represents the conditions in the region on the date of enactment of WRDA 2000 accounting for natural variations and including existing legal sources of water. The baseline will establish the amount of water that is presently delivered by the Central and Southern Florida Project. The proposed regulations provide that the pre-CERP baseline will be established by June 30, 2003. The proposed regulations also provide that each Project Implementation Report will consider the change of pre-CERP baseline water availability in identifying the quantity, timing, and distribution of water to be made available for the natural system by a project component; whether improvements in water quality are needed in order to ensure that water delivered to the natural system meets applicable water quality standards; whether additional quantity, timing, and distribution of water and/or improved water quality should be made available by subsequent projects; whether to recommend preparation of a Comprehensive Plan Modification Report; and whether to recommend that the State of Florida and its agencies reexamine the reservation or allocation of water needed under State law in order to meet the needs of the natural system and such uses identified under the savings clause. The Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan was developed as an integrated set of components or projects that are intended to work together to successfully achieve the goals and purposes of the Plan. Although individual projects increase the amount of water available, the effect of an individual project extends far beyond the location of the project. Accordingly, it is important that the identification of water to be reserved for the natural system take into account the synergistic and regional effect of projects. The proposed regulations contemplate that a guidance memorandum will be developed to provide uniform guidance for quantifying water made available by projects and for identifying the water to be reserved for the natural system. The proposed regulations also provide direction for the development of the guidance memorandum. Some agencies, interest groups, and the public were concerned about potential variations from the predicted availability of water once projects actually are implemented and operated. The proposed regulations provide that development of a Comprehensive Plan Modification Report be undertaken to determine the need for revisions to the Plan. The regulations also provide that in the interim during preparation of the Comprehensive Plan Modification Report, operation of the project should be consistent with the procedures identified in the Project Implementation Report and Project Operating Manual. P. Savings Clause Provisions Many commenters questioned the effects of implementation of the Plan on existing legal sources of water and on existing levels of flood protection. As discussed, Section 601(h)(5)(A) of WRDA 2000 contains a savings clause provision that is designed to ensure that existing sources of water and levels of flood protection are preserved. The report of the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works on WRDA 2000 (Senate Report No. 106 362) describes the intent of this savings clause as follows: Elimination of existing sources of water supply is barred until new sources of comparable quantity and quality of water are available; existing authorized levels of flood protection are maintained; and the water compact among the Seminole Tribe of Florida, the State, and the South Florida Water Management District is specifically preserved. With respect to flood control, the committee intends that implementation of the Plan will not result in significant adverse impact to any person with an existing, legally recognized right to a level of protection against flooding. The committee does not intend that, consistent with benefits included in the Plan, this bill create any new rights to a level of protection against flooding that is not currently recognized under applicable Federal or State law.  using a process consistent with the processes used to develop a Project Implementation Report. The proposed regulations provide that the final approved Comprehensive Plan Modification Report will be transmitted to Congress. O. Ensuring Achievement of Plan Benefits The Plan will improve the quantity, quality, timing, and distribution of water to the South Florida ecosystem. Section 601(f) of WRDA 2000 specifies that the Secretary in coordination with the non-Federal sponsor prepare Project Implementation Reports prior to implementation of those projects. Section 601(h)(4)(A) of WRDA 2000 specifies a number of items required to be in a Project Implementation Report, including identification of the appropriate quantity, timing, and distribution of water dedicated and managed for the natural system, and the identification of the amount of water to be reserved or allocated for the natural system. The reservation or allocation of water for the natural system will be implemented under State law and must be made before the Army can execute a Project Cooperation Agreement for the project. ``State law'' includes reservations or allocations of water made by Florida's Water Management Districts under authority of State law. A number of commenters expressed the view that the Plan required that water be reserved for the natural system on an 80%20% basis. These commenters rely on the report of the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works on WRDA 2000 (Senate Report No. 106362) that states: The Plan contains a general outline of the quantities of water to be produced by each project. According to the Army Corps, 80 percent of the water generated by the Plan is needed for the natural system in order to attain restoration goals, and 20 percent of the water generated for use in the human environment. * * * Subject to future authorizations by Congress, the committee fully expects that the water necessary for restoration, currently estimated at 80 percent of the water generated by the Plan, will be reserved or allocated for the benefit of the natural system (Emphasis added).  Although those percentages were appropriate as an initial estimate for the purpose of evaluating the Plan, the regulations anticipate that each Project Implementation Report will evaluate and identify water to be reserved for the natural system and made available for other water-related needs of the region, and that the Plan itself will be continually evaluated through adaptive management. Accordingly, the water  Although the savings clause uses the term ``existing legal sources of water,'' it does not define the term. Nor could we find a definition elsewhere in Federal or State law. We have not defined the term in the proposed regulations, leaving the definition of an ``existing legal source''  VerDate Jul<25>2002  17:25 Aug 01, 2002  Jkt 197001  PO 00000  Frm 00008  Fmt 4701  Sfmt 4702  E:\FR\FM\02AUP3.SGM  pfrm17  PsN: 02AUP3   Federal Register / Vol. 67, No. 149 / Friday, August 2, 2002 / Proposed Rules of water to be determined on a case-bycase basis after consideration of all relevant facts. We may include a definition after considering submitted comments. Currently, the proposed regulations specify that the Project Implementation Report will include an analysis to determine if the project will cause an elimination or transfer of existing legal sources of water. If the project will cause an elimination or transfer of a source of water, then the Project Implementation report will include measures to ensure that such elimination or transfer will not take place until a new source of water of comparable quantity or quality is available to replace the water that would be lost as a result of implementation of the Plan. Existing legal sources of water may include water currently available for agriculture, water supply, tribal use, or elements of the natural system including the Everglades, as well as any other existing legal sources. The proposed regulations require a Project Implementation Report to include an analysis of the level of service for flood protection that was in existence on the date of enactment of the statute; and is in accordance with applicable law. If this analysis shows that the level of service for flood protection would be reduced by implementation of a project, then the regulations state that the project or its implementation plan will be modified to mitigate or eliminate the adverse effect on flood protection. Some commenters raised the question of how the Plan would address opportunities for increased levels of flood protection or the provision of flood protection in locations where there currently is no flood protection. The overarching objective of the Plan is the restoration, preservation, and protection of the South Florida ecosystem while providing for other water-related needs of the region, including water supply and flood protection. Accordingly, the proposed regulations allow for the evaluation of increased levels of flood protection or the provision of flood protection in areas where there is currently no flood protection, provided that such flood protection is consistent with the goals and purposes of the Plan and is in accordance with the provisions of section 601(f)(2)(B) of WRDA 2000 and other applicable laws. Q. Interim Goals Many comments focused on development of the interim goals. Section 601(h)(3)(c)(i)(III) of WRDA 2000 requires that interim goals be established to provide a means by which the restoration success of the Plan may be evaluated throughout the restoration process. Progress towards meeting the interim goals is to be reported to Congress as part of the periodic reports required by the Act. While there was widespread agreement among agencies, tribes, interest groups, and the public that interim goals should be established to ensure that the goals and purposes of the Plan are achieved, there were different views about whether these interim goals should be a part of the programmatic regulations. Some believed that the interim goals needed to be a part of the programmatic regulations to ensure that the goals would be met. They also believed that goals had to be incorporated into the regulations to enable the public to take part in the process of establishing the goals. Others were concerned that the statute specifically required the regulations to set up the process for establishing interim goals rather than the goals themselves. Additional commenters were concerned that placing the interim goals in the programmatic regulations would make goals difficult to adopt and amend, and that the adaptive management process authorized by section 601 of WRDA 2000 was incompatible with the Administrative Procedures Act rulemaking process. Other commenters were concerned that incorporating the goals into the regulations would suggest that the goals were meant to set standards or schedules enforceable in court rather than planning targets, and assessment and reporting tools. In addition, during development of the proposed regulations, it was apparent that there was not complete agreement on exactly what the interim goals should be. Staff of the implementing agencies required additional time to model the implementation schedule to evaluate expected performance at specific points in the implementation process. This modeling is an important first step in developing incremental stages (interim goals) for achieving that performance. Moreover, the South Florida Ecosystem Restoration Task Force and others indicated an interest in reviewing and discussing interim goals before they were adopted. Thus, even among those who thought that interim goals should be included in these regulations, it was clear that more time for modeling was needed. The proposed regulations recognize these facts and attempt to accommodate the views of commenters by establishing the principles that will guide the development of the interim goals and  50547  appropriately involve the public. The proposed regulations establish the structure for developing and adopting the interim goals, and make it clear that interim goals are targets for use of the agencies and Congress in evaluating the success of the restoration effort. They are not intended to be standards or schedules enforceable in court. The Restoration Coordination and Verification (RECOVER) team will use the principles set forth in the proposed regulations to develop and recommend a set of interim goals for implementation of the Plan no later than June 30, 2003. The regulations specify that interim goals shall reflect the incremental accomplishment of the expected performance level of the Plan, and will identify improvements in quantity, timing and distribution of water in fiveyear increments beginning in 2005. The interim goals will also include indicators for water quality improvement and ecological responses, such as increases in extent of wetlands, improvements in habitat quality, and improvements in native plant and animal abundance. However, the regulations also recognize that achievement of improvements in water quality and desired ecological responses may be dependent on other programs and activities outside the scope of CERP. The extent of this dependence on outside programs and activities should be explicitly assessed and described at the time goals are developed, and should be taken into account as the CERP is subsequently evaluated relative to the goals. The interim goals shall be predicted by appropriate models and tools and shall provide a quantitative basis for evaluating the restoration success of the Plan during the period of implementation. The expected level of the Plan is generally represented by the output of the model run of D13R as described in the ``Final Integrated Feasibility Report and Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement'' dated April 1, 1999, as modified by section 601 of WRDA 2000, or any subsequent modification authorized in law. The proposed regulations envision that RECOVER will provide its recommendations to the Corps of Engineers and South Florida Water Management District for review and discussion. Interim goals will be memorialized in an agreement to be signed by the Department of the Army, the Department of the Interior, and the State no later than December 31, 2003. The Department of the Army, the Department of the Interior, and the State will provide a notice of availability of the proposed agreement to the public in the Federal Register, seek public  VerDate Jul<25>2002  17:25 Aug 01, 2002  Jkt 197001  PO 00000  Frm 00009  Fmt 4701  Sfmt 4702  E:\FR\FM\02AUP3.SGM  pfrm17  PsN: 02AUP3   50548  Federal Register / Vol. 67, No. 149 / Friday, August 2, 2002 / Proposed Rules physical and ecological characteristics that defined the pre-drainage ecosystem, including more natural hydroperiods, which are a precursor to improvements to native flora and fauna, presence of key species in historic habitats, and patterns of plant communities that form a gradient from aquatic communities to uplands. The regulations recognize that the concept of restoration anticipates future improvements to the Plan through adaptive management. The regulations also recognize that performance measures will continue to be refined and developed throughout the course of implementing the Plan. Interim goals will show incremental progress towards reaching the expected performance level of the Plan at different time intervals during implementation. The regulations envision that the RECOVER team will provide their recommendations about interim goals to the Corps of Engineers and South Florida Water Management District. These recommendations will be considered during the development of an agreement on interim goals that is to be finalized by the Army, the Department of the Interior, and the State of Florida by December 31, 2003. These interim goals will be used initially to evaluate the success of the restoration effort and will be refined periodically during the implementation of the Plan as appropriate to ensure that the overall restoration objectives of the Plan are achieved. S. Targets for Other Water-Related Needs of the Region The overarching objective of the Plan is the restoration, preservation, and protection of the South Florida ecosystem while providing for other water-related needs of the region, including water supply and flood protection. Some commenters urged that, in addition to the interim goals aimed at evaluating restoration success of the Plan, the regulations also should provide incremental targets for the other water-related needs of the region. They believe that this will ensure that all of the goals and purposes of the Plan are achieved. Others commented that, if these other incremental targets were included, progress towards achieving these targets should be evaluated separately from interim goals. Identifying incremental targets for the other water-related needs of the region will help evaluate the success of implementation of the Plan in achieving the non-restoration goals of the Plan. Therefore, we have decided to establish in the regulations a mechanism for evaluating progress towards providing for these other water-related needs. The regulations provide that by June 30, 2003, RECOVER will develop recommendations on targets to evaluate progress on achieving the other waterrelated needs of the region, for consideration by the Corps of Engineers and the South Florida Water Management District, in consultation with others. The Corps of Engineers and the South Florida Water Management District will also consult with the South Florida Ecosystem Restoration Task Force in establishing targets for evaluating progress towards achieving other water-related needs of the region provided for in the Plan. These targets shall be established by the Corps of Engineers and the South Florida Water Management District by December 31, 2003. These targets are intended to facilitate inter-agency planning, monitoring, and assessment throughout the implementation process and are not intended to be standards or schedules enforceable in court. Interim goals, which are directed at restoration success of the Plan, and targets for achieving the other waterrelated needs of the region, which are not directed at restoration, are set out in two distinct sections to make clear that they are intended to evaluate two different types of goals of the Plan. In recognition of the significant technical and scientific analyses that are needed in the development of interim goals and targets, RECOVER has already begun the work necessary in order to meet the June 30, 2003 deadline for providing recommendations on interim goals and targets for other water-related needs to the Corps of Engineers and the South Florida Water Management District. T. Role of the Department of the Interior Several commenters urged that the Department of the Interior play a significant role in implementation of the Plan because of its stewardship role over Federal lands and natural resources involved in the Plan. The regulations give the Department of the Interior a special concurring role, along with the Governor of the State of Florida, in the development of six specific guidance memoranda related to important program-wide aspects of implementing the Plan: (1) General format and content of Project Implementation Reports; (2) processes for Project Delivery Team evaluation of alternatives developed for Project Implementation Reports, their cost effectiveness and impacts; (3) process for system-wide evaluation of PIR alternatives by RECOVER; (4) the general content of operating manuals; (5) general processes for the conduct of assessment activities of RECOVER; and  comments, and consult with Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Florida, the Seminole Tribe of Florida, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Department of Commerce, the Florida Department of Environmental Protection, and other Federal, State, and local agencies and the South Florida Ecosystem Restoration Task Force concerning the proposed interim goals. Finally, the proposed regulations establish a process for revising the interim goals in five-year increments or sooner, if appropriate in light of new information. Finally, some commenters believed that the interim goals should take into account other water-related needs of the region, including water supply and flood protection, as provided for in the Plan. Other commenters believed that the interim goals should not evaluate other water-related needs of the region. We felt that the interim goals should focus solely on restoration success because section 601(h)(3)(c)(i)(III) of WRDA 2000 specifies that the interim goals are to provide a means by which restoration success may be evaluated throughout the implementation process. The proposed regulations reflect this view. However, the statute recognizes that providing for other water-related needs of the region, including water supply and flood protection, are also objectives of the Plan. Therefore, the proposed regulations also provide for separately monitoring progress on other water-related needs of the region as provided for in the Plan during the implementation process, thus ensuring that all of the goals and purposes of the Plan will be achieved. R. Relationship Among Restoration, Performance Measures, and Interim Goals In order to comprehend how the Plan will be evaluated to ensure that its restoration objectives are achieved, it is essential to understand the relationship among the concepts of restoration, performance measures, and interim goals. In this regulation, restoration is defined as the level of recovery and protection to the South Florida ecosystem described in the Plan approved by Congress, with such modifications that Congress may provide for in the future. As the regulations indicate, the concept of restoration in the Plan approved by Congress was expressed in a level of recovery assessed in terms of performance measures, consisting chiefly of hydrologic characteristics. The definition also recognizes that increased flows to the natural system are expected to restore essential  VerDate Jul<25>2002  17:25 Aug 01, 2002  Jkt 197001  PO 00000  Frm 00010  Fmt 4701  Sfmt 4702  E:\FR\FM\02AUP3.SGM  pfrm17  PsN: 02AUP3   Federal Register / Vol. 67, No. 149 / Friday, August 2, 2002 / Proposed Rules (6) the process used in Project Implementation Reports for identifying the appropriate quantity, timing, and distribution of water dedicated and managed for the natural system. The regulations also give the Secretary of the Interior and the Governor of the State of Florida a concurring role in the Secretary of the Army's determination of the pre-CERP baseline. They also specify that interim goals will be established through a formal Interim Goals Agreement between the Corps of Engineers, the State, and the Department of the Interior. Further, the Department of the Interior is provided an important role in the Leadership Group of RECOVER, along with several other Federal and State agencies and the two Tribes. Finally, the regulations give the Department of the Interior an important consulting role throughout implementation of the program, including, among other things, participation on Project Development Teams; development of the Adaptive Management Program; selection and revision of hydrologic models; development of Project Management Plans and Program Management Plans; development of Project Implementation Reports; development of Operating Manuals; development, review and revision of changes to the Master Implementation Sequencing Schedule; recommending and developing Comprehensive Plan Modification Reports; and developing means for monitoring progress towards other water-related needs of the region as provided for in the Plan. U. Role of South Florida Ecosystem Restoration Task Force Several commenters suggested that the Programmatic Regulations create a specific role for the South Florida Ecosystem Restoration Task Force, an interagency group created by section 528(f) of the Water Resources Development Act of 1996 (110 Stat. 3770) (hereinafter ``WRDA 96''). The legal basis for the Task Force's role in the restoration effort is found both in Section 528 of WRDA 96 and in Section 601 of WRDA 2000. Section 528 envisions that the Task Force will coordinate programs and research on ecosystem restoration, exchange information, provide assistance and facilitate resolution of conflicts involving South Florida ecosystem restoration. In Section 601(j) of WRDA 2000, the Task Force is also given a consultation responsibility concerning the establishment of an independent scientific review panel to review the progress that is being made toward achieving the natural system restoration goals of the Plan. Some members of the Task Force and its associated working group represent agencies involved in implementing CERP under the programmatic regulations, such as the Jacksonville District Corps of Engineers and the South Florida Water Management District. As recognized by this regulation, the South Florida Water Management District and the Jacksonville District already regularly report to the Task Force and its working group on CERP matters. The Task Force also has appointed the Water Resources Advisory Commission (WRAC) of the South Florida Water Management District as an advisory body to the Task Force. The Corps of Engineers serves on this body and regularly briefs that body on CERP. The Department of the Army recognizes the important role that these collaborative groups play in discussion and resolution of CERP issues. We expect that informal coordination among the implementing agencies, the Task Force and its working group and its other advisory bodies will continue. For example, the Task Force may wish to have regular briefings on CERP implementation issues, on the Master Implementation Sequencing Plan, on Project Implementation Reports, or on Operating Manuals; or the Task Force may decide to have RECOVER provide the working group with information on work in progress. Further, we contemplate that the Task Force will determine, on a case-by-case basis, the manner and extent to which it is appropriate for it to be involved in CERP in order to carry out its existing statutory responsibilities. If a regular process evolves, it can be incorporated into revisions of the Programmatic Regulations. At recent meetings, the Task Force expressed an interest in consultation on several subjects. Accordingly, this draft regulation incorporates consultation with the Task Force on those subjects. They include: interim goals; targets for other water-related needs of the region as provided for in the Plan; certain assessment reports; Comprehensive Plan Modification Reports; Pilot Project Technical Data Reports; and periodic reports to Congress by the Secretary of Army and Secretary of Interior in consultation with EPA, Department of Commerce, and the State of Florida. The final regulation may provide for additional subjects upon which the Task Force may consult, if deemed appropriate after consideration of public comments. V. NEPA Compliance As required by regulations of the Council on Environmental Quality (40  50549  CFR 1505.1 and 1507.3), agencies must issue regulations identifying classes of actions generally requiring an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS), generally not subject to the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), and actions requiring an Environmental Assessment (EA) of whether a full NEPA EIS is required or not. The Corps of Engineers has adopted procedures generally implementing NEPA in  230 of this chapter. The Programmatic Regulations consider on a system-wide basis, the kinds of actions needed to implement the Plan, and apply the principles of  230 to those activities. The programmatic regulations identify certain actions which generally require preparation of a NEPA document (either an Environmental Impact Statement or an environmental assessment), or which are categorically excluded from NEPA. Actions, such as the development or revision of methods or guidance memoranda, are listed as categorically excluded. Although the development or revision of a method or guidance memorandum itself would not require a NEPA analysis, use of the method or guidance memorandum would be analyzed under NEPA, as appropriate, in a decision document such as a Project Implementation Report. In general, the NEPA documentation for a particular project will be included in the Project Implementation Report. For this reason, other project-specific documents such as the Design Documentation Report, Project Cooperation Agreement, Project Management Plan, and detailed plans and specifications for the project are listed as categorically excluded from NEPA documentation requirements. The Corps recognizes that these documents may address elements of the project that have a potential to significantly affect the quality of the human environment, and fully intends that these effects should be analyzed and considered as required by NEPA, but believes that this analysis and consideration can be most effectively accomplished by including one comprehensive NEPA analysis for each project in the Project Implementation Report, rather than having piecemeal analyses in each of the supporting documents. Some commenters expressed the view that the guidance memorandum for determining the quantity, timing and distribution of water dedicated and managed for the natural system in a Project Implementation Report (PIR) should be analyzed in an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS). Since the guidance memorandum is procedural and does not affect the environment, recommend legislation, or determine a  VerDate Jul<25>2002  17:25 Aug 01, 2002  Jkt 197001  PO 00000  Frm 00011  Fmt 4701  Sfmt 4702  E:\FR\FM\02AUP3.SGM  pfrm17  PsN: 02AUP3   50550  Federal Register / Vol. 67, No. 149 / Friday, August 2, 2002 / Proposed Rules promulgation of the final rule, then the preamble to the final rule will contain a statement concerning the consistency of that Project Implementation Report with the programmatic regulations. V. Concurrence Requirements for This Regulation The Secretary of the Interior and the Governor are required by Section 601(h)(3)(B) of WRDA 2000 to provide the Secretary with a written statement of concurrence or non-concurrence on the proposed programmatic regulations within 180 days from the end of the public comment period. This statute specifies that a failure to provide a written statement of concurrence or nonconcurrence within the 180-day time frame will be deemed as meeting the concurrency requirements. A copy of any concurrency or nonconcurrency statement shall be made a part of the administrative record and be referred to in the final programmatic regulations. Any nonconcurrency statements shall specifically detail the reason or reasons for the nonconcurrence. Throughout the process of developing the proposed regulations, we have maintained close coordination with the Department of the Interior and the State of Florida. The Army will give good faith consideration to the concurrence or non-concurrence statements of the Secretary of Interior and the Governor. The final regulations will include a reference to these statements before making a decision to issue final regulations. VI. Organization of the Proposed Rule We have organized the proposed regulations under five major headings. The first heading, General Provisions, provides the purpose of the regulations, the applicability of the rule, definitions pertaining to the regulations and other general information. The second heading, Program Goals and Responsibilities, describes the goals and purposes of the Plan; implementation principles; and implementation responsibilities, consultation, and coordination. The remaining headings were designed to be consistent with the content required by section 601(h)(3)(C). These headings are: Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan Implementation Processes; Incorporating New Information into the Plan; and Ensuring Protection of the Natural System and Water Availability Consistent with the Goals and Purposes of the Plan. VII. Public Comments Solicited We are soliciting comments and suggestions from the public, governmental organizations, and other interested parties on the proposed regulations. If you wish to comment on this proposed rule, you may submit your comments and materials by any one of several methods (see ADDRESSES section). If submitting comments by electronic format, please submit them in ASCII file format or Word file format and avoid the use of special characters and any form of encryption. Please include your name and return e-mail address in your e-mail message. Please note that your e-mail address will not be retained at the termination of the public comment period. VIII. Administrative Requirements A. Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.) These regulations do not impose any information collection requirements for which OMB approval under the Paperwork Reduction Act is required. Thus, this action is not subject to the Paperwork Reduction Act. B. Executive Order 12866, as Amended Under Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735, October 4, 1993), as amended, we must determine whether the regulatory action is ``significant'' and therefore subject to review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the requirements of the Executive Order. The Executive Order defines ``significant regulatory action'' as one that is likely to result in a rule that may: (1) Have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more, or adversely affect in a material way the economy, a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local, or Tribal governments or communities; (2) Create a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency; (3) Materially alter the budgetary impact of entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations of recipients thereof; or (4) Raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles set forth in the Executive Order. Pursuant to the terms of Executive Order 12866, as amended, it has been determined that these regulations are a ``significant regulatory action'' in light of the provisions of paragraph (4) above. As such, this action was submitted to OMB for review. Changes made in response to OMB suggestions or recommendations are documented in the public record.  specific quantity, timing, or distribution of water for a specific component, it was not considered to be a ``major Federal action'' under NEPA. It is important to note that NEPA would apply to the decision made in a PIR for a specific project applying a guidance memorandum to that project and determining that a certain quantity, timing or distribution of water was required for the project. Similar comments were directed at the interim goals. Some commenters felt that the interim goals were not ``major Federal actions'' affecting the environment under NEPA. These commenters regarded the interim goals as evaluation and reporting tools. Other commenters maintained that the interim goals are planning goals and that as such should be subject to a full NEPA analysis. In proposing these regulations, we determined that it was not appropriate at this time to make a programmatic decision on precisely how NEPA applied to interim goals because the interim goals have not yet been established and since the extent to which interim goals will be used in planning is still under consideration. When specific interim goals are proposed for adoption, a decision can be made on exactly how NEPA applies. Moreover, when the Programmatic Regulations are revised for the first time, the Corps will consider whether interim goals should be listed as categorically excluded, generally requiring an EIS, or generally requiring an Environmental Assessment but not necessarily an EIS. IV. Project Implementation Reports Approved Pursuant to Transition Rule Section 601(h)(3)(D) of WRDA 2000 establishes a transition rule for Project Implementation Reports approved before the date of promulgation of the programmatic regulations. This transition rule requires that the Project Implementation Reports be consistent with the Plan. The transition rule also requires that the preamble of the programmatic regulations contain a statement concerning the consistency with the programmatic regulations of the Project Implementation Reports approved prior to the date of promulgation of those regulations. A number of Project Implementation Reports are underway currently, but no Project Implementation Reports have been approved to date. The Project Implementation Report for the Southern Golden Gates Estates project in Collier County is scheduled to be completed prior to promulgation of the final rule. If the final Project Implementation Report on Southern Golden Gates Estates is approved before the date of  VerDate Jul<25>2002  17:25 Aug 01, 2002  Jkt 197001  PO 00000  Frm 00012  Fmt 4701  Sfmt 4702  E:\FR\FM\02AUP3.SGM  pfrm17  PsN: 02AUP3   Federal Register / Vol. 67, No. 149 / Friday, August 2, 2002 / Proposed Rules C. Executive Order 13132 Executive Order 13132, entitled ``Federalism'' (64 FR 43255, August 10, 1999), requires the development of an accountable process to ensure ``meaningful and timely input by State and local officials in the development of regulatory policies that have federalism implications.'' ``Policies that have federalism implications'' is defined in the Executive Order to include regulations that have ``substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government.'' These regulations do not have significant federalism implications. The proposed regulations define the relationships between the Federal and State partners in implementing the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan. These proposed regulations are limited to implementation of the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan. It will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government, as specified in Executive Order 13132. Thus, Executive Order 13132 does not apply to this rule. Nonetheless, the Corps of Engineers has consulted closely with the State and local officials in developing the proposed rule. D. Regulatory Flexibility Act The Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq., as amended by the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act (SBREFA) of 1996) generally requires an agency to prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis of any rule subject to notice-and-comment rulemaking requirements under the Administrative Procedure Act or any other statute unless the agency certifies that the rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small organizations and small governmental jurisdictions. For purposes of assessing the impacts of the proposed rule on small entities, a small entity is defined as: (1) A small business based on SBA size standards; (2) a small governmental jurisdiction that is a government of a city, county, town, school district, or special district with a population of less than 50,000; and (3) a small organization that is any not-for-profit enterprise which is independently owned and operated and is not dominant in its field. After considering the economic impacts of the proposed rule on small entities, we certify that this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. The proposed regulations only establish processes and governmental relationships that will be used for implementation of the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan. E. Unfunded Mandates Reform Act We have determined in accordance with the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act (2 U.S.C. 1501 et seq.): (a) These regulations will not ``significantly or uniquely'' affect small governments. A Small Government Agency Plan is not required. Small governments will only be affected to the extent that they agree to act as a nonFederal sponsor for implementation of projects for the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan. The proposed regulations do not establish new or different requirements for nonFederal sponsors for implementation of projects for the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan. (b) The proposed regulations will not produce a Federal mandate of $100 million or greater in any year, and therefore, does not constitute a ``significant regulatory action'' under the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act. The regulations define processes and relationships between the Federal and State partners in implementing the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan. The regulations do not affect the cost sharing requirements for nonFederal sponsors in implementing the Plan and therefore, imposes no new obligations on State or local governments. F. National Technology Transfer and Advancement Act Section 12(d) of the National Technology Transfer and Advancement Act of 1995 (the NTTAA), Public Law 104113, section 12(d) (15 U.S.C. 272 note), directs us to use voluntary consensus standards in our regulatory activities unless to do so would be inconsistent with applicable law or otherwise impractical. Voluntary consensus standards are technical standards (e.g., materials specifications, test methods, sampling procedures, and business practices) that are developed or adopted by voluntary consensus standards bodies. The NTTAA directs us to provide Congress, through OMB, explanations when we decide not to use available and applicable voluntary consensus standards. These regulations do not involve technical standards.  50551  Therefore, we did not consider the use of any voluntary consensus standards. G. Executive Order 13045 Executive Order 13045, entitled ``Protection of Children From Environmental Health Risks and Safety Risks'' (62 FR 19885, April 23, 1997), applies to any rule that: (1) Was initiated after April 21, 1997, or for which a notice of proposed rulemaking was published after April 21, 1998; (2) is determined to be ``economically significant'' as defined under Executive Order 12866, and (3) concerns an environmental health or safety risk that we have reason to believe may have a disproportionate effect on children. If the regulatory action meets all three criteria, we must evaluate the environmental health or safety effects of the planned rule on children, and explain why the planned regulation is preferable to other potentially effective and reasonably feasible alternatives that we considered. The regulations are not subject to Executive Order 13045 because it is not an economically significant regulatory action as defined by Executive Order 12866. The regulations establish processes for the implementation of the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan and define the relationships between the Federal and State partners for implementation. Furthermore, they do not concern an environmental health or safety risk that we have reason to believe may have a disproportionate effect on children. H. Executive Order 13175 Under Executive Order 13175, we may not issue a regulation that has substantial, direct effects on one or more Indian tribes, on the relationship between the Federal government and Indian tribes, or on the distribution of powers and responsibilities between the Federal government and Indian tribes, and imposes substantial direct compliance costs on those communities, and that is not required by statute, unless the Federal government provides the funds necessary to pay the direct compliance cost incurred by the Tribal governments, or we consult with those governments. If we comply by consulting, Executive Order 13175 requires us to provide the Office of Management and Budget, in a separately identified section of the preamble to the rule, a description of the extent of our prior consultation with representatives of affected Tribal governments, a summary of the nature of their concerns, and a statement supporting the need to issue the regulation. In addition, Executive Order 13175 requires us to develop an effective process permitting  VerDate Jul<25>2002  17:25 Aug 01, 2002  Jkt 197001  PO 00000  Frm 00013  Fmt 4701  Sfmt 4702  E:\FR\FM\02AUP3.SGM  pfrm17  PsN: 02AUP3   50552  Federal Register / Vol. 67, No. 149 / Friday, August 2, 2002 / Proposed Rules J. Civil Justice Reform In accordance with Executive Order 12988, we have determined that the proposed regulations do not unduly burden the judicial system and meets the requirements of sections 3(a) and 3(b)(2) of the Order. The regulations establish processes to be used in implementing the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan and defines the relationships between the governmental entities that will implement the Plan. K. Executive Order 13211 On May 18, 2001, the President issued an Executive Order (E.O. 13211) that applies to regulations that significantly affect energy supply, distribution, and use. Executive Order 13211 requires agencies to prepare Statements of Energy Effects when undertaking certain actions. Because the proposed regulations are not expected to significantly affect energy supplies, distribution, or use, this action is not a significant energy action and no Statement of Energy Effects is required. L. Environmental Documentation We have determined that these proposed regulations do not constitute a major Federal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment. Therefore, environmental documentation under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) is not required for these proposed regulations. The Corps of Engineers has prepared appropriate environmental documentation, including a Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement, for the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan. Moreover, the proposed regulations establish requirements for the preparation of appropriate environmental documentation as part of the implementation process.

The proposed regulations are required by section 601(h)(3) of WRDA 2000. Additionally, the proposed rule does not impose significant compliance costs on any Indian Tribes. The regulations establish processes for the implementation of the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan and define the relationships between the implementing entities. Accordingly, the requirements of section 3(b) of Executive Order 13175 do not apply to these regulations. However, the Corps of Engineers recognizes that two Indian Tribes, the Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Florida and the Seminole Tribe of Florida, have a significant direct interest in the implementation of the CERP and the framework for its implementation that will be established by these programmatic regulations. We have thus consulted extensively with these Tribes in the development of this proposed rule, and have included requirements for continued consultation in all significant project implementation components, including program-wide guidance memoranda, Project Management Plans, Program Management Plans, Project Implementation Reports, Project Operating Manuals, the System Operating Manual, and the Master Implementation Sequencing Plan. These Tribes are also included in the Leadership Group of RECOVER and participate in the Project Delivery Teams and the South Florida Ecosystem Restoration Task Force, which has played and will continue to play a consultative role on many aspects of CERP implementation. Finally,  385.10(b) includes a general requirement for consultation with the Tribes ``throughout the implementation process.'' I. Executive Order 12630 In accordance with Executive Order 12630 entitled ``Governmental Actions and Interference with Constitutionally Protected Property Rights,'' the proposed regulations will not effect a taking of private property or otherwise have taking implications. A takings implication assessment is not required. The regulations establish processes to be used in implementing the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan.

(b) The purpose of these programmatic regulations is to establish the processes necessary for implementing the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan (the Plan) to ensure that the goals and purposes of the Plan are achieved. Some of these processes are project specific, including, but not limited to, development of Project Implementation Reports, projectspecific performance measures, Project Cooperation Agreements, plans and specifications, Design Documentation Reports, Pilot Project Technical Data Reports, and Operating Manuals. Other processes are of more general applicability, including, but not limited to, development of program-wide guidance memoranda, system-wide performance measures, interim goals, targets for monitoring progress on other goals and purposes of the Plan, and the Master Implementation Sequencing Plan. Taken together these documents establish the process by which the programmatic regulations ensure that the restoration success and other goals and purposes of the Plan are achieved. These programmatic regulations also describe the relationship among the various Federal, State, tribal, and local governmental entities charged with Plan implementation responsibilities.  385.2 Applicability of the programmatic regulations.  (2) Any existing legal water rights of the United States, the State of Florida, the Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Florida, or the Seminole Tribe of Florida, including rights under the compact among the Seminole Tribe of Florida, the State, and the South Florida Water Management District, defining the scope and use of water rights of the Seminole Tribe of Florida, as codified by section 7 of the Seminole Indian Land Claims Settlement Act of 1987 (25 U.S.C. 1772e). (c) This part is intended to aid the internal management of the implementing agencies and are not intended to create any right or benefit enforceable at law by a party against the implementing agencies or their officers. Nothing in this part shall create a right or expectation to benefits or enhancements, temporary or permanent, in third parties that are not specifically authorized by Congress in Section 601 of WRDA 2000. (d) Nothing in this part is intended to, or shall be interpreted to, reserve or allocate water or to prescribe the process for reserving or allocating water or for water management under Florida law.

Independent scientific review means the process established pursuant to section 601(j) of WRDA 2000, or other process that is independent of the Corps of Engineers, the South Florida Water Management District, and other entities involved in the implementation of the Plan, to review and validate the scientific and technical processes and information developed for the Plan. Independent Technical Review Team means the team established by the Corps of Engineers and the non-Federal sponsor, to ensure quality control of documents and products produced by the Project Delivery Team through periodic technical reviews. Indicator means an element or component of the natural or human systems that is expected to be influenced by the Plan, and has been selected to be monitored as representative of a class of system responses. Individual features of the Plan means a feature of the Plan related to and limited to one specific project of the Plan. Interim goal is a means by which success of restoration, as defined for purposes of this part, may be evaluated throughout the implementation process. Last added increment means the evaluation of a project as the last project to be added to a system of projects. For the purposes of the Plan, this means analyzing a proposed project assuming that all the other components of the Plan have been implemented. Level of service for flood protection means the water level or flow duration and frequency, which the Central and Southern Project and other water management systems in the South Florida ecosystem provide in order to prevent flooding of the related surface water basins. Master Implementation Sequencing Plan means the document that describes the sequencing and scheduling of the pilot projects, individual projects, and program-level activities that comprise the Plan. Mediation means a non-binding dispute resolution process designed to assist the disputing parties to resolve the dispute. In mediation, the parties mutually select a neutral and impartial third party to facilitate the negotiations. Monitoring means the systematic process of collecting data designed to show the status, trends, and relationships of elements of natural and human systems at predetermined locations and times. Natural system means all land and water managed by the Federal government or the State within the South Florida ecosystem and includes water conservation areas; sovereign submerged land; Everglades National Park; Biscayne National Park; Big Cypress National Preserve; other Federal or State (including a political subdivision of a State) land that is designated and managed for conservation purposes; and any tribal land that is designated and managed for conservation purposes, as approved by the tribe.

(a) The Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan is a framework for modifications and operational changes to the Central and Southern Florida Project that are needed to restore, preserve, and protect the South Florida ecosystem while providing for other water-related needs of the region, including water supply and flood protection. The overarching objective of the Plan is the restoration, preservation, and protection of the South Florida ecosystem while providing for other water-related needs of the region, including water supply and flood protection. (b) The Corps of Engineers and nonFederal sponsors shall, in consultation with the Department of the Interior, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Department of Commerce, the Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Florida, the Seminole Tribe of Florida, the Florida Department of Environmental Protection, and other Federal, State, and local agencies, implement the Plan to ensure the protection of water quality in, the reduction of the loss of fresh water from, and the improvement of the environment of the South Florida Ecosystem and to achieve and maintain the benefits to the natural system and human environment described in the Plan, and required pursuant to section 601 of WRDA 2000 for as long as the project is authorized. (c) The goal of the Plan is to provide the quantity, quality, timing, and distribution of water necessary to achieve the goals and purposes of the Plan. The Corps of Engineers and nonFederal sponsors shall implement the projects of the Plan with the goal of achieving the expected performance level of the Plan and to seek continuous improvement of the Plan based upon new information resulting from changed or unforeseen circumstances, new scientific or technical information, new or updated models, or information developed through the adaptive assessment principles contained in the Plan, or future authorized changes to the Plan integrated into the implementation of the Plan.  385.9 Implementation principles.  the Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Florida, the Seminole Tribe of Florida, the Florida Department of Environmental Protection, and other Federal, State, and local agencies, conduct activities, including programlevel activities, necessary to implement the projects of the Plan. Such activities shall be conducted as part of an integrated implementation program, in accordance with this part, and based on the following principles: (a) Individual projects shall be formulated based on their contribution to the system-wide goals and purposes of the Plan and the achievement of the expected performance level of the Plan, as well as on their ability to provide benefits without regard to projects not yet implemented. (b) Interim goals shall be established pursuant to this part to provide a means for evaluating restoration success at specific time intervals during implementation. Progress on achieving other water-related needs of the region as provided for in the Plan shall also be evaluated at specific time intervals during implementation. (c) Endorsement of the Plan as a restoration framework is not intended as a constraint on innovation in its implementation through the adaptive management process. Continuous improvement of the Plan shall be sought to ensure that new information resulting from changed or unforeseen circumstances, new scientific or technical information, or information developed through the adaptive assessment principles contained in the Plan, or future authorized changes to the Plan are integrated into the implementation of the Plan. The adaptive management process provides a means for analyzing performance of the Plan and assessing progress towards meeting the goals and purposes of the Plan as well as a basis for improving the performance of the Plan. Improving the performance of the Plan means either enhancing the benefits of the Plan in terms of restoration of the natural system while providing for other waterrelated needs of the region, including water supply and flood protection, or delivering Plan benefits at reduced cost.  385.10 Implementation responsibilities, consultation, and coordination.

The guidance memorandum shall also provide for projects that are hydrologically separate from the rest of the system. The guidance memorandum also shall address procedures for determining whether improvements in water quality are necessary to ensure that water delivered to the natural system meets applicable water quality standards. These procedures shall ensure that any features to improve water quality are implemented in a manner consistent with the cost sharing provisions of the Water Resources Development Acts of 1996 and 2000. (ii) The guidance memorandum shall generally take into account the natural fluctuation of water made available in any given year; the objective of restoration of the natural system; the need for protection of existing uses transferred to new sources; contingencies for drought protection; the need to identify the additional quantity, timing, and distribution of water made available by a new project component while maintaining a systemwide perspective on the amount of water made available by the Plan; and the need to determine whether improvements in water quality are necessary to ensure that water delivered to the natural system meets applicable water quality standards. (iii) Project Implementation Reports approved before the date of promulgation of these regulations or the development of the guidance memorandum may use whatever method that the Corps of Engineers and the non-Federal sponsor deem is reasonable and consistent with the provisions of section 601 of WRDA 2000. (iv) Nothing in this section is intended to, or shall it be interpreted to, reserve or allocate water or to prescribe the process for reserving or allocating water or for water management under Florida law. Nothing in this section is intended to, nor shall it be interpreted to, prescribe any process of Florida law.  and Southern Florida Project prior to the date of enactment of section 601 of WRDA 2000. In developing the preCERP baseline, the Corps of Engineers and the South Florida Water Management District shall use a method that is consistent with the guidance memorandum approved in accordance with paragraph (b)(2) of this section. (2) Concurrence by the Secretary of the Interior and the Governor shall be required on the proposed pre-CERP baseline. Within 180 days from the development of the pre-CERP baseline, or December 31, 2003, whichever is sooner, or such shorter period that the Secretary of the Interior and the Governor may agree to, the Secretary of the Interior and the Governor may provide the Secretary with a written statement of concurrence or nonconcurrence with the proposed preCERP baseline. A failure to provide a written statement of concurrence or nonconcurrence within such time frame shall be deemed as meeting the concurrency requirements of this section. Any nonconcurrency statement shall specifically detail the reason or reasons for the non-concurrence. The Corps of Engineers and the South Florida Water Management District shall give good faith consideration to any nonconcurrency statement, and take the reason or reasons for the nonconcurrence into account in the final decision to determine the preCERP baseline. (3) In preparing a Project Implementation Report, the Corps of Engineers and the South Florida Water Management District shall determine whether the pre-CERP baseline quantity of water of comparable quality is still available. The Corps of Engineers and the non-Federal sponsor shall consider any change in availability of pre-CERP baseline water and previously reserved water in identifying the quantity, timing, and distribution of water to be made available for the natural system by a project component in preparing the Project Implementation Report. The Project Implementation Report shall consider: whether additional quantity, timing, and distribution of water should be made available by subsequent projects; whether improvements in water quality are needed in order to ensure that water delivered to the natural system meets applicable water quality standards; whether to recommend preparation of a Comprehensive Plan Modification Report as described in  385.32; and whether to recommend that the State of Florida and its agencies re-examine the reservation or allocation of water made pursuant to State law in order to  VerDate Jul<25>2002  16:58 Aug 01, 2002  Jkt 197001  PO 00000  Frm 00032  Fmt 4701  Sfmt 4702  E:\FR\FM\02AUP3.SGM  pfrm17  PsN: 02AUP3   Federal Register / Vol. 67, No. 149 / Friday, August 2, 2002 / Proposed Rules  385.36 Elimination or transfer of existing legal sources of water.  50571  (a) Pursuant to the provisions of section 601(h)(5)(A) of WRDA 2000, Project Implementation Reports shall include analyses to determine if existing legal sources of water are to be transferred or eliminated as a result of project implementation. If implementation of the project shall cause a transfer or elimination of existing legal sources of water, then the Project Implementation Report shall include an implementation plan that ensures that such transfer or elimination shall not occur until a new source of water of comparable quantity and quality is available to replace the water to be lost as a result of implementation of the Plan. (b) In determining if implementation of a project shall cause an elimination or transfer of existing legal sources of water, the Corps of Engineers and the non-Federal sponsor shall include those for: (1) An agricultural or urban water supply; (2) Allocation or entitlement to the Seminole Indian Tribe of Florida under section 7 of the Seminole Indian Land Claims Settlement Act of 1987 (25 U.S.C. 1772e); (3) The Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Florida; (4) Water supply for Everglades National Park; or (5) Water supply for fish and wildlife.  385.37 Flood protection.  Engineers and the non-Federal sponsor may consider opportunities to provide additional flood protection consistent with restoration of the natural system, and the provisions of section 601(f)(2)(B) of WRDA 2000 and other applicable laws.  385.38 Interim goals.  (a) General. In accordance with section 601 of WRDA 2000, flood protection, consistent with restoration, preservation, and protection of the natural system, is a purpose of the Plan. (b) Level of service. (1) For each Project Implementation Report, the level of service for flood protection that: (i) Was in existence on the date of enactment of section 601 of WRDA 2000; and (ii) Is in accordance with applicable law, shall be determined for the area affected by the project. (2) The Project Implementation Report shall include analyses to demonstrate that the level of service for flood protection in paragraph (b)(1) of this section will not be reduced by implementation of the project. (c) Improved and new flood protection benefits. The overarching objective of the Plan is the restoration, preservation, and protection of the South Florida Ecosystem while providing for other water-related needs of the region, including water supply and flood protection. In preparing the Project Implementation Report, the Corps of  (a) Agreement. The Secretary, the Secretary of the Interior, and the Governor shall, by December 31, 2003, and in consultation with the Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Florida, the Seminole Tribe of Florida, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Department of Commerce, the Florida Department of Environmental Protection, and other Federal, State, and local agencies, and the South Florida Ecosystem Restoration Task Force, execute an Interim Goals Agreement establishing interim goals to facilitate inter-agency planning, monitoring and assessment so as to achieve the overarching objectives of the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan and to ensure the means by which the restoration success of the Plan may be evaluated, and ultimately reported to the Congress pursuant to  385.40 throughout the implementation process. (b) Purpose. (1) Interim goals are targets by which the restoration success of the Plan may be evaluated at specific points by agency managers, the State, and Congress throughout the overall planning and implementation process. In addition, interim goals will facilitate adaptive management and allow the Corps of Engineers and its non-federal sponsors opportunities to make adjustments if actual project performance is less than anticipated, including recommending any changes to the Plan. Interim goals are not intended to be standards or schedules enforceable in court. (2) To ensure flexibility in implementing the Plan over the next several decades, and to ensure that interim goals may reflect changed circumstances or new information resulting from adaptive management, the interim goals may be modified, consistent with the processes set forth in paragraph (c) of this section, to reflect new information resulting from changed or unforeseen circumstances, new scientific or technical information, new or updated models, or information developed through the adaptive assessment principles contained in the Plan, or future authorized changes to the Plan. (3) The Corps of Engineers and the South Florida Water Management District and other non-Federal sponsors shall sequence and schedule projects as  necessary to achieve the interim goals and the targets for achieving progress towards other water-related needs of the region provided for in the Plan, to the extent practical given funding, technical, or other constraints. (4) If the interim goals have not been met or are unlikely to be met, then the Corps of Engineers and the South Florida Water Management District shall: (i) Document why the interim goals have not been met or are unlikely to be met and either (ii) Develop a plan of action that achieves the interim goals as soon as practical consistent with the other objectives of the Plan, and initiate adaptive management actions pursuant to  385.31(c) based on the plan of action; or (iii) Recommend changes to the interim goals in accordance with paragraph (b)(2) of this section. (c) Process for establishing interim goals. (1) In developing proposed goals for inclusion in the Interim Goals Agreement, the Secretary, the Secretary of the Interior, and the Governor, shall be provided with, and consider, the technical recommendations of RECOVER and any modifications to those recommendations by the Corps of Engineers or the South Florida Water Management District. These recommendations shall be provided no later than June 30, 2003. Thereafter, the Secretary, the Secretary of the Interior, and the Governor shall provide a notice of availability of the proposed agreement to the public in the Federal Register, seek public comments, and consult with the Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Florida, the Seminole Tribe of Florida, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Department of the Commerce, the Florida Department of Environmental Protection, and other Federal, State, and local agencies, and the South Florida Ecosystem Restoration Task Force. After considering comments of the public and consulted agencies on the proposed agreement, and incorporating any suggestions that are appropriate and consistent with the goals and purposes of the Plan, the Secretary, the Secretary of the Interior, and the Governor, shall execute the final agreement, and provide a notice of availability to the public in the Federal Register by no later than December 31, 2003. (2) In developing its recommendations for interim goals, RECOVER shall use the principles in paragraph (d) of this section.

Thereafter, the Secretary, the Secretary of the Interior, and the Governor shall revise the interim goals as appropriate and execute a new agreement every five years. However, they may revise interim goals whenever appropriate as new information becomes available. Any revisions to interim goals shall be adopted consistent with the process established pursuant to this part. (d) Principles for developing interim goals. (1) RECOVER, using best available science and information, shall recommend a set of interim goals for implementation of CERP, consisting of regional hydrologic performance targets, improvements in water quality, and anticipated ecological responses for areas such as, Lake Okeechobee, the Kissimmee River Region, the Water Conservation Areas, the Lower East Coast, the Upper East Coast, the Everglades Agricultural Area, and the Caloosahatchee River, Everglades National Park, Big Cypress National Preserve, and the estuaries. These interim goals shall reflect the incremental accomplishment of the expected performance level of the Plan, and will identify improvements in quantity, quality, timing and distribution of water in five-year increments beginning in 2005. The interim goals shall be predicted by appropriate models and tools and shall provide a quantitative basis for evaluating the restoration success of the Plan during the period of implementation. The expected performance level of the Plan is generally represented by the output of the model run of D13R as described in the ``Final Integrated Feasibility Report and Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement'' dated April 1, 1999, as modified by section 601 of WRDA 2000, or any subsequent modification authorized in law. In developing the interim goals for the five-year increments, RECOVER shall use the Master Implementation Sequencing Plan as the basis for predicting the increments. RECOVER may recommend additional interim goals for implementation of CERP in addition to those initially developed and may propose revisions to the initial set of hydrologic interim goals as new information is gained through adaptive management. (2) In developing its recommendations for interim goals, RECOVER shall consider indicators including, but not limited to: (i) Hydrologic indicators, including:  (a) Purpose. (1) The overarching objective of the Plan is the restoration, preservation, and protection of the South Florida ecosystem while providing for other water-related needs of the region, including water supply and flood protection. Progress towards providing for these other water-related needs shall also be evaluated. (2) As provided for in paragraph (b) of this section, the Corps of Engineers and the South Florida Water Management District shall establish targets for evaluating progress towards achieving other water-related needs of the region, including water supply and flood protection, throughout the implementation process. (3) The Corps of Engineers and the South Florida Water Management District and other non-Federal sponsors shall sequence and schedule projects as necessary to achieve the targets for other water-related needs of the region provided for in the Plan, consistent with the interim goals established pursuant to  385.38, to the extent practical given funding, technical, or other constraints. (4) If the targets for evaluating progress towards achieving other water-  related needs of the region have not been met or are unlikely to be met, then the Corps of Engineers and the South Florida Water Management District shall: (i) Document why the targets have not been met or are unlikely to be met; and either (ii) Develop a plan of action that achieves the targets as soon as practical consistent with the purposes of the Plan and initiate adaptive management actions pursuant to  385.31(c) based on the plan of action; or (iii) Adopt changes to the targets in accordance with paragraph (b)(3) of this section. (b) Process for establishing targets. (1) Not later than June 30, 2003 RECOVER shall develop recommendations on targets to evaluate progress on achieving the other water-related needs of the region, for consideration by the Corps of Engineers and the South Florida Water Management District, in consultation with the Department of the Interior, the Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Florida, the Seminole Tribe of Florida, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Department of Commerce, the Florida Department of Environmental Protection, and other Federal, State, and local agencies. The Corps of Engineers and the South Florida Water Management District shall also consult with the South Florida Ecosystem Restoration Task Force in establishing targets for evaluating progress towards achieving other water-related needs of the region provided for in the Plan. These targets shall be established by the Corps of Engineers and the South Florida Water Management District by December 30, 2003. Targets for evaluating progress towards achieving other water-related needs of the region provided for in the Plan are intended to facilitate inter-agency planning, monitoring, and assessment throughout the implementation process and are not intended to be standards or schedules enforceable in court. (2) In accordance with  385.18, the Corps of Engineers and the South Florida Water Management District shall provide the public with opportunities to review and comment on proposed targets. (3) The Corps of Engineers and the South Florida Water Management District shall review the targets for evaluating progress towards achieving the other water-related needs of the region under the Plan at a minimum every five years beginning in 2005, to determine if they should be revised, and revise them as appropriate.

These targets shall reflect the incremental accomplishment of the expected performance level of the Plan, and will identify improvements in quantity, quality, timing and distribution of water in five-year increments beginning in 2005. The targets shall be predicted by appropriate models and tools and shall provide a quantitative basis for evaluating progress on achieving other water-related needs of the region provided for in the Plan during the period of implementation. The expected performance level of the Plan is generally represented by the output of the model run of D13R as described in the ``Final Integrated Feasibility Report and Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement'' dated April 1, 1999, as modified by section 601 of WRDA 2000, or any subsequent modification authorized in law. In developing the targets for the five-year increments, RECOVER shall use the Master Implementation Sequencing Plan as the basis for predicting the increments. RECOVER may recommend additional targets for implementation of CERP in addition to those initially developed and may propose revisions to the initial set of hydrologic targets as new information is gained through adaptive management. (2) In developing its recommendations for targets, RECOVER shall consider the following indicators, but not limited to: (i) The frequency of water restrictions in the Lower East Coast Service Areas at each time increment. (ii) The frequency of water restrictions in the Lake Okeechobee Service Areas at each time increment. (iii) The frequency of meeting saltwater intrusion protection criteria for the Lower East Coast Service Area at each time increment.  385.40 Reports to Congress.  50573  (a) Beginning on October 1, 2005 and periodically thereafter until October 1, 2036, the Secretary and the Secretary of the Interior shall jointly submit to Congress a report on the implementation of the Plan as required by section 601(l) of WRDA 2000. Such reports shall be completed not less often than every 5 years. (b) This report shall be prepared in consultation with the Environmental Protection Agency, the Department of Commerce, the Seminole Tribe of Florida, the Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Florida, the Florida Department of Environmental Protection, the South Florida Water Management District, and other Federal, State, and local agencies and the South Florida Ecosystem Restoration Task Force. (c) Such reports shall include a description of planning, design, and construction work completed, the amount of funds expended during the period covered by the report, including a detailed analysis of the funds expended for adaptive management, and the work anticipated over the next 5year period and updated estimates of total CERP cost and individual component costs and an explanation of any changes from the initial estimates contained in the ``Final Integrated Feasibility Report and Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement,'' dated April 1, 1999. (d) In addition, each report shall include: (1) The determination of each Secretary, and the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, concerning the benefits to the natural system and the human environment  achieved as of the date of the report and whether the completed projects of the Plan are being operated in a manner that is consistent with the requirements of section 601(h) of WRDA 2000; (2) Progress towards the interim goals established in accordance with  385.38; (3) Progress towards achieving targets for other water-related needs of the region provided for in the Plan established pursuant  385.39; and (4) A review of the activities performed by the Secretary pursuant to section 601(k) of WRDA 2000 and  385.18 and  385.19 as they relate to socially and economically disadvantaged individuals and individuals with limited English proficiency.

GX267-93-9587196	"CHAPTER 2 THE SECTION 106 REVIEW PROCESS  2-1   CHAPTER 2 THE SECTION 106 REVIEW PROCESS 2.0 OVERVIEW This Handbook chapter addresses applicable requirements set forth in Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) of 1966 (as amended). Section 106 pertains to actions performed, assisted, permitted, or licensed by a federal agency that may affect historic properties. In regard to most transportation projects in Florida, this is generally the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) acting in concert with its agent, the Florida Department of Transportation (FDOT). Although this discussion is in terms of federal involvement, these actions apply to all levels of projects proposed by the FDOT because state laws and Florida's historic preservation compliance review program parallel the federal process for Section 106 review. In the case of transportation projects, the four-step Section 106 process is initiated (Step 1) by the FHWA determining whether it has an undertaking that is a type of action that could affect historic properties. If not, the FHWA has no further obligations under Section 106. If potential effects may result, the FHWA identifies the proper parties with which to consult in the Section 106 process concerning the action. The FHWA then determines the appropriate scope of the resource identification process for the action and proceeds to identify (Step 2) potentially affected historic properties. If significant historic properties, i.e., those eligible for listing in the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP), are identified in the project's Area of Potential Effect, FHWA, in consultation with appropriate parties, makes an assessment of adverse effect on the significant historic resources (Step 3). If no adverse effects are identified the project may proceed. If adverse effects are identified the agency begins consultation to resolve these adverse effects (Step 4) by their avoidance, minimization, or mitigation. Consultation may result in a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) among consulting parties; the MOA outlines the measures to be taken to resolve the adverse effects. Occasionally, there is no way to resolve the adverse effects of an undertaking and the effects must be accepted in the public interest. The transportation undertaking then proceeds. This chapter presents a simplified description of the Section 106 process as implemented by 36 CFR Part 800 (revised, 1/11/01).  SECTION 2.1 2.2 2.3 2.4 2.5 2.6  CONTENTS Introduction to Section 106 of the NHPA FHWA and the Section 106 Process State Review and Section 106 Other Participants in the Section 106 Process Implementing Section 106: The Four Steps Featured Hyperlinks  PAGE 2-3 2-4 2-4 2-4 2-6 2-13  2-2   2.1 INTRODUCTION TO SECTION 106 OF THE NHPA The Section 106 process is a review procedure established by Congress in 1966. The procedures for this process are contained in Title 36 CFR Part 800 (""Protection of Historic Properties""), revised January 11, 2001. Section 106 represents the principal federal review process that looks at how historic properties are affected by projects funded by or under the jurisdiction of federal agencies. It is the statutory responsibility of the federal agency to fulfill the requirements of the Section 106 process and to ensure that an agency official with jurisdiction over an undertaking takes legal and financial responsibility for Section 106 compliance (36 CFR Part 800.2). Federal agencies under the U.S. Department of Transportation that may be involved in Section 106 actions include the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), the U.S. Coast Guard, the Federal Aviation Administration, the Federal Transit Administration, and the Federal Railroad Administration. Other federal agencies, such as the U.S. Corps of Engineers, may be involved in the Section 106 process involving transportation projects through the permitting functions of the agency. In the case of most transportation projects, the FDOT is primarily involved with the FHWA as the ""involved federal agency"" in terms Department activities and acts as the agent of the FHWA in such undertakings. The FHWA is thus designated as the coordinating agency in the Section 106 process throughout this Cultural Resource Management Handbook. Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966 (as amended) states that: The head of any federal agency having direct or indirect jurisdiction over a proposed federal or federally-assisted undertaking in any state and the head of any federal department or independent agency having authority to license any undertaking shall, prior to the approval of the expenditure of any federal funds on the undertaking or prior to the issuance of any license, as the case may be, take into account the effect of the undertaking on any district, site, building, structure, or object that is included in or eligible for inclusion in the NRHP. The head of any such federal agency shall afford the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation established under Title II of this Act a reasonable opportunity to comment with regard to such undertaking. In essence, Section 106 requires federal agencies to:   Consider the effects their actions (or actions they may assist, permit, or license) may have on NRHP-listed or eligible historic properties Provide the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation (ACHP) a reasonable opportunity to comment on such actions  The main purpose of Section 106 is to avoid, minimize, or mitigate impacts to significant historic properties resulting from federal actions. Technically, Section 106 applies to:    Properties that have been formally listed in the NRHP Properties that have been determined eligible for inclusion in the NRHP Properties that may be eligible but have not yet been identified and evaluated 2-3   The latter is critical to FHWA and FDOT since it is the responsibility of the federal agency involved to identify historic properties and ascertain their potential NRHP eligibility following the procedures outlined in the Advisory Council and National Park Service regulations, 36 CFR Part 800. The underlying philosophy behind Section 106 maintains that the optimal environment will possess a harmonious mix of old and new cultural resources. Section 106 also recognizes that it is not realistic, nor in the public interest, to preserve every historic resource. Therefore, Section 106 does not require preservation in every case, nor does it give the ACHP veto power over a federal agency's actions. It does, however, require full consideration of preservation values by federal agencies compared with the projected benefits of the completed undertaking, costs, and other factors. As a result, final actions performed by federal agencies and reviewed by the Section 106 process can range from avoidance to unmitigated loss of the historic property, as long as consideration of the effects and available options were carefully evaluated. 2.2 FHWA AND THE SECTION 106 PROCESS As a federal agency, FHWA is the lead agency and directly involved with the Section 106 review process. In turn, FDOT also participates in the Section 106 review process as the agent of the FHWA. Although policies and procedures change, the FDOT facilitates the 106 process by providing FHWA with the appropriate documentation and assistance at each step. This documentation includes, but is not limited to, Cultural Resource Assessment Surveys (CRASs), Section 106 Consultation Case Reports, and Agreement Documents such as Memoranda of Agreement (MOAs) or Programmatic Agreements (PAs). Additional assistance includes, but is not limited to, gathering of required information and documents, coordination of the Section 106 process, and participation in consultation meetings. 2.3 STATE REVIEW AND SECTION 106 For state-funded transportation projects with no federal funding or assistance, the provisions in Chapter 267, F.S., which mirror the NHPA Section 106 requirements, apply. In the case of state-funded projects, the lead agency is the FDOT. Section 106 has been incorporated as part of Florida's uniform historic preservation program. As noted in the DHR's program guidelines, this unified federal-state process avoids confusion. Florida's comprehensive historic preservation statutory framework complements that of the federal government. In many respects, Chapter 267, F.S. parallels the provisions of the federal NHPA of 1966 (as amended). 2.4 OTHER PARTICIPANTS IN THE SECTION 106 PROCESS In addition to FHWA and the Department, the revised Section 106 regulations (36 CFR Part 800.2(a)(4)) state that FHWA shall involve certain consulting parties in the findings and determinations made during the process. Such consultations should be appropriate to the scale of 2-4   the undertaking and the scope of federal involvement. Where applicable, this consultation process should be coordinated with agency procedures and mechanisms established to meet the requirements of other statutes such as those of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and other regulatory legislation. The consultation process involves seeking, discussing, and considering the views of other participants, and, where feasible, seeking agreement with them in matters arising in the Section 106 process (36 CFR Part 800.16(f)). Consulting parties in the Section 106 process include the following:  State Historic Preservation Officer (SHPO)  The Division of Historical Resources (DHR), of the Department of State, is Florida's primary historic preservation agency. The office of the State Historic Preservation Officer (SHPO) is established in DHR. The SHPO is appointed by the Governor and serves at the pleasure of the Secretary of State. The SHPO conducts relations with the representatives of the federal government and with respective states concerning matters of historic preservation. The Historic Preservation Compliance Review Section of DHR is responsible for reviewing and commenting on historic preservation work conducted under Section 106 and Chapter 267 F.S. (revised 2001). The SHPO reflects the interests of the state and its citizens in the preservation of their cultural heritage. The SHPO advises and assists federal agencies in carrying out their Section 106 responsibilities and cooperates with such agencies, local governments, organizations and individuals to ensure that historic properties are taken into consideration at all levels of planning and development (36 CFR Part 800.2 [c][1]).  Tribal Historic Preservation Officer (THPO)  Native American coordination, where applicable, is an important FHWA responsibility in the Section 106 process. The THPO is the tribal official appointed by a federally recognized tribe's chief governing body or designated by tribal ordinance or preservation program who has assumed the responsibilities of the SHPO for purposes of Section 106 compliance on tribal lands. Tribal lands refer to lands within the boundaries of any Indian reservation and all dependent Indian communities. A tribal historic preservation representative may be consulted if a THPO has not been officially appointed and certified. In the latter case, the SHPO will also be a consulting party concerning resources on tribal lands. The THPO or an appointed historic preservation representative should also be consulted concerning historic properties of interest to a tribe that are located off tribal lands. Again, the SHPO also participates as a consulting party in such cases. The FHWA must ensure, where applicable, that federally recognized Native American tribes have a reasonable opportunity to identify concerns, including those of traditional and cultural significance known as ""Traditional Cultural Properties,"" about significant cultural resources in all steps of the Section 106 process. It is FHWA's responsibility to make a reasonable and good faith effort to identify the appropriate tribes to be consulted. Furthermore, the need for confidentiality under certain circumstances should be recognized as an essential part of the consultation process. Finally, consultation with a Native American tribe must recognize the ""government-togovernment"" relationship that exists between the federal government and federally recognized 2-5   Native American tribes and should be conducted in a sensitive manner that is respectful of tribal sovereignty. For additional information, see Exhibit 2-1.  Advisory Council On Historic Preservation (ACHP)  The ACHP provides guidance and assistance in the consultation process and generally oversees the operation of the Section 106 process. The Council also consults with and comments to agency officials on individual undertakings and programs that affect historic properties. It may enter the process of its own accord to ensure adherence to proper policy and procedure or in response to a request from a participating party to provide advice, guidance, and assistance concerning a specific undertaking including functioning in dispute resolution.  Representatives of Local Governments  A representative of a local government with jurisdiction over the area in which the effects of an undertaking may occur is entitled to participate as a consulting party.  The Public  The views of the public (36 CFR Part 800.2[d]) are considered essential to informed decision-making in the Section 106 process. FHWA shall seek and consider the views of the public in a manner commensurate with the nature and complexity of an undertaking and its potential effects on historic properties. As in Native American coordination, confidentiality should be a consideration in certain circumstances. FHWA must, except where confidentiality is to be protected, provide the public with information about an undertaking and seek public comment and input. Where possible, FHWA may use the public involvement process associated with other regulatory requirements to fulfill its responsibility in this area if they are adequate to do so.  Additional Consulting Parties  Certain individuals and organizations with a demonstrated interest in an undertaking may participate as consulting parties in the Section 106 process (36 CFR Part 800.2[c][5]) due to the nature of their legal or economic relation to the undertaking or affected properties or due to their concern with the undertaking's effects on historic properties. 2.5 IMPLEMENTING SECTION 106 - THE FOUR STEPS The Section 106 process is briefly described in the following sections. For federally funded or assisted undertakings, the FHWA is ultimately responsible for completing the process and for coordination and consultation with the SHPO, the THPO or other appropriate tribal representative, if applicable, and the ACHP. As noted above, other consulting parties include representatives of local governments and the public. FDOT's responsibility is to provide FHWA with the appropriate documentation and assistance at each step in the Section 106 process. For state-funded projects, 2-6   the Department takes the responsibility for complying with the provisions of state historic preservation law with no FHWA involvement. The revised regulations (36 CFR Part 800), effective January 11, 2001, strengthen certain requirements of the Section 106 process and also attempt to ""streamline"" portions of the review. Consultation between the federal agency and other parties with an interest in the effects of an undertaking is stressed. Increased consultation with federally recognized Native American Tribes is emphasized especially in cases where the action occurs on tribal lands or involves resources of cultural or religious significance to a tribe on or off tribal lands. The revised regulations recommend commencing the review process at the early stages of project planning. The review process, which implements Section 106, is divided into four steps and is illustrated in the flow chart below: Step Step Step Step 1: 2: 3: 4: Initiate the Section 106 Process Identify Historic Properties Assess Adverse Effects Resolve Adverse Effects  Initiate Section 106 Process  Establish undertaking Identify appropriate SHPO/THPO Plan to involve the public Identify other consulting parties Undertaking is type that might affect historic properties Identify Historic Properties  No undertaking/no potential to cause effects  Determine scope of efforts Identify historic properties Evaluate historic significance Historic properties are affected Assess Adverse Effects  No historic properties affected  Apply criteria of adverse effect Historic properties are adversely affected Resolve Adverse Effects  No historic properties adversely affected  Continue consultation FAILURE TO AGREE  Memorandum of Agreement COUNCIL COMMENT  2-7   2.5.1  Step 1: Initiate the Section 106 Process  The FHWA first determines whether the proposed action is an ""undertaking"" as defined in the Section 106 regulations and, if so, whether it is the type of activity that has the potential to cause effects on historic properties. As noted in Chapter 1 of this Handbook, historic properties are significant cultural resources, that is, those that meet the criteria for inclusion in the NRHP. An ""undertaking"" is defined in 36 CFR Part 800.16(y) as follows: ""a project, activity, or program funded in whole or part under the direct or indirect jurisdiction of a federal agency, including those carried out by or on behalf of a federal agency; those carried out with federal financial assistance; those requiring a federal permit, license or approval; and those subject to state or local regulations administered pursuant to a delegation or approval by a federal agency."" If the undertaking is concluded to be a type of activity that does not have the potential to affect historic properties, if they were indeed present, then the agency has no further obligations under Section 106. This decision is unilaterally made by FHWA but the ACHP may issue an advisory opinion on the validity of this decision. If the undertaking is determined to have the potential to affect historic properties, assuming that such resources were present, the FHWA must identify the appropriate SHPO and/or THPO (see 2.4) to consult in the Section 106 process. FHWA then consults with the SHPO/THPO to identify other potential consulting parties (36 CFR Part 800.3) concerning the proposed action and is responsible for inviting them to participate. This consultation process with the SHPO/THPO also includes developing a plan to involve the public in the Section 106 process by identifying the appropriate points to seek public input and for notifying the public of proposed actions. Where practicable, existing agency public involvement procedures can be used in this process if they are adequate in assuring compliance with Section 106 requirements. So too, is coordinating the Section 106 review with reviews required under other authorities such as NEPA. The public outreach effort should reflect the nature and complexity of the undertaking, the potential effects involved, and the projected public interest in the project. Confidentiality should also be considered in cases where resources may be threatened by public disclosure. This is especially the case where resources considered of religious or cultural significance to Native American tribes are involved. FHWA should consult with the SHPO/THPO in a manner appropriate for the agency planning process for the undertaking and to the nature of the undertaking and its effects on historic properties (36 CFR Part 800.3[c][3]). In other words, it is important that FHWA involve other participating parties in the Section 106 process in the project planning process and that the required consultation should be commensurate with the characteristics of the undertaking and its projected potential to affect historic properties. Policies and procedures pertinent to these issues can be found in the FDOT Project Development and Environment Manual (PD&E), Part 2, Chapter 12, entitled ""Archaeological And Historical Resources"" and Part 1, Chapter 3, entitled, ""Class of Action Determinations."" 2-8   Once the determination has been made that the undertaking has the potential to affect historic properties, if present, and the consultation process has been initiated, the second step in the Section 106 process is implemented (see flow chart on page 2-7). 2.5.2 Step 2: Identify Historic Properties  This step in the Section 106 process occurs when a determination has been made that the undertaking may have the potential to affect historic properties, that is, significant archaeological and/or historical cultural resources. It involves FHWA and its agent, the FDOT, in determining the scope of the resource identification effort, conducting a cultural resource assessment survey tailored to the magnitude of the project and its potential for effects on historic properties, and in evaluating the significance of any cultural resources identified in the assessment process. If it is determined that the proposed project could affect historic properties, FHWA, in consultation with the SHPO and/or THPO, determine and document the Area of Potential Effect (APE) for the undertaking. The APE is the geographic area or areas within which an undertaking may directly or indirectly cause alterations in the character or use of historic properties (36 CFR Part 800.16[d]), that is, affect the qualities for which the resource has been determined significant according to the National Register criteria. Once again, the nature and magnitude of the undertaking and its concomitant potential to cause effects is a critical element in the determination of the APE. The scoping process of the resource identification effort involves, as applicable, a review of existing historic properties within the APE including any data concerning possible historic properties not yet identified. Information is sought from consulting parties identified in Step 1 and, as appropriate, from any other individuals or organizations that are likely to have knowledge concerning cultural resources in the area. The gathering of such information includes consultation as noted above, background research involving prior studies, oral history interviews where appropriate, and sample field investigation where necessary. At this stage, it is also important to gather information from appropriate federally recognized Native American tribes concerning archaeological resources that may be of religious or cultural significance to them on or off tribal lands. When appropriate, confidentially issues should be considered (36 CFR Part 800.11[c]) to protect any historic properties that may be identified. Based on the background information gathered, and in consultation with participating parties, a cultural resource assessment survey (CRAS) is conducted appropriate to the nature of the undertaking and its potential effects. Part 2, Chapter 12 of the FDOT Project Development and Environment Manual discusses level of survey in regard to various undertakings. The cultural resource assessment survey process and its proper documentation are discussed in detail in Chapters 3 and 5 of this Handbook. Where project alternatives consist of corridors or involve large land areas, or where access to property is restricted, FHWA may use a phased process to conduct identification and evaluation efforts. If cultural resources, archaeological or historical are identified within the APE as a result of the CRAS, they are evaluated for significance according to National Register criteria. The evaluation process for cultural resources is discussed in detail in Chapter 4 of this Handbook. If FHWA and the consulting parties agree on the potential significance of a resource or resources encountered, then the evaluation process is complete. If the participating parties do not agree, than the Keeper of the National Register may be requested to make a determination of 2-9   National Register eligibility for the resource (see 36 CFR Part 63). A participant in the Section 106 process may also request that the ACHP become involved in this determination effort. Two possible findings are possible as a result of Step 2 in the Section 106 process. If the FHWA finds that there are no historic properties present or that there are historic properties present but that the undertaking will have no effect on them, a finding of ""No Historic Properties Affected"" is issued (see flow chart on page 2-7). This finding is fully documented to the SHPO/ THPO according to documentation requirements listed in 36 CFR Part 800.11(d). All consulting parties are notified and documentation is made available for public inspection prior to approving the undertaking. If the SHPO/THPO or ACHP, if it has entered the process, does not object to the finding within 30 days of the receipt of the finding, the FHWA's obligations under Section 106 are fulfilled. If the FHWA determines that there are historic properties that may be affected by the undertaking then a ""Historic Properties Affected"" finding results and Step 3 of the Section 106 process is initiated (see flow chart on page 2-7). This is also the case if the SHPO/THPO or ACHP, if involved, object to the finding of ""No Historic Properties Affected."" In this instance, the FHWA shall notify all consulting parties and invite their views on the effects and proceed to assess adverse effects in Step 3 of the Section 106 process. 2.5.3 Step 3: Assess Adverse Effects  If historic properties are determined to be potentially affected in the APE, FHWA applies the Criteria of Adverse Effect to these resources. In doing so, FHWA considers any views concerning such effects that have been provided by consulting parties and the public. An adverse effect is found when an undertaking may alter, directly or indirectly, any of the characteristics of a resource that qualify the property for inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places. Adverse effects are those that would diminish the integrity of the properties location, design, setting, materials, workmanship, feeling or association. Adverse effects may include reasonably foreseeable effects caused by the undertaking that may occur later in time, be further removed in distance, or be cumulative (36 CFR Part 800.5[a]). Adverse effects can range from physical destruction or damage to all or part of the property by the undertaking to the improper provision of handicapped access that is not consistent with The Secretary of the Interior 's Standards for the Treatment of Historic Properties (36 CFR Part 68) and applicable guidelines. The Criteria of Adverse Effect are fully described and discussed in Chapter 6 of this Handbook. It is important to note that former ""exceptions"" to the Criteria of Adverse Effect determination have been eliminated in the new Section 106 process (revised, 1/11/01). These include alterations to a historic property not in accordance with the Secretary's Standards (noted above) and the transfer, sale, or lease of a historic property out of federal ownership or control without proper legal restrictions or covenants assuring its protection. The exception for data recovery regarding archaeological sites, that is, excavation for the scientific knowledge the site contained, has also been eliminated. Such action is now considered an adverse effect. FHWA considers the views of the SHPO/THPO and other consulting parties and the public 2-10   in applying the Criteria of Adverse Effect. FHWA may propose a finding of ""No Adverse Effect"" (NAE) when the undertaking's effects do not meet those established in the Criteria. FHWA documents the finding of NAE and provides it to all consulting parties. The SHPO/THPO has 30 days from the receipt of adequate documentation to review the finding. If there is no disagreement with this finding, FHWA may proceed with the undertaking. If the SHPO/THPO does not respond within 30 days of the receipt of the finding FHWA may consider this as agreement of the SHPO/ THPO with the finding. FHWA must maintain a record of the finding (36 CFR Part 800.5[d][1]) and provide information to the public upon request while respecting confidentiality considerations, if applicable. If the undertaking changes prior to its implementation, FHWA must reopen the consultation process concerning the project. If the SHPO/THPO or any consulting parties disagree with FHWA's NAE finding in the 30day review period, FHWA will either consult with the objecting party to resolve the disagreement or request the ACHP to review the finding. FHWA provides all pertinent documentation to the ACHP. The ACHP will notify FHWA of its determination as to whether the adverse effect criteria have been correctly applied within 15 days of having received the documented finding. The ACHP will specify the basis for its final determination and this determination will be binding. FHWA will proceed according to this determination. If the ACHP does not respond to the FHWA in the allotted 15 day time frame following receipt of documentation from FHWA, the agency may assume ACHP concurrence with its NAE finding and proceed accordingly. If it is determined by FHWA and the consulting parties that an ""Adverse Effect"" to a historic property or properties has occurred as a result of the undertaking, then consultation continues under Step 4 of the Section 106 process (see flow chart on page 2-7) to resolve the adverse effect(s). 2.5.4 Step 4: Resolve Adverse Effects  In this step, FHWA continues the consultation process established in Step 3 in an attempt to resolve the undertaking's adverse effect on a historic property. As previously noted, an adverse effect is one that results in the alteration of any of the characteristics of a significant cultural resource that qualifies the property for inclusion in the National Register. FHWA consults with the SHPO/THPO and other consulting parties to develop and evaluate alternatives or modifications to the undertaking that could avoid, minimize, or mitigate the adverse effect to the property. FHWA also notifies the ACHP of the adverse effect finding and provides appropriate documentation to the Council. This documentation includes a description of the undertaking and APE, information about the identification process and affected historic properties, a discussion of project effects and why the adverse effect finding is applicable, and the views of the consulting parties on the process. The ACHP will advise the agency and the consulting parties within 15 days of receipt of the finding and the documentation as to whether it will participate in the consultation. The ACHP may also enter the process for other reasons such as a request from an involved party or if a National Historic Landmark is involved in the undertaking. If the ACHP decides not to participate, FHWA continues to proceed with the consultation process. At this point, FHWA, the SHPO/THPO, and the ACHP (if participating), may agree to 2-11   invite other individuals or organizations to become consulting parties. This will certainly be the case for any individual or organization that will assume a specific role or responsibility in the development and implementation of an MOA concerning resolution of the adverse effect. FHWA provides all appropriate documentation to consulting parties subject to the confidentiality provisions of 36 CFR Part 800.11(c). FHWA also makes similar information available to the public and provides the public with an opportunity to express their views on resolving the adverse effects of the undertaking. If the ACHP is not participating, FHWA consults with the SHPO/THPO and the other consulting parties to devise ways to avoid, minimize, or mitigate the adverse effects. First consideration is given to alternative ways of accomplishing the agency's goals without unacceptably damaging the National Register listed or eligible property. This may include consideration of alternative sites, alternative alignments, and alternative designs as well as the ""no build"" option, which can be used to evaluate the importance of the undertaking against the severity of its effects. If the consulting parties find that the consideration of such alternatives does not result in a viable solution that best serves the public interest, they can proceed to a discussion of mitigation measures. Mitigation refers to actions that reduce or compensate for the impacts an undertaking may have on a National Register listed or eligible property. This process and options are described and discussed in detail in Chapters 6, 7, and 8 of this Handbook. If the consulting parties agree on how to resolve the adverse effects, a MOA will be executed. These parties will typically become signatories to the MOA along with others who may be invited to sign. The MOA is the document that records the terms and conditions agreed upon to resolve the adverse effects of an undertaking on historic properties. The executed MOA with appropriate documentation will be submitted to the ACHP prior to proceeding with the undertaking. If the consulting parties fail to agree on the terms of the MOA, FHWA will request the ACHP to join the consultation process. The Council will either join the process or proceed to comment on the process to the agency in which case the agency head must take the comments into account before reaching a final decision on the undertaking. It should also be remembered that the ACHP had the right to join the process when originally contacted by FHWA concerning the adverse effect and participated as a consulting party throughout the process. In some cases, it may be agreed that there are no mitigation measures available and that the adverse effects must be accepted in the public interest. On the other hand, consulting parties may occasionally not be able to come to mutual agreement concerning the undertaking and its effects. In this case, FHWA, the SHPO and/or THPO, or the ACHP (if participating) may decide to terminate consultation. If this occurs, FHWA requests the ACHP's comments in accordance with 36 CFR Part 800.7(c). The head of the federal agency shall then take into account the Council's comments before reaching a final decision on the undertaking. The agency head will document the final decision on the undertaking that includes the rationale for the final decision and demonstrates that the Council's comments have been duly considered. This documentation will be provided to the ACHP, all consulting parties, and to the public for notification purposes. FHWA will either proceed or not proceed with the undertaking at this point. Either way, this concludes the Section 106 process and satisfies the FHWA's statutory responsibilities under Section 106 of the NHPA of 1966 (as amended). 2-12   2.6 FEATURED HYPERLINKS 36 CFR Part 63 - Determinations of eligibility for inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places http://archnet.asu.edu/archnet/topical/crm/crmusdoc.html 36 CFR Part 68  The Secretary of the Interior 's Standards for the Treatment of Historic Properties http://archnet.asu.edu/archnet/topical/crm/crmusdoc.html 36 CFR Part 800  Protection of Historic Properties http://www.achp.gov/regs.html 36 Part 800.2 - Participants in the Section 106 process http://www.achp.gov/regs.html#800.2 36 CFR Part 800.3 - Initiation of the Section 106 process http://www.achp.gov/regs.html#800.3 36 CFR Part 800.5 - Assessment of adverse effects http://www.achp.gov/regs.html#800.5 36 CFR Part 800.7 - Failure to resolve adverse effects http://www.achp.gov/regs.html#800.7 36 CFR Part 800.11 - Documentation standards http://www.achp.gov/regs.html#800.11 36 CFR Part 800.16 - Definitions http://www.achp.gov/regs.html#800.16 48 FR 44716  Professional Qualification Standards - 1983 http://www2.cr.nps.gov/laws/ProfQual83.htm Advisory Council on Historic Preservation (ACHP) http://www.achp.gov/ Chapter 267, F.S.: Historical Resources http://www.leg.state.fl.us/Statutes/index.cfm?Tab=Statutes&Submenu=1 Division of Historical Resources (DHR) http://dhr.dos.state.fl.us FDOT PD&E Manual http://www.dot.state.fl.us/emo/pubs/pdeman/pdeman.htm 2-13   Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/ National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) http://ceq.eh.doe.gov/nepa/regs/nepa/nepaeqia.htm National Historic Preservation Act of 1966 http://www2.cr.nps.gov/laws/NHPA1966.htm National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) http://www.cr.nps.gov/nr/index.htm  2-14   EXHIBIT 2.1 NATIVE AMERICAN CONSULTATION EFFORTS  2-15   NATIVE AMERICAN CONSULTATION EFFORTS Federal regulations (36 CFR part 800), effective January 11, 2001, require that federal agencies consult with federally recognized Native American tribes in all phases of the Section 106 process when an agency undertaking may have the potential to affect Native American historic properties on or off tribal lands. The Department acts as the agent of the FHWA in many aspects of the consultation process but the FHWA is ultimately responsible for compliance with the requirements of the regulations implementing Section 106 of the NHPA. The objective of Native American consultation is to conduct good faith efforts to elicit information from the appropriate tribes concerning properties of traditional or historical importance to them. Under Section 106 of the tation programs for the state. As FHWA. It is, therefore, the resp effort to identify the appropriate NHPA, FDOT acts as the agent of FHWA in enacting transpornoted above, the ultimate decisionmaking authority rests with onsibility of the FHWA to make a reasonable and good faith tribes to be consulted.  The Section 106 regulations define consultation as the ""process of seeking, discussing, and considering the views of other participants, and, where feasible, seeking agreement with them regarding matters arising in the section 106 process"" (36 CFR Part 800 Section 800.16(f)).  As defined in the NHPA and the implementing regulations, Indian tribes are those tribes that have received formal recognition by the United States. Specifically, ""Indian tribe means an Indian tribe, band, nation, or other organized group or community...., which is recognized as eligible for the special programs and services provided by the United States to Indians because of their status as Indians"" (36CFR Part 800 Section 800.16 (m)). In Florida, consultation takes place with the following five federally recognized tribes:       T T T T T  h h h h h  e e e e e  Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Florida Muscogee Creek Nation Poarch Band of Creek Indians Seminole Nation of Oklahoma, and Seminole Tribe of Florida  All five tribes are part of the former Creek Confederacy with ancestral lands throughout the southeastern United States. Two tribes currently reside and have tribal lands in the state: the Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Florida and the Seminole Tribe of Florida. Although the Muscogee Creek Nation, the Poarch Band of Creek Indians and the Seminole Nation of Oklahoma do not currently have reservation lands in the state, they at one time lived in Florida and have a 2-16   direct historical and cultural association with the state. They, therefore, are tribes that are culturally affiliated with the state of Florida. Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Florida The Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Florida was originally part of the same group of Creek Indians as the Seminole Tribe who fought against the U.S. government during the Seminole Wars of the 1800s. They took refuge in the Everglades during these wars and were part of the small group that was not removed to Oklahoma following the war. Eventually, they split from the Seminole Tribe to become an independent tribe and, in 1962, were formally recognized by the U.S. government. Today, they have a population of approximately 550 individuals and three reservation areas in the state of Florida: Tamiami Trail, Alligator Alley and Krome Avenue. The Tamiami Trail Reservation area, located 40 miles west of Miami, is the site of most tribal operations, and the center of the Miccosukee Indian population. Alligator Alley is the largest of the Tribe's reservations, comprising 74,812.37 acres. It is located west of Ft. Lauderdale, Florida, lying north and south of State Highway 84 (Alligator Alley), and includes a service station plaza, a Miccosukee Police Substation, wetlands, and land used for cattle grazing. The Krome Avenue reservation consists of the Miccosukee Gaming Facility and Convention Center and the Miccosukee Tobacco Shop, located at the intersection of Krome Avenue and Tamiami Trail. For additional information consult the Miccosukee website (http://www.miccosukee.com). Muscogee Creek Nation The Muscogee (Creek) people are descendents of a culture that, before AD 1500, spanned the entire region known today as the Southeastern United States. Early ancestors of the Muscogee constructed earthen pyramids along the rivers of this region as part of their elaborate ceremonial complexes. The historic Muscogee later built expansive towns within these same broad river valleys in the present states of Alabama, Georgia, Florida and South Carolina. In the removal treaty of 1832, Muscogee leadership exchanged the last of their ancestral homelands for new lands in Indian Territory (Oklahoma). The U.S. Army enforced the removal of more than 20,000 Muscogee (Creeks) to Indian Territory in 1836 and 1837. Today, the Muscogee Creek Nation is located in Oklahoma and has land claims in the Florida panhandle. The tribal headquarters is located in Okmulgee, Oklahoma, and the tribe has approximately 44,000 tribal members. It, along with the Seminole Nation, is considered one of the ""five civilized tribes,"" a name bestowed by the U.S government because of the belief that these tribes adapted more quickly than others to European ways. Additional information on the Muscogee Creek Nation can be found at http://www.ocevnet.org/ creek. Poarch Band of Creek Indians The Poarch Band of Creek Indians was historically part of the Creek Confederacy with territory primarily in Georgia and Alabama. The Poarch represent one of the few groups that was not removed to Indian Territory by the United States government, and have lived together for nearly 150 years. They have a 400-acre reservation in southern Alabama on the Florida border, 2-17   but tribal members also live off-reservation in Escambia County, Florida. Federal recognition was obtained in 1984 and, currently, there are approximately 2,127 members of the Poarch Band of Creek Indians. Additional information on the Poarch Band of Creek Indians can be found at http://www.poarchcreekindians.org. Seminole Nation of Oklahoma In 1856, the U.S government established the Seminole Nation of Oklahoma in Indian Territory. They are historically associated with the Seminole Tribe of Florida and represent the more than 3,000 Seminoles who were removed from Florida by the U.S government at the end of the Seminole Wars in the 1800s. Consequently, the Seminole Nation considers Florida its ancestral home and has historical and cultural connections to the state. The tribal headquarters are located at Wewoka (meaning Barking Waters), which is the county seat of Seminole County. The Seminole Nation of Oklahoma currently has around 12,000 enrolled tribal members, of which about 60 percent live within or near the Seminole Nation boundaries. Except for about 700 not living in Oklahoma, the remaining 40 percent of tribal members live in other parts of the state. Additional information about the Seminole Nation of Oklahoma can be found on its website at http: //www.cowboy.net/native/seminole. Seminole Tribe of Florida The Seminoles are composed of various culturally related Creek tribes that began to migrate into northern Florida sometime before 1750. In all likelihood, those Indians who survived the period of European settlement and the resultant diseases were absorbed into the Seminole Tribe as they migrated south into Florida. During and following the Seminole Wars, approximately 300 Seminoles took refuge in the Everglades and avoided removal to Indian Territory. Their descendants form the Seminole Tribe of Florida. In 1957, a majority of these people voted to establish an administrative entity called the Seminole Tribe of Florida and, in that same year, the U.S. Congress officially recognized them as an Indian tribe. Those who chose to not become members of the newly-formed Seminole Tribe either remained independent or eventually joined together to form the Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Florida. Today, the Seminole Tribe of Florida has almost 3,000 members living on six reservations across the peninsula: Hollywood (formerly Dania), Big Cypress, Brighton, Fort Pierce, Immokalee, and Tampa. Additional information on the Seminole Tribe of Florida can be found at http://www.seminoletribe.com Consultation Meetings: An Ongoing Dialogue Native American consultation can be challenging and complicated given the history of Indian and government relations in the United States and widely varying and disparate cultural perspectives. The FHWA and the Department have worked diligently with the tribes to establish the trust relationships and mutual understanding essential to successful coordination efforts. FHWA, SHPO, and the Department are currently involved in ongoing consultation meetings with representatives of the Native American tribes living in or having cultural affiliation with Florida. This dialogue has its foundation in Section 106 discussion meetings and project related coordination begun in 1999. The objectives of the current meetings are to build partnerships and to identify 2-18   transportation-related issues of concern to both the agencies and tribes. These issues include:          Establishing effective communication channels; Establishing appropriate communication protocols; Enhancing mutual respect and understanding; Encouraging growth of cultural sensitivity; Understanding roles and responsibilities under pertinent laws and regulations; Respecting tribal sovereignty; Understanding agency concerns for production schedules and costs; Understanding tribal concerns for Native American sacred and cultural resources; and Streamlining the consultation process.  The ultimate goal of this Native American consultation effort is to complete a Memorandum of Understanding between the agencies and tribes that will ensure compliance with Section 106 of the NHPA and expedite the consultation process Major Issues Coordination with the five federally recognized tribes represents a developing and evolving process that, to date, has identified the following four major issues of concern to the tribes: 1 2 3 4 . . . . Government-to-government relationship Confidentiality Human Remains Archaeological Sites  Government-to-Government Relationship C o n s u l t a t i o n w i t h a N a t i v e A m e r i c a n t r i b e m u s t r e c o g n i z e t h e "" g o v e r n m e n t - t o - g o v e r nment"" relationship that exists between the federal government and federally recognized Native A m e r i c a n t r i b e s a n d s h o u l d b e c o n d u c t e d i n a s e n s i t i v e m a n n e r t h a t i s r e s p e c t f u l o f t r i b a l s o vereignty. Indian tribes are sovereign governments that exist within the boundaries of the United States. As such, the U.S government has a unique relationship with the tribes that derives from the Constitution, treaties, Supreme Court decisions, and federal laws and authorities. Therefore, all initial coordination efforts must take place on a government-to-government level. Technically, this means that the head of FHWA coordinates directly with each tribal Chief or Chairperson. In recognition that this may not be workable on a day-to-day basis, the FHWA, in conjunction with the FDOT, initiated the government-to-government relationship with each of the five tribes and is in the process of developing a workable protocol that will satisfy tribal and agency objectives. While the proper protocol is being established, Native American tribes should be kept informed of each step of the Section 106 process.  2-19   Until the official protocol and procedures for conducting consultation are completed, the District Cultural Resource Mangers should contact the FDOT Native American Coordinator with questions regarding the information to be provided to the tribes. Confidentiality Native American people are often ""held to norms of secrecy and confidentiality"" when dealing with sacred information, and the mere act of revelation to an outsider can constitute a violation of traditional religious and cultural norms. Because of this, Indian tribes are often concerned about revealing the locations of their religious and cultural sites. Providing such information on traditional use areas, such as plant gathering places, ceremonial centers, and burial mounds, to the public may also lead to the disruption of its use or even destruction by curious or ill-intentioned people. Section 204 of the NHPA allows agencies to withhold information regarding an undertaking or its effects if it determines that such information would:    Cause a significant invasion of privacy; Risk harm to the resource; or Impede the use of a traditional religious site by its practitioners.  Additionally, legislation enacted by the Florida state legislature in January 2002 exempts the locations of archaeological sites in Florida from the provisions of what is commonly referred to as the ""Sunshine Law,"" (s.119.07 (1) and 2.24(a) of Article I of the State Constitution). The law allows agencies to limit the distribution of location information on sites vulnerable to looting or vandalism, in particular, prehistoric archaeological sites. Again, FHWA and FDOT are currently working with the tribes to identify those cases where confidentiality is desired or required. In the meantime, the District Cultural Resource Managers should consult with the FDOT Native American Coordinator to determine the need for withholding such information. Human Remains Human remains are a matter of cultural, historical, and sacred significance to Indian tribes and should not be looked at only in an archaeological context. For archaeologists, the significance of human remains sites lies in their ability to provide biological, pathological, epidemiological, dietary, and mortuary information that will assist in better describing, understanding, and explaining past human behavior and historical processes. Many Native Americans, on the other hand, view such interests as incompatible with their traditional beliefs and values. So strong are their beliefs regarding the sacredness of these types of sites that some tribes refuse to even discuss the subject of death. Not surprisingly, the excavation of human remains for the purposes of scientific investigation is viewed as abhorrent to them and tantamount to an unauthorized 2-20   exhumation of their ancestors. The discovery of human remains must, therefore, be approached with a great deal of cultural sensitivity and an understanding that, to Native Americans, human remains are sacred. In the event that human remains are found during any project, the provisions of Chapter 872 (see Chapter 1 of this Handbook) must be followed. Briefly, this law states that when ""an unmarked human burial is discovered..., all activity that may disturb the unmarked human burial shall cease"" and may not resume until authorized by either the District Medical Examiner or the State Archaeologist [(872.05(4)]. If human remains less than 75 years old are encountered or if they are involved in a criminal investigation, the District Medical Examiner has jurisdiction. If the remains are determined to be more than 75 years of age, then the State Archaeologist takes the lead in determining appropriate treatments and options for the remains. In cases where the State Archaeologist has jurisdiction, the State Archaeologist will set up a committee to initiate consultation and make decisions regarding the steps to be taken to satisfy the legal requirements of Chapter 872, F.S. It is advisable to notify the FDOT Native American Coordinator immediately to ensure that the proper legal procedures are followed. Archaeological Sites To non-Indians, the past, as reflected in archaeological sites, is not part of their cultural heritage, traditional religious system, or ancestral sites. By the very nature of their profession, archaeologists are trained to view archaeological sites as sources of information about the past to be excavated and analyzed, and a means to better understand the way of life of Native American groups. To Native Americans, archaeological sites are part of their ongoing cultural traditions and are frequently referred to as ancestral or cultural sites. Consequently, these sites remain an integral part of their history and culture. In many cases, such sites may have more importance than the scientific value that can be yielded through excavation. It is, therefore, imperative that Native American tribes be consulted regarding these sites. It is also recommended that the District Cultural Resource Managers consult with the Department's Native American Coordinator for any project where significant archaeological sites are identified during the CRAS. The Native American Coordinator can help provide direction to assure that the tribes receive the proper information and are included in determining effects and providing input in ways to minimize, avoid or mitigate adverse effects.  2-21   Native American Tribal Contacts (updated July 16, 2003) Native American consultation regarding archaeological resources represents one of the most challenging Section 106 compliance issues. The need to establish a cooperative relationship between the Department, FHWA, and the five federally recognized tribes affiliated with Florida is critical to ensure compliance with the law and to meet project schedules. The Department is actively developing a workable consultation process that incorporates Native American concerns in all phases of the Section 106 review process. Therefore, please consult with the Department Native American Coordinator and the FHWA with questions regarding the consultation process.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:     Affected entities: Entities potentially affected by this action are  those which participate in the Acid Rain Program.     Title: Acid Rain Program ICR; (OMB Control No. 2060-0258; EPA ICR  No. 1633.12) expiring 1/31/1999.     Abstract: The Acid Rain Program was established under Title IV of  the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments. The program calls for major  reductions of the pollutants that cause acid rain while establishing a  new approach to environmental management. This information collection  is necessary to implement the Acid Rain Program. It includes burden  hours associated with developing and modifying permits, transferring  allowances, obtaining allowances from the conservation and renewable  energy reserve and small diesel refinery program, monitoring emissions,  participating in the annual auctions, completing annual compliance  certifications, participating in the Opt-in program, and complying with  Nox permitting requirements. Most of this information collection is  mandatory under 40 CFR parts 72-78. Some parts of it are voluntary or  to obtain a benefit, such as participation in the annual auctions under  40 CFR part 73, subpart E. An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a  person is not required to respond to, a collection of information  unless it displays a currently valid OMB control number. The OMB  control numbers for EPA's regulations are listed in 40 CFR part 9 and  48 CFR Ch. 15. The EPA would like to solicit comments to:     (i) Evaluate whether the proposed collection of information is  necessary for the proper performance of the functions of the agency,  including whether the information will have practical utility;     (ii) Evaluate the accuracy of the agency's estimate of the burden  of the proposed collection of information, including the validity of  the methodology and assumptions used;     (iii) Enhance the quality, utility, and clarity of the information  to be collected; and     (iv) Minimize the burden of the collection of information on those  who are to respond, including through the use of appropriate automated  electronic, mechanical, or other technological collection techniques or  other forms of information technology, e.g., permitting electronic  submission of responses.     Burden Statement: The annual public reporting and recordkeeping  burden for this collection of information is estimated to average 273  hours per response and 3,344 hours per respondent. The annual operation  and maintenance (O&M) costs are an estimated $61,431 per respondent.  All the O&M costs and most of the burden hours are associated with the  collection and reporting of continuous emission data, which is the  foundation for the allowance trading system. Burden means the total  time, effort, or financial resources expended by persons to generate,  maintain, retain, or disclose or provide information to or for a  Federal agency. This includes the time needed to review instructions;  develop, acquire, install, and utilize technology and systems for the  purposes of collecting, validating, and verifying information,  processing and maintaining information, and disclosing and providing  information; adjust the existing ways to comply with any previously  applicable instructions and requirements; train personnel to be able to  respond to a collection of information; search data sources; complete  and review the collection of information; and transmit or otherwise  disclose the information.     Respondents/Affected Entities: 849.     Estimated Number of Respondents: 849.     Frequency of Response: Varies by task.     Estimated Total Annual Hour Burden: 2,839,120 hours.     Estimated Total Annualized Cost Burden (All O&M): $44,660,000.      Dated: April 28, 1998. Brian J. McLean, Director, Acid Rain Division.

Background      Metropolitan Planning funds are apportioned by statutory formula to  the Governors for allocation to Metropolitan Planning Organizations  (MPOs) in urbanized areas or portions thereof to provide funds for  their Unified Planning Work Programs. Statewide Planning and Research  funds are apportioned to States by statutory formula to provide funds  for their Statewide Planning and Research Programs. Urbanized Area  Formula Program funds are apportioned by statutory formula to urbanized  areas and to Governors to provide capital, operating and planning  assistance in urbanized areas. Nonurbanized Area Formula Program funds  are apportioned  [[Page 127]]  by statutory formula to Governors for capital, operating and  administrative assistance in nonurbanized areas. Elderly and Persons  with Disabilities Program funds are apportioned by statutory formula to  Governors to provide capital assistance to organizations providing  transportation service for the elderly and persons with disabilities.  Fixed Guideway Modernization funds are apportioned by statutory formula  to specified urbanized areas for capital improvements in rail and other  fixed guideways. New Starts identified in the FY 2002 DOT  Appropriations Act and Bus Allocations identified in the Conference  Report accompanying the Act are included in this notice. FTA will honor  those designations included in report language to the extent that the  projects meet the statutory intent of the specific program. Job Access  and Reverse Commute (JARC) funds are awarded on a competitive basis.  JARC projects identified in the FY 2002 DOT Appropriations Act are  included in this notice. Over-the-Road Bus Accessibility Program  projects are also competitively selected.  II. Overview  A. Fiscal Year 2002 Appropriations      The FY 2002 funding amounts for FTA programs are displayed in Table  1. The following text provides a narrative explanation of the funding  levels and other factors affecting the apportionments and allocations.  B. TEA-21 Authorized Program Levels      TEA-21 provides a combination of trust and general fund  authorizations that total $7.737 billion for the FY 2002 FTA program.  Of this amount, $6.747 billion was guaranteed under the discretionary  spending cap and made available in the FY 2002 DOT Appropriations Act.  See Table 12 for fiscal years 1998-2003 guaranteed funding levels by  program and Table 12A for the total of guaranteed and non-guaranteed  levels by program.     Information regarding estimates of the funding levels for FY 2003  by State and urbanized area is available on the FTA Web site. The FY  2003 numbers are intended for planning purposes only but may be used  for programming Metropolitan Transportation Improvement Programs and  Statewide Transportation Improvement Programs. Actual apportionment  figures for FY 2002 are contained in this notice, while apportionment  figures for FY 1998-FY 2001 can be found in the appropriate FTA fiscal  year apportionment notice, which is available on the FTA Web site.  C. Project Management Oversight      Section 5327 of Title 49 U.S.C., permits the Secretary of  Transportation to use up to one-half percent of the funds made  available under the Urbanized Area Formula Program and the Nonurbanized  Area Formula Program, and three-quarters percent of funds made  available under the Capital Investment Program to contract with any  person to oversee the construction of any major project under these  statutory programs to conduct safety, procurement, management and  financial reviews and audits, and to provide technical assistance to  correct deficiencies identified in compliance reviews and audits.  Language in the 2002 DOT Appropriations Act increases the amount made  available under the Capital Investment Program for oversight activities  to one percent.  D. VIII Paralympiad for the Disabled      The FY 2002 DOT Appropriations Act made $5 million available from  the formula grants program for the VIII Paralympaid for the Disabled,  to be held in Salt Lake City, Utah. The funds shall be available for  grants for the costs of planning, delivery and temporary use of transit  vehicles for special transportation needs and construction of temporary  transportation facilities for the VIII Paralympiad for the Disabled.  III. Fiscal Year 2002 Focus Areas  A. Transit Safety and Security      Public transit agencies throughout the nation have stepped up  security efforts following the terrorist events of September 2001. FTA  has launched an FY 2002 effort to assist transit providers to address  security issues and has refocused funding to specific security-related  activities. Initially, FTA will deploy security assessment teams to the  largest transit systems in the country. These assessment findings and  best practices will enable the FTA to provide extended assistance to  all transit agencies to evaluate and update their emergency response  plans. FTA will provide technical and funding assistance to transit  agencies for full-scale emergency response drills based on their  updated response plans and vulnerability assessments. Free regional  workshops will offer security and emergency response training to local  transit employees.     FTA has identified $2 million of FY 2002 research funding to  undertake security-related transit research under the auspices of the  Transit Cooperative Research Program of the National Academy of  Sciences.     Also, recipients of section 5307 formula funding are reminded that  at least one percent of the amount a grantee receives each fiscal year  must be expended on ``mass transportation security projects'' unless  the grantee certifies, and the Secretary of Transportation accepts,  that the expenditure for security projects is unnecessary. It is  unlikely that FTA will waive this requirement.     Another potential source of funding for transit security  enhancements is through the FHWA transfer of flexible formula funds, as  provided in 23 U.S.C. 104, which, in conjunction with Title 23 U.S.C.  120, provides transit agencies a 100 percent Federal share for safety  projects (subject to a nationwide 10 percent program limitation).  B. 2000 Census      The Census Bureau identifies and classifies urban and rural  population and delineates urbanized areas after each decennial census.  The FTA uses urbanized and rural designations and statistical data for  a number of purposes, including the apportionment of funds for its  formula based programs.     The Census Bureau had not completed the process of delineating  urbanized and rural areas for the 2000 Census at the time FTA  apportioned FY 2002 funds. Therefore, the 1990 Census data was used for  the FY 2002 apportionments contained in this notice.     It is anticipated that a number of areas will change categories  under the 2000 Census, as a result of growth in population and/or the  application of new criteria that will be used to define/designate  urbanized and rural areas. Once FTA receives the 2000 Census data, we  will post, on the FTA Website, estimated FY 2003 apportionments for the  formula programs.     For further information contact Ken Johnson, FTA Office of Resource  Management and State Programs, at (202) 366-2053.  C. TEAM-Web      The Transportation Electronic Award Management system (TEAM) is  FTA's electronic grant making and record keeping system. On October 1,  2001, FTA released TEAM-Web, a new Internet version of the TEAM system.  TEAM-Web permits grantees to submit their grant information via the  Internet and provides for continued and enhanced submission of grant  information electronically.     TEAM-Web provides the recipients of financial assistance online  access to the FTA information resources that support their mission  critical operations,  [[Page 128]]  including real time access to detailed disbursements by project,  balances in formula budget accounts, and the status of applications in  the award process. The new system also has an email notification  process that will ensure accountability when processing applications  through the FTA Offices and the Department of Labor. All current user  information has been migrated to the Web version of TEAM. FTA has  conducted training sessions on how to navigate TEAM-Web in its  Headquarters and Regional Offices. For information on future training  sessions, contact the appropriate FTA Regional Office.     To access TEAM-Web, log onto the Internet at  http:// FTATEAMWeb.fta.dot.gov . For additional information, contact Glenn  Bottoms, Chief, Transit Data and Support Division, (202) 366-1632.  D. New Starts Rule and Workshops      TEA-21 requires the FTA to issue regulations on the manner in which  candidate projects for capital investment grants or loans for new fixed  guideway systems and extensions to existing systems (New Starts) will  be evaluated and rated. The Major Capital Investment Projects Final  Rule (49 CFR Part 611), referred to as the New Starts Final Rule, was  published in the Federal Register on December 7, 2000, and became  effective on April 6, 2001.     Electronic access to this Final Rule and related documents is  available through the FTA Web site ( http://www.fta.dot.gov ), under the  New Starts section. Paper copies of this Final Rule and other  documentation can be obtained by contacting FTA at one of our Regional  Offices.     As in the previous fiscal year, FTA will conduct outreach sessions  and workshops in FY 2002 to introduce the Final Rule and to continue  longstanding outreach efforts on the New Starts program. Information on  scheduled workshops can be obtained by contacting any FTA Regional  Office, as well as the FTA Office of Planning and the FTA Office of  Budget and Policy.  E. Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS)      Section 5206(e) of TEA-21 requires that Intelligent Transportation  Systems (ITS) projects using funds from the Highway Trust Fund  (including the Mass Transit Account) conform to National ITS  Architecture and Standards. The FTA National ITS Architecture  Consistency Policy for Transit Projects implements the TEA-21  requirements and went into effect on April 8, 2001. The Policy is  available on the FTA Web site, and guidance material is available on  the Departmental ITS Web site at  www.its.dot.gov . These standards and  requirements apply to FY 2002 allocations included in this notice that  contain ITS components. Using existing FTA oversight procedures, FTA  has initiated a program to provide initial oversight and technical  assistance with respect to National ITS Architecture Consistency  requirements.     Questions regarding the applicability of these standards and  requirements should be addressed to the FTA Regional Office or FTA  Office of Research, Demonstration and Innovation, at (202) 366-4991.  F. Environmental Streamlining      TEA-21 directs DOT to expedite the environmental review process for  proposed highway and transit projects. With this apportionments notice,  FTA is introducing two measures concerning proposed major transit  investments (New Starts) that will support timely delivery of projects,  while maintaining and enhancing protection of the human and natural  environment.     First, FTA is extending automatic pre-award authority to proposed  New Starts projects for costs incurred to acquire real property and  real property rights upon the completion of the National Environmental  Policy Act (NEPA) review of the proposed project. NEPA review is  complete when FTA signs an environmental Record of Decision (ROD) or  Finding of No Significant Impact (FONSI) or makes a Categorical  Exclusion (CE) determination. This measure will enable grant applicants  to begin earlier to assist persons and businesses that will be  displaced by the project in a manner consistent with commitments made  as part of the NEPA review and in compliance with the Uniform  Relocation Assistance and Real Property Acquisition Policies Act (URA).  It will also help grant applicant to initiate the lengthy process of  acquiring property earlier.     Second, FTA will extend automatic pre-award authority to proposed  New Starts projects for costs incurred to carry out the NEPA review  process and to prepare an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS),  Environmental Assessment (EA), Categorical Exclusion (CE), or other  environmental documents for that project upon the inclusion of that  project in a federally approved State Transportation Improvement  Program (STIP). FTA had previously given pre-award authority for use of  formula funds. Now New Starts funds may serve as a funding source for  these New Starts project NEPA activities. This measure will eliminate  unnecessary delays in starting up the conceptual engineering, public  involvement process, and interagency coordination for the project.     For additional information, contact Joseph Ossi, FTA Office of  Planning, (202) 366-1613.  IV. Metropolitan Planning Program and State Planning and Research  Program  A. Metropolitan Planning Program      Funding made available for the Metropolitan Planning Program (49  U.S.C. 5303) in the FY 2002 DOT Appropriations Act is $55,422,400,  which is the guaranteed funding level under TEA-21. The FY 2002  Metropolitan Planning Program apportionment to States for MPOs' use in  urbanized areas totals $55,662,971. This amount includes $55,422,400 in  FY 2002 funds, and $240,571 in prior year deobligated funds available  for reapportionment under this program. A basic allocation of 80  percent of this amount ($44,530,377) is distributed to the States based  on the State's urbanized area population as defined by the U.S. Census  Bureau for subsequent State distribution to each urbanized area, or  parts thereof, within each State. A supplemental allocation of the  remaining 20 percent ($11,132,594) is also provided to the States based  on an FTA administrative formula to address planning needs in the  larger, more complex urbanized areas. Table 2 contains the final State  apportionments for the combined basic and supplemental allocations.  Each State, in cooperation with the MPOs, must develop an allocation  formula for the combined apportionment, which distributes these funds  to MPOs representing urbanized areas, or parts thereof, within the  State. This formula, which must be approved by the FTA, must ensure to  the maximum extent practicable that no MPO is allocated less than the  amount it received by administrative formula under the Metropolitan  Planning Program in FY 1991 (minimum MPO allocation). Each State  formula must include a provision for the minimum MPO allocation. Where  the State and MPOs desire to use a new formula not previously approved  by FTA, it must be submitted to the appropriate FTA Regional Office for  prior approval.     By April 2002, the Census Bureau is expected to make available  detailed results of the 2000 Census and designate new urbanized areas.  When the Census Bureau issues its population data, FTA will request  that States reaffirm these in-State formulas. A reaffirmation or new  [[Page 129]]  in-State formula should be submitted to the FTA Regional Office in time  to receive approval before October 1, 2002. Currently, guaranteed and  authorized funding levels for each State over the life of TEA-21  (fiscal years 1999-2003) based on the 1990 Census, are posted at  http:/ /www.fta.dot.gov/office/planning/gaf.htm . FTA will post revised fiscal  year 2003 guaranteed and authorized funding levels based on the 2000  Census for each State at this same Web site address, when 2000 Census  data becomes available. This information should be utilized by each  State when reaffirming or revising in-State formulas.  B. State Planning and Research Program      Funding made available for the State Planning and Research Program  (49 U.S.C. 5313(b)) in the FY 2002 DOT Appropriations Act is  $11,577,600, the guaranteed funding level under TEA-21.     The FY 2002 apportionment for the State Planning and Research  Program (SPRP) totals $11,698,648. This amount includes $11,577,600 in  FY 2002 funds, and $121,048 in prior year deobligated funds, which have  become available for reapportionment under this program. Final State  apportionments for this program are also contained in Table 2. These  funds may be used for a variety of purposes such as planning, technical  studies and assistance, demonstrations, management training, and  cooperative research. In addition, a State may authorize a portion of  these funds to be used to supplement metropolitan planning funds  allocated by the State to its urbanized areas, as the State deems  appropriate.  C. Data Used for Metropolitan Planning and State Planning and Research  Apportionments      Population data from the 1990 Census is used in calculating these  apportionments. The Metropolitan Planning funding provided to urbanized  areas in each State by administrative formula in FY 1991 was used as a  ``hold harmless'' base in calculating funding to each State.  D. FHWA Metropolitan Planning Program      For informational purposes, the estimated FY 2002 apportionments  for the FHWA Metropolitan Planning Program (PL) are contained in Table  3. Estimated apportionments for the FY 2002 FHWA State Planning and  Research Program (SPRP) were not available at the time of publication  of this notice.  E. Local Match Waiver for Specified Planning Activities      Job Access and Reverse Commute Planning. Federal, State and local  welfare reform initiatives may require the development of new and  innovative public and other transportation services to ensure that  former welfare recipients have adequate mobility for reaching  employment opportunities. In recognition of the key role that  transportation plays in ensuring the success of welfare-to-work  initiatives, FTA and FHWA permit the waiver of the local match  requirement for job access and reverse commute planning activities  undertaken with both FTA and FHWA Metropolitan Planning Program and  State Planning and Research Program funds. FTA and FHWA will support  requests for waivers when they are included in Metropolitan Unified  Planning Work Programs and State Planning and Research Programs and  meet all other appropriate requirements.  F. Planning Emphasis Areas for Fiscal Year 2002      The FTA and FHWA identify Planning Emphasis Areas (PEAs) annually  to promote priority themes for consideration, as appropriate, in  metropolitan and statewide transportation planning processes. To  support this, FTA and FHWA will prepare an inventory of current  practice, guidance and training in those areas. Opportunities for  exchanging ideas and experiences on innovative practices in these topic  areas also will be provided throughout the year. For FY 2002, five key  planning themes have been identified: (1) Consideration of safety and  security in the transportation planning process; (2) integration of  planning and environmental processes; (3) consideration of management  and operations within planning processes; (4) consultation with local  officials; and (5) enhancing the technical capacity of planning  processes. 1. Safety and Security in the Transportation Planning Process     TEA-21 emphasizes the safety and security of transportation systems  as a national priority and calls for transportation projects and  strategies that ``increase the safety and security of transportation  systems.'' This entails integration of safety and facility security  into all stages of the transportation planning process.     FTA and FHWA are working together to advance the state-of-practice  in addressing safety and security in the metropolitan and statewide  planning process through workshops and case studies. A report prepared  by the Transportation Research Board (TRB), Transportation Research  Circular E-C02, ``Safety-Conscious Planning,'' January 2001, describes  the issues and recommendations identified at a Safety in Planning  workshop held earlier. The report is available on the TRB Web site at   www.nas.edu/trb . Also, the Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE)  has prepared a discussion paper on the topic, entitled ``The  Development of the Safer Network Transportation Planning Process,''  which is posted to their Web site at [ www.ite.org .] 2. Integrated Planning and Environmental Processes     TEA-21 mandates the elimination of the Major Investment Study as a  stand-alone requirement, while integrating the concept within the  planning and project development/environmental review processes. A  training course entitled ``Linking Planning and NEPA'' is being  developed and will be made available at the National Transit Institute  Web site--[ www.ntionline.com ]. 3. Consideration of Management and Operations Within Planning Processes     TEA-21 challenges FHWA and FTA to move beyond traditional capital  programs for improving the movement of people and goods--focusing on  the need to improve the way transportation systems are managed and  operated. FTA and FHWA have convened a working group and have  commissioned discussion papers on the topic. This information is  available at  http://plan2op.fhwa.dot.gov . 4. Consultation With Local Officials     Consultation with local officials is a vital yet sensitive issue  within the transportation planning process. Within metropolitan areas,  the MPO provides the venue and policy context for this. Outside of  metropolitan areas, FHWA and FTA are working to facilitate the most  effective consultation processes within each State. FTA and FHWA will  continue to ensure effective consultation between States and local  officials in non-metropolitan areas in reviewing statewide planning  and, specifically, in making findings in support of FTA and FHWA STIP  approvals. 5. Enhancing the Technical Capacity of Planning Processes     Reliable information on current and projected usage and performance  of transportation systems is critical to the ability of planning  processes to supply credible information to decision-makers  [[Page 130]]  to support preparation of plans and programs that respond to their  localities' unique needs and policy issues. To ensure the reliability  of usage and performance data, as well as the responsiveness of policy  forecasting tools, an evaluation is needed of the quality of  information provided by the technical tools, data sources, forecasting  models, as well as the expertise of staff to ensure its adequacy to  support decision-making. And if this support is found to be lacking,  the responsible agencies within metropolitan and statewide planning  processes are encouraged to devote appropriate resources to enhancing  and maintaining their technical capacity.     The metropolitan and statewide transportation planning processes  have become critical tools for responding to increasingly complex  issues at the State and local levels. Many of these issues are  encompassed in previously listed planning emphasis areas (e.g.,  integrated planning and environmental processes, management and  operations, analytical tools and methods) and include much more. It is  essential that FTA and FHWA provide technical assistance, training, and  information to our customers to further enhance the skills and  capabilities they utilize to conduct effective transportation planning  processes. The FTA and FHWA have created the Metropolitan Capacity  Building (MCB) Program, and the Statewide and Rural Capacity Building  Programs as tools to disseminate and coordinate information, training,  and foster a dialogue for the exchange of ideas. More information on  the MCB program can be found at  www.mcb.fhwa.dot.gov .     For further information on these PEAs, contact Ken Lord, FTA  Metropolitan Planning Division, (202) 366-2836, or Shana Baker, FHWA  Office of Metropolitan Planning and Programs, (202) 366-1862.  G. Federal Planning Certification Reviews      The Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act (ISTEA)  initiated, and TEA-21 continued, the requirement for the FTA and FHWA  to certify, at least every three years, that the planning processes  conducted in the largest metropolitan areas were being carried out in  compliance with applicable provisions of Federal law. This provision  applies specifically to localities termed ``Transportation Management  Areas'' (TMA), which are urbanized areas with populations of 200,000  and above, or other urbanized areas that may be designated by the  Secretary of Transportation. TEA-21 further required that, in  conducting these certification reviews, provisions be made for public  involvement appropriate to the metropolitan area under review.     To that end, an annual calendar of prospective dates and locations  for certification reviews of TMAs anticipated in FY 2002 has been  prepared and is posted on the FTA Web site at  http://www.fta.dot.gov/ library/planning/cert2002.htm .     For further information regarding Federal certifications of the  planning process, contact: for FTA, Charles Goodman, FTA Metropolitan  Planning Division, (202) 366-1944, or Scott Biehl, FTA Office of Chief  Counsel, (202) 366-4063; for FHWA, Sheldon Edner, FHWA Metropolitan  Planning Division, (202) 366-4066, or Reid Alsop, FHWA Office of the  Chief Counsel, (202) 366-1371.  H. Consolidated Planning Grants      Since FY 1997, FTA and FHWA have offered States the option of  participating in a pilot Consolidated Planning Grant (CPG) program.  Additional State participants are sought so that FTA and FHWA can  benefit from the widest possible range of participant input to improve  and further streamline the process.     With the fund transfer provisions of TEA-21, which were applied to  the CPG beginning in FY 2000, all funds (more than 35 post-FY 1999 FHWA  sources are eligible for transfer) can be accessed by indicating only  whether the funds are for State or metropolitan planning. This  streamlined fund drawdown process eliminates the need to monitor  individual fund sources, if several have been used, and ensures that  the oldest funds will always be used first.     Under the CPG, States can report metropolitan planning expenditures  (to comply with the Single Audit Act) for both FTA and FHWA under the  Catalogue of Federal Domestic Assistance number for FTA's Metropolitan  Planning Program. Additionally, for States with an FHWA Metropolitan  Planning (PL) fund-matching ratio greater than 80 percent, the State  (through FTA) can request a waiver of the 20 percent local share  requirement in order that all FTA funds used for metropolitan planning  in a CPG can be granted at the higher FHWA rate. For some States, this  Federal match rate can exceed 90 percent. Currently, three western  States participating in the pilot (California, Idaho, and Wyoming) are  using the FHWA PL match rate for FTA's Metropolitan Planning Program.     Pre-award authority has been granted to FTA's planning programs for  the life of TEA-21. This pre-award authority enables States to continue  planning program activities from year to year with the assurance that  eligible costs can later be converted to a regularly funded Federal  project without the need for prior approval or authorization from the  granting agency. Beginning in FY 2000, the transfer procedures  established to implement the transfer provision in TEA-21 (section  1103(i) ``Transfer of Highway and Transit Funds'') is applicable to  FHWA funds used in CPG. For planning projects funded through CPG, the  State DOT requests the transfer of funds in a letter to the FHWA  Division Office. The FHWA-funded planning activities must be in  accordance with the State's or MPO's Planning Work Program. The letter  must be signed by the appropriate State official or their designee and  must specify the State and the amount of funding to be transferred for  the CPG by apportionment category (e.g. STP, CMAQ, Donor State Bonus,  Funding Restoration, etc.) and by appropriation year. The letter should  include only the funding for planning activities contained in the  State's or MPO's Planning Work Program. If no FTA program, either  Metropolitan Planning (49 U.S.C. 5303) or Statewide Planning and  Research (49 U.S.C. 5313(b)), is indicated for transfers to CPG, funds  will be credited to the Metropolitan Planning Program.     As part of the pilot, FTA will continue to work with participating  States to increase the flexibility and further streamline the  consolidated approach to planning grants. For further information on  participating in the CPG Pilot, contact Candace Noonan, Intermodal and  Statewide Planning Division, FTA, at (202) 366-1648 or Anthony Solury,  Office of Planning and Environment, FHWA, at (202) 366-5003.  I. New Starts Approval to Enter Preliminary Engineering and Final  Design      TEA-21 extends FTA's long-standing authority for approving the  advancement of candidate New Starts projects into preliminary  engineering (PE) by requiring that FTA also approve entrance into the  final design (FD) stage of project development. Specifically, 49 U.S.C.  5309(e)(6) requires that a proposed New Starts project may advance into  preliminary engineering or final design only if FTA finds that the  project meets the statutory criteria specified in Sec. 5309(e), and  that there is a reasonable likelihood that it will continue to do so.  In making such findings, FTA evaluates and rates proposed New Starts  projects as ``highly  [[Page 131]]  recommended,'' ``recommended,'' or ``not recommended,'' based on the  results of alternatives analysis, the statutory criteria for project  justification, and the degree of local financial commitment. FTA has  established a set of decision rules for approving entrance into  preliminary engineering and final design at 49 CFR part 611. After  first meeting several basic planning, environmental, and project  management requirements which demonstrate the ``readiness'' of the  project to advance into the next stage of project development,  candidate projects are subject to FTA evaluation against the New Starts  project justification and local financial commitment criteria. Projects  may advance to the next appropriate stage of project development (PE or  FD) only if rated ``recommended'' or ``highly recommended,'' based on  FTA's evaluation under the statutory criteria. Projects rated ``not  recommended'' will not be approved to advance.     Section 5309(e)(8)(A) of Title 49 U.S.C. exempts projects which  request a section 5309 New Starts share of less than $25 million from  the requirements of section 5309(e). TEA-21 also provides statutory  exemptions to certain specific projects. It is important to note that  any exemption under section 5309(e)(8)(A) applies only to the statutory  New Starts project evaluation criteria that serves as the basis for  FTA's approval to advance to preliminary engineering and final design  for such projects. Proposed New Starts projects seeking less than $25  million in funding from the Sec. 5309 New Starts program must still  request approval to enter the next stage of development, and must  fulfill all appropriate planning, environmental, and project management  requirements. Nonetheless, FTA encourages sponsors of projects they  believe to be exempt to submit the full range of data to FTA for  evaluation and rating. This will provide FTA with the means necessary  to make funding recommendations for such projects to Congress, and will  protect project sponsors in the event that further project development  activities reveal the need for additional Sec. 5309 New Starts funding  beyond $25 million.  V. Urbanized Area Formula Program  A. Total Urbanized Area Formula Apportionments      The amount made available to the Urbanized Area Formula Program (49  U.S.C. 5307) in the FY 2002 DOT Appropriations Act is $3,216,040,006.  In addition, $7,092,285 in deobligated funds became available for  reapportionment under the Urbanized Area Formula Program as provided by  49 U.S.C. 5336(i).     After reserving $16,080,200 for oversight, the amount of FY 2002  funds available for apportionment is $3,199,959,806. The funds to be  reapportioned, described in the previous paragraph, are then added and  increase the total amount apportioned for this program to  $3,207,052,091. Table 4 displays the amounts apportioned under the  Urbanized Area Formula Program. Table 13 contains the apportionment  formula for the Urbanized Area Formula Program.     An additional $4,849,950 is made available for the Alaska Railroad  for improvements to its passenger operations. After reserving $24,250  for oversight, $4,825,700 is available for the Alaska Railroad.  B. Fiscal Year 2001 Apportionment Adjustments      Adjustments were made to the apportionment of two urbanized areas  because of corrections to data used to compute the FY 2001 Urbanized  Area Formula Program apportionments, published in the Federal Register  of January 18, 2001 (66 FR 4918). The differences between the  previously published apportionment and the corrected apportionment for  these areas have been resolved and the necessary adjustment made to the  areas' apportionment for FY 2002. The amounts published in this notice  contain the adjustments and the affected urbanized areas have been  advised.  C. Data Used for Urbanized Area Formula Apportionments      Data from the 2000 National Transit Database (NTD) Report Year (49  U.S.C. 5335) submitted in late 2000 and early 2001 were used to  calculate the FY 2002 Urbanized Area Formula apportionments for  urbanized areas 200,000 in population and over. Population and  population density data are also used in calculating apportionments  under the Urbanized Area Formula Program.  D. Urbanized Area Formula Apportionments to Governors      The total Urbanized Area Formula apportionment to the Governor for  use in areas under 200,000 in population for each State is shown in  Table 4. This table also contains the total apportionment amount  attributable to each urbanized area within the State. The Governor may  determine the allocation of funds among the urbanized areas under  200,000 in population with one exception. As further discussed in  Section G below, funds attributed to an urbanized area under 200,000 in  population, located within the planning boundaries of a transportation  management area, must be obligated in that area.  E. Transit Enhancements      One percent of the Urbanized Area Formula Program apportionment in  each urbanized area with a population of 200,000 and over must be made  available only for transit enhancements. Table 4 shows the amount set  aside for enhancements in these areas.     The term ``transit enhancement'' includes projects or project  elements that are designed to enhance mass transportation service or  use and are physically or functionally related to transit facilities.  Eligible enhancements include the following: (1) Historic preservation,  rehabilitation, and operation of historic mass transportation  buildings, structures, and facilities (including historic bus and  railroad facilities); (2) bus shelters; (3) landscaping and other  scenic beautification, including tables, benches, trash receptacles,  and street lights; (4) public art; (5) pedestrian access and walkways;  (6) bicycle access, including bicycle storage facilities and installing  equipment for transporting bicycles on mass transportation vehicles;  (7) transit connections to parks within the recipient's transit service  area; (8) signage; and (9) enhanced access for persons with  disabilities to mass transportation.     It is the responsibility of the MPO to determine how the one  percent will be allotted to transit projects. The one percent minimum  requirement does not preclude more than one percent being expended in  an urbanized area for transit enhancements. Items that are only  eligible as enhancements--in particular, operating costs for historic  facilities--may be assisted only within the one percent funding level.     The recipient must submit a report to the appropriate FTA Regional  Office listing the projects or elements of projects carried out with  those funds during the previous fiscal year and the amount awarded. The  report must be submitted with the Federal fiscal year's final quarterly  progress report in TEAM-Web. The report should include the following  elements: (a) Grantee name, (b) urbanized area name and number, (c) FTA  project number, (d) transit enhancement category, (e) brief description  of enhancement and progress towards project implementation, (f)  activity line item code from the approved budget, and (g)  [[Page 132]]  amount awarded by FTA for the enhancement.  F. Fiscal Year 2002 Operating Assistance      FY 2002 funding for operating assistance is available only to  urbanized areas with populations under 200,000. For these areas, there  is no limitation on the amount of the State apportionment that may be  used for operating assistance, and the Federal/local share ratio is 50/ 50.     TEA-21 provides two exceptions to the restriction on operating  assistance in areas over 200,000 in population. These exceptions have  been addressed and eligible areas previously notified.  G. Designated Transportation Management Areas      All urbanized areas over 200,000 in population have been designated  as Transportation Management Areas (TMAs), in accordance with 49 U.S.C.  5305. These designations were formally made in a Federal Register  Notice dated May 18, 1992 (57 FR 21160). Additional areas have been  designated as TMAs upon the request of the Governor and the MPO  designated for such area or the affected local officials. During FY  2001, no additions to existing TMAs were designated.     Guidance for setting the boundaries of TMAs is contained in the  joint transportation planning regulations codified at 23 CFR part 450  and 49 CFR part 613. In some cases, the TMA boundaries, which have been  established by the MPO for the designated TMA, also include one or more  urbanized areas with less than 200,000 in population. Where this  situation exists, the discretion of the Governor to allocate Urbanized  Area Formula program ``Governor's Apportionment'' funds for urbanized  areas with less than 200,000 in population is restricted, i.e., the  Governor only has discretion to allocate Governor's Apportionment funds  attributable to areas that are outside of designated TMA boundaries.     If any additional small urbanized areas--within the boundaries of a  TMA--are identified, notification should be made in writing to the  Associate Administrator for Program Management, Federal Transit  Administration, 400 Seventh Street, SW., Washington, DC 20590, no later  than July 1 of each fiscal year. FTA's most recent list of urbanized  areas with population less than 200,000 that are included within the  planning boundaries of designated TMAs, is contained in the ``FTA  Fiscal Year 2001 Apportionment, Allocations and Program Information;  Notice'' which, can be found on the FTA Web site.  H. Urbanized Area Formula Funds Used for Highway Purposes      Urbanized Area Formula funds apportioned to a TMA can be  transferred to FHWA and made available for highway projects if the  following three conditions are met: (1) Such use must be approved by  the MPO in writing after appropriate notice and opportunity for comment  and appeal are provided to affected transit providers; (2) in the  determination of the Secretary, such funds are not needed for  investments required by the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990  (ADA); and (3) the MPO determines that local transit needs are being  addressed.     Urbanized Area Formula funds that are designated for highway  projects will be transferred to and administered by FHWA. The MPO  should notify FTA of its intent to use FTA funds for highway purposes,  as prescribed in section VIII.A., below.  I. National Transit Database (NTD) Internet Reporting and Redesign  Effort      The NTD is the FTA database for nation-wide statistics on the  transit industry, including safety data. Prior to FY 2001, FTA  reporters utilized diskettes to submit statistics on their operating,  financial and safety activities to FTA. Last year, reporters had the  option of using the diskette system or the FTA new Internet reporting  system. Beginning with FY 2002, all reports will need to be submitted  via the Internet. Diskettes will no longer be accepted. The FTA NTD  reporting seminars, held six times annually across the country, have  concentrated on the Internet reporting system. The changeover to  Internet reporting has received favorable comments and has resulted in  accelerated data collection and validation.     NTD statistics are utilized, in part, to apportion Urbanized Area  Formula Program funds for areas over 200,000 in population. In  addition, NTD data is summarized and used to report to Congress on the  performance of the transit industry and associated costs. These data  are used to assist in assessing whether annual FTA Strategic Plan goals  are achieved.     The overall effort to modernize and redesign the NTD--as detailed  in the FTA May 31, 2001 report to Congress entitled ``Review of the  National Transit Database''--continues and is now in the programming  phase. Plans call for reporting via the new NTD in the Fall of 2002  with training for NTD reporters to begin in the winter of 2001. The  monthly/quarterly reporting of summary safety, security, and extent of  service data, as well as immediate reporting of major safety and  security incidents, will be implemented in calendar year 2002. This  reporting has been structured to exempt smaller transit properties  (under 100 vehicles in maximum service) from the monthly reporting  requirement. An increased number of NTD seminars are scheduled to  assist transit properties in reporting. See the NTD Web site for  further information at  www.ntdprogram.com .  VI. Nonurbanized Area Formula Program and Rural Transit Assistance  Program (RTAP)  A. Nonurbanized Area Formula Program      The amount made available for the Nonurbanized Area Formula Program  (49 U.S.C. 5311) in the FY 2002 DOT Appropriations Act is $224,555,243.  The FY 2002 Nonurbanized Area Formula apportionments to the States  total $226,410,089 and are displayed in Table 5. Of the $224,555,243  available, $1,122,776 was reserved for oversight. The funds apportioned  include $2,977,622 in deobligated funds from fiscal years prior to FY  2002.     The Nonurbanized Area Formula Program provides capital, operating  and administrative assistance for areas under 50,000 in population.  Each State must spend no less than 15 percent of its FY 2002  Nonurbanized Area Formula apportionment for the development and support  of intercity bus transportation, unless the Governor certifies to the  Secretary that the intercity bus service needs of the State are being  adequately met.  B. Rural Transit Assistance Program (RTAP)      Funding made available for the RTAP (49 U.S.C. 5311(b)(2)) in the  2002 DOT Appropriations Act was $5,250,000, the guaranteed funding  level under TEA-21. The FY 2002 RTAP allocations to the States total  $5,270,729 and are also displayed in Table 5. This amount includes  $5,250,000 in FY 2002 funds, and $20,729 in prior year deobligated  funds, which are available for reapportionment.     The funds are allocated to the States to undertake research,  training, technical assistance, and other support services to meet the  needs of transit operators in nonurbanized areas. These funds are to be  used in conjunction with the States' administration of the Nonurbanized  Area Formula Program.     FTA also supports RTAP activities at the national level within the  National  [[Page 133]]  Planning and Research Program (NPRP). The National RTAP projects  support the States in their use of the formula allocations for training  and technical assistance. Congress did not designate any funds for the  National RTAP among the NPRP allocations in the Conference Report  accompanying the FY 2002 DOT Appropriations Act. FTA will, however,  include the National RTAP among priority projects to be funded from  available NPRP funds. During FY 2002, FTA will conduct a competitive  selection to choose providers of the National RTAP services for the  next five years.  VII. Elderly and Persons with Disabilities Program      Funds in the amount of $84,604,801 are made available for the  Elderly and Persons with Disabilities Program (49 U.S.C. 5310) in the  FY 2002 DOT Appropriations Act. A total of $84,930,249 is apportioned  to the States for FY 2002 for the Elderly and Persons with Disabilities  Program. In addition to the FY 2002 funding of $84,604,801, the FY 2002  apportionment includes $325,448 in prior year unobligated funds, which  are available for reapportionment under the Elderly and Persons with  Disabilities Program. Table 6 shows each State's apportionment.     The formula for apportioning these funds uses Census population  data for persons aged 65 and over and for persons with disabilities.  The funds provide capital assistance for transportation for elderly  persons and persons with disabilities. Eligible capital expenses may  include, at the option of the recipient, the acquisition of  transportation services by a contract, lease, or other arrangement.     While the assistance is intended primarily for private non-profit  organizations, public bodies that coordinate services for the elderly  and persons with disabilities, or any public body that certifies to the  State that there are no non-profit organizations in the area that are  readily available to carry out the service, may receive these funds.     These funds may be transferred by the Governor to supplement  Urbanized Area Formula or Nonurbanized Area Formula capital funds  during the last 90 days of the fiscal year.  VIII. FHWA Surface Transportation Program and Congestion Mitigation  and Air Quality Funds Used for Transit Purposes (Title 23, U.S.C.  104)  A. Transfer Process      The process for transferring flexible formula funds between FTA and  FHWA programs is described below. Information on the transfer of FHWA  funds to FTA planning programs can be found in section IV.H., above. Transfer From FHWA to FTA     FHWA funds designated for use in transit capital projects must  result from the metropolitan and statewide planning and programming  process, and must be included in an approved Statewide Transportation  Improvement Program (STIP) before the funds can be transferred. The  State DOT requests, by letter, the transfer of highway funds for a  transit project to the FHWA Division Office. The letter should specify  the project, amount to be transferred, apportionment year, State,  Federal aid apportionment category (i.e., Surface Transportation  Program (STP), Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality (CMAQ), Interstate  Substitute, or congressional earmark), and a description of the project  as contained in the STIP.     The FHWA Division Office confirms that the apportionment amount is  available for transfer and concurs in the transfer by letter to the  State DOT and FTA. The FHWA Office of Budget and Finance then transfers  obligation authority and an equal amount of cash to FTA. All CMAQ, STP,  and FHWA funds allocated to transit projects in the Appropriations Act  or Conference Report will be transferred to one of the three FTA  formula capital programs (i.e. Urbanized Area Formula (section 5307),  Nonurbanized Area Formula (section 5311) or Elderly and Persons with  Disabilities (section 5310).     The FTA grantee's application for the project must specify which  capital program the funds will be used for and the application should  be prepared in accordance with the requirements and procedures  governing that program. Upon review and approval of the grantee's  application, FTA obligates funds for the project.     The transferred funds are treated as FTA formula funds, but are  assigned a distinct identifying code for tracking purposes. The funds  may be used for any purpose eligible under the FTA formula capital  program to which they are transferred. FTA and FHWA have issued  guidance on project eligibility under the CMAQ program in a Federal  Register notice dated February 23, 2000 (65 FR 9040). All FTA  requirements are applicable to transferred funds except local share-- FHWA local share requirements apply. Transferred funds should be  combined with regular FTA funds in a single annual grant application. Transfers From FTA to FHWA     The Metropolitan Planning Organization (MPO) submits a request to  the FTA Regional Office for a transfer of FTA section 5307 formula  funds (apportioned to an urbanized area 200,000 and over in population)  to FHWA based on approved use of the funds for highway purposes, as  contained in the Governor's approved State Transportation Improvement  Program. The MPO must certify that: (1) The funds are not needed for  capital investments required by the Americans with Disabilities Act;  (2) notice and opportunity for comment and appeal has been provided to  affected transit providers; and (3) local funds used for non-Federal  match are eligible to provide assistance for either highway or transit  projects. The FTA Regional Administrator reviews and concurs in the  request, then forwards the approval to FTA Headquarters, where a  reduction is made to the grantee's formula apportionment and FTA's  National Operating Budget in TEAM-Web, equal to the dollar amount being  transferred to FHWA.     For information regarding these procedures, please contact Kristen  D. Clarke, FTA Budget Division, at (202) 366-1699; or Richard Meehleib,  FHWA Finance Division, at (202) 366-2869.  B. Matching Share for FHWA Transfers      The provisions of Title 23 U.S.C., regarding the non-Federal share  apply to Title 23 funds used for transit projects. Thus, FHWA funds  transferred to FTA retain the same matching share that the funds would  have if used for highway purposes and administered by FHWA.     There are three instances in which a Federal share higher than 80  percent would be permitted. First, in States with large areas of Indian  and certain public domain lands and national forests, parks and  monuments, the local share for highway projects is determined by a  sliding scale rate, calculated based on the percentage of public lands  within that State. This sliding scale, which permits a greater Federal  share, but not to exceed 95 percent, is applicable to transfers used to  fund transit projects in these public land States. FHWA develops the  sliding scale matching ratios for the increased Federal share.     Secondly, commuter carpooling and vanpooling projects and transit  safety projects using FHWA transfers administered by FTA may retain the  same 100 percent Federal share that would be allowed for ride-sharing  or safety projects administered by the FHWA.     The third instance includes the 100 percent Federal safety  projects;  [[Page 134]]  however, these are subject to a nationwide 10 percent program  limitation.  IX. Capital Investment Program (49 U.S.C. 5309)  A. Fixed Guideway Modernization      The formula for allocating the Fixed Guideway Modernization funds  contains seven tiers. The apportionment of funding under the first four  tiers, through FY 2003, is based on data used to apportion the funding  in FY 1997. Funding under the last three tiers is apportioned based on  the latest available route miles and revenue vehicle miles on segments  at least seven years old, as reported to the NTD.     Table 7 displays the FY 2002 Fixed Guideway Modernization  apportionments. Fixed Guideway Modernization funds apportioned for this  section must be used for capital projects to maintain, modernize, or  improve fixed guideway systems.     All urbanized areas with fixed guideway systems that are at least  seven years old are eligible to receive Fixed Guideway Modernization  funds. A request for the start-up service dates for fixed guideways has  been incorporated into the NTD reporting system to ensure that all  eligible fixed guideway data is included in the calculation of the  apportionments. A threshold level of more than one mile of fixed  guideway is required to receive Fixed Guideway Modernization funds.  Therefore, urbanized areas reporting one mile or less of fixed guideway  mileage under the NTD are not included.     For FY 2002, $1,136,400,000 is made available for Fixed Guideway  Modernization in the FY 2002 DOT Appropriations Act, which is the  guaranteed funding level in TEA-21. An amount of $11,364,000 was then  deducted for oversight, and $7,047,502 was set aside for the Alaska  Railroad as directed by language in Section 1124 of the FY 2001 Omnibus  Consolidated Appropriations Act (Pub. L. 106-554), leaving  $1,117,988,498 available for apportionment to eligible urbanized areas.  In addition to the FY 2002 funding, $547,205 in deobligated funds from  fiscal years prior to FY 2002 is added and increases the total amount  apportioned to $1,118,535,703 under Fixed Guideway Modernization. Table  14 contains information regarding the Fixed Guideway Modernization  apportionment formula.     The Alaska Railroad has been determined to be eligible for funding  under the Fixed Guideway Modernization program for service provided in  the Anchorage, AK, urbanized area. The FY 2002 Fixed Guideway  Modernization apportionment for the Alaska Railroad is, in part, based  on a calculated amount derived from application of the Fixed Guideway  Modernization formula--using approved Alaska Railroad data for fixed  guideway directional route miles located within the Anchorage, AK,  urbanized area. In addition, the Alaska Railroad apportionment includes  the $7,047,502 set aside for the Alaska Railroad as directed in Public  Law 106-554.     The Alaska Railroad eligibility to receive funds under the Fixed  Guideway Modernization program is pursuant to FTA's determination that:  (1) it is the fixed guideway system for the Anchorage, AK urbanized  area (which is an urbanized area eligible for assistance under section  5336(b)(2)(A) of 49 U.S.C. Chapter 53, and therefore eligible for  funding under sections 5337(a)(5)(B), 5337(a)(6)(B), and  5337(a)(7)(B)); and (2) the Alaska Railroad meets the standard of  having been in service for at least seven years.     The Alaska Railroad was built by the Federal Government between  1914 and 1923. The Railroad operated under the control of the Interior  Department until April 1967 when the Department of Transportation  assumed that responsibility. After passage of special Federal  legislation, the assets of the Alaska Railroad were sold to the State  of Alaska, which assumed ownership of the railroad in January 1985.  Since Federal ownership of the Alaska Railroad has extended over the  greater part of its existence, the DOT acknowledges a special  stewardship towards the Alaska Railroad within the Anchorage urbanized  area. For purposes of formula apportionments beginning in FY 2004 and  beyond, FTA will create a mode code exclusively for reporting to the  NTD by the Alaska Railroad in the NTD Reporting Manual for report year  2002.  B. New Starts      The amount made available for New Starts in the FY 2002 DOT  Appropriations Act is $1,136,400,000, which was fully allocated and  represents the guaranteed funding level under TEA-21. Of this amount,  $11,364,000 is reserved for oversight activities, leaving  $1,125,036,000 available for allocations to projects. Prior year  unobligated funds specified by Congress to be reallocated in the amount  of $1,488,840 are then added and increase the total amount allocated to  $1,126,524,840. The reallocated funds are derived from unobligated and  deobligated balances for the following projects: Hartford-Old Saybrook,  CT, project, $496,280; New London-Waterfront, CT, access project,  $496,280; and North Front Range, CO, corridor feasibility study,  $496,280. The final allocation for each New Starts project is listed in  Table 8.     Prior year unobligated allocations for New Starts in the amount of  $543,136,665 remain available for obligation in FY 2002. This amount  includes $531,342,762 in fiscal years 2000 and 2001 unobligated  allocations, and $11,793,903 for fiscal years 1998 and 1999 unobligated  allocations that are extended in the FY 2002 Conference Report. These  unobligated amounts are displayed in Table 8A.     Capital Investment Program funds for New Starts projects identified  as having been extended in the FY 2002 Conference Report accompanying  the FY 2002 DOT Appropriations Act, will lapse September 30, 2002. A  list of the extended projects and the amount that remains unobligated  as of September 30, 2001, is appended to Table 8A for ready reference.  C. Bus      The FY 2002 DOT Appropriations Act provides $568,200,000, for the  purchase of buses, bus-related equipment and paratransit vehicles, and  for the construction of bus-related facilities. This amount represents  the guaranteed funding level under TEA-21.     TEA-21 established a $100 million Clean Fuels Formula Program under  49 U.S.C. 5308 (described in section XII below). The program is  authorized to be funded with $50 million from the Bus category of the  Capital Investment Program and $50 million from the Formula Program.  However, the FY 2002 DOT Appropriations Act directs FTA to transfer the  formula portion to, and merge it with, funding provided for the Bus  category of the Capital Investment Program. Thus, $618,200,000  appropriated in FY 2002 is available for funding the Bus category of  the Capital Investment Program. In addition, Congress directed that  funds made available for bus and bus facilities be supplemented with  $1,733,658 from projects included in previous Appropriations Acts,  which increases the total amount made available to $619,933,658. The  supplemental funds are derived from unobligated balances for the  following projects: Carroll County, NH transportation alliance buses,  $198,500; New Hampshire statewide buses, $34,001; Gary, IN transit  consortium buses, $310,157; Jefferson Parish, LA bus and bus  facilities, $347,375; Louisiana state infrastructure bank, bus and bus  [[Page 135]]  facilities, $347,375; and North Slope borough, AK, $496,250.     After deducting $6,182,000 for oversight, the amount available for  allocation under the Bus category is $613,751,658. Table 9 displays the  allocation of the FY 2002 Bus funds by State and project. The FY 2002  Conference Report accompanying the FY 2002 DOT Appropriations Act  allocated all of the FY 2002 Bus funds to specified States or  localities for bus and bus-related projects. FTA will honor those  allocations to the extent that they comply with the statutory  authorization for that program.     Prior year unobligated balances for Bus Program allocations in the  amount of $494,182,292 remain available for obligation in FY 2002. This  includes $477,559,360 in fiscal years 2000 and 2001 unobligated  allocations, and $16,622,932 for fiscal years 1998 and 1999 unobligated  allocations that are extended in the FY 2002 Conference Report or the  FY 2001 Supplemental Appropriations Act Conference Report. These  unobligated amounts are displayed in Table 9A.     Capital Investment Program funds for Bus projects identified as  having been extended in the Conference Report accompanying the FY 2002  DOT Appropriations Act or the FY 2001 Supplemental Appropriations Act,  will lapse September 30, 2002. A list of the extended projects and the  amount that remains unobligated as of September 30, 2001, is appended  to Table 9A for ready reference.     In addition, the FY 2002 Conference Report provides clarification  for FY 2001 projects and permits the use of FY 2001 appropriations for  additional work as follows:     (1) Funds appropriated for the Lowell, Massachusetts transit hub  can be used for the Hale Street bus maintenance and operations center;     (2) Funds appropriated for the Municipal Transit Operators in  California can be used for bus and bus facilities;     (3) Funds appropriated for the King County Metro Eastgate park and  ride can be used for the Issaquah Highlands park and ride;     (4) Funds allocated for buses for Suburban Mobility Authority for  Regional Transportation (SMART) in Southeast Michigan may also be  available for bus facilities; and     (5) Funds appropriated to the Burlington, Vermont multi-modal  transit project in fiscal years 1998, 1999, 2000, and 2001 will be  available for construction of the multimodal project and other transit  improvements.  X. Job Access and Reverse Commute Program      The FY 2002 DOT Appropriations Act provides $125 million for the  Job Access and Reverse Commute (JARC) Program, which is the guaranteed  funding level under TEA-21. In the FY 2002 Conference Report the  appropriators indicated their desire that $109,339,000 of this amount  be awarded to certain specified States and localities. These areas and  the corresponding amounts are listed in Table 10. States and localities  listed in the FY 2002 Conference Report, along with other States and  localities not so listed, are invited to apply for JARC funding  according to the procedures that will be published in a separate  Federal Register notice. That notice will solicit applications for the  $125 million available in FY 2002 and the $150 million that is the  guaranteed level of funding for FY 2003.     Because recipients of JARC funds have expressed the need for multi- year funding through the early stages of implementation, FTA will no  longer limit awards to a single year, but rather will consider multi- year funding in appropriate cases. To give effect to this new policy,  FTA will give priority to funding continuation of previously selected  projects. FTA will solicit applications for continued funding from  those applicants previously funded under the JARC program. Grantees may  apply for up to two additional years of continuation funding beyond  that previously approved. Continuation does not include expansion of  services beyond those previously funded. Expanded services will be  treated as new projects. Continuation projects are expected to document  their progress through their most recent progress report. Evaluation of  JARC projects' progress will be a key element in determining continued  FTA financial support.     FTA will solicit applications for new JARC projects both from  existing recipients and from States, localities and nonprofit  organizations that have not previously been awarded JARC funds. Because  FY 2003 is the last year of the TEA-21 authorization of the JARC  program, applicants for new projects will be encouraged to apply for a  level of funding that would allow them to sustain service for at least  two years.     Applicants identified in the FY 2002 Conference Report must  participate in this application process along with all other  applicants. FTA will evaluate and rank all projects submitted in  response to this new solicitation. Because it is expected that FY 2002  funds will be used primarily, if not entirely, for continuation  projects, it is expected that new projects will not be funded until FY  2003 funds become available.     The JARC program, established under TEA-21, provides funding for  the provision of transportation services designed to increase access to  jobs and employment-related activities. Job Access projects are those  that transport welfare recipients and low-income individuals, including  economically disadvantaged persons with disabilities, in urban,  suburban, or rural areas to and from jobs and activities related to  their employment. Reverse Commute projects provide transportation  services for the general public from urban, suburban, and rural areas  to suburban employment opportunities. A total of up to $10,000,000 from  the appropriation can be used for Reverse Commute Projects.     One of the goals of the JARC program is to increase collaboration  among transportation providers, human service agencies, employers,  metropolitan planning organizations, States, and affected communities  and individuals. All projects funded under this program must be derived  from an area-wide Job Access and Reverse Commute Transportation Plan,  developed through a regional approach which supports the implementation  of a variety of transportation services designed to connect welfare  recipients to jobs and related activities. A key element of the program  is making the most efficient use of existing public, nonprofit and  private transportation service providers.  XI. Over-the-Road Bus Accessibility Program      The amount made available for the Over-the-Road Bus Accessibility  (OTRB) Program in the FY 2002 DOT Appropriations Act is $6,950,000,  which is the guaranteed funding level under TEA-21. Of this amount,  $5,250,000 is available to providers of intercity fixed-route service,  and $1,700,000 is available to other providers of over-the-road bus  services, including local fixed-route service, commuter service, and  charter and tour service.     The OTRB program authorizes FTA to make grants to operators of  over-the-road buses to help finance the incremental capital and  training costs of complying with the DOT over-the-road bus  accessibility final rule, published on September 28, 1998 (63 FR  51670). Funds will be provided at 90 percent Federal share. FTA  conducts a national solicitation of applications and grantees are  selected on a competitive basis.     In FY 2001, a total of $3 million was available to intercity fixed- route  [[Page 136]]  providers and $1.7 million was available to all other providers. FTA  selected 61 applicants from among the 84 applications submitted for  funding incremental capital and training costs of complying with DOT's  OTRB Accessibility requirements.     A separate Federal Register Notice providing program guidance and  application procedures for FY 2002 will be issued.  XII. Clean Fuels Formula Program      TEA-21 established the Clean Fuels Formula Grant Program under  section 5308 of Title 49 U.S.C., to assist non-attainment and  maintenance areas in achieving or maintaining attainment status and to  support markets for emerging clean fuel technologies. Under the  program, public transit agencies in maintenance and non-attainment  areas (as defined by the EPA) are to apply for formula funds to acquire  clean fuel vehicles. The legislation specified the program to be funded  with $50 million from the bus category of the Capital Investment  Program, and $50 million from the Urbanized Area Formula Program in  each fiscal year of TEA-21. However, congressional appropriation  actions in this fiscal year as well as in fiscal years 1999, 2000, and  2001 have provided no funds for this program.     A Notice of Proposed Rulemaking was published in the Federal  Register on August 28, 2001 (66 FR 45561). The proposed rule  establishes the procedures potential recipients must use to apply for  this program. Comments on the proposed rule were due October 12, 2001.  Responses to those comments and preparation of the final rule are in  progress.     For further information contact Nancy Grubb, FTA Office of Resource  Management and State Programs, at (202) 366-2053.  XIII. National Planning and Research Program      The amount made available to the National Planning and Research  Program in the FY 2002 DOT Appropriations Act is $31,500,000, of which  Congress allocated $15,500,000 for specific activities. These  allocations are listed in Table 11.     The program's core effort is the deployment of technological  innovation to improve personal mobility, enhance the safety and  security of transit operations, minimize fuel consumption and air  pollution, increase ridership and enhance the quality of life of all  communities. Emphasis is placed on mainstreaming proven cost-effective  technological innovation through the FTA planning and capital  assistance programs. Primary target areas are security technologies to  protect against weapons of mass destruction, safety systems for  railroad grade crossing protection and shared-track operations, cost  reduction in advances in bus technology, and bus rapid transit.     FTA is directing resources for research, development, demonstration  and deployment activities associated with technology and other  innovations in four priority areas:       Safety and security systems--to improve driver operations,  minimize pedestrian conflicts, reduce terrorist threats and to  facilitate shared track operations;       Transit buses--to reduce operating and maintenance costs  through improved energy management; to introduce rapid bus operations;  to foster trade opportunities; to deploy low emission vehicles; and to  leverage the $600 million or more invested annually through the FTA Bus  capital assistance program;       Infrastructure--to support the $4.9 billion annual FTA  capital investment; to protect the integrity of federally supported  assets; and to facilitate the deployment of lower cost systems options  for expanding capacity; and       Knowledge Management--to expand U.S. transit industry  professional capacity and participation in global markets.  For additional information contact Henry Nejako, Program Management  Officer, Office of Research, Demonstration and Innovation, at (202)  366-3765.  XIV. Unit Values of Data for Urbanized Area Formula Program,  Nonurbanized Area Formula Program, and Fixed Guideway Modernization      The dollar unit values of data derived from the computations of the  Urbanized Area Formula Program, the Nonurbanized Area Formula Program,  and the Capital Investment Program--Fixed Guideway Modernization  apportionments are displayed in Table 15 of this notice. To replicate  an area's apportionment amount multiply its population, population  density, and data from the NTD by the appropriate unit value.  XV. Period of Availability of Funds      The funds apportioned under the Metropolitan Planning Program and  the Statewide Planning and Research Program, the Urbanized Area Formula  Program, and Fixed Guideway Modernization, in this notice, will remain  available to be obligated by FTA to recipients for three fiscal years  following FY 2002. Any of these apportioned funds unobligated at the  close of business on September 30, 2005, will revert to FTA for  reapportionment under the respective program.     Funds apportioned to nonurbanized areas under the Nonurbanized Area  Formula Program, including RTAP funds, will remain available for two  fiscal years following FY 2002. Any such funds remaining unobligated at  the close of business on September 30, 2004, will revert to FTA for  reapportionment among the States under the Nonurbanized Area Formula  Program. Funds allocated to States under the Elderly and Persons with  Disabilities Program in this notice must be obligated by September 30,  2002. Any such funds remaining unobligated as of this date will revert  to FTA for reapportionment among the States under the Elderly and  Persons with Disabilities Program. The FY 2002 DOT Appropriations Act  includes a provision requiring that FY 2002 New Starts and Bus funds  not obligated for their original purpose as of September 30, 2004,  shall be made available for other projects under 49 U.S.C. 5309.     JARC funds for projects selected by FTA for funding in FY 2002 will  remain available for two fiscal years following FY 2002. Any such funds  remaining unobligated at the close of business on September 30, 2004,  will revert to FTA for reallocation under the JARC program.     Capital Investment Program funds for New Starts and Bus projects  identified as having been extended in the FY 2002 Conference Report  accompanying the FY 2002 DOT Appropriations Act will lapse September  30, 2002.  XVI. Automatic Pre-Award Authority to Incur Project Costs  A. Policy      FTA provides blanket or automatic pre-award authority to cover  certain program areas described below. This pre-award authority allows  grantees to incur project costs prior to grant approval and retain  their eligibility for subsequent reimbursement after grant approval.  The grantee assumes all risk and is responsible for ensuring that all  conditions, which are described below, are met to retain eligibility.  This automatic pre-award spending authority permits a grantee to incur  costs on an eligible transit capital or planning project without  prejudice to possible future Federal participation in the cost of the  project or projects. Prior to exercising pre-award authority, grantees  must comply with the conditions and Federal requirements outlined in  [[Page 137]]  paragraphs B and C immediately below. Failure to do so will render an  otherwise eligible project ineligible for FTA financial assistance. In  addition, grantees are strongly encouraged to consult with the  appropriate FTA regional office if there is any question regarding the  eligibility of the project for future FTA funds or the applicability of  the conditions and Federal requirements.     Pre-award authority was extended in the June 24, 1998 Federal  Register Notice on TEA-21 to all formula funds and flexible funds that  will be apportioned during the authorization period of TEA-21, 1998- 2003. Pre-award authority also applies to Capital Investment Bus  allocations identified in this notice. For such section 5309 Capital  Investment Bus projects, the date that costs may be incurred is the  date that the appropriation bill in which they are contained is  enacted. Pre-award authority does not apply to Capital New Start funds,  or to Capital Investment Bus projects not specified in this or previous  notices, except as described in D below.  B. Conditions      Similar to the FTA Letter of No Prejudice (LONP) authority, the  conditions under which this authority may be utilized are specified  below:     (1) The pre-award authority is not a legal or moral commitment that  the project(s) will be approved for FTA assistance or that FTA will  obligate Federal funds. Furthermore, it is not a legal or moral  commitment that all items undertaken by the applicant will be eligible  for inclusion in the project(s).     (2) All FTA statutory, procedural, and contractual requirements  must be met.     (3) No action will be taken by the grantee that prejudices the  legal and administrative findings that the Federal Transit  Administrator must make in order to approve a project.     (4) Local funds expended by the grantee pursuant to and after the  date of the pre-award authority will be eligible for credit toward  local match or reimbursement if FTA later makes a grant for the  project(s) or project amendment(s).     (5) The Federal amount of any future FTA assistance awarded to the  grantee for the project will be determined on the basis of the overall  scope of activities and the prevailing statutory provisions with  respect to the Federal/local match ratio at the time the funds are  obligated.     (6) For funds to which the pre-award authority applies, the  authority expires with the lapsing of the fiscal year funds.     (7) The Financial Status Report, in TEAM-Web, must indicate the use  of pre-award authority.  C. Environmental, Planning, and Other Federal Requirements      FTA emphasizes that all of the Federal grant requirements must be  met for the project to remain eligible for Federal funding. Compliance  with NEPA and other environmental laws or executive orders (e.g.,  protection of parklands, wetlands, historic properties) must be  completed before State or local funds are spent on implementing  activities such as final design, construction, and acquisition for a  project that is expected to be subsequently funded with FTA funds.  Depending on which class the project is included under in FTA  environmental regulations (23 CFR part 771), the grantee may not  advance the project beyond planning and preliminary engineering before  FTA has issued either a categorical exclusion (refer to 23 CFR part  771.117(d)), a finding of no significant impact, or a record of  decision. The conformity requirements of the Clean Air Act (40 CFR part  93) also must be fully met before the project may be advanced with non- Federal funds.     Similarly, the requirement that a project be included in a locally  adopted metropolitan transportation improvement program and federally  approved statewide transportation improvement program must be followed  before the project may be advanced with non-Federal funds. For planning  projects, the project must be included in a locally approved Planning  Work Program that has been coordinated with the State. In addition,  Federal procurement procedures, as well as the whole range of Federal  requirements, must be followed for projects in which Federal funding  will be sought in the future. Failure to follow any such requirements  could make the project ineligible for Federal funding. In short, this  increased administrative flexibility requires a grantee to make certain  that no Federal requirements are circumvented through the use of pre- award authority. If a grantee has questions or concerns regarding the  environmental requirements, or any other Federal requirements that must  be met before incurring costs, it should contact the appropriate  regional office.     Before an applicant may incur costs for activities expected to be  funded by New Start funds, or for Bus Capital projects not listed in  this notice or previous notices, it must first obtain a written LONP  from FTA. To obtain an LONP, a grantee must submit a written request  accompanied by adequate information and justification to the  appropriate FTA regional office.  D. Pre-Award Authority for New Starts Projects  1. Preliminary Engineering and Final Design     New Starts projects are required to follow a federally defined  planning process. This process includes, among other things, FTA  approval of entry of a project into preliminary engineering and  approval to enter final design. The grantee request for entry into  preliminary engineering and the request for entry into final design  both document the project and how it meets the New Starts statutory  criteria for project evaluation and rating in detail. With FTA approval  to enter preliminary engineering, and subsequent approval to enter  final design, FTA will automatically extend pre-award authority to that  phase of project development. 2. Acquisition Activities     In the past, FTA provided applicant grantees pre-award authority to  incur costs for right-of-way acquisition for projects funded by sources  other than New Starts funds under the conditions described in  paragraphs A, B and C, above. With the issuance of this Notice, FTA  will extend automatic pre-award authority for the acquisition of real  property and real property rights for a New Starts project upon  completion of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) review of  that project. NEPA review is completed when FTA signs an environmental  Record of Decision (ROD) or Finding of No Significant Impact (FONSI),  or makes a Categorical Exclusion (CE) determination. The real estate  acquisition activities for a proposed New Starts project prior to  approval of Federal funding, no longer require a Letter of No Prejudice  (LONP) described in section XVII below. Real estate acquisition may now  commence upon completion of the NEPA review process.     Most major FTA-assisted projects require the acquisition of  residential and/or business properties and the relocation of the  occupants. Often real property rights, like railroad track usage  rights, are needed. With limited exceptions set forth in FTA's NEPA  guidance, the purchase of real property can prejudice the consideration  of less damaging alternatives and may not take place until the NEPA  process has been completed by FTA's signing of an environmental ROD or  FONSI or making a CE determination.     For FTA-assisted projects, acquisition of real property must be  made in accordance with the requirements of the Uniform Relocation  Assistance and Real  [[Page 138]]  Property Acquisition Policies Act (URA) and its implementing  regulations (49 CFR part 24). Compliance with the URA regulations  requires substantial lead-time. Properties must be appraised, persons  who will be displaced must be educated about their relocation rights,  proper housing must be found for displaced residents, and businesses  must be relocated in accordance with the URA. In some cases, the  remediation of contaminated soils or groundwater, or the removal of  underground storage tanks must be dealt with during the acquisition  process. Potentially responsible parties to the contamination must be  identified and their financial liability negotiated or litigated.  Acquisition of railroad right-of-way or usage rights is frequently a  negotiated transaction that is fundamental to the transit project and  therefore should be negotiated as early as possible after the  completion of the NEPA process. Delays in the closing on an acquisition  can lead to inconvenience or hardship for residents and businesses that  are being displaced. Delays can also lead to increases in property  values or in the current owners' financial expectations that prolong  negotiated settlements.     To facilitate the acquisition process for New Starts projects, FTA  will extend automatic pre-award authority to the acquisition of real  property and real property rights with the signing of the environmental  ROD or FONSI or the CE determination. This pre-award authority is  strictly limited to costs incurred to acquire real property and real  property rights and to provide relocation assistance in accordance with  the URA regulation. It is limited to the acquisition of real property  and real property rights that are explicitly identified in the final  EIS, EA or CE determination, as needed for the selected alternative  that is the subject of the FTA-signed ROD or FONSI, or the CE  determination. It does not cover site preparation, demolition, or any  other activity that is not strictly necessary to comply with the URA.  At FTA's discretion, these other activities may be covered by Letters  of No Prejudice, described in section XVII, below. This pre-award  authority does not cover the acquisition of construction equipment or  vehicles or any other acquisition except that of real property and real  property rights.     Grant applicants should use this pre-award authority for real  property very discreetly with a clear understanding that it does not  constitute a funding commitment by FTA. On occasion, even projects that  received a ``recommended'' rating from FTA under the New Starts  regulation (49 CFR part 611) have not received a Full Funding Grant  Agreement from FTA simply because the competition for the limited New  Starts funds is so intense.     This pre-award authority for the acquisition of real property and  real property rights, in accordance with the URA and after FTA's  signing of a ROD or FONSI or making a CE determination, is intended to  streamline the project delivery process, to enhance relocation services  for residents and businesses, and to avoid the escalation in the cost  of real property caused by delays in its acquisition. In granting this  pre-award authority, FTA is aware that the risk taken by the grant  applicant in acquiring real property without an FTA commitment is  somewhat mitigated by the re-sale value of the real property, in the  event that FTA funding assistance is not ultimately forthcoming and the  project is abandoned. 3. National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) Activities     The National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) requires that projects  with potentially significant adverse impacts proposed for Federal  funding assistance be subjected to a public and interagency review of  the need for the project, its environmental and community impacts, and  alternatives with potentially less damaging actions. Projects for which  FTA experience indicates there are no significant impacts are subject  to NEPA, but categorically excluded from the more rigorous levels of  NEPA review.     FTA regulations (23 CFR 771.105(e)) state that the costs incurred  by a grant applicant for the preparation of environmental documents  requested by FTA are eligible for FTA assistance. FTA has previously  extended pre-award authority to incur costs for environmental reviews  and documents from other funding sources but not from New Starts funds.     With issuance of this notice, FTA extends automatic pre-award  authority for costs incurred to conduct the NEPA environmental review,  including historic preservation activities, and to prepare an EIS, EA,  CE, or other environmental documents for a proposed New Starts project,  effective as of the date of the federal approval of the relevant  Statewide Transportation Improvement Program (STIP) or STIP amendment  that includes the project. This pre-award authority applies to New  Starts funding, as well as other funding sources. This pre-award  authority is strictly limited to costs incurred to conduct the NEPA  process and prepare environmental and historic preservation documents.  It does not cover preliminary engineering activities beyond those  absolutely necessary for NEPA compliance. As with any pre-award  authority, FTA participation in costs incurred is not guaranteed.     This pre-award authority for using New Starts funds for  environmental and historic preservation work for proposed New Starts  projects, as long as those projects are in FTA-approved STIPs, is being  provided for the first time with this Notice. It is intended to  streamline the NEPA process in accordance with TEA-21 section 1309,  ``Environmental Streamlining,'' by eliminating unnecessary delays in  starting up the conceptual engineering and environmental reviews, the  public involvement process, and the interagency coordination process  for New Starts projects.  XVII. Letters of No Prejudice (LONP) Policy  A. Policy      Letter of No Prejudice (LONP) authority allows an applicant to  incur costs on a future project utilizing non-Federal resources with  the understanding that the costs incurred subsequent to the issuance of  the LONP may be reimbursable as eligible expenses or eligible for  credit toward the local match should FTA approve the project at a later  date. LONPs are applicable to projects not covered by automatic pre- award authority. The majority of LONPs will be for section 5309 New  Starts funds not covered under a full funding grant agreement or for  section 5309 Bus funds not yet appropriated by Congress. At the end of  an authorization period, there may be LONPs for formula funds beyond  the life of the current authorization.     Under most circumstances the LONP will cover the total project.  Under certain circumstances the LONP may be issued for local match  only, for example, to permit real estate purchased as it becomes  available to be used for match for the project at a later date.  B. Conditions      The following conditions apply to all LONPs.     (1) LONP pre-award authority is not a legal or moral commitment  that the project(s) will be approved for FTA assistance or that FTA  will obligate Federal funds. Furthermore, it is not a legal or moral  commitment that all items undertaken by the applicant will be eligible  for inclusion in the project(s).     (2) All FTA, DOT, and other Federal statutory, regulatory,  procedural, and contractual requirements must be met.     (3) No action will be taken by the grantee that prejudices the  legal and  [[Page 139]]  administrative findings that the Federal Transit Administrator must  make in order to approve a project.     (4) Local funds expended by the grantee pursuant to and after the  date of the LONP will be eligible for credit toward local match or  reimbursement if FTA later makes a grant for the project(s) or project  amendment(s).     (5) The Federal amount of any future FTA assistance to the grantee  for the project will be determined on the basis of the overall scope of  activities and the prevailing statutory provisions with respect to the  Federal/local match ratio at the time the funds are obligated.     (6) For funds to which this pre-award authority applies, the  authority expires with the lapsing of the fiscal year funds.  C. Environmental, Planning, and Other Federal Requirements      As with automatic pre-award authority, FTA emphasizes that all of  the Federal grant requirements must be met for the project to remain  eligible for Federal funding. Compliance with NEPA and other  environmental laws or executive orders (e.g., protection of parklands,  wetlands, historic properties) must be completed before State or local  funds are spent on implementation activities such as final design,  construction, or acquisition for a project expected to be subsequently  funded with FTA funds. Depending on which class the project is included  under in FTA's environmental regulations (23 CFR part 771), the grantee  may not advance the project beyond planning and preliminary engineering  before FTA has approved either a categorical exclusion (see 23 CFR  section 771.117(d)), a finding of no significant impact, or a record of  decision. The conformity requirements of the Clean Air Act (40 CFR part  93) also must be fully met before the project may be advanced with non- Federal funds.     Similarly, the requirement that a capital project be included in a  locally adopted metropolitan transportation improvement program and  federally approved statewide transportation improvement program must be  followed before the project may be advanced with non-Federal funds. For  planning projects, the project must be included in a locally approved  Planning Work Program that has been coordinated with the State. In  addition, Federal procurement procedures, as well as the whole range of  Federal requirements, must be followed for projects in which Federal  funding will be sought in the future. Failure to follow any such  requirements could make the project ineligible for Federal funding. In  short, this pre-award authority requires a grantee to make certain that  no Federal requirements are circumvented. If a grantee has questions or  concerns regarding the environmental requirements, or any other Federal  requirements that must be met before incurring costs, it should contact  the appropriate FTA regional office.  D. Request for LONP      Before an applicant may incur costs for a project not covered by  automatic pre-award authority, it must first submit a written request  for an LONP to the appropriate regional office. This written request  must include a description of the project for which pre-award authority  is desired and a justification for the request.  XVIII.

FTA Fiscal Year 2002 Annual List of Certifications and  Assurances      The ``Fiscal Year 2002 Annual List of Certifications and  Assurances'' is published in conjunction with this notice. It appears  as a separate Part of the Federal Register on the same date whenever  possible. The FY 2002 list contains several changes to the previous  year's Federal Register publication. As in previous years, the grant  applicant should certify electronically. Under certain circumstances  the applicant may enter its PIN number in lieu of an electronic  signature provided by its attorney, provided the applicant has on file  the current affirmation of its attorney in writing dated this Federal  fiscal year. The applicant is advised to contact the appropriate FTA  Regional Office for electronic procedure information.     The ``Fiscal Year 2002 Annual List of Certifications and  Assurances'' is accessible on the Internet at  http://www.fta.dot.gov/ library/legal/ca.htm . Any questions regarding this document may be  addressed to the appropriate Regional Office.  XX. Grant Application Procedures      All applications for FTA funds should be submitted to the  appropriate FTA Regional Office. FTA utilizes TEAM-Web, an Internet  accessible electronic grant application system, and all applications  should be  filed  electronically. FTA has provided exceptions to the  requirement for electronic filing of applications for certain new, non- traditional grantees in the Job Access and Reverse Commute and Over- the-Road Bus Accessibility programs as well as to a few grantees that  have not successfully connected to or accessed TEAM-Web.     In FY 2001, FTA established a 90-day goal for processing and  approving all capital, planning and operating grants, including the  section 5307 Urbanized Area Formula Program, section 5309 Fixed  Guideway Modernization, New Starts and Bus Programs, the section 5310  Elderly and Persons with Disabilities Program, the section 5311  Nonurbanized Area Formula Program, the TEA-21 Job Access and Reverse  Commute Program, the TEA-21 Over-the-Road Bus Accessibility Program,  section 5303 Metropolitan Planning Program, and section 5313(b)  Statewide Planning and Research Program. The 90-day processing time  begins with the receipt of a complete application by the Regional  Office. In order for an application to be considered complete, it must  meet the following requirements: all projects must be contained in an  approved STIP (when required), all environmental findings must be made  by FTA, there must be an adequate project description, local share must  be secure, all required civil rights submissions must have been  submitted, and certifications and assurances must  [[Page 140]]  be properly submitted. Once an application is complete, the FTA  Regional Office will assign a project number and when required submit  the application to the Department of Labor for a certification under  section 5333(b). The FTA circulars referenced below contain more  information regarding application contents and complete applications.  State applicants for section 5311 are reminded that they must certify  to DOL that all subrecipients have agreed to the standard labor  protection warranty for section 5311 and provide DOL with other related  information for each grant.     Formula and Capital Investment grant applications should be  prepared in conformance with the following FTA Circulars: Program  Guidance and Application Instructions for Metropolitan Planning Program  Grants--C8100.1B, October 25, 1996; Urbanized Area Formula Program:  Grant Application Instructions--C9030.1C, October 1, 1998; Nonurbanized  Area Formula Program Guidance and Grant Application Instructions-- C9040.1E, October 1, 1998; Section 5310 Elderly and Persons with  Disabilities Program Guidance and Application Instructions C9070.1E,  October 1, 1998; and Section 5309 Capital Program: Grant Application  Instructions--C9300.1A, October 1, 1998. Guidance on preparation of  applications for State Planning and Research funds may be obtained from  each FTA Regional Office. Copies of circulars are available from FTA  Regional Offices as well as the FTA Web site.     Applications for grants containing transferred FHWA funds (STP,  CMAQ, and others) should be prepared in the same manner as for funds  under the program to which they are being transferred. The application  for flexible funds needs to specifically indicate the type and amount  of flexible funds being transferred to FTA. The application should also  describe which items are being funded with transferred funds,  consistent with the Statewide Transportation Improvement Program  (STIP).

Background      Metropolitan Planning funds are apportioned by statutory formula to  the States for allocation to Metropolitan Planning Organizations (MPOs)  in urbanized areas or portions thereof to provide funds for their  Unified Planning Work Programs. Statewide Planning and Research funds  are apportioned to States by statutory formula to provide funds for  their Statewide Planning and Research Programs. Urbanized Area Formula  Program funds are apportioned by statutory formula to urbanized areas  and to Governors to provide capital, operating and planning assistance  in  [[Page 11907]]  urbanized areas. Nonurbanized Area Formula Program funds are  apportioned by statutory formula to Governors for capital, operating  and administrative assistance in nonurbanized areas. Elderly and  Persons with Disabilities Program funds are apportioned by statutory  formula to Governors to provide capital assistance to organizations  providing transportation service for the elderly and persons with  disabilities. Fixed Guideway Modernization funds are apportioned by  statutory formula to specified urbanized areas for capital improvements  in rail and other fixed guideways. New Starts identified in the FY 2003  DOT Appropriations Act and Bus and Bus-Related Allocations identified  in the Conference Report accompanying the Act are included in this  notice. FTA will honor those designations included in report language  to the extent that the projects meet the statutory intent of the  specific program.  II. Overview  A. Fiscal Year 2003 Appropriations      The FY 2003 funding amounts for FTA programs are displayed in Table  1. The amounts have been adjusted, from the FY 2003 enacted funding  levels, to reflect an across-the-board .65 percent reduction  proportionately applied to the discretionary budget authority and  obligation limitation, and to each program, project and activity, as  directed under section 601 of Title VI of the Consolidated  Appropriations Resolution, 2003, along with transferred and reallocated  resources. The following text provides a narrative explanation of the  funding levels and other factors affecting the apportionments and  allocations.  B. TEA-21 Authorized Program Levels      TEA-21 provides a combination of trust and general fund  authorizations that total $8.194 billion for the FY 2003 FTA program.  Of this amount, $7.226 billion was guaranteed under the discretionary  spending cap and was enacted under the FY 2003 DOT Appropriations Act.  However, after applying the across-the-board .65 percent reduction, as  directed by section 601 of Title IV of the Consolidated Appropriations  Resolution, 2003, new funding for FTA programs is $7.179 billion. See  Table 11 for fiscal years 1998-2003 guaranteed funding levels by  program and Table 11A for the total of guaranteed and non-guaranteed  levels by program.  C. Project Management Oversight      Section 5327 of Title 49 U.S.C., permits the Secretary of  Transportation to use up to one-half percent of the funds made  available under the Urbanized Area Formula Program and the Nonurbanized  Area Formula Program, and three-quarters percent of funds made  available under the Capital Investment Program to contract with any  person to oversee the construction of any major project under these  statutory programs; to conduct safety, procurement, management and  financial reviews and audits; and to provide technical assistance to  correct deficiencies identified in compliance reviews and audits.  Language in the 2002 DOT Appropriations Act increased the amount made  available under the Capital Investment Program for oversight activities  to one percent.  D. Leveraging Grant Funds      Public transportation grantees are reminded that with interest  rates at currently low levels it may be cost-effective to leverage  their projected grant receipts, and thereby accelerate the acquisition  of needed rolling stock or completion of essential infrastructure. FTA  encourages grant recipients to examine all leveraging options at their  disposal, including the use of grant anticipation notes (GAN) secured  with Formula Capital, Fixed Guideway Modernization, and New Starts  funds. To date, over $1.7 billion in grant anticipation bonds have been  issued, allowing major projects to be completed early and at lower  cost. FTA will provide information and other assistance to grantees  that wish to examine financing options during their project development  process.     For additional information, contact Paul L. Marx, Office of Policy  Development, at (202) 366-1675.  III. Fiscal Year 2003 Focus Areas      FTA draws attention to the following areas of particular interest  to grantees in FY 2003 relative to the FTA programs.  A. Transit Safety and Security      Since September 11th, the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) has  undertaken a series of major steps to help prepare the transit industry  to counter terrorist threats. FTA has provided direct assistance to  transit agencies through on-site readiness assessments, technical  assistance teams, regional forums for emergency responders, grants for  drills, training, and accelerating technology and research projects.  >From this initial work, it is clear that it is critical to integrate  security throughout every aspect of transit programs, operations, and  infrastructure.     Although the transit industry has made great strides in  strengthening security and emergency preparedness, there is much more  to do. The most important investments for transit agencies to improve  security elements are in the areas of employee training, public  awareness, and emergency response planning. Detailed information about  these three areas and other important actions can be found in FTA's  list of Top 20 Security Program Action Items for transit agencies.  These 20 action items are based on good security practices identified  through FTA's Security Assessments and the technical assistance  program. The Top 20 Security Program Action Items can be found on FTA's  Web site at [ http://transit-safety.volpe.dot.gov/security/ SecurityInitiatives/Top20/default.asp  ]. FTA will work with transit   agencies to assist you as you incorporate these practices into your  programs.  B. Ridership      FTA's FY 2003 strategic business plan establishes FTA's core values  and identifies a number of strategic goals for sustaining these values  over the next three years. Specifically, FTA seeks to deliver products  and services that are valued by its customers and to assist transit  agencies in better meeting the needs of their customers. Increasing  transit ridership is a key measure of success in achieving this  objective. FTA has further identified a goal of achieving an average  2.5 percent increase in the number of transit passenger-miles traveled  per market (controlling for differences in employment levels) this  fiscal year. FTA is in the process of identifying a range of research,  guidance, and other technical assistance to support State and local  transit efforts to increase ridership. FTA encourages all transit  agencies to focus attention on ways to increase transit ridership, and  will be issuing further information about the FTA ridership initiative  throughout FY 2003.  C. 2000 Census Changes and Impact on Grantee Status as Designated  Recipient      The Census Bureau released the 2000 Census urbanized area  designations on May 1, 2002, and provided corrections/changes to the  list of designated areas in subsequent Federal Register Notices, dated  August 23 and November 20, 2002. FTA used this 2000 Census population  data and information for the first time to apportion transit funds in  FY 2003, which accounts for a number of changes from FY 2002  apportionments.  [[Page 11908]]      In the 2000 Census, nonurbanized population decreased by three  percent to 89.6 million from the 1990 Census, and elderly population  increased by 18 percent to 35.4 million. Four hundred sixty-five  urbanized areas were designated, which is 59 more than the 406  designated in the 1990 Census. Seventy-six are newly qualified  urbanized areas, and more than 50 urbanized areas crossed the 200,000  population threshold, as a result of growth; the merger of two small  urbanized areas; or the merger of one or more small urbanized areas  into an existing urbanized area with population over 200,000. In  addition, 14 urbanized areas were formed from splitting existing  urbanized areas, more than 70 urbanized areas had name or description  changes, which in some cases includes the addition of a new State in  the urbanized area description/geographical boundary, and two urbanized  areas (Montgomery, AL and Lorain-Elyria, OH) saw their populations  decrease to less than 200,000. 2000 Census information and FTA analysis  of the changes may be found on the FTA Web site at [ http:// www.fta.dot.gov/library/planning/census/censusinfo.html  ].   www.fta.dot.gov/library/planning/census/censusinfo.html ].      The large number of urbanized areas affected by 2000 Census changes  and the assorted types of changes experienced require that many areas  designate or change their ``Designated Recipient.'' In order for FTA to  award a grant to an urbanized area as part of its Urbanized Area  Formula Program (Title 49 U.S.C. section 5307), a grant recipient must  be a ``Designated Recipient'' for that urbanized area or must be a  public agency authorized by the Designated Recipient to apply for  grants. Documentation for new or changed Designated Recipients in areas  over 200,000 in population shall include the following:     1. A letter expressing the concurrence of the Governor or of  another state agency in which the Governor's authority to concur in  designations of recipients has been delegated;     2. Concurrence by the publicly-owned operators of mass  transportation servicing the urbanized area of the Designated  Recipient(s);     3. An appropriately certified resolution of the policy-making body  of the Metropolitan Planning Organization (MPO) concurring in the  Designated Recipient(s); and     4. For each Designated Recipient, an opinion of counsel certifying  to the entity's legal capacity to perform the functions of a Designated  Recipient.     For urbanized areas greater than 50,000 but under 200,000 in  population, the Governor of each State is the Designated Recipient. The  Governor may:     1. Retain Designated Recipient status himself/herself. No  documentation needs to be submitted to support this action; or     2. Designate one or more local Designated Recipients for each  urbanized area under 200,000 in population. Such designation must be  documented by letter from the Governor naming the local Designated  Recipient and by an opinion of counsel for each such Designated  Recipient certifying its legal capacity to perform the functions of a  Designated Recipient.     Documentation relative to Designated Recipients or public agencies  authorized by the Designated Recipient to apply for grants should be  forwarded to the appropriate FTA Regional Office. For further  information contact the appropriate FTA Regional Office, or Ken  Johnson, FTA Office of Resource Management and State Programs, at (202)  366-2053.  IV. Metropolitan Planning Program and State Planning and Research  Program  A. Metropolitan Planning Program      Funding made available for the Metropolitan Planning Program (49  U.S.C. 5303) by the FY 2003 DOT Appropriations Act is $59,993,094 after  application of the across-the-board .65 percent reduction. The FY 2003  Metropolitan Planning Program apportionment to States for MPOs' use in  urbanized areas totals $60,443,434. This amount includes $59,993,094 in  FY 2003 funds, and $450,340 in prior year funds available for  reapportionment under this program. A basic allocation of 80 percent of  this amount ($48,354,747) is distributed to the States based on the  State's urbanized area population as defined by the U.S. Census Bureau  for subsequent State distribution to each urbanized area, or parts  thereof, within each State. A supplemental allocation of the remaining  20 percent ($12,088,687) is also provided to the States based on an FTA  administrative formula to address planning needs in the larger, more  complex urbanized areas. Table 2 contains the State apportionments for  the combined basic and supplemental allocations.     Each State, in cooperation with the MPOs, must develop an  allocation formula for the combined apportionment, which distributes  these funds to MPOs representing urbanized areas, or parts thereof,  within the State. States must reaffirm these in-State formulas or  develop new ones, which then must be submitted to the FTA Regional  Office for approval before these funds area distributed.     As noted in section III.C above, 2000 Census urbanized area  designations are available in Federal Register Notices issued by the  Census Bureau and may be accessed at [ http://www.fta.dot.gov/library/ legal/federalregister/2002/index.html  ] on the FTA Web site. FTA has   posted on its Web site a comparison of FY 2003 guaranteed funding  levels based on 2000 Census and based on the 1990 census information  for each State at [ http://www.fta.dot.gov/library/planning/census/comp/ t2.html  ] and a comparison of the amounts actually apportioned for   fiscal year 2002 using both the 1990 Census and the 2000 Census at  [ http://www.fta.dot.gov/library/planning/census/comp/t1.html ]. This   [http:// www.fta.dot.gov/library/planning/census/comp/t1.html ]. This   information should be utilized by each state when reaffirming or  revising in-state formulas.  B. Statewide Planning and Research Program      Funding made available for the Statewide Planning and Research  Program (49 U.S.C. 5313(b)) by the FY 2003 DOT Appropriations Act is  $12,532,406 after application of the across-the-board .65 percent  reduction. The FY 2003 apportionment for the Statewide Planning and  Research Program (SPRP) totals $12,643,295. This amount includes  $12,532,406 in FY 2003 funds, and $110,889 in prior year funds  available for reapportionment under this program. Final State  apportionments for this program are also contained in Table 2. These  funds may be used for a variety of purposes such as planning, technical  studies and assistance, demonstrations, management training, and  cooperative research. In addition, a State may authorize a portion of  these funds to be used to supplement metropolitan planning funds  allocated by the State to its urbanized areas, as the State deems  appropriate.  C. FHWA Metropolitan Planning Program and State Planning and Research  Program      For informational purposes, the estimated FY 2003 apportionments  for the FHWA Metropolitan Planning Program (PL) are contained in Table  3. Actual apportionments for the FY 2003 FHWA State Planning and  Research Program (SPRP) were not available at the time of publication  of this notice.  D. Local Match Waiver for Specified Planning Activities      Job Access and Reverse Commute Planning. Federal, State and local  [[Page 11909]]  welfare reform initiatives may require the development of new and  innovative public and other transportation services to ensure that  former welfare recipients have adequate mobility for reaching  employment opportunities. In recognition of the key role that  transportation plays in ensuring the success of welfare-to-work  initiatives, FTA and FHWA permit the waiver of the local match  requirement for job access and reverse commute planning activities  undertaken with both FTA and FHWA Metropolitan Planning Program and  State Planning and Research Program funds. FTA and FHWA will support  requests for waivers when they are included in Metropolitan Unified  Planning Work Programs and State Planning and Research Programs and  meet all other requirements.  E. Planning Emphasis Areas for Fiscal Year 2003      The FTA and FHWA identify Planning Emphasis Areas (PEAs) annually  to promote priority themes for consideration, as appropriate, in  metropolitan and statewide transportation planning processes. To  support this, FTA and FHWA will prepare an inventory of current  practice, guidance and training in those areas. Opportunities for  exchanging ideas and experiences on innovative practices in these topic  areas also will be provided throughout the year. For FY 2003, five key  planning themes have been identified: (1) Consideration of safety and  security in the transportation planning process; (2) integration of  planning and environmental processes; (3) consideration of management  and operations within planning processes; (4) State DOT consultation  with non-metropolitan local officials; and (5) enhancing the technical  capacity of planning processes.     1. Safety and Security in the Transportation Planning Process. TEA- 21 emphasizes the safety and security of transportation systems as a  national priority and calls for transportation projects and strategies  that ``increase the safety and security of transportation systems.''  This entails integration of safety and facility security into all  stages of the transportation planning process.     FTA and FHWA are working together to advance the state-of-practice  in addressing safety and security in the metropolitan and statewide  planning process through workshops and case studies. A report prepared  by the Transportation Research Board (TRB), Transportation Research  Circular E-C02, ``Safety-Conscious Planning,'' January 2001, describes  the issues and recommendations identified at a Safety in Planning  workshop held earlier. The report is available on the TRB Web site at  [ http://www.nas.edu/trb ]. Also, the Institute of Transportation   [http:// www.nas.edu/trb ]. Also, the Institute of Transportation   Engineers (ITE) has prepared a discussion paper on the topic, entitled  ``The Development of the Safer Network Transportation Planning  Process,'' which is posted to their Web site at [ http://www.ite.org ].  Process,'' which is posted to their Web site at [http:// www.ite.org ].      2. Integrated Planning and Environmental Processes. TEA-21 mandated  the elimination of the Major Investment Study as a stand-alone  requirement, while integrating the concept within the planning and  project development/environmental review processes. A training course  entitled ``Linking Planning and NEPA'' is being developed and will be  made available at the National Transit Institute Web site, [ http:// www.ntionline.com  ].   www.ntionline.com ].      3. Consideration of Management and Operations within Planning  Processes. TEA-21 challenges FHWA and FTA to move beyond traditional  capital programs for improving the movement of people and goods-- focusing on the need to improve the way transportation systems are  managed and operated. FTA and FHWA have convened a working group and  have commissioned discussion papers on the topic. This information is  available at [ http://plan2op.fhwa.dot.gov ].      4. State DOT Consultation With Non-Metropolitan Local Officials. On  January 23, 2003, the FTA and FHWA issued a final Rule on consultation,  which can be accessed at [ http://www.fta.dot.gov/library/legal/ federalregister/2003/fr12303.html  ]. This final rule amends the 1993   Joint FTA/FHWA Planning regulation published in the Federal Register,  Volume 58, No. 207, on October 28, 1993. Consultation is a vital issue  within the transportation planning process. Each State shall have a  documented process(es) that implements consultation with non- metropolitan local officials in the statewide planning process and  development of the statewide transportation improvement program by  February 24, 2004. The FTA and FHWA will work with each State to help  facilitate development of the documented process(es), but will not  review or approve the documented process(es). However, the FTA and FHWA  in the State Planning Finding will comment on progress toward  accomplishing the documented process(es) and its implementation. Since  consultation is a vital issue, each state shall review its documented  process and solicit comments regarding the effectiveness of its  consultation process within two years of adopting its documented  process, and thereafter, at least once every five years.     5. Enhancing the Technical Capacity of Planning Processes. Reliable  information on current and projected usage and performance of  transportation systems is critical to the ability of planning processes  to supply credible information to decision-makers to support  preparation of plans and programs that respond to their localities'  unique needs and policy issues. To ensure the reliability of usage and  performance data, as well as the responsiveness of policy forecasting  tools, an evaluation is needed of the quality of information provided  by the technical tools, data sources, and forecasting models, as well  as the expertise of staff to ensure its adequacy to support decision- making. If this expertise is found to be lacking, the responsible  agencies within metropolitan and statewide planning processes are  encouraged to devote appropriate resources to enhance and maintain  their technical capacity.     The metropolitan and statewide transportation planning processes  have become critical tools for responding to increasingly complex  issues at the State and local levels. Many of these issues are  encompassed in previously listed planning emphasis areas (e.g.,  integrated planning and environmental processes, management and  operations, analytical tools and methods) and include much more. It is  essential that FTA and FHWA provide technical assistance, training, and  information to our customers to further enhance the skills and  capabilities they utilize to conduct effective transportation planning  processes. The FTA and FHWA have created the Planning Capacity Building  (PCB) Program, which combines what previously were separate programs  focused on planning processes in metropolitan, statewide and rural  areas. The PCB is a tool to disseminate and coordinate information,  training, and foster a dialogue for the exchange of ideas. More  information on the PCB program can be found at [ http:// www.mcb.fhwa.dot.gov  ]. (Note--As of this writing, a merged Web site    www.mcb.fhwa.dot.gov ]. (Note--As of this writing, a merged Web site   focused on metropolitan, statewide, and rural issues is under  development.)     For further information on these PEAs, contact Candace Noonan, FTA  Office of Planning, (202) 366-1648, or John Humeston, FHWA Office of  Planning, (202) 366-1862.  F. Consolidated Planning Grants      Since FY 1997, FTA and FHWA have offered States the option of  participating in a pilot Consolidated Planning Grant (CPG) program.  Information concerning  [[Page 11910]]  participation in the CPG program can be found on the FTA Web site at  [ http://www.fta.dot.gov/office/public/cpg.htm ]. For further information   [http:// www.fta.dot.gov/office/public/cpg.htm ]. For further information   on participating in the CPG Pilot, contact Candace Noonan, Office of  Planning, FTA, at (202) 366-1648 or Anthony Solury, Office of Planning  and Environment, FHWA, at (202) 366-5003.  G. FTA Review of Alternative Analysis      FTA has long had substantive involvement in the evaluation of  alternatives performed to comply with the National Environmental Policy  Act (NEPA). FTA would like to extend this interest to comparable  planning-level alternatives analysis, and requests that local agencies  that intend to conduct such a study prior to NEPA review notify their  FTA Regional Office in writing if such a study may result in a transit  project being proposed for funding under the Section 5309 New Starts  program. FTA further requests the opportunity to review any NEPA or  pre-NEPA alternatives analysis scope of work, purpose and need,  description of alternatives, and technical methodologies and results as  they are developed. FTA desires to become involved in these local  studies for three reasons: (1) To assist local agencies in addressing  technical and procedural issues early in the study process, rather than  at the end when it may be too late to solve them efficiently; (2) to  ensure that FTA requirements for alternatives analysis are met (this  includes the selection of a New Starts Baseline alternative and  documentation of planning-level information needed to perform a Before  and After Study, should the resulting project eventually receive a Full  Funding Grant Agreement); and (3) to gain sufficient understanding of  the resulting project to support FTA's decision to advance it into  preliminary engineering (PE) and, later, final design. If the  alternatives analysis is done outside of NEPA, FTA's review is further  intended to help ensure that its results, including any elimination of  alternatives from further consideration, are adequately supported and  will stand up when the NEPA review is initiated.     Failure to provide FTA with an opportunity to participate in the  alternatives analysis could result in additional study effort necessary  to ensure consistency with FTA policy and good planning practices. Such  additional work could further result in significant delays in the  processing of the request to enter into PE.     In February 2003, FTA posted under the New Starts section of its  Web site [ http://www.fta.dot.gov/library/policy/ns/ns.htm ] revised   Web site [http:// www.fta.dot.gov/library/policy/ns/ns.htm ] revised   preliminary guidance on advancing fixed guideway transit investments  through planning and project development. This guidance provides  additional detail on FTA's expectations for alternatives analysis and  its role in the study process. For additional information, contact Sean  Libberton, FTA Office of Planning, at (202) 366-2360.  V. Urbanized Area Formula Program  A. Total Urbanized Area Formula Apportionments      The amount made available to the Urbanized Area Formula Program (49  U.S.C. 5307) by the FY 2003 DOT Appropriations Act is $3,423,540,998,  after application of the across-the-board .65 percent reduction. In  addition, $5,479,136 in prior year funds became available for  reapportionment under the Urbanized Area Formula Program as provided by  49 U.S.C. 5336(i).     After reserving $17,117,705 for oversight, the amount of FY 2003  funds available for apportionment is $3,406,423,293. The funds to be  reapportioned, described in the previous paragraph, are then added and  increase the total amount apportioned for this program to  $3,411,902,429. Table 4 displays the amounts apportioned under the  Urbanized Area Formula Program. Table 12 contains the apportionment  formula for the Urbanized Area Formula Program.     An additional $4,818,425 is made available for the Alaska Railroad  for improvements to its passenger operations, after application of the  across-the-board .65 percent reduction. After reserving $24,092 for  oversight, $4,794,333 is available for the Alaska Railroad.  B. Data Used for Urbanized Area Formula Apportionments      Data from the 2001 National Transit Database (NTD) Report Year were  used to calculate the FY 2003 Urbanized Area Formula apportionments for  urbanized areas 200,000 in population and over. 2000 Census Population  and population density data are also used in calculating apportionments  under the Urbanized Area Formula Program.  C. Urbanized Area Formula Apportionments to Governors      The total Urbanized Area Formula apportionment to the Governor for  use in areas under 200,000 in population for each State is shown in  Table 4. This table also contains the apportionment amount attributable  to each urbanized area within the State. The Governor may determine the  allocation of funds among the urbanized areas under 200,000 in  population with the following exception: as further discussed in  Section F below, funds attributed to an urbanized area under 200,000 in  population, located within the planning boundaries of a Transportation  Management Area, must be obligated in that small urbanized area.  D. Transit Enhancements      One percent of the Urbanized Area Formula Program apportionment in  each urbanized area with a population of 200,000 and over must be made  available only for transit enhancements. Table 4 shows the amount set  aside for enhancements in these areas.     The term ``transit enhancement'' includes projects or project  elements that are designed to enhance mass transportation service or  use and are physically or functionally related to transit facilities.  Eligible enhancements include the following: (1) Historic preservation,  rehabilitation, and operation of historic mass transportation  buildings, structures, and facilities (including historic bus and  railroad facilities); (2) bus shelters; (3) landscaping and other  scenic beautification, including tables, benches, trash receptacles,  and street lights; (4) public art; (5) pedestrian access and walkways;  (6) bicycle access, including bicycle storage facilities and installing  equipment for transporting bicycles on mass transportation vehicles;  (7) transit connections to parks within the recipient's transit service  area; (8) signage; and (9) enhanced access for persons with  disabilities to mass transportation.     It is the responsibility of the MPO to determine how the one  percent will be allotted to transit projects. The one percent minimum  requirement does not preclude more than one percent being expended in  an urbanized area for transit enhancements. However, items that are  only eligible as enhancements--in particular, operating costs for  historic facilities--may be assisted only within the one percent  funding level.     The recipient must submit a report to the appropriate FTA Regional  Office listing the projects or elements of projects carried out with  those funds during the previous fiscal year and the amount awarded. The  report must be submitted with the Federal fiscal year's final quarterly  progress report in TEAM-Web. The report should include the following  elements: (a) Grantee name, (b) urbanized area name and number, (c) FTA  project number, (d) transit enhancement category, (e) brief description  of enhancement and progress towards project  [[Page 11911]]  implementation, (f) activity line item code from the approved budget,  and (g) amount awarded by FTA for the enhancement.  E. Fiscal Year 2003 Operating Assistance      In general, FY 2003 funding for operating assistance is available  only to urbanized areas with populations under 200,000. For these  areas, there is no limitation on the amount of the State apportionment  that may be used for operating assistance, and the Federal/local share  ratio is 50/50. TEA-21 provides an exception to the restriction on  operating assistance in areas over 200,000 in population; eligible  areas have already been identified and notified.     Pub. L. 107-232, signed by the President on October 1, 2002, allows  transit systems in urbanized areas that, for the first time, exceeded  200,000 in population according to the 2000 Census to use section 5307  funds for operating assistance. A list of the eligible 2000 Census  urbanized areas (with populations 200,000 or greater) to which Pub. L.  107-232 applies and that may use FY 2003 funds for operating assistance  is provided in Table 15. The listing also shows the maximum amount of  the area's FY 2003 apportionment that may be used for operating  assistance (the FY 2003 Operating Limitation). The use of the urbanized  area funds for operating assistance by these areas is restricted to  projects carried out within the geographical or service area boundary  of the affected 1990 census small (less than 200,000 population)  urbanized area.  F. Designated Transportation Management Areas      All 2000 Census urbanized areas having a population of at least  200,000 have been designated as Transportation Management Areas (TMAs),  in accordance with 49 U.S.C. 5305. In addition, the Santa Barbara, CA  urbanized area, which did not meet the population threshold requirement  for TMA status with respect to 2000 Census, retained its previously  granted TMA status based on Gubernatorial request. These TMA  designations were formally made in the FTA Notices at 67 FR 45173 et  seq. (July 8, 2002) and 67 FR 62285 et seq. (October 4, 2002).     Guidance for setting the boundaries of TMAs is contained in the  joint transportation planning regulations codified at 23 CFR part 450  and 49 CFR part 613. In some cases, the TMA planning boundaries, which  have been established by the MPO for the designated TMA, also include  one or more urbanized areas less than 200,000 in population. Where this  situation exists, the discretion of the Governor to allocate Urbanized  Area Formula program ``Governor's Apportionment'' funds for urbanized  areas with less than 200,000 in population is restricted, i.e., the  Governor only has discretion to allocate Governor's Apportionment funds  attributable to areas that are outside of designated TMA planning  boundaries.     If any additional small urbanized areas--within the planning  boundaries of a TMA--are identified, notification should be made in  writing to the Associate Administrator for Program Management, Federal  Transit Administration, 400 Seventh Street, SW, Washington, DC 20590,  no later than July 1 of each fiscal year. FTA has revised and provided  below the list of previously identified urbanized areas with population  less than 200,000 included within the planning boundaries of designated  TMAs, based on 2000 Census urbanized area designations. With respect to  Norman, OK, Section 336 of FY 2003 DOT Appropriations Act directs that  the city of Norman, OK shall be considered part of the Oklahoma City  TMA.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------                                   Small urbanized area included in TMA         Designated TMA                          boundary ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Houston, TX..................

Frederick, MD Oklahoma City, OK............  Norman, Oklahoma ------------------------------------------------------------------------  G. Urbanized Area Formula Funds Used for Highway Purposes      Urbanized Area Formula funds apportioned to a TMA can be  transferred to FHWA and made available for highway projects if the  following three conditions are met: (1) Such use must be approved by  the MPO in writing after appropriate notice and opportunity for comment  and appeal are provided to affected transit providers; (2) in the  determination of the Secretary, such funds are not needed for  investments required by the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990  (ADA); and (3) the MPO determines that local transit needs are being  addressed.     Urbanized Area Formula funds that are designated for highway  projects will be transferred to and administered by FHWA. The MPO  should notify FTA of its intent to use FTA funds for highway purposes,  as prescribed in section VIII.A., below.  H. National Transit Database (NTD) Internet Reporting and Redesign  Effort      The National Transit Database (NTD) is FTA's repository for  nationwide statistics about the transit industry, including safety and  security data. The new, redesigned NTD reporting system is on the  Internet and in operation. The new reporting software and statistical  data reports can be found on FTA's NTD web site at [ http:// www.ntdprogram.com  ]. More than 600 FTA grantees have filed reports to    www.ntdprogram.com ]. More than 600 FTA grantees have filed reports to   FTA via the Internet on the new system. To meet Government Performance  and Results Act deadlines, NTD data is available on a timelier basis.  The new monthly reporting of safety and ridership data provides the NTD  with current data. In addition, thousands of incident and summary  safety and security reports will be submitted to FTA on the new NTD  system. The new, detailed safety data will help FTA and the transit  industry fashion countermeasures to recurring safety problems. The  revised NTD includes several valuable new features like the new  reporting software, which includes enhanced pre-submission validation  routines. Reporters can save time by pre-loading certain large data  fields  [[Page 11912]]  from last year. The new Oracle database and reports aid researchers.     FTA grantees receive Urbanized Area Formula and Fixed Guideway  Modernization apportionments based, in part, on the data they submit to  the NTD. NTD data is also summarized and used to report to Congress on  the condition, performance, and safety of the transit industry, and  associated costs. The Transportation Security Administration is already  using security reports from the NTD. In addition, these data are used  in the assessment of FTA goals.     This year, the voluntary reporting of rural transit data by State  DOTs is being tested. Work also continues on the collection of data on  the condition of the capital infrastructure of transit. A voluntary  test version of the asset condition module was put on-line and was well  accepted, providing an excellent inventory and assessment of tunnels,  bridges, track, stations, bus maintenance facilities, and other assets.  VI. Nonurbanized Area Formula Program and Rural Transit Assistance  Program  A. Nonurbanized Area Formula Program      The amount made available for the Nonurbanized Area Formula Program  (49 U.S.C. 5311) by the FY 2003 DOT Appropriations Act is $239,043,694,  after application of the across-the-board .65 percent reduction. The FY  2003 Nonurbanized Area Formula apportionments to the States total  $238,954,559 and are displayed in Table 5. Of the $239,043,694  available, $1,195,218 was reserved for oversight. The funds apportioned  include $1,106,083 in prior year funds available for reapportionment.     The Nonurbanized Area Formula Program provides capital, operating  and administrative assistance for areas under 50,000 in population.  Each State must spend no less than 15 percent of its FY 2003  Nonurbanized Area Formula apportionment for the development and support  of intercity bus transportation, unless the Governor certifies to the  Secretary that the intercity bus service needs of the State are being  adequately met.  B. Rural Transit Assistance Program      Funding made available for the Rural Transit Assistance Program  (RTAP) (49 U.S.C. 5311(b)(2)) by the FY 2003 DOT Appropriations Act is  $5,215,875, after application of the across-the-board .65 percent  reduction. The FY 2003 RTAP allocations to the States total $5,216,875  and are displayed in Table 5. This amount includes $1,000 in prior year  funds available for reapportionment.     The funds are allocated to the States to undertake research,  training, technical assistance, and other support services to meet the  needs of transit operators in nonurbanized areas. These funds are to be  used in conjunction with the States' administration of the Nonurbanized  Area Formula Program.     FTA also supports RTAP activities at the national level within the  National Planning and Research Program (NPRP). The National RTAP  projects support the States in their use of the formula allocations for  training and technical assistance. Congress did not designate any funds  for the National RTAP among the NPRP allocations in the Conference  Report accompanying the FY 2003 DOT Appropriations Act. FTA will,  however, include the National RTAP among priority projects to be funded  from available NPRP funds. During FY 2002, FTA conducted a competitive  selection and chose the American Public Works Association, in  consortium with the Community Transportation Association of America, to  provide National RTAP services for the next five years.  VII. Elderly and Persons With Disabilities Program      The amount made available for the Elderly and Persons with  Disabilities Program (49 U.S.C. 5310) by the FY 2003 DOT Appropriations  Act is $90,063,558, after application of the across-the-board .65  percent reduction. The FY 2003 Elderly and Persons with Disabilities  Program apportionments to the States total $90,166,393 and are  displayed in Table 6. The funds apportioned include $102,835 in prior  year funds available for reapportionment.     The formula for apportioning these funds uses Census population  data for persons aged 65 and over, and for persons with disabilities.  The funds provide capital assistance for transportation for elderly  persons and persons with disabilities. Eligible capital expenses may  include, at the option of the recipient, the acquisition of  transportation services by a contract, lease, or other arrangement.     While the assistance is intended primarily for private non-profit  organizations, public bodies that coordinate services for the elderly  and persons with disabilities, or any public body that certifies to the  State that there are no non-profit organizations in the area that are  readily available to carry out the service, may receive these funds.     These funds may be transferred by the Governor to supplement  Urbanized Area Formula or Nonurbanized Area Formula capital funds  during the last 90 days of the fiscal year.  VIII. FHWA Surface Transportation Program and Congestion Mitigation and  Air Quality Funds Used for Transit Purposes  A. Transfer Process      The process for transferring flexible formula funds between FTA and  FHWA programs is described below. For information on the transfer of  FHWA funds to FTA planning programs contact the FTA/FHWA staff  identified in section IV.F, above.     Transfer from FHWA to FTA. FHWA funds designated for use in transit  capital projects must be derived from the metropolitan and statewide  planning and programming process, and must be included in an approved  Statewide Transportation Improvement Program (STIP) before the funds  can be transferred. The State DOT requests, by letter, the transfer of  highway funds for a transit project to the FHWA Division Office. The  letter should specify the project, amount to be transferred,  apportionment year, State, Federal aid apportionment category i.e.,  Surface Transportation Program (STP), Congestion Mitigation and Air  Quality (CMAQ), Interstate Substitute, or congressional earmark), and a  description of the project as contained in the STIP.     The FHWA Division Office confirms that the apportionment amount is  available for transfer and concurs in the transfer by letter to the  State DOT and FTA. The FHWA Office of Budget and Finance then transfers  obligation authority and an equal amount of cash to FTA. All FHWA CMAQ,  STP, and congressional earmarked funds for transit projects in the  Appropriations Act or Conference Report will be transferred to one of  the three FTA formula programs (i.e., Urbanized Area Formula (section  5307), Nonurbanized Area Formula (section 5311) or Elderly and Persons  with Disabilities (section 5310).     The FTA grantee's application for the project must specify which  program the funds will be used for and the application should be  prepared in accordance with the requirements and procedures governing  that program. Upon review and approval of the grantee's application,  FTA obligates funds for the project.     Transferred funds are treated as FTA formula funds, but are  assigned a distinct identifying code for tracking purposes. The funds  may be used for any capital purpose eligible under the FTA formula  program to which they are  [[Page 11913]]  transferred and in the case of CMAQ for certain operating costs. FTA  and FHWA have issued guidance on project eligibility under the CMAQ  program in a Notice at 65 FR 9040 et seq. (February 23, 2000). In  accordance with 23 U.S.C. 104(k), all FTA requirements are applicable  to transferred funds except local share--FHWA local share requirements  apply. Transferred funds should be combined with regular FTA funds in a  single annual grant application.     Transfers From FTA to FHWA. The Metropolitan Planning Organization  (MPO) submits a request to the FTA Regional Office for a transfer of  FTA section 5307 formula funds (apportioned to an urbanized area  200,000 and over in population) to FHWA based on approved use of the  funds for highway purposes, as contained in the Governor's approved  State Transportation Improvement Program. The MPO must certify that:  (1) The funds are not needed for capital investments required by the  Americans with Disabilities Act; (2) notice and opportunity for comment  and appeal has been provided to affected transit providers; and (3)  local funds used for non-Federal match are eligible to provide  assistance for either highway or transit projects. The FTA Regional  Administrator reviews and concurs in the request, then forwards the  approval to FTA Headquarters, where a reduction is made to the  grantee's urbanized area formula apportionment and FTA's National  Operating Budget in TEAM-Web, equal to the dollar amount being  transferred to FHWA.     For information regarding these procedures, please contact Kristen  D. Clarke, FTA Budget Office, at (202) 366-1686; or Richard Meehleib,  FHWA Finance Division, at (202) 366-2869.  B. Matching Share for FHWA Transfers      The provisions of Title 23 U.S.C., regarding the non-Federal share  apply to Title 23 funds used for transit projects. Thus, FHWA funds  transferred to FTA retain the same matching share that the funds would  have if used for highway purposes and administered by FHWA.     There are three instances in which a Federal share higher than 80  percent would be permitted. First, in States with large areas of Indian  and certain public domain lands and national forests, parks and  monuments, the local share for highway projects is determined by a  sliding scale rate, calculated based on the percentage of public lands  within that State. This sliding scale, which permits a greater Federal  share, but not to exceed 95 percent, is applicable to transfers used to  fund transit projects in these public land States. FHWA develops the  sliding scale matching ratios for the increased Federal share.     Secondly, commuter carpooling and vanpooling projects and transit  safety projects using FHWA transfers administered by FTA may retain the  same 100 percent Federal share that would be allowed for ride-sharing  or safety projects administered by the FHWA.     The third instance includes the 100 percent Federal safety  projects; however, these are subject to a nationwide 10 percent program  limitation.  IX. Capital Investment Program (49 U.S.C. 5309)  A. Fixed Guideway Modernization      The formula for allocating the Fixed Guideway Modernization funds  contains seven tiers. The apportionment of funding under the first four  tiers, through FY 2003, is based on data used to apportion the funding  in FY 1997. Funding under the last three tiers is apportioned based on  the latest available route miles and revenue vehicle miles on segments  at least seven years old, as reported to the NTD.     Table 7 displays the FY 2003 Fixed Guideway Modernization  apportionments. Fixed Guideway Modernization funds apportioned for this  section must be used for capital projects to maintain, modernize, or  improve fixed guideway systems.     All urbanized areas with fixed guideway systems that are at least  seven years old are eligible to receive Fixed Guideway Modernization  funds. A request for the start-up service dates for fixed guideways has  been incorporated into the NTD reporting system to ensure that all  eligible fixed guideway data is included in the calculation of the  apportionments. A threshold level of more than one mile of fixed  guideway is required to receive Fixed Guideway Modernization funds.  Therefore, urbanized areas reporting one mile or less of fixed guideway  mileage under the NTD are not included.     The FY 2003 DOT Appropriations Act makes $1,206,506,400 available  for Fixed Guideway Modernization, after application of the across-the- board .65 percent reduction. An amount of $12,065,064 was then reserved  for oversight, leaving $1,194,441,336 available for apportionment to  eligible urbanized areas. In addition, prior year funds available for  reapportionment in the amount of $84,033 are added and increase the  total amount apportioned to $1,194,525,369 under Fixed Guideway  Modernization. Table 13 contains information regarding the Fixed  Guideway Modernization apportionment formula.  B. New Starts      The amount made available for New Starts by the FY 2003 DOT  Appropriations Act is $1,252,229,548, after application of the across- the-board .65 percent reduction. This amount includes $45 million  (adjusted for the .65 percent reduction) in FY 2003 funds transferred  from the Job Access and Reverse Commute Program (JARC) and additional  transfers of $1,015,648 from unobligated 1999 JARC funds, in accordance  with language in the FY 2003 DOT Appropriations Act and accompanying  Conference Report. Of the $1,252,229,548 made available $12,522,295 was  reserved for oversight activities, leaving $1,239,707,253 available for  allocations to projects. The final allocation for each New Starts  projects is listed in Table 8.     Prior year unobligated allocations for New Starts in the amount of  $483,496,983 remain available for obligation in FY 2003. This amount  includes $464,241,119 in fiscal years 2001 and 2002 unobligated  allocations, and $19,255,864 for fiscal years 1999 and 2000 unobligated  allocations that are extended in the FY 2003 Conference Report. These  unobligated amounts are displayed in Table 8A.     Capital Investment Program funds for New Starts projects identified  as having been extended in the FY 2003 Conference Report accompanying  the FY 2003 DOT Appropriations Act will lapse September 30, 2003. A  list of the extended projects and the amount that remains unobligated  as of September 30, 2002, is appended to Table 8A for ready reference.  C. Bus and Bus-Related      The FY 2003 DOT Appropriations Act provides $603,253,200 for the  purchase of buses, bus-related equipment and paratransit vehicles, and  for the construction of bus-related facilities, after application of  the across-the-board .65 percent reduction.     TEA-21 established a $100 million Clean Fuels Formula Program under  49 U.S.C. 5308 (described in section XII below). The program is  authorized to be funded with $50 million from the Bus and Bus-Related  category of the Capital Investment Program and $50 million from the  Formula Program. However, the FY 2003 DOT Appropriations Act directs  FTA to transfer the formula portion to, and merge it with, funding  provided for the Bus and Bus-Related category of the Capital Investment  Program. The .65 percent across-the-  [[Page 11914]]  board reduction has been applied to the $50 million in transferred  funds. Thus, $652,928,200 of funds appropriated in FY 2003 is available  for funding the Bus and Bus-Related category of the Capital Investment  Program. In addition, Congress directed that funds made available for  bus and bus facilities include $4,567,156 reallocated from projects in  previous appropriations Acts, which increases the total amount made  available to $657,495,356. The reallocated funds are derived from  unobligated balances for the following projects: Essex Junction,  Vermont multimodal station, $490,547; Towamencin Township, Pennsylvania  intermodal center (1999), $1,488,750; Towamencin Township, Pennsylvania  intermodal center (2000), $1,471,643; Folsom, California multimodal  facility, $992,500; and Georgetown University fuel cell program,  $123,176.     After reserving $6,529,282 for oversight, the amount available for  allocation under the Bus and Bus-Related category is $650,966,074.  Table 9 displays the allocation of the FY 2003 Bus and Bus-Related  funds by State and project. The FY 2003 Conference Report accompanying  the FY 2003 DOT Appropriations Act allocated all of the FY 2003 Bus and  Bus-Related funds to specified States or localities for bus and bus- related projects. FTA will fund all designations that comply with the  statutory requirements for the program.     Prior year unobligated balances for Bus and Bus-Related allocations  in the amount of $515,023,153 remain available for obligation in FY  2003. This includes $503,518,819 in fiscal years 2001 and 2002  unobligated allocations, and $11,504,334 for fiscal years 1998, 1999  and 2000 unobligated allocations extended in the FY 2003 Conference  Report. These unobligated amounts are displayed in Table 9A.     Capital Investment Program funds for Bus and Bus-Related projects  identified as having been extended in the Conference Report  accompanying the FY 2003 DOT Appropriations Act will lapse September  30, 2003. A list of the extended projects and the amount that remains  unobligated as of September 30, 2002, is appended to Table 9A for ready  reference.     In addition, FY 2003 Conference Report provides clarifications for  Bus and Bus-Related projects as follows:     (1) Funding provided to Bevill State Community College may also  made available to Jasper, Alabama.     (2) Within the funding provided in FY 2003 to the State of  Illinois, $1,000,000 shall be for the refurbishment of the Dan Ryan  station.     (3) The conference agreement provides $7,500,000 to Kentucky for  bus and bus facilities needs statewide. Of this funding, $4,000,000  shall be provided to southern and eastern Kentucky. The remainder shall  be allocated to: Bluegrass Community Action Services, City of  Frankfort, Kentucky Foothills Development Council, Community Action  Council of Fayette/Lexington, Lexington Red Cross, East Kentucky  Independent Service Organization, and Lexington Transit Authority.     (4) Within the funding provided for the state of Michigan, the  state should strongly consider requests from Alger County, Charlevoix  County, Delta Area Transit Authority, Houghton, Ontonogan County, City  of Sault Ste. Marie, and Schoolcraft County.     (5) Within the funds provided for the state of Ohio, the state  should strongly consider requests from Kent, and the East Side transit  center.     (6) Funding provided for the Sierra Madre Villa intermodal center  in fiscal year 2002 shall also be made available to the Los Angeles  County Metropolitan Transportation Authority (LACMTA) for bus and bus  related facilities in the LACMTA's service area.     (7) Funds provided in fiscal year 2002 for the Fort Worth  intermodal center park and ride facility shall be used to facilitate  the finish out the intermodal connections into downtown Fort Worth and  to enhance the linkage of the TRE with the T's bus operation and park  and ride elements occurring at two sites: the ITC (and geographically  related areas like the 7th Street parking lot and Alarm Supply  Building) and a larger facility at the Texas and Pacific Station.     (8) Funding provided for Wyandotte County buses and Kansas City  joblinks in fiscal year 2001 shall be made available to the Unified  Government of Wyandotte County/Kansas City.     (9) Funds provided in fiscal year 2001 for Louisiana's Plaquemines  Parish Ferry shall also be made available to the New Orleans Regional  Planning Commission for vans, buses and related facility construction  in Plaquemines, St. Bernard, St. John and St. Charles parishes.     (10) Funds made available in fiscal year 2001 for the Tompkins  County intermodal facility shall also be made available for the Ulster  County, New York rural bus garage.     (11) Funding provided for the Swampscott buses in fiscal year 2000  may also be available to Lynnfield, Massachusetts to replace buses.     (12) Funds made available in fiscal year 2000 to the Ithaca  intermodal transportation center shall also be made available for the  Binghamton intermodal transportation center.  X. Job Access and Reverse Commute Program      The FY 2003 DOT Appropriations Act provides $104,317,500, for the  Job Access and Reverse Commute (JARC) Program after the transfer of $45  million from JARC to the Capital Investment Program (New Starts) as  stipulated in the FY 2003 DOT Appropriations Act and the accompanying  Conference Report, and the application of the across-the-board .65  percent reduction. JARC project funding will be published separately  from this notice.     The JARC program, established under TEA-21, provides funding for  the provision of transportation services designed to increase access to  jobs and employment-related activities. Job Access projects are those  that transport welfare recipients and low-income individuals, including  economically disadvantaged persons with disabilities, in urban,  suburban, or rural areas to and from jobs and activities related to  their employment. Reverse Commute projects provide transportation  services for the general public from urban, suburban, and rural areas  to suburban employment opportunities. A total of up to $10,000,000 from  the appropriation may be used for Reverse Commute Projects.  XI. Over-the-Road Bus Accessibility Program      The amount made available for the Over-the-Road Bus Accessibility  (OTRB) Program by the FY 2003 DOT Appropriations Act is $6,904,825,  after application of the across-the-board .65 percent reduction. Of  this amount, $5,215,875 is available to providers of intercity fixed- route service, and $1,688,950 is available to other providers of over- the-road bus services, including local fixed-route service, commuter  service, and charter and tour service.     The OTRB program authorizes FTA to make grants to operators of  over-the-road buses to help finance the incremental capital and  training costs of complying with the DOT over-the-road bus  accessibility final rule, published on September 28, 1998 (63 FR  51670). Funds will be provided at 90 percent Federal share. FTA  conducts a national solicitation of applications and grantees are  selected on a competitive basis.     A Federal Register Notice providing program guidance and  application procedures for FY 2003 was published in the Federal  Register on February 7, 2003. Applications are due by March 28, 2003.  [[Page 11915]]  XII. Clean Fuels Formula Program      TEA-21 established the Clean Fuels Formula Grant Program under  section 5308 of Title 49 U.S.C. to assist non-attainment and  maintenance areas in achieving or maintaining attainment status and to  support markets for emerging clean fuel technologies. No funds were  provided for this program in the FY 2003 DOT Appropriations Act. For  further information contact Nancy Grubb, FTA Office of Resource  Management and State Programs, at (202) 366-2053.  XIII. National Planning and Research Program      The amount made available to the National Planning and Research  Program by the FY 2003 DOT Appropriations Act is $31,295,250, after  application of the across-the-board .65 percent reduction, of that  amount $16,442,426 is allocated for specific activities. These  allocations are listed in Table 10. For additional information contact  Henry Nejako, Program Management Officer, Office of Research,  Demonstration and Innovation, at (202) 366-0184.  XIV. Unit Values of Data for Urbanized Area Formula Program,  Nonurbanized Area Formula Program, and Fixed Guideway Modernization      The dollar unit values of data derived from the computations of the  Urbanized Area Formula Program, the Nonurbanized Area Formula Program,  and the Capital Investment Program--Fixed Guideway Modernization  apportionments are displayed in Table 14 of this notice. To replicate  an area's apportionment, multiply its population, population density,  and data from the NTD by the appropriate unit value.  XV. Period of Availability of Funds      The funds apportioned under the Metropolitan Planning Program and  the Statewide Planning and Research Program, the Urbanized Area Formula  Program, and Fixed Guideway Modernization, in this notice, will remain  available to be obligated by FTA to recipients for three fiscal years  following FY 2003. Any of these apportioned funds that remain  unobligated at the close of business on September 30, 2006, will revert  to FTA for reapportionment under the respective program.     Funds apportioned to nonurbanized areas under the Nonurbanized Area  Formula Program, including RTAP funds, will remain available for two  fiscal years following FY 2003. Any such funds that remain unobligated  at the close of business on September 30, 2005, will revert to FTA for  reapportionment among the States under the Nonurbanized Area Formula  Program. Funds allocated to States under the Elderly and Persons with  Disabilities Program in this notice must be obligated by September 30,  2003. Any such funds that remain unobligated as of that date will  revert to FTA for reapportionment among the States under the Elderly  and Persons with Disabilities Program. The FY 2003 DOT Appropriations  Act includes a provision requiring that FY 2003 New Starts and Bus and  Bus-Related funds not obligated for their original purpose as of  September 30, 2005, shall be made available for other projects under 49  U.S.C. 5309.     JARC funds for projects selected by FTA for funding in FY 2003 will  remain available for two fiscal years following FY 2003. Any such funds  that remain unobligated at the close of business on September 30, 2005,  will revert to FTA for reallocation under the JARC program.     Capital Investment Program funds for New Starts and Bus and Bus- Related projects identified as having been extended in the FY 2003  Conference Report accompanying the FY 2003 DOT Appropriations Act will  lapse September 30, 2003.  XVI. Automatic Pre-Award Authority To Incur Project Costs      This information incorporates and elaborates on guidance previously  provided in the FTA FY 2002 Apportionments and Allocations Notice found  at [ http://www.fta.dot.gov/library/legal/federalregister/2002/ fr1202a.pdf  ].   A. Policy      FTA provides blanket or automatic pre-award authority to cover  certain program areas described below. This pre-award authority allows  grantees to incur project costs prior to grant approval and retain  their eligibility for subsequent reimbursement after grant approval.  The grantee assumes all risk and is responsible for ensuring that all  conditions, which are described below, are met to retain eligibility.  This automatic pre-award spending authority permits a grantee to incur  costs on an eligible transit capital or planning project without  prejudice to possible future Federal participation in the cost of the  project or projects. Prior to exercising pre-award authority, grantees  must comply with the conditions and Federal requirements outlined in  paragraphs B and C immediately below. Failure to do so will render an  otherwise eligible project ineligible for FTA financial assistance. In  addition, grantees are strongly encouraged to consult with the  appropriate FTA regional office if there is any question regarding the  eligibility of the project for future FTA funds or the applicability of  the conditions and Federal requirements.     Pre-award authority was extended in the June 24, 1998 Federal  Register Notice on TEA-21 to all formula funds and flexible funds that  will be apportioned during the authorization period of TEA-21, 1998- 2003. Pre-award authority for operating and planning projects under the  formula grants programs is not limited to the authorization period.  Pre-award authority also applies to Capital Investment Bus and Bus- Related allocations identified in this notice. For such section 5309  Capital Investment Bus and Bus-Related projects, the date that costs  may be incurred is the date that the appropriation bill in which they  are contained is enacted. Pre-award authority does not apply to Capital  New Start funds, or to Capital Investment Bus and Bus-Related projects  not specified in this or previous notices, except as described in D  below. Extension of Pre-Award Authority Beyond the TEA-21 Authorization Period     Because there is uncertainty in the timing of the FY 2004  appropriations act and/or the surface transportation reauthorization  act, a large number of LONPs might be requested for routine, continuing  transit projects using anticipated formula funds. FTA, in this Notice,  is extending pre-award authority to grantees for project costs to be  reimbursed by formula funds and flexible funds that will be  appropriated in FY 2004.     In using this pre-award authority for FY 2004 formula funds,  grantees are cautioned that reauthorization may result in changes in  program structure, administrative requirements, or funding  availability. As with all pre-award authority, activities must be  conducted in compliance with Federal requirements in order to retain  eligibility for future reimbursement.  B. Conditions      Similar to the FTA LONP authority, the conditions under which this  authority may be utilized are specified below:     (1) The pre-award authority is not a legal or moral commitment that  the project(s) will be approved for FTA assistance or that FTA will  obligate Federal funds. Furthermore, it is not a legal or moral  commitment that all  [[Page 11916]]  items undertaken by the applicant will be eligible for inclusion in the  project(s).     (2) All FTA statutory, procedural, and contractual requirements  must be met.     (3) No action will be taken by the grantee that prejudices the  legal and administrative findings that the Federal Transit  Administrator must make in order to approve a project.     (4) Local funds expended by the grantee pursuant to and after the  date of the pre-award authority will be eligible for credit toward  local match or reimbursement if FTA later makes a grant for the  project(s) or project amendment(s).     (5) The Federal amount of any future FTA assistance awarded to the  grantee for the project will be determined on the basis of the overall  scope of activities and the prevailing statutory provisions with  respect to the Federal/local match ratio at the time the funds are  obligated.     (6) For funds to which the pre-award authority applies, the  authority expires with the lapsing of the fiscal year funds.     (7) The Financial Status Report, in TEAM-Web, must indicate the use  of pre-award authority.  C. Environmental, Planning, and Other Federal Requirements      FTA emphasizes that all of the Federal grant requirements must be  met for the project to remain eligible for Federal funding. Compliance  with the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and other  environmental laws or executive orders (e.g., protection of parklands,  wetlands, and historic properties) must be completed before State or  local funds are spent on implementing activities such as final design,  construction, and acquisition for a project that is expected to be  subsequently funded with FTA funds. Depending on which class the  project is included under in FTA environmental regulations, 23 CFR part  771, the grantee may not advance the project beyond planning and  preliminary engineering before FTA has issued either a categorical  exclusion, refer to 23 CFR part 771.117(d), a finding of no significant  impact, or a record of decision. The conformity requirements of the  Clean Air Act, 40 CFR part 93, also must be fully met before the  project may be advanced into implementation under pre-award authority.     Similarly, the requirement that a project be included in a locally  adopted metropolitan transportation improvement program and federally  approved statewide transportation improvement program must be followed  before the project may be advanced with non-Federal funds under pre- award authority. For planning projects, the project must be included in  a locally approved Planning Work Program that has been coordinated with  the State. In addition, Federal procurement procedures, as well as the  whole range of Federal requirements, must be followed for projects in  which Federal funding will be sought in the future. Failure to follow  any such requirements could make the project ineligible for Federal  funding. In short, this increased administrative flexibility requires a  grantee to make certain that no Federal requirements are circumvented  through the use of pre-award authority. If a grantee has questions or  concerns regarding the environmental requirements, or any other Federal  requirements that must be met before incurring costs, it should contact  the appropriate regional office.     Before an applicant may incur costs for Bus and Bus-Related Capital  projects not listed in this notice or previous notices, it must first  obtain a written LONP from FTA. To obtain an LONP, a grantee must  submit a written request accompanied by adequate information and  justification to the appropriate FTA regional office, as described in  section XVII below.  D. Pre-Award Authority for New Starts Projects  1. Preliminary Engineering and Final Design     New Starts projects are required to follow a federally defined  project development process. This process includes, among other things,  FTA approval of entry of a project into preliminary engineering and  approval to enter final design. The grantee request for entry into  preliminary engineering and the request for entry into final design  document the project's justification and financial criteria, which FTA  evaluates as part of its approval process. With FTA approval to enter  preliminary engineering, and subsequent approval to enter final design,  FTA will automatically extend pre-award authority to that phase of  project development. 2. Real Property Acquisition Activities     FTA will extend automatic pre-award authority for the acquisition  of real property and real property rights for a New Starts project upon  completion of the NEPA review of that project. NEPA review is completed  when FTA signs an environmental Record of Decision (ROD) or Finding of  No Significant Impact (FONSI), or makes a Categorical Exclusion (CE)  determination. With the limitations and caveats described below, real  estate acquisition for a New Starts project may now commence upon  completion of the NEPA review process.     Most major FTA-assisted projects require the acquisition of  residential and/or business properties and the relocation of the  occupants. Often real property rights, like railroad track usage  rights, are needed. With limited exceptions set forth in FTA's NEPA  guidance, the purchase of real property can prejudice the consideration  of less damaging alternatives and may not take place until the NEPA  process has been completed by FTA's signing of an environmental ROD or  FONSI or making a CE determination.     For FTA-assisted projects, any acquisition of real property must be  conducted in accordance with the requirements of the Uniform Relocation  Assistance and Real Property Acquisition Policies Act (URA) and its  implementing regulations, 49 CFR part 24. Compliance with the URA  regulations requires substantial lead-time. Properties must be  appraised, persons who will be displaced must be educated about their  relocation rights, proper housing must be found for displaced  residents, and businesses must be relocated in accordance with the URA.  In some cases, the remediation of contaminated soils or groundwater, or  the removal of underground storage tanks must be dealt with during the  acquisition process. Potentially responsible parties of the  contamination must be identified and their financial liability  negotiated or litigated. Acquisition of railroad right-of-way or usage  rights is frequently a negotiated transaction that is fundamental to  the transit project and therefore should be negotiated as early as  possible after the completion of the NEPA process. Delays in the  closing on an acquisition can lead to inconvenience or hardship for  residents and businesses that are being displaced. Delays can also lead  to increases in property values or in the current owners' financial  expectations that prolong negotiated settlements.     To facilitate the acquisition process for New Starts projects, FTA  will extend automatic pre-award authority for the acquisition of real  property and real property rights with the signing of the environmental  ROD or FONSI or the CE determination. This pre-award authority is  strictly limited to costs incurred to acquire real property and real  property rights and to provide relocation assistance in accordance with  the URA regulation. It is limited to the acquisition of real property  and real property rights that are explicitly identified in the final  EIS, EA or CE determination, as needed for the selected alternative  that is the subject of  [[Page 11917]]  the FTA-signed ROD or FONSI, or the CE determination. It does not cover  site preparation, demolition, or any other activity that is not  strictly necessary to comply with the URA. At FTA's discretion, these  other activities may be covered by a LONP, described in section XVII,  below. This pre-award authority does not cover the acquisition of  construction equipment or transit vehicles or any other acquisition  except that of real property and real property rights.     Grant applicants should use this pre-award authority for real  property very discreetly with a clear understanding that it does not  constitute a funding commitment by FTA. On occasion, even projects that  received a ``recommended'' rating from FTA under the New Starts  regulation, 49 CFR part 611, have not received a Full Funding Grant  Agreement from FTA simply because the competition for the limited New  Starts funds is so intense.     This pre-award authority for the acquisition of real property and  real property rights, in accordance with the URA and after FTA's  signing of a ROD or FONSI or making a CE determination, is intended to  streamline the project delivery process, to enhance relocation services  for residents and businesses, and to avoid the escalation in the cost  of real property caused by delays in its acquisition. In granting this  pre-award authority, FTA is aware that the risk taken by the grant  applicant in acquiring real property without an FTA commitment is  somewhat mitigated by the re-sale value of the real property, in the  event that FTA funding assistance is not ultimately forthcoming and the  project is abandoned. 3. National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) Activities     The NEPA requires that projects with potentially significant  adverse impacts proposed for Federal funding assistance be subjected to  a public and interagency review of the need for the project, its  environmental and community impacts, and alternatives with potentially  fewer damaging effects. Projects for which FTA experience indicates  there are no significant impacts are subject to NEPA, but categorically  excluded from the more rigorous levels of NEPA review.     FTA regulations, 23 CFR 771.105(e), state that the costs incurred  by a grant applicant for the preparation of environmental documents  requested by FTA are eligible for FTA assistance. FTA extends automatic  pre-award authority for costs incurred to conduct the NEPA  environmental review, including historic preservation activities, and  to prepare an EIS, EA, CE, or other environmental documents for a  proposed New Starts project, effective as of the date of the federal  approval of the relevant STIP or STIP amendment that includes any phase  of the project. This pre-award authority applies to New Starts funding,  as well as other FTA funding sources. This pre-award authority is  strictly limited to costs incurred to conduct the NEPA process and  prepare environmental and historic preservation documents. It does not  cover preliminary engineering activities beyond those necessary for  NEPA compliance. As with any pre-award authority, FTA participation in  costs incurred is not guaranteed.     This pre-award authority for environmental and historic  preservation work for a proposed New Starts project in the FTA-approved  STIP is intended to streamline the NEPA process in accordance with TEA- 21 Section 1309, ``Environmental Streamlining,'' by eliminating  unnecessary delays in starting up the conceptual engineering and  environmental reviews, the public involvement process, and the  interagency coordination process for New Starts projects. 4. Other New Starts Activities Requiring LONP     Except as discussed in paragraphs 1-3 above, a grant applicant must  obtain a written LONP from FTA before incurring costs for any activity  expected to be funded by New Start funds not yet granted. To obtain an  LONP, an applicant must submit a written request accompanied by  adequate information and justification to the appropriate FTA regional  office, as described in section XVII below.  XVII. Letter of no Prejudice (LONP) Policy  A. Policy      LONP authority allows an applicant to incur costs on a project  utilizing non-Federal resources with the understanding that the costs  incurred subsequent to the issuance of the LONP may be reimbursable as  eligible expenses or eligible for credit toward the local match should  FTA approve the project at a later date. LONPs are applicable to  projects and project activities not covered by automatic pre-award  authority. The majority of LONPs will be for Section 5309 New Starts  funds not covered under a full funding grant agreement or for Section  5309 Bus and Bus-Related funds not yet appropriated by Congress. At the  end of an authorization period, there may be LONPs for formula funds  beyond the life of the current authorization.     Under most circumstances the LONP will cover the total project.  Under certain circumstances the LONP may be issued for local match  only, for example, to permit real estate purchased as it becomes  available to be used for match for the project at a later date.  B. Conditions      The following conditions apply to all LONPs.     (1) LONP pre-award authority is not a legal or moral commitment  that the project(s) will be approved for FTA assistance or that FTA  will obligate Federal funds. Furthermore, it is not a legal or moral  commitment that all items undertaken by the applicant will be eligible  for inclusion in the project(s).     (2) All FTA, DOT, and other Federal statutory, regulatory,  procedural, and contractual requirements must be met.     (3) No action will be taken by the grantee that prejudices the  legal and administrative findings that the Federal Transit  Administrator must make in order to approve a project.     (4) Local funds expended by the grantee pursuant to and after the  date of the LONP will be eligible for credit toward local match or  reimbursement if FTA later makes a grant for the project(s) or project  amendment(s).     (5) The Federal amount of any future FTA assistance to the grantee  for the project will be determined on the basis of the overall scope of  activities and the prevailing statutory provisions with respect to the  Federal/local match ratio at the time the funds are obligated.     (6) For funds to which this pre-award authority applies, the  authority expires with the lapsing of the fiscal year funds.  C. Environmental, Planning, and Other Federal Requirements      As with automatic pre-award authority, FTA emphasizes that all of  the Federal grant requirements must be met for the project to remain  eligible for Federal funding. Compliance with NEPA and other  environmental laws or executive orders (e.g., protection of parklands,  wetlands, historic properties) must be completed before State or local  funds are spent on implementation activities such as final design,  construction, or acquisition for a project expected to be subsequently  funded with FTA funds. Depending on which class the project is included  under in FTA's environmental regulations, 23 CFR part 771, the grantee  may not advance the project beyond planning and preliminary engineering  before FTA has approved a CE determination, 23 CFR Section 771.117(d),  a finding of no significant impact (FONSI), or an environmental ROD.  Because project  [[Page 11918]]  implementation activities may not be initiated prior to NEPA  completion, FTA will normally not issue an LONP for such activities  until the NEPA process has been completed with a ROD, FONSI, or CE  determination. The conformity requirements of the Clean Air Act, 40 CFR  part 93, also must be fully met before the project may be advanced with  non-Federal funds.     Similarly, the requirement that a capital project be included in a  locally adopted metropolitan transportation improvement program and  federally approved statewide transportation improvement program must be  followed before the project may be advanced with non-Federal funds. For  planning projects, the project must be included in a locally approved  Planning Work Program that has been coordinated with the State. In  addition, Federal procurement procedures, as well as the whole range of  Federal requirements, must be followed for projects in which Federal  funding will be sought in the future. Failure to follow any such  requirements could make the project ineligible for Federal funding. In  short, this pre-award authority requires a grantee to make certain that  no Federal requirements are circumvented. If a grantee has questions or  concerns regarding the environmental requirements, or any other Federal  requirements that must be met before incurring costs, it should contact  the appropriate FTA regional office.  D. Request for LONP      Before an applicant may incur costs for a project not covered by  automatic pre-award authority, it must first submit a written request  for an LONP to the appropriate regional office and obtain written  approval.

FTA Fiscal Year 2003 Annual List of Certifications and Assurances      On October 23, 2002, FTA published in the Federal Register the list  and accompanying text of all Certifications and Assurances required of  recipients of FTA assistance in Fiscal Year 2003. See, 67 FR 65171 et  seq. The full text of the Fiscal Year 2003 Certifications and  Assurances is also accessible both on FTA's Internet Web site at  [ http://www.fta.dot.gov/library/legal/ca.htm ] and FTA's TEAM Web site   [http:// www.fta.dot.gov/library/legal/ca.htm ] and FTA's TEAM Web site   for recipients, TEAM-Web at [ http://ftateamweb.fta.dot.gov/static/2003- CERTS-TEAM.doc  ]. In compliance with 49 U.S.C. 5323(n), which requires a   simultaneous publication of a list of the Certifications and Assurances  and FTA's annual notice of Apportionments, recipients are directed to  the October 23, 2002 notice at 67 FR 65171 et seq. for the list and  text of FTA's Certifications and Assurances and to FTA's Web sites  displaying those Certifications and Assurances. Any questions regarding  this document may be addressed to the appropriate Regional Office.     As in previous years, the grant applicant should certify  electronically. Under certain circumstances the applicant may enter its  Personal Identification Number (PIN) in lieu of an electronic signature  provided by its attorney, provided the applicant has on file the  current affirmation of its attorney in writing dated this Federal  fiscal year. The applicant is advised to contact the appropriate FTA  Regional Office for electronic procedure information.  XX. Grant Application Procedures      All applications for FTA funds should be submitted to the  appropriate FTA Regional Office. FTA utilizes TEAM-Web, an Internet  accessible electronic grant application system, and all applications  should be filed electronically. FTA has provided exceptions to the  requirement for electronic filing of applications for certain new, non- traditional grantees in the Job Access and Reverse Commute and Over- the-Road Bus Accessibility programs as well as to a few grantees that  have not successfully connected to or accessed TEAM-Web.     FTA is committed to processing grants within 60 days of receipt of  a completed application by the appropriate Regional Office. In order  for an application to be considered complete, it must meet the  following requirements: All projects must be contained in an approved  STIP (when required), all environmental findings must be made by FTA,  there must be an adequate project description, local share must be  secure, any flexible funds included in the budget must be secured, all  required civil rights submissions must be current and certifications  and assurances must be properly submitted. Once an application is  complete, the FTA Regional Office will assign a project number and,  when required, submit the application to the Department of Labor for a  certification under section 5333(b). The FTA circulars contain more  information regarding application contents and complete applications.  State applicants for section 5311 are reminded that they must certify  to DOL that all subrecipients have agreed to the standard labor  protection warranty for section 5311 and provide DOL with other related  information for each grant.     This notice and all program guidance circulars may be accessed via  the FTA Web site. Copies of circulars are available from FTA Regional  Offices as well.      Issued on: March 5, 2003. Jennifer L.

GX255-54-10331064	"Application Processing, Issuance and/or Denial  Part 750page 1  750.1 SCOPE In this part, references to the EAR are references to 15 CFR chapter VII, subchapter C. This part describes the Bureau of Industry and Security's (BIS) process for reviewing your application for a license and the applicable processing times for various types of applications. Information related to the issuance, denial, revocation, or suspension of a license or license application is provided along with the procedures on obtaining a duplicate or replacement license, the transfer of a license and shipping tolerances available on licenses. This part also contains instructions on obtaining the status of any pending application. 750.2 PROCESSING OF CLASSIFICATION REQUESTS AND ADVISORY OPINIONS (a) Classification requests Al l classification requests submitted in accordance with procedures described in 748.3(a) and (b) of the EAR will be answered within 14 calendar days after receipt. All responses will inform the person of the proper classification (e.g., whether or not the item is subject to the Export Administration Regulations (EAR) and, if applicable, the appropriate Export Control Classification Number [ECCN]). (b) Advisory Opinion requests All advisory opinions submitted in accordance with procedures described in 748.3(a) and (c) of the EAR will be answered within 30 calendar days after receipt.  750.3 REVIEW OF LICENSE APPLICATIONS BY BIS AND OTHER GOVERNMENT AGENCIES AND DEPARTMENTS (a) Review by BIS In reviewing specific license applications, BIS will conduct a complete analysis of the license application along with all documentation submitted in support of the application. In addition to reviewing the item and end-use, BIS will consider the reliability of each party to the transaction and review any available intelligence information. To the maximum extent possible, BIS will make licensing decisions without referral of license applications to other agencies, however, BIS may consult with other U.S. departments and agencies regarding any license application. (b) Review by other departments or agencies (1) The Departments of Defense, Energy, State, and the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency (ACDA) have the authority to review any license application submitted under the EAR. In addition, BIS may, where appropriate, refer license applications to other U.S. government departments or agencies. These agencies and departments will be referred to as ""agencies"" for the purposes of this part. Though these agencies have the authority to review any license application, they may determine that they do not need to review certain types of license applications. In these instances, the agency will provide BIS with a Delegation of Authority to process those license applications without review by that particular agency. (2) The Departments of Defense, Energy, State, and ACDA are generally concerned with license applications involving items controlled for national security, missile technology, nuclear nonproliferation, and chemical and biological weapons proliferation reasons or destined for countries and/or end uses of concern. In January 2004  Export Administration Regulations   Application Processing, Issuance and/or Denial  Part 750page 2  particular, these agencies are concerned with reviewing license applications as follows: (i) The Department of Defense is concerned primarily with items controlled for national security and regional stability reasons and with controls related to encryption items; (ii) The Department of Energy is concerned primarily with items controlled for nuclear nonproliferation reasons; (iii) The Department of State is concerned primarily with items controlled for regional stability, anti-terrorism, crime control reasons, and sanctions; and (iv) ACDA is concerned primarily with items controlled for national security, nuclear nonproliferation, regional stability, and antiterrorism reasons. (v) The Department of Justice is concerned with controls relating to encryption items. 750.4 PROCEDURES FOR PROCESSING LICENSE APPLICATIONS (a) Overview (1) All license applications will be resolved or referred to the President no later than 90 calendar days from the date of BIS's registration of the license application. Processing times for the purposes of this section are defined in calendar days. The procedures and time limits described in this part apply to all license applications registered on or after February 4, 1996. The procedures and time limits in effect prior to December 6, 1995 will apply to license applications registered prior to February 4, 1996. (2) Properly completed license applications will be registered promptly upon receipt by BIS. Export Administration Regulations  Registration is defined as the point at which the application is entered into BIS's electronic license processing system. If your application contains deficiencies that prevent BIS from registering your application, BIS will attempt to contact you to correct the deficiencies, however, if BIS is unable to contact you, the license application will be returned without being registered. The specific deficiencies requiring return will be enumerated in a notice accompanying the returned license application. If a license application is registered, but BIS is unable to correct deficiencies crucial to processing the license application, it will be returned without action. The notice will identify the deficiencies and the action necessary to correct the deficiencies. If you decide to resubmit the license application, it will be treated as a new license application when calculating license processing time frames. (b) Actions not included in processing time calculations The following actions will not be counted in the time period calculations described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section for the processing of license applications: (1) Agreement by the applicant to the delay. BIS may request applicants to provide additional information in support of their license application, respond to questions arising during processing, or accept proposed conditions or riders on their license application. If BIS has provided the applicant with an intent to deny letter described in 750.6 of this part, processing times may be suspended in order to negotiate modifications to a license application and obtain agreement to such modifications from the foreign parties to the license application. (2) Pre-license checks. If a pre-license check, to establish the identity and reliability of the recipient of the controlled items, is conducted through government channels, provided that: (i) The need for such a pre-license check is January 2004   Application Processing, Issuance and/or Denial  Part 750page 3  established by the Secretary, or by another agency, if the request for a pre-license check is made by such agency and the request is made in accordance with the following time frames; (A) The pre-license check is requested within 5 days of the determination that it is necessary; and (B) The analysis resulting from the prelicense check is completed within 5 days. (3) Government-to-Government assurances. R e que s t s for governm e nt-to-gove r n m e nt assurances of suitable end-use of items approved for export or reexport when failure to obtain such assurances would result in rejection of the license application, provided that: (i) The request for such assurances is sent to the Secretary of State within five days of the determination that the assurances are required; (ii) The Secretary of State initiates the request of the relevant government within 10 days of receipt of the request for such assurances; and (iii) The license is issued within 5 days of the Secretary's receipt of the requested assurances. (4) Consultations. Consultation with other governments, if such consultation is provided for by a relevant bilateral arrangement or multilateral regime as a precondition for approving a license. (5) Multilateral reviews. Multilateral review of a license application if such review is required by the relevant multilateral regime. (6) Congressional notification. Under Section 6(j) of the Export Administration Act, as amended (EAA), the Secretaries of Commerce and State are required to notify appropriate Committees of the Congress 30 days prior to issuing a license to any country designated by the Secretary of State as being terrorist-supporting for any items that could make a significant contribution to the military Export Administration Regulations  potential of such countries, or could enhance the ability of such countries to support acts of international terrorism. Accordingly, the issuance of any license subject to this requirement will be delayed for 30 days. (i) Designated countries. The following countries have been designated by the Secretary of State as terrorist-supporting countries: Cuba, Iran, Iraq, Libya, North Korea, Sudan, and Syria. (ii) Items subject to notification requirement. License applications involving the export or reexport of the following items to the military, police, intelligence or other sensitive end-users are subject to this notification requirement: (A) All items controlled for national security reasons, except digital computers with a Composite Theoretical Performance (CTP) less than 500 MTOPS; (B) All items controlled for chemical and biological weapons proliferation reasons; (C) All items controlled for missile technology reasons; (D) All items controlled for nuclear nonproliferation reasons; and (E) All items controlled by the CCL where the entry heading identifies the items controlled as those contained in the International Munitions List. (iii) Additional notifications. The Secretaries of Commerce and State must also notify the appropriate Congressional committees 30 days before a license is issued for the export or reexport of any item controlled on the CCL to a designated country if the Secretary of State determines that the export or reexport ""could make a significant contribution to the military potential of such country, including its military logistics capability, or could enhance the ability of such country to support acts of international January 2004   Application Processing, Issuance and/or Denial  Part 750page 4  terrorism."" (c) Initial processing Within 9 days of license application registration, BIS will, as appropriate: (1) Contact the applicant if additional information is required, if the license application is improperly completed, or required support documents are missing, to request additional or corrected information; (2) Assure the stated classification on the license application is correct; (3) Return the license application if a license is not required with a statement notifying the applicant that a license is not required; (4) Approve the license application or notify the applicant of the intent to deny the license application; or (5) Refer the license application electronically along with all necessary recommendations and analysis concurrently to all agencies unless the application is subject to a Delegation of Authority. Any relevant information not contained in the electronic file will be simultaneously forwarded in paper copy. (d) Review by other agencies and/or interagency groups (1) Within 10 days of receipt of a referral the reviewing agency must advise BIS of any information not contained in the referral as described in paragraph (c)(5) of this section. BIS will promptly request such information from the applicant. The time that elapses between the date the information is requested by the reviewing agency and the date the information is received by the reviewing agency will not be counted in processing time frames. (2) Within 30 days of receipt of the initial  referral, the reviewing agency will provide BIS with a recommendation either to approve (with or without conditions or riders) or deny the license applicatio n. As appropriate, such a recommendation may be made with the benefit of consultation and/or discussions in interagency groups established to provide expertise and coordinate interagency consultation. These interagency groups consist of: (i) The Missile Technology Export Control Group (MTEC). The MTEC, chaired by the Department of State, reviews license applications involving items controlled for missile technology reasons. The MTEC also reviews license applications involving items not controlled for missile technology (MT) reasons, but destined for a country and/or end-use/end-user of MT concern. (ii) The SubGroup on Nuclear Export Coordination (SNEC). The SNEC, chaired by the Department of State, reviews license applications in volving item s controlled for n u c lear nonproliferation reasons. The SNEC also reviews license applications involving items not controlled for nuclear nonproliferation (NP) reasons, but destined for a country and/or end use/end-user of NP concern. (iii) The Shield. The Shield, chaired by the Department of State, reviews license applications involving items controlled for chemical and biological weapons reasons. The Shield also reviews license applications involving items not controlled for chemical and biological weapons (CBW) reasons, but destined for a country and/or end-use/end-user of CBW concern. (e) Recommendations by reviewing agencies Reviewing agencies recommending denial of a license application must provide a statement of reasons, consistent with the provisions of the EAA or EAR, and cite both the statutory and the regulatory basis for the recommendation to deny. A reviewing agency that fails to provide a recommendation within 30 days with a statement January 2004  Export Administration Regulations   Application Processing, Issuance and/or Denial  Part 750page 5  of reasons supported by the statutory and regulatory basis shall be deemed to have no objection to the final decision of BIS. (f) Interagency dispute resolution and escalation procedures (1) Escalation to the Operating Committee (OC). (i) In any instance where the reviewing agencies are not in agreement on final disposition of a license application, it will be escalated to the OC for resolution. The Chair of the OC will consider the recommendations of the reviewing agencies and any information provided by the applicant in person during an open OC session. Each agency will be informed of the Chair's decision on the license application within 14 days after the deadline for receiving agency recommendations. (ii) If any agency disagrees with the OC Chair's decision, the agency may escalate the decision by appealing to the Chair of the Advisory Committee on Export Policy for resolution. If such a request for escalation is not made within 5 days of the decision of the OC Chair, the chair's decision will be final. (2) Escalation to the Advisory Committee on Export Policy (ACEP). Requests for escalation to the ACEP must be in writing from an official appointed by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate, or a person properly acting in such capacity, and cite both the statutory and the regulatory basis for the appeal. The ACEP will review all relevant information and recommendations. The Chair of the ACEP will inform the reviewing agencies of the majority vote decision of the ACEP within 11 days from the date of receipt of the escalation request. Within 5 days of the decision, any dissenting agency may appeal in writing the ACEP's decision to the Secretary of Commerce in the Secretary's capacity as the Chair of the Export Administration Review Board. The written Export Administration Regulations  request must be made by the head of the agency requesting escalation and cite both the statutory and the regulatory basis for the appeal. Within the same period of time, the Secretary may initiate a meeting on his or her own initiative to consider a license application. In the absence of a timely appeal, the decision of the ACEP will be final. (3) Escalation to the Export Administration Review Board (EARB). The EARB will review all relevant information and recommendations, and such other export control matters as may be appropriate. The Secretary of Commerce will inform the reviewing agencies of the majority vote decision of the EARB within 11 days from the date of receipt of the appeal. Within 5 days of the decision, any agency dissenting from the decision of the EARB may appeal the decision to the President. The appeal must be in writing from the head of the dissenting agency. In the absence of a timely appeal, the decision of the EARB will be final. 750.5 STATUS OF PENDING APPLICATIONS AND OTHER REQUESTS (a) Information available You may contact BIS for status of your pending Classification Request, Advisory Opinion, or license application.

The notification will include: (1) The intent to deny decision; (2) The statutory and regulatory basis for the denial; (3) To the extent consistent with the national security and foreign policy of the United States, the specific considerations that led to the decision to deny the license application; (4) What, if any, modifications or restrictions to the license application would allow BIS to reconsider the license application; (5) The name of the BIS representative in a position to discuss the issues with the applicant; and Export Administration Regulations  (b) Response to intent to deny notification You will be allowed 20 days from the date of the notification to respond to the decision before the license application is denied. If you respond to the notification, BIS will advise you if, as a result of your response, the decision to deny has been changed. Unless you are so advised by the 45th day after the date of the notification, the denial will become final, without further notice. You will then have 45 days from the date of final denial to exercise the right to appeal under part 756 of the EAR. 750.7 ISSUANCE OF LICENSES (a) Scope A license authorizes only a specific transaction, or series of transactions, as described in the license application and any supporting documents. A license application may be approved in whole or in part or further limited by conditions or other restrictions appearing on the license itself or in the EAR. When a license application is approved by BIS, a license is issued as described in paragraph (b) of this section. (b) Issuance of a license After a license application is approved, a computer generated license is issued by the Department of Commerce bearing the license number and a validation date. Where appropriate, the license will also show an expiration date. Where necessary, attachments to a license will also be validated with the Department of Commerce seal and the date of validation. Exporters must use the complete license number when preparing a Shipper's Export Declaration (SED) or Automated Export System (AES) record January 2004   Application Processing, Issuance and/or Denial  Part 750page 7  and other export control documents, and in communicating with the Department of Commerce concerning the license. (c) Changes to the license (1) The following non-material changes do not require submission of a ""Replacement"" license or any other notification to BIS. (If you wish to make any change not identified in this paragraph, you will need to submit a ""Replacement"" license in accordance with the instructions contained in Supplement No. 1 to part 748 of the EAR Block 11): (i) Decrease in unit price or total value; (ii) Increase in price or quantity if permitted under the shipping tolerances in 750.11 of this part; (iii) Increase in price that can be justified on the basis of changes in point of delivery, port of export, or as a result of transportation cost, drayage, port charges, warehousing, currency fluctuations, etc.; (iv) Establishment of unit or total price in conformance with a ""price statement"" on a license that permits price to be based on the market price at a specified date plus an exporter's mark-up, or like basis; (v) Change in intermediate consignee if the new intermediate consignee is located in the country of ultimate destination as shown on the license, except a change in, or addition of, an intermediate consignee involving a consolidated shipment; (vi) Change in continuity of shipment by unloading from carrier at a country listed in Country Group B (see Supplement No. 1 to part 740 of the EAR) port not in the country of ultimate destination, without the designation of an intermediate consignee on the shipping documents and license, provided: Export Administration Regulations  (A) The purpose is to transfer the shipment to another vessel, barge, or vehicle, solely for onforwarding to the country of destination shown on the shipping documents and the license; (B) The shipment is moving on a through bill of lading; (C) The carrier is not registered in, owned or controlled by, or under charter or lease to a country in Country Group D:1 or E:2 (see Supplement No. 1 to part 740 of the EAR), or a national of any of these countries; (D) The carrier retains custody of the shipment until it is delivered to the ultimate consignee; and (E) The original bill of lading or air waybill first issued at the port of export is delivered with the shipment to the ultimate consignee; (vii) Change in address of purchaser or ultimate consignee if the new address is located within the same country shown on the license; or (viii) Change in ECCN, unit of quantity, unit price, or wording of the item description (where necessary only for the purpose of conforming to an official revision in the CCL). This does not cover an actual change in the item to be shipped, or an increase in the price or quantity. (2)(i) For Encryption Licensing Arrangements issued by BIS for exports and reexports of items controlled under ECCN 5A002, 5B002, and 5D002, and for encryption commodities and software previously on the U.S. Munitions List and currently authorized for export or reexport under a State Department license, distribution arrangement or any other authority of the State Department, you must by letter to BIS a request for approval of any additional country of destination. (ii) Letters requesting changes pursuant to paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section should be made January 2004   Application Processing, Issuance and/or Denial  Part 750page 8  by the license holder on company letterhead, clearly identifying the original license number and the requested change. In addition, requests for changes to State licenses or other authorizations must be accompanied by a copy of the original State license or authorization. The requested changes may not take effect until approved in writing by BIS. Send requests for changes to the following address: Office of Strategic Trade  Bureau of Industry and Security  U.S. Department of Commerce  Room 2705  14th Street and Pennsylvania Ave., NW  Washington, DC 20230   Attn: Encryption Division  (d) Responsibility of the licensee The person to whom a license is issued is the licensee. In export transactions, the exporter must be the licensee, and the exporter-licensee is responsible for the proper use of the license, and for all terms and conditions of the license, except to the extent that certain terms and conditions are directed toward some other party to the transaction. In the case of Encryption License Agreements (ELA), the licensee may not necessarily be the exporter or reexporter. In this case, the authorized user of the ELA is responsible for proper use of the license, and for all terms and conditions of the license, except to the extent that certain terms and conditions are directed toward some other party to the transaction. In reexport or routed export transactions, a U.S. agent acting on behalf of a foreign principal party in interest may be the licensee; in these cases, both the agent and the foreign principal party in interest, on whose behalf the agent has acted, are responsible for the use of the license, and for all terms and conditions of the license, except to the extent that certain terms and conditions are directed toward some other party to the transaction. It is the licensee's responsibility to communicate the specific license conditions to the parties to whom those conditions Export Administration Regulations  apply. In addition, when required by the license, the licensee is responsible for obtaining written acknowledgment(s) of receipt of the conditions from the party(ies) to whom those conditions apply. (e) Prohibited use of a license No person convicted of a violation of any statute specified in section 11(h) of the EAA, at the discretion of the Secretary of Commerce, may apply for any license for a period up to 10 years from the date of the conviction. See 766.25 of the EAR. (f) Quantity of commodities authorized Unlike software and technology, commodities will be approved with a quantity or dollar value limit. The ""Unit"" paragraph within each CCL commodity entry will list a specific ""Unit"" for those commodities controlled by that entry. Any license resulting from a license application to export or reexport commodities will be licensed in terms of the specified ""Unit"". If a commodity is licensed in terms of ""$ value"", the unit of quantity commonly used in trade may also be shown on the license. Though this unit may be shown on the approved license, the quantity of commodities authorized is limited entirely by the total dollar value shown on the approved license. (g) License validity period Licenses involving the export or reexport of items will generally have a 24 month validity period, unless a different validity period has been requested and specifically approved by BIS. Exceptions from the 24 month validity period include, license applications reviewed and approved as an ""emergency"" (see 748.4(h) of the EAR), license applications for items controlled for short supply reasons, and Special Comprehensive Licenses. Emergency licenses will expire no later than the last day of the calendar month following the month in which the emergency license is issued. Licenses for items controlled for short January 2004   Application Processing, Issuance and/or Denial  Part 750page 9  supply reasons will be limited to a 12 month validity period. The expiration date will be clearly stated on the face of the license. If the expiration date falls on a legal holiday (Federal or State), the validity period is automatically extended to midnight of the first day of business following the expiration date. (See part 752 of the EAR for validity periods for Special Comprehensive Licenses.) (1) Extended validity period. Validity periods in excess of 24 months generally will not be granted. BIS will consider granting a validity period exceeding 24 months when extenuating circumstances warrant such an extension, however, no changes will be approved related to any other particular on the license (e.g., parties to the transaction, countries of ultimate destination, etc.). For example, an extended validity period will generally be granted where the transaction is related to a multi-year project, when production lead time will not permit an export or reexport during the original validity period of the license, when an unforeseen emergency prevents shipment within the 24-month validity of the license, or for other similar circumstances. A continuing requirement to supply spare or replacement parts will not normally justify an extended validity period. Licenses issued in accordance with the emergency clearance provisions contained in 748.4(h) of the EAR will not be extended. See 752.9 of the EAR for information relating to the extension of a Special Comprehensive License. (2) Request for extension. (i) The applicant must submit a letter in writing to request an extension in the validity period of a previously approved license. The subject of the letter must be titled: ""Request for Validity Period Extension"" and contain the following information: (A) The name, address, and telephone number of the requestor; (B) A copy of the original license, with the license number, validation date, and current expiration date legible; and Export Administration Regulations  (C) Justification for the extension. (ii) It is the responsibility of the applicant to ensure that all applicable support documents remain valid and are in the possession of the applicant. If the request for extension is approved, BIS will provide the applicant with a written response. (h) Specific types of licenses (1) Licenses for temporary exports or reexports. If you have been granted a license for the temporary export or reexport of items and you decide not to return the items to the United States, you must submit a license application requesting authorization to dispose of the items. Except when the items are to be used on a temporary basis at a new destination (and returned to the United States after such use), you must ensure that your license application is accompanied by all documents that would be required if you had requested a license to export or reexport the same item directly to the new destination. (2) Intransit within the United States. If you have been issued a license authorizing an intransit shipment (that does not qualify for the intransit provisions of License Exception TMP) through the United States, your license will be valid only for the export of the intransit shipment wholly of foreign origin and for which a Transportation and Exportation customs entry or an Immediate Exportation customs entry is outstanding. (3) Intransit outside the United States. If you have been issued a license authorizing unlading or transit through a country listed in the General Prohibition Eight contained in 736.2(b)(8) of the EAR, and you did not know the identity of the intermediate consignee at the time of the originallicense application, you must notify BIS in writing once you have ascertained the identity of the intermediate consignee. Your notification must contain the original license number, and the complete name, address, and telephone number of the intermediate consignee. The written request January 2004   Application Processing, Issuance and/or Denial  Part 750page 10  must be submitted to BIS at the address listed in 748.2(c) of the EAR. (4) Replacement license. If you have been issued a ""replacement"" license (for changes to your original license that were not covered in paragraph (c) of this section), you must attach the ""replacement"" license to the original, and retain both. (i) Terminating license conditions Exporters or reexporters who have shipped under licenses with conditions that would not apply to an export under a License Exception or if no license was required, and foreign consignees who have agreed to such conditions, are no longer bound by these conditions when the licensed items become eligible for a License Exception or can be exported or reexported without a license. Items that become eligible for a License Exception are subject to the terms and conditions of the applicable License Exception and to the restrictions in 740.2 of the EAR. Items that become eligible for export without a license remain subject to the EAR and any export, reexport, or disposition of such items may only be made in accordance with the requirements of the EAR. Termination of license conditions does not relieve an exporter or reexporter of its responsibility for violations that occurred prior to the availability of a License Exception or prior to the removal of license requirements. (j) Records If you have been issued a license you must retain the license, and maintain complete records in accordance with part 762 of the EAR including any licenses (whether used or unused, valid or expired) and all supporting documents and shipping records.  750.8 REVOCATION OR SUSPENSION OF LICENSES (a) Revocation All licenses for exports or reexports are subject to revision, suspension, or revocation, in whole or in part, without notice whenever it is known that the EAR have been violated or that a violation is about to occur. BIS's Office of Exporter Services may revoke any license in which a person who has been convicted of one of the statutes specified in section 11(h) of the EAA, at the discretion of the Secretary of Commerce, has an interest in the license at the time of the conviction. It may be necessary for BIS to stop a shipment or an export or reexport transaction at any stage in the process (e.g., in order to prevent an unauthorized export or reexport). If a shipment is already en route, it may be further necessary for BIS to order the return or unloading of such shipment at any port of call in accordance with the provisions of the EAA. (b) Return of revoked or suspended licenses If BIS revokes or suspends a license, the licensee shall return the license immediately upon notification that the license has been suspended or revoked. The license must be returned to BIS at the address listed in 748.2(c) of the EAR, Attn:""Return of Revoked/Suspended License"". All applicable supporting documents and records of shipments must be retained by the licensee in accordance with the recordkeeping provisions of part 762 of the EAR. If the licensee fails to return a license immediately upon notification that it has been suspended or revoked, BIS may impose sanctions provided for in part 764 of the EAR.  Export Administration Regulations  January 2004   Application Processing, Issuance and/or Denial  Part 750page 11  750.9 DUPLICATE LICENSES (a) Lost, stolen or destroyed  750.10 TRANSFERS OF LICENSES FOR EXPORTS (a) Authorization  If a license is lost, stolen or destroyed, you, as the licensee, may obtain a duplicate of the license by submitting a letter to the BIS at the address listed in 748.2(c) of the EAR, Attention: Duplicate License Request"". You must certify in your letter: (1) That the original license ([number] issued to [name and address of licensee]) has been lost, stolen or destroyed; (2) The circumstances under which it was lost, stolen or destroyed; and (3) If the original license is found, the licensee will return either the original or duplicate license to the BIS. Note that if shipment was made against the original license, those shipments must be counted against the duplicate license. If you are issued a duplicate license you must retain the duplicate license in accordance with the recordkeeping provisions of part 762 of the EAR. (b) Hong Kong Trade Department BIS will automatically issue a duplicate license whenever the license lists a party in Hong Kong as the intermediate consignee, or when Hong Kong is identified as the country from which the reexport will take place. The duplicate license will be labeled ""Duplicate for Hong Kong Trade Department"". This duplicate must be forwarded to the reexporter or intermediate consignee for submission to the Hong Kong Trade Department. The original license must be retained on file by the licensee in accordance with the recordkeeping provisions contained in part 762 of the EAR.  As the licensee, you may not transfer a license issued for the export of items from the United States to any other party, except with the prior written approval of BIS. BIS may authorize a transfer of a license for export to a transferee who is subject to the jurisdiction of the United States, is a principal party in interest, and will assume all powers and responsibilities under the license for the control of the shipment of the items out of the United States. BIS will approve only one transfer of the same license and only transfers of licenses to export items. (b) How to request the transfer of licenses (1) Letter from licensee. You, as the licensee, must submit a letter in writing to request a transfer of a license or licenses. The letter must contain the following information: (i) The reasons for the requested transfer; (ii) Either a list of the outstanding license numbers or a statement that all outstanding licenses in the name of the licensee are to be transferred, and the total number of such outstanding licenses; (iii) A list of all license applications for export to be transferred that are pending with BIS, identifying the Application Control Number for each, or other information that will assist in identifying the pending license applications; (iv) Name and address of the person you intend to transfer the licenses and license applications to; (v) The facts necessitating transfer; (vi) A statement as to whether or not any  Export Administration Regulations  January 2004   Application Processing, Issuance and/or Denial  Part 750page 12  consideration has been, or will be, paid for the transfer; and (vii) Identification by name of the legal document (certificate, agreement, etc.) or other authority by which the new firm name is legally established, the new corporation or firm created, or the assets transferred and showing the effective date of such document and the state where filed or recorded. (2) Information whom you wish provide you a submitted with following: from transferee. The person to to transfer your license(s) must signed letter, that must be your request, containing the  The undersigned hereby certifies that, if license number(s)_____________ is (are) transferred in accordance with my (our) request, any and all documents evidencing the order covered by this(these)license(s) will be retained and made available upon request in com p liance with the recordkeeping provisions contained in Part 762 of the Export Administration Regulations. The undersigned further certifies compliance with all requirements of the Export Administration Regulations regarding these licenses. (c) Notification of transfer and recordkeeping Unless instructed otherwise by BIS, you must retain the license(s) pending notification by BIS of the action taken. If the request is approved, you must forward the license(s) to the transferee and the validated letter received from BIS authorizing the transfer. If the transfer request is not approved, the license(s) must either be returned to BIS or used by you if you so choose and have retained the legal and operational capacity fully to meet the responsibilities imposed by the license(s). If your initial request is returned by BIS for additional information, after obtaining the necessary information you may resubmit your request. 750.11 SHIPPING TOLERANCES (a) Applicability and use of shipping tolerances Under some circumstances, you may use a license issued for the export of items from the United States to export more than the quantity or value shown on that license. This additional amount is called a shipping tolerance. This section tells you, as the licensee, when you may take advantage of a shipping tolerance and the amount of shipping tolerance you are permitted to use. January 2004  (i) That the transferee is a principal party in interest in the transaction covered by the license, or is acting as agent for a principal party in interest; (ii) That the transferee is subject to the jurisdiction of the United States; (iii) That the transferee assumes all powers and responsibilities under the license for the control of the shipment of the items out of the United States; (iv) Whether any consideration has been, has not been, or will be paid for the transfer; (v) The name and address of the foreign principal in instances where the transferee will make the export as an agent on behalf of a foreign principal; and (vi) If the license is to be transferred to a subsidiary or firm, or if you transfer to the transferee all, or a substantial portion, of your assets or business, the transferee must certify that the legal authority changing the exporter imposes on the transferee the responsibility to accept and fulfill the obligations of the transferor under the transactions covered by the license; and (vii) The following certification: Export Administration Regulations   Application Processing, Issuance and/or Denial  Part 750page 13  (1) If you have already shipped the full amount approved on your license, you may not use this shipping tolerance provision. No further shipment may be made under the license. (2) The amount of shipping tolerance you are permitted is based on the ""Unit"" specified for the item you want to export in the applicable ECCN on the CCL (see Supplement No. 1 to part 774 of the EAR). You must calculate shipping tolerance based on the applicable ""Unit"" whether that be Number, Dollar Value, or Area, Weight, or other Measure. You may not use any other unit that may appear on your license. (b) Calculating shipping tolerances There are three basic rules, one for items licensed by ""Dollar Value"", one for items licensed by ""Number"", and another for items licensed by ""Area, Weight or other Measure"". (1) Items licensed by ""Dollar Value"". If the ""Unit"" paragraph in the ECCN applicable to your item reads ""$ value"" or ""in $ value"", there is no shipping tolerance. You may not ship more than the total dollar value stated on your license. (2) Items licensed by ""Number"". If the ""Unit"" paragraph in the ECCN applicable to your item reads ""Number"" or ""in Number"", there is no shipping tolerance with respect to the number of units. However, the value of all of your shipments under one license may exceed the total dollar value stated on that license by up to 25%. (3) Items licensed by ""Area, Weight or Measure"". If the ""Unit"" paragraph in the ECCN applicable to your item reads ""kilograms"" or ""square meters"" or some other unit of area, weight or measure, your shipment may exceed the unshipped balance of the area, weight or other measure listed on your license by up to 10% and the total dollar value shown on your license by up to 25%, unless; (i) Your license stipulates a specific shipping Export Administration Regulations  tolerance; or (ii) Your item is controlled for short supply reasons and a smaller tolerance has been established. (See part 754 of the EAR). (c) Examples of shipping tolerances (1) A license authorizes the export of 100,000 kilograms of an item controlled by an ECCN where the ""Unit"" is stated as ""kilograms"", the total cost of which is $1,000,000: (i) One shipment. If one shipment is made, the quantity that may be exported may not exceed 110,000 kg (10% tolerance on the unshipped Area, Weight, or Measure balance), and the total cost of that one shipment may not exceed $1,250,000:  $1,000,000 (the total value shown on the license) +250,000 (25% of the total value shown on the license) $1,250,000 (ii) Two shipments. If the first shipment is for 40,000 kg (valued at $400,000), the second shipment may not exceed 66,000 kg (10% of the unshipped balance of 60,000 kg (6,000 kg) plus the unshipped balance), and the total cost of the second shipment shall not exceed $850,000: $600,000 (the value of the unshipped  balance of 60,000 kg)  +250,000 (25% of the original total value  shown on the license)  ________ $850,000 (iii) Three shipments.

(ii)(A) If the first shipment is for 4 pieces of equipment valued at $4,000,000, the second shipment may not exceed 6 pieces of equipment (no tolerance on ""number"") valued at no more than $8,500,000: $6,000,000 +2,500,000 __________ $8,500,000 (the value of the unshipped 6 pieces) (25% of the original total value shown on the license)  (2) A license authorizes the export of an item controlled by an ECCN where the ""Unit"" is stated as ""$ value"", the total cost of which is $5,000,000. There is no shipping tolerance on this license because the items are controlled by an ECCN where ""$ value"" is the stated ""Unit"". (3) A license authorizes the export of 10 pieces of equipment controlled by an ECCN where the ""Unit"" is stated as ""Number"", with a total value of $10,000,000 and the export of parts and accessories covered by that same entry valued at $1,000,000: (i)(A) If one shipment is made, the quantity of equipment that may be exported may not exceed 10 pieces of equipment because there is no shipping tolerance on the ""number"" of units. That one shipment of equipment may not exceed $12,500,000: $10,000,000 +2,500,000 __________ $12,500,000 (B) If the one shipment includes parts and accessories, those parts and accessories may not exceed $1,000,000 because there is no shipping Export Administration Regulations  (B) If the first shipment includes $300,000 of parts and accessories, the second shipment may not exceed $700,000 of parts and accessories because there is no shipping tolerance on any commodity licensed in terms of dollar value. (iii)(A) If the first shipment is for 4 pieces of equipment valued at $4,000,000 and the second shipment is for 3 pieces of equipment valued at $3,000,000, the third shipment may not exceed 3 pieces of equipment (no tolerance on ""number"") valued at no more than $5,500,000: (the value of the unshipped 3 pieces) +2,500,000 ( 2 5 % o f t h e o r i g i n a l v a l u e shown on the license) __________ $5,500,000 (B) If the first shipment includes $300,000 of parts and accessories and the second shipment includes another $300,000, the third shipment may not exceed $400,000 because there is no shipping tolerance on commodities licensed in terms of dollar value. $3,000,000  (the total value shown on the license) (25% of the total value shown on the license)  January 2004"

Background      Metropolitan Planning funds are apportioned by a statutory formula  to the Governors for allocation by them to Metropolitan Planning  Organizations (MPOs) in urbanized areas or portions thereof. State  Planning and Research funds also are apportioned to states by a  statutory formula. Urbanized Area Formula Program funds are apportioned  by statutory formula to urbanized areas and to the Governors to provide  capital, operating and planning assistance in urbanized areas.  Nonurbanized Area Formula Program funds are apportioned by statutory  formula to the Governors for capital, operating and administrative  assistance in nonurbanized areas. The Elderly and Persons with  Disabilities Program funds are apportioned by statutory formula to the  Governors to provide capital assistance to organizations providing  transportation service for the elderly and persons with disabilities.  Fixed Guideway Modernization funds are apportioned by statutory formula  to specified urbanized areas for capital improvements in rail and other  fixed guideways. New Start and Bus funds identified in the Omnibus  Appropriations Act are also included in this Notice.  II. Overview of Appropriations for Grant Programs  A. General      The fiscal year 1999 appropriations for the FTA program is  $5,390,000,000, the guaranteed funding level under TEA-21, plus an  additional $25,000,000 above the guaranteed level to support the  Administration's proposed and TEA-21 adopted Job Access and Reverse  Commute Program.     In fiscal year 1999, the appropriation for the Metropolitan  Planning Program is $43,841,600 and $9,158,400 for the State Planning  and Research Program. The appropriation for formula grants totals  $2,850,000,000. Under statutory authority, the distribution of the  total formula funds available is as follows: $4,849,950 is set aside  for the Alaska Railroad, $50,000,000 for the Clean Fuels Formula  Program is transferred to the Capital Investment Bus program, and  $2,000,000 is for the Over-the-Road Bus Accessibility Program. Of the  remaining amount of $2,793,150,050, 91.23 percent ($2,548,190,791) is  made available to the Urbanized Area Formula Program, 6.37 percent  ($177,923,658) is made available to the Nonurbanized Area Formula  Program, and 2.4 percent ($67,035,601) is made available to the Elderly  and Persons with Disabilities Program.     The other program appropriations contained in this Notice are as  follows: $5,250,000 for the Rural Transit Assistance Program (RTAP);  and $2,257,000,000 for the Capital Program. Of the Capital Program  amount, $902,800,000 is for Fixed Guideway Modernization, $902,800,000  is for New Starts, and $451,400,000 is for Bus Capital. In addition,  $50,000,000 of formula funds for Clean Fuels was transferred to and  merged with the Bus Capital Program increasing that program to  $501,400,000. $75,000,000 is for the Job Access and Reverse Commute  Program.     Table 1 displays the amounts appropriated for these programs,  including adjustments and final apportionment and allocation amounts.  The following text provides a narrative explanation for the funding  levels and other factors affecting these apportionments and  allocations.  B. TEA-21 Authorized Program Levels      TEA-21 provides a combination of trust and general fund  authorizations that total $6,542,000,000 for fiscal year 1999 FTA  program. Of this amount, $5,365,000,000 is guaranteed under the  discretionary spending cap. See Table 9 for fiscal years 1998-2003  guaranteed fund levels by program, and Table 9A for the total of  guaranteed and non-guaranteed levels by program.     Information regarding estimates of the fundings levels for 1999- 2003 by state and urbanized area is available on the FTA home page at  www.fta.dot.gov. These numbers are for planning purposes only as they  will be revised in the future but may be used for programming  metropolitan transportation improvement programs and statewide  transportation improvement programs.  C. Project Management Oversight      49 U.S.C. Section 5327 allows the Secretary of Transportation to  use not more than one-half percent of the funds made available under  the Urbanized Area Formula Program, the Nonurbanized Area Formula  Program; the National Capital Transportation Act, as 1 amended; and  three-quarters percent of funds made available under the Capital  Program to contract with any person to oversee the construction of any  major project under these statutory programs; to conduct safety,  procurement, management and financial reviews and audits; and to  provide technical assistance to correct deficiencies identified in  compliance reviews and audits. Therefore, one-half percent of the funds  appropriated for the Urbanized Area Formula Program, the Nonurbanized  Area Formula Program and the National Capital Transportation Act, as  amended, for fiscal year 1999, and three-quarters percent of Capital  Program funds have been reserved for these purposes before  apportionment of funds.  III. Outreach  A. FTA-Sponsored TEA-21 Listening Sessions      Over a thirty-day period that began in early September of 1998, the  FTA conducted eight listening sessions for its customers and  constituents. Sessions were held in Dallas, Portland, San Francisco,  Atlanta, Kansas City, Chicago, Philadelphia, and New York.     The sessions were designed to allow FTA leadership and staff to  hear the concerns and issues that people had with respect to the  implementation of TEA-21. The overwhelming majority of people who spoke  during the sessions asked questions about new provisions,  implementation schedules and funding levels. The principal issues in  all of the  [[Page 60054]]  sessions were changes in the New Start evaluation process, the new  preventive maintenance provision, and the three new programs: Job  Access and Reverse Commute; Clean Fuel Formula; and Over-the-Road Bus  Accessibility.  B. Revised Program Guidance Circulars      To incorporate changes introduced in TEA-21, FTA has issued revised  program guidance circulars. New circulars, which are all effective  October 1, 1998, include C9030.1C, Urbanized Area Formula Program:  Grant Application Instructions; C9040.1E, Nonurbanized Area Formula  Program Guidance and Grant Application Instructions; C9070.1E, Elderly  and Persons with Disabilities Program Guidance and Grant Application  Instructions; C9300.1A, Capital Program: Grant Application  Instructions; and C5010.1C, Grant Management Guidelines.  IV. Emphasis Areas  A. Americans With Disabilities Act Compliance      With eight years since the passage of the Americans with  Disabilities Act (ADA), compliance with all aspects of ADA is one of  FTA's highest priorities. FTA will continue to focus on grantees'  compliance with ADA. Several grantees have entered into voluntary  compliance agreements (VCAs) which represent their commitment to come  into full compliance. FTA will continue to monitor the milestones in  the VCAs and expects the grantees to meet them.     TEA-21 and the fiscal year 1999 Omnibus Appropriations Act provide  unprecedented levels of funding for public transportation and these  increased funds should be utilized to ensure speedy and full compliance  with all aspects of the ADA.     Grantees that may have difficulties with ADA compliance should  contact their FTA regional office as soon as they are aware of any  problems.  B. National ITS Architecture and Standards Requirements      Section 5206(e) of TEA-21 requires that Intelligent Transportation  Systems (ITS) projects using funds from the Highway Trust Fund  (including the Mass Transit Account) conform to the National ITS  Architecture and Standards. Interim guidance on conformity with  National ITS Performance Standards was issued October 2, 1998 jointly  by FTA and FHWA. This document provides guidance for meeting this  provision of TEA-21 and is available from the FTA regional office or on  the internet at www.its.dot.gov. These standards and requirements apply  to fiscal year 1999 bus allocations included in this notice which  contain ITS components.     Questions regarding the applicability of these standards and  requirements should be addressed to the FTA regional office or Ronald  Boenau, FTA Office of Research, Demonstration and Innovation at (202)  366-0195.  V. Transportation Electronic Awards and Management System  A. Background      The FTA Grants Management Information System (GMIS) became  operational 10 years ago. In 1994 FTA began the Electronic Grant Making  and Management (EGMM) initiative. The EGMM program is a paperless  electronic grant application, review, approval, acceptance and  management process. This program started as a pilot effort and involved  20 grantees nationwide who served as pilots. By fiscal year 1998, 191  grantees were participating in the FTA EGMM program. Over 800 grantees  were on line for various management activities such as filing of  financial and narrative status reports. In addition, grantees could use  EGMM for the electronic signature of annual certifications and  assurances. During the assessment of the GMIS, FTA became aware that  the GMIS was not Year 2000 compliant.  B. Transportation Electronic Awards and Management System (TEAM)      On November 2, 1998, FTA will introduce its third generation of  electronic enhancements when the Transportation Electronic Awards and  Management System, the TEAM system, becomes operational. This will make  FTA's mission critical grant management systems Year 2000 compliant,  and the FTA grant delivery process will not be interrupted. The TEAM  system utilizes graphical user interface (GUI) technology providing  point and click ``Smart'' selections that aid the grant recipients with  their business process for submitting applications and management  reporting.     During fiscal year 1999, the TEAM system will use a dual grant  numbering system which includes the current system and one that  reflects the codification of Federal transit laws. For example, a  current number may be NY-90-X321; the new number would be NY-5307-0321.  Starting with fiscal year 2000, only the numbers reflecting the  codification will be used.     FTA outreach to the industry has been extensive and thorough. FTA  personnel have traveled to 30 cities to conduct hands-on training  sessions, which have attracted over 1,200 transit industry  professionals--with more sessions underway until everyone who uses FTA  programs can access the TEAM system. On September 30, 1998, FTA began  distributing the TEAM system software to grantees at no charge and  expects all grantees to apply for grants electronically in fiscal year  1999.  C. Fiscal Year 1999 Emphasis      In fiscal year 1999 FTA expects grantees to use the TEAM system  grantees for grant application and approval, as well as for grant  management activities if they have not already done so. FTA also  expects all grantees to file the fiscal year 1999 Certifications and  Assurances electronically using the TEAM system.  VI. Expanded Definition of Capital  A. Preventive Maintenance      Preventive maintenance, an expense that became eligible for FTA  capital assistance for one year with the DOT 1998 Appropriations Act,  was established as permanently eligible for FTA capital assistance  under TEA-21; therefore, FY 1998 funds and subsequent fiscal year  appropriations may be used for preventive maintenance. Preventive  maintenance costs are defined as all maintenance costs. For general  guidance regarding eligible maintenance costs, the grantee should refer  to the definition of maintenance in the most recent National Transit  Database reporting manual. A grantee may continue to request assistance  for capital expenses under the FTA policies governing associated  capital maintenance items (spare parts), vehicle overhaul as 20 percent  of maintenance, maintenance of vehicle leased under contract, and  vehicle rebuilds (major re-work); or a grantee may choose to capture  all maintenance under preventive maintenance. If a grantee purchases  service instead of operating service directly, and maintenance is  included in the contract for that purchased service, then the grantee  may apply for preventive maintenance capital assistance under the  capital cost of contracting policy. The capital cost of contracting  policy is discussed below.     For accounting purposes, the grantee is cautioned not to confuse  the fact that an item generally considered to be an operating expense  is eligible for FTA capital assistance. Generally accepted accounting  principles and the grantee's accounting system detemine those costs  that are to be accounting for as operating costs. The National Transit  Database  [[Page 60055]]  Reporting System (NTD) follows generally accepted accounting  principles, so a grant recipient reporting to the NTD must report the  operating costs the grant recipient has incurred as operating costs  regardless of its eligibility for FTA capital assistance. Nevertheless,  under provisions of TEA-21 and earlier under provision of the fiscal  year 1998 Approriations Act, some of those operating costs, while  continuing to be accounted for as operating costs in the grant  recipient's accounting records, are now eligible for FTA capital  assistance. Grantees may not count the same costs twice.  B. ADA Complimentary Paratransit Service      TEA-21 expanded the definition of an eligible capital project to  include: ``* * * the provision of nonfixed route paratransit  transportation in accordance with Section 223 of the Americans with  Disabilities Act of 1990 (42 U.S.C. 12143), but only for grant  recipients that are in compliance with the applicable requirements of  the Act, including both fixed route and demand responsive service, and  only for amounts not to exceed 10 percent of such recipient's annual  formula apportionment under sections 5307 and 5311.''     Recipients of formula funds under the Urbanized Area Formula  Program and the Nonurbanized Area Formula Program may now use up to 10  percent of their annual formula apportionment to pay for ADA  paratransit operating costs. Section 223 of the ADA defines the  specific type of paratransit service that is eligible for this new  provision which is implemented in Subpart F of the Department of  Transportation's ADA regulation, which (at 49 CFR Part 37) explains the  ADA paratransit eligibility process, and the service criteria (service  area, response time, fares, trip purpose restrictions, hours and days  of service and capacity constraints).     a. ADA Compliance. Eligibility for using this expanded definition  of capital is dependent upon compliance with ADA requirements.  Currently, FTA grantees are required to certify compliance with ADA on  an annual basis. Non-compliance with ADA is the result of a formal  determination by FTA. Transit systems determined as being in non- compliance are not eligible to use this provision. Grantees who do not  make satisfactory progress in negotiating voluntary compliance  agreements or who do not achieve milestones within signed agreements  will lose their eligibility for funds for paratransit operating  expenses.     b. Non-ADA Paratransit. Operating costs associated with paratransit  services which are not required by the ADA are not eligible for this  funding option.     c. Time of Costs Incurred. FTA reimbursement at the 80 percent  Federal share for ADA paratransit costs under this provision must be by  means of a grant awarded after June 9, 1998. Eligible costs must have  been incurred in a local fiscal year ending after June 9, 1998.     d. Implementation in UZA's with More than One Grantee. For those  urbanized areas with more than one ADA paratransit provider, it will be  the responsibility of the Metropolitan Planning Organization (MPO),  working with the transit operators, to program up to 10 percent of the  urbanized area's apportionment should it want to utilize this  eligibility.  C. Capital Cost of Contracting      Some FTA grantees contract for transit service, for maintenance  service, or for vehicles that the grantee will use in transit service.  FTA traditionally provides assistance for the capital consumed in the  course of the contract. The concept of assisting with capital consumed  is referred to as the ``capital cost of contracting.'' FTA provides  assistance at the 80/20 FTA/local share ratio for the capital cost of  contracting.     To incorporate the fact that preventive maintenance is now an  eligible capital cost, FTA has changed the admininstration of the  Capital Cost of Contracting policy, effecitive with fiscal year 1998  funds. Preventive maintenance costs are now included within the capital  cost of contracting category, along with the capital charges for the  use of assets (capital consumed). Consequently, revisions have been  made to the schedule of precentages and type of contract used in the  past. The new schedule appears in the revised Circular 9030.1C.  VII. Section 5303 Metropolitan Planning Program and Section 5313(b)  State Planning and Research Program  A. Metropolitan Planning Program      The fiscal year 1999 Metropolitan Planning apportionment to states  for MPOs to be used in urbanized areas totals $43,901,198. This amount  includes $43,841,600 in fiscal year 1999 appropriated funds, and  $59,598 in prior year deobligated funds which have become available for  reallocation for this program. A basic allocation of 80 percent of this  amount ($35,120,958) is distributed to the states based on the state's  urbanized area population as defined by the U.S. Census Bureau for  subsequent state distribution to each urbanized area, or parts thereof,  within each state. A supplemental allocation of the remaining 20  percent ($8,780,240) is also provided to the States based on an FTA  administrative formula to address planning needs in the larger, more  complex urbanized areas. Table 2 contains the final state  apportionments for the combined basic and supplemental allocations.  Each state, in cooperation with the MPOs, must develop an allocation  formula for the combined apportionment which distributes these funds to  MPOs representing urbanized areas, or parts thereof, within the State.  This formula, which must be approved by the FTA, must ensure to the  maximum extent practicable that no MPO is allocated less than the  amount it received by administrative formula under the Metropolitan  Planning Program in fiscal year 1991 (minimum MPO allocation). Each  state formula must include a provision for the minimum MPO allocation.  Where the State and MPOs desire to use a new formula not previously  approved by FTA, it must be submitted to the appropriate FTA Regional  Office for prior approval.  B. State Planning and Research Program      The fiscal year 1999 apportionment for the State Planning and  Research Program totals $9,257,248. This amount includes $9,158,400 in  fiscal year 1999 appropriated funds, and $ 98 ,848 in prior year  deobligated funds which have become available for reallocation to this  program. Final state apportionments for this program are also contained  on Table 2. These funds may be used for a variety of purposes such as  planning, technical studies and assistance, demonstrations, management  training, and cooperative research. In addition, a state may authorize  a portion of these funds to be used to supplement planning funds  allocated by the state to its urbanized areas as the state deems  appropriate.  C. Data Used for Metropolitan Planning and State Planning and Research  Apportionments      Population data from the 1990 Census is used in calculating these  apportionments. The Metropolitan Planning funding provided to urbanized  areas in each state by administrative formula in fiscal year 1991 was  used as a ``hold harmless'' base in calculating funding to each State.  D. FHWA Metropolitan Planning Program and State Planning and Research  Program      For informational purposes, the fiscal year 1999 apportionment for  the FHWA  [[Page 60056]]  Metropolitan Planning Program and estimated apportionment for fiscal  year 1999 State Planning and Research Program are contained in Table 3.  E. Local Match Waiver for Job Access Planning Activities      Federal, state, and local welfare reform initiatives may require  the development of new and innovative public and other transportation  services to ensure that former welfare recipients have adequate  mobility for reaching employment opportunities. In recognition of the  key role that transportation plays in ensuring the success of welfare- to-work initiatives, FTA and FHWA are continuing the policy established  last year to permit waiver of the local match requirement for job  access planning activities undertaken with metropolitan Planning  Program and State Planning and Research Program funds. FTA and FHWA  will support requests for waivers when they are included in  metropolitan Unified Planning Work Programs and State Planning and  Research Programs and meet all other appropriate requirements.  F. Planning Emphasis Areas      (1) The Concept: The FTA and FHWA have cooperatively developed  Planning Emphasis Areas (PEA) for fiscal years 1999 and 2000. Emphasis  areas promote priority themes for consideration, as appropriate, in  metropolitan and statewide transportation planning processes.     (2) An Emphasis on System Management and Operation: TEA-21  identifies system management and operation as a focal theme and context  for transportation investment nationwide. The Conference Report  supporting TEA-21 contains language that places high priority on  Operations and Management, as indicated by the following excerpt. ``It  is in the national interest to encourage and promote the safe and  efficient management, operation, and development of surface  transportation systems that will serve the mobility needs of people and  freight and foster economic growth and development within and through  urbanized areas * * *''     TEA-21 identifies seven planning areas to be considered in  metropolitan and statewide planning. These include:     (A) support the economic vitality of the metropolitan area,  especially by enabling global competitiveness, productivity, and  efficiency;     (B) increase the safety and security of the transportation system  for motorized and nonmotorized users;     (C) increase the accessibility and mobility options available to  people and for freight;     (D) Protect and enhance the enviroment, promote energy  conservation, and improve quality of life;     (E) enhance the integration and connectivity of the transportation  system, across and between modes, for people and freight;     (F) promote efficient system management and operation; and     (G) emphasize the preservation of the existing transportation  system.     Planning area (F) promotes the consideration of efficient system  management and operation in transportation planning processes and  recognizes that we cannot always build our way out of congestion but  need to better manage and operate the existing system. Many agencies  that use a traditional capital intensive, capacity-enhancing  programming process to address the area's transportation problems will  need to review and revise their planning and programming process to  consider system management and operations.     (3) DOT Activities in Support of Management and Operations: FTA and  FHWA will work to support metropolitan areas and states in their  efforts to incorporate system management and operation strategies in  their local planning processes.     DOT is spearheading an effort to develop a collaborative dialogue  among a broad range of transportation stakeholders leading to a  consenus of the role of management and operations in transportation  decision-making. This dialogue would identify customer needs for  training and technical assistance. Support for integrated planning and  application of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) strategies,  including the role of ITS National Architecture, is another effort  supporting system management and operation.     (4) Next Steps: FTA and FHWA will be working over the coming months  to support further development of the added emphasis on System  Management and Operation and outline a comprehensive approach for  consideration and use by MPOs.  G. Federal Planning Certification Reviews      Federal certification of the planning process is conducted in a  Transportation Management Area (TMA), which is an urbanized area with a  population of 200,000 and above or other urbanized areas designated by  the Secretary of Transportation (the Secretary). The Secretary is  responsible for certifying, at least once every three years, that the  metropolitan transportation planning process in the TMA is being  carried out under applicable provisions of Federal law.     Dates for site visits for the TMAs to be reviewed in fiscal year  1999 are being established and will be available on the FTA Home Page  at http://www.fta.gov/office/planning.     For further information regarding Federal certifications of the  planning process contact: For FTA: Mr. Charles Goodman, FTA  Metropolitan Planning Division (TPL-12), 202-366-1944; or Scott Biehl,  FTA Office of Chief Counsel (TCC-30), 202-366-4063. For FHWA: Mr.  Sheldon Edner, FHWA Metropolitan Planning Division (HEP-20), 202-366- 4066; or Reid Alsop, FHWA Office of the Chief Counsel (HCC-31), 202- 366-1371.  H. Consolidated Planning Grant      In fiscal year 1997, FTA and FHWA began offering states the option  of participating in a pilot Consolidated Planning Grant (CPG) program.  Eleven states are participating in the pilot so far. Since the first  CPG grant was awarded in April 1997, more than $95,000,000 has been  obligated by the pilot states. Of this total, more than $69,700,000 is  from FHWA sources. Of the eleven participants, nine have completed at  least one full year under the pilot. Of the nine, two states have  elected to continue the pilot with new, separate CPG grants for the  second year. This approach treats the CPG much as FHWA funds are  treated currently; that is, as basically annual apportionments with a  yearly close-out of project activities and a deobligation and  reobligation cycle. Seven states have elected to amend the original CPG  grant to add new fiscal year funds to treat the CPG more like an FTA  grant, but with even greater flexibility. Under the multi-year approach  option, the CPG grant would stay open for a period of years to be  determined by the state (and MPO, jointly, for Metropolitan Planning  funds) with the approval of the Federal Government. New apportionments  can be added by grant amendment as funds become available. The ease  with which a state can opt for the single year or the multi-year  approach to the CPG grant speaks to the flexibility intended for the  program.     One of our original goals in developing the CPG Pilot was to give  states and MPOs more control over their planning resources with a  combination of broader financial controls and greater flexibility in  the management of their planning activities. After more than one full  year's experience under the pilot,  [[Page 60057]]  FTA's annual review of planning program fund balances and potential  lapsing funds revealed that none of the pilot states had funds in  danger of lapsing (under FTA's planning programs, funds that are  unobligated after four years' time lapse to the state). Further, only  two of the eleven pilot states have any FTA planning funds available  that were appropriated before fiscal year 1998. As in previous years,  pre-award authority is granted to both of FTA's planning programs as  part of this annual Notice. This pre-award authority enables states to  continue planning program activities from year to year with the  assurance that eligible costs can later be converted to a regularly  funded Federal project without the need for prior approval or  authorization from the granting agency.     This November, FTA will be providing an enhancement to its  electronic grant system (TEAM system) that can be used to request  planning grants, obligate funds, monitor fund balances and grant  status, and file financial and status reports for the CPG. While  benefiting all grants, these enhancements are particularly well suited  to the very streamlined funding request format of the CPG Pilot. As  part of the pilot, FTA will continue to work with participating states  to increase the flexibility and further streamline the consolidated  approach to planning grants. For further information on participating  in the CPG Pilot, contact Ms. Candace Noonan, Intermodal and Statewide  Planning Division, FTA, at (202) 366-1648 or Anthony Solury,  Metropolitan Planning Division, FHWA, at (202) 366-5003.  I. New Starts Evaluation and Criteria      TEA-21 includes several changes to the evaluation process and  criteria for New Starts fixed guideway projects. The Secretary shall  consider several additional criteria in the Department's review and  evaluation of candidate New Starts projects. FTA will be required to  evaluate each project authorized for New Starts funding by each  criterion, as well as provide an overall project rating of ``highly  recommended,'' ``recommended,'' and ``not recommended.'' In addition to  its annual report to Congress on Funding Levels and Allocations of  Funds for Transit Major Capital Investments, FTA will be required to  issue a supplemental report in August of each year which rates all  projects that have completed alternatives analysis and preliminary  engineering since the date of the last report. FTA must also approve  candidate New Starts project's entry into final design. FTA also  continues its prior approval authority for entrance into preliminary  engineering.     TEA-21 requires that no less than 92 percent of the annual New  Starts program must be used for final design and construction.     FTA will soon issue regulations implementing the New Starts  provision of TEA-21.  J. Metropolitan Transportation Improvement Programs (TIPs) and State  Transportation Improvement Programs (STIPs)      Both the TIPs and STIPs, major products of the metropolitan and  State transportation planning processes, continue to be required under  TEA-21 and 23 CFR part 450. TEA-21 has provided new authorization  levels as well as new programs for the FTA and FHWA. Development of 3- year TIPs and STIPs requires knowledge of Federal FTA and FHWA funding  amounts and sources. With respect to Federal funding sources,  ``available'' or ``committed'' funds identified in TIPs and STIPs are  to be taken to mean authorized and/or appropriated funds. Authorized  amounts for the purposes of TEA-21 include the total of guaranteed and  nonguaranteed funding. FTA and FHWA funding amounts and sources for the  six years of TEA-21 are provided by State and/or urbanized areas on the  Internet at the following locations: (1) FTA, http://www.fta.dot.gov/ library/policy/t21toc.htm and (2) FHWA, http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/tea21/ 98appor.htm.  K. Metropolitan Planning      TEA-21 retains much of the basic structure of the metropolitan and  statewide planning process, as established by ISTEA, with a few  significant changes. The set of sixteen metropolitan planning factors  has been reduced to seven factors: economic vitality; safety and  security; accessibility and mobility; environment, energy conservation  and quality of life; integration and connectivity; efficient operation  and management; and preservation of existing transportation resources.  Freight shippers and users of public transit are added to the explicit  set of stakeholders to be given opportunities to comment on  metropolitan plans and transportation improvement programs (TIPs).     Metropolitan planning organizations (MPOs) may include in their  TIPs an ``illustrative'' list of projects that could be implemented if  additional resources were made available. MPOs will also be encouraged  to coordinate the planning for Federally-funded non-emergency  transportation services as part of the metropolitan planning process.  FTA and FHWA will be revising the Joint Planning Regulations (23 CFR  part 450 and 49 CFR part 613) to formally incorporate changes to the  planning program.  VIII. Section 5307 Urbanized Area Formula Program  A. Total Urbanized Area Formula Apportionments      In addition to the appropriated fiscal year 1999 Urbanized Area  Formula funds of $2,548,190,791, the apportionment also includes  $5,055,703 in deobligated funds which have become available for  reapportionment for the Urbanized Area Formula Program as provided by  49 U.S.C. 5336(i).     Table 4 displays the amount apportioned for the Urbanized Area  Formula Program. After the one-half percent for oversight is set-aside  ($12,740,954), the amount appropriated for this program is  $2,543,135,088. The funds to be reapportioned, described in the  previous paragraph, have then been added. Thus, the total amount  apportioned for this program is $2,540,505,540.     An additional $4,849,950 is appropriated for the Alaska Railroad  for improvements to its passenger operations. After the one-half  percent for oversight is reserved ($24,250), $4,825,700 is available  for the Alaska Railroad.     Table 2 contains the fiscal years 1999-2003 apportionment formula  for the Section 5307 Urbanized Area Formula Program.  B. Data Used for Urbanized Area Formula Apportionments      Data from the 1997 NTD (49 U.S.C. 5335) Report Year submitted in  late 1997 and early 1998 have been used to calculate the fiscal year  1999 Urbanized Area Formula apportionments for urbanized areas 200,000  in population and over. The population and population density figures  used in calculating the Urbanized Area Formula are from the 1990  Census.  C. Adjustments for Energy and Operating Efficiencies      49 U.S.C. 5336(b)(2)(E) provides that, if a recipient of Urbanized  Area Formula Program funds demonstrates to the satisfaction of the  Secretary that energy or operating efficiencies would be achieved by  actions that reduce revenue vehicle miles but provide the same  frequency of revenue service to the same number of riders, the  recipient's apportionment under 49 U.S.C. 5336(b)(2)(A)(i) shall not be  reduced as  [[Page 60058]]  a result of such actions. One recipient has submitted data acceptable  to FTA in accordance with this provision. Accordingly, the revenue  vehicle miles used in the Urbanized Area Formula database to calculate  the fiscal year 1999 Urbanized Area Formula apportionment reflect the  amount the recipient would have received without the reductions in  mileage.  D. Urbanized Area Formula Fiscal Year 1999 Apportionments to Governors      The total Urbanized Area Formula apportionment to the Governor for  use in areas under 200,000 in population for each state is shown on  Table 4. Table 4 also contains the total apportionment amount  attributable to each of the urbanized areas within the state. The  Governor may determine the allocation of funds among the urbanized  areas under 200,000 in population with one exception. As further  discussed below in Section H, funds attributed to an urbanized area  under 200,000 in population, located within the planning boundaries of  a transportation management area, must be obligated in that area.  E. Transit Enhancements      For urbanized areas with populations 200,000 and over, TEA-21  established a minimum annual expenditure requirement of one percent for  transit projects and project elements that qualify as enhancements  under the Urbanized Area Formula Program. Table 4 indicates the amount  set aside for enhancements in these areas. The term ``transit  enhancement'' includes projects or project elements that are designed  to enhance mass transportation service or use and are physically or  functionally related to transit facilities.     (1) Eligible enhancements. Following are the transit projects and  project elements that may be counted to meet the minimum enhancement  expenditure requirement.     (a) Historic preservation, rehabilitation, and operation of  historic mass transportation buildings, structures, and facilities  (including historic bus and railroad facilities);     (b) Bus shelters;     (c) Landscaping and other scenic beautification, including tables,  benches, trash receptacles, and street lights;     (d) Public art;     (e) Pedestrian access and walkways;     (f) Bicycle access, including bicycle storage facilities and  installing equipment for transporting bicycles on mass transportation  vehicles;     (g) Transit connections to parks within the recipient's transit  service area;     (h) Signage; and     (i) Enhanced access for persons with disabilities to mass  transportation.     (2) Requirements. One percent of the Urbanized Area Formula Program  apportionment in each urbanized area with a population of 200,000 and  over must be made available only for transit enhancements. When there  are several grantees in an urbanized area, it is not required that each  grantee spend one percent of its Urbanized Area Formula Program funds  on transit enhancements. Rather, one percent of the urbanized area's  apportionment must be expended on projects and project elements that  qualify as enhancements. If these funds are not obligated for transit  enhancements within three years following the fiscal year in which the  funds are apportioned, the funds will lapse and no longer be available  to the urbanized area, and will be reapportioned under the Urbanized  Area Formula Program.     It will be the responsibility of the MPO to determine how the one  percent will be allotted to transit projects. The one percent minimum  requirement does not preclude more than one percent being expended in  an urbanized area for transit enhancements. Items that are only  eligible as enhancements, however--in particular, operating costs for  historic facilities--may only be assisted within the one percent fund  level.     (3) Project Budget. The project budget for each grant application  that includes enhancement funds must include a scope code for transit  enhancements and specific budget activity line items for transit  enhancements.     (4) Enhancement Report. The recipient must submit a report to the  appropriate FTA Regional Office listing the projects or elements of  projects carried out with those funds during the previous fiscal year  and the amount expended. The report must be submitted in the Federal  fiscal year's final quarterly report, using activity line item codes  from the approved project budget.     (5) Bicycle Access. TEA-21 provides that projects providing bicycle  access to transit assisted with the FTA enhancement apportionment shall  be eligible for a 95 percent Federal share.     (6) Enhanced Access for Persons with Disabilities. Enhancement  projects or elements of projects designed to enhance access for persons  with disabilities must go beyond the requirements contained in the  Americans with Disabilities Act.  F. Fiscal Year 1999 Operating Assistance      Fiscal year 1999 funding for operating assistance is available only  to urbanized areas with populations under 200,000. For these smaller  areas, there is no limitation on the amount of the state apportionment  that may be used for operating assistance, and the Federal/local share  ratio is 50/50. In addition, for all areas, many of the activities  formerly funded by FTA with operating assistance are now eligible  capital items under the category of preventive maintenance at the  Federal/local share ratio of 80/20. TEA-21 provides one exception to  the non-availability of funds for operating assistance to areas with  populations 200,000 and above. Operating assistance is available to any  urbanized area with a populations of 200,000 and above if the number of  total bus revenue vehicle miles operated in or directly serving the  area is under 900,000, and if the number of buses operated in or  directly serving the area does not exceed 15.     This provision is not available to small operators within a large  urbanized area in which the total number of vehicles that provide  service is more than 15 and the total number of bus revenue vehicle  miles operated in or directly servicing the area is 900,000 or more.     The Omnibus Appropriations Act amended Section 3027 of TEA-21  (which in turn amended 49 U.S.C. 5336 regarding use of operating  assistance in larger urbanized areas) to allow transit providers of  services to the elderly and disabled that operate 20 or fewer vehicles  and are located in urbanized areas with a population of at least  200,000 to use Federal funds to finance the operating costs of  equipment and facilities used by the transit provider in providing mass  transit services to elderly persons and persons with disabilities,  providing that such assistance to all entities should not exceed  $1,000,000,000 annually.  G. Carryover Funds for Operating Assistance      The operating assistance limitations remain on the unused fiscal  years 1996-1998 funds. These funds continue to be available for  obligation at the Federal/local share ratio of 50/50 in fiscal year  1999 and throughout the period of availability. For unused fiscal year  1998 funds for areas under 200,000, operating assistance as a capital  project with an 80 percent federal match ratio (without limitation)  will continue to be available in fiscal year 1999 and throughout the  period of availability.  [[Page 60059]]  H. Designated Transportation Management Areas      All urbanized areas over 200,000 in population have been designated  as transportation management areas (TMAs), in accordance with 49 U.S.C.  Section 5305. These designations were formally made in a Federal  Register Notice dated May 18, 1992 (57 FR 21160), signed by the Federal  Highway Administrator and the Federal Transit Administrator. Additional  areas may be designated as TMAs upon the request of the Governor and  the MPO designated for such area or the affected local officials. As of  October 1, 1998, two additional TMAs have been formally designated:  Petersburg, Virginia, comprised solely of the Petersburg, Virginia,  urbanized area; and Santa Barbara, Santa Maria, and Lompoc, California,  which were combined and designated as one TMA.     Guidance for setting the boundaries of TMAs is contained in the  joint transportation planning regulations codified at 23 CFR part 450  and 49 CFR part 613. In some cases, the TMA boundaries, which have been  established by the MPO for the designated TMA, also include one or more  urbanized areas with less than 200,000 in population. Where this  situation exists, the discretion of the Governor to allocate Urbanized  Area Formula program ``Governor's Apportionment'' funds for urbanized  areas with less than 200,000 in population is restricted.     As required by 49 U.S.C. 5307(a)(2), a recipient(s) must be  designated to dispense the Urbanized Area Formula funds attributable to  TMAs. Those urbanized areas that do not already have a designated  recipient must name one and notify the appropriate FTA regional office  of the designation. This would include those urbanized areas with less  than 200,000 in population that may receive TMA designation  independently, or those with less than 200,00 in population which are  currently included within the boundaries of a larger designated TMA. In  both cases, the Governor would only have discretion to allocate  Governor's Apportionment funds attributable to areas which are outside  of designated TMA boundaries. In order for the FTA and Governors to  know which urbanized areas under 200,000 in population are included  within the boundaries of an existing TMA, and so that they can be  identified in future Federal Register notices, each MPO whose TMA  planning boundaries include these smaller urbanized areas is asked to  identify such areas to the FTA. This notification should be made in  writing to the Associate Administrator for Program Management, Federal  Transit Administration, 400 Seventh Street, SW, Washington, DC 20590,  no later than July 1 of each fiscal year. To date, FTA has been  notified of the following urbanized areas with less than 200,000 in  population that are included within the planning boundaries of  designated TMAs:  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                                                 Small urbanized area included in                                 Designated TMA                                           TMA boundaries ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Baltimore, Maryland...........................................................

Urbanized Area Formula Funds Used for Highway Purposes      Urbanized Area Formula funds apportioned to a TMA are also  available for highway projects if the following three conditions are  met: (1) Such use must be approved by the MPO in writing after  appropriate notice and opportunity for comment and appeal are provided  to affected transit providers; (2) in the determination of the  Secretary, such funds are not needed for investments required by the  Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA); and (3) the MPO  determines that local transit needs are being addressed.     Urbanized Area Formula funds which are designated for highway  projects will be transferred to and administered by the FHWA. The MPO  should notify FTA of its intent to program FTA funds for highway  purposes.  IX. Section 5311 Nonurbanized Area Formula Program and Section  5311(b) Rural Transit Assistance Program (RTAP)  A. Nonurbanized Area Formula Program      The fiscal year 1999 Nonurbanized Area Formula apportionments to  the states totaling $177,856,722 are displayed in Table 5. Of the  $177,923,658 appropriated, one-half percent ($889,618) was reserved for  oversight. In addition to the current appropriation, the funds  available for apportionment included $822,682 in deobligated funds from  fiscal years prior to 1999.     The population figures used in calculating these apportionments are  from the 1990 Census.     The Nonurbanized Formula Program provides capital, operating and  administrative assistance for areas under 50,000 in population. Each  state must spend no less than 15 percent of its fiscal year 1999  Nonurbanized Area Formula apportionment for the development and support  of intercity bus transportation, unless the Governor certifies to the  Secretary that the intercity bus service needs of the state are being  adequately met. Fiscal year 1999 Nonurbanized Area Formula grant  applications must reflect this level of programming for intercity bus  or include a certification from the Governor.     Funding for the Nonurbanized Area Formula Program is significantly  higher under TEA-21 than it was under the Intermodal Surface  Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 (ISTEA). FTA encourages the  states to use the increase to begin to expand the coverage of transit  service into rural and small urban areas currently unserved and to  improve levels of service in those areas which currently have only  minimal transit service.  B. Rural Transit Assistance Program (RTAP)      The fiscal year 1999 RTAP allocations to the states totaling  $5,401,831 are also displayed on Table 5. This amount includes  $5,250,000 in fiscal year 1999 appropriated funds, and $151,831 in  [[Page 60060]]  prior year deobligated funds, which have become available for  reallocation for this program.     The funds are allocated to the states to undertake research,  training, technical assistance, and other support services to meet the  needs of transit operators in nonurbanized areas. These funds are to be  used in conjunction with the states' administration of the Nonurbanized  Area Formula Program.     Effective with fiscal year 1999, FTA has revised the administrative  formula used to allocate RTAP funds to the states, by increasing the  minimum allocation each state receives from $50,000 to $65,000. The  minimum allocation for the insular areas remains at $10,000. The effect  of this change is to distribute the increase in RTAP funds more  equitably to the smaller states, to enable them to continue to provide  effective RTAP services. Due to the increase in program funding, no  state receives an allocation in fiscal year 1999 that is less than in  fiscal year 1998.  X. Section 5310 Elderly and Persons with Disabilities Program      A total of $67,136,222 is apportioned to the states for fiscal year  1999 for the Elderly and Persons with Disabilities Program. In addition  to the fiscal year 1999 appropriation of $67,035,601, the fiscal year  1999 apportionment also includes $100,621 in prior year unobligated  funds which have become available for reapportionment for the Elderly  and Persons with Disabilities Program. Table 6 shows each state's  apportionment.     The formula for apportioning these funds uses 1990 Census  population data for persons aged 65 and over and for persons with  disabilities.     The funds provide capital assistance for transportation for elderly  persons and persons with disabilities. Eligible capital expenses may  include, at the option of the recipient, the acquisition of  transportation services by a contract, lease, or other arrangement.     While the assistance is intended primarily for private non-profit  organizations, public bodies that coordinate services for the elderly  and persons with disabilities, or any public body that certifies to the  state that non-profit organizations in the area are not readily  available to carry out the service, may receive these funds.     These funds may be transferred by the Governor to supplement the  Urbanized Area Formula or Nonurbanized Area formula capital funds  during the last 90 days of the fiscal year.  XI. Surface Transportation Program Flexible Funds Used for Transit  Purposes (Title 23, U.S.C.)  A. Transfer Process      TEA-21 made changes in how funds are to be transferred from FHWA to  FTA. Under ISTEA, obligation authority was not transferred to and from  FTA. TEA-21 provides that obligation authority will be transferred to  and from FHWA to FTA. In order to accommodate this change, FHWA and FTA  are revising internal transfer procedures. The external process from  transferring funds may also be revised. Until these revised procedures  are developed, the two agencies have agreed to use the transfer process  that was established under ISTEA which is described below.     Flexible DOT funds, such as Surface Transportation Program (STP)  funds, Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality (CMAQ) funds, or others,  which are designated for use in transit projects, are transferred from  the FHWA to FTA after which FTA approves the project and awards a  grant. Flexible funds designated for transit projects must result from  the metropolitan and state planning and programming process, and must  be included in an approved State Transportation Improvement Program  (STIP) before the funds can be transferred. In order to initiate the  transfer process, the grantee must submit a completed application to  the FTA Regional Office, and must notify the state highway/ transportation agency that it has submitted an application which  requires a transfer of funds. Once the state highway/transportation  agency determines that the state has sufficient obligation authority,  the state agency notifies the FHWA Division Office that the funds are  to be used for transit purposes. FHWA then notifies the FTA of the  transfer project for processing and obligation. The flexible funds  transferred to FTA will be placed in an urbanized area or state account  for one of the three existing formula programs--Urbanized Area,  Nonurbanized Area, or Elderly and Persons with Disabilities.     The flexible funds are then treated as FTA formula funds, although  they retain a special identifying code. They may be used for any  purpose eligible under these FTA programs. All FTA requirements are  applicable to transferred funds. Flexible funds should be combined with  regular FTA formula funds in a single annual grant application.  B. Matching Share for Flexible Funds      The provisions of Title 23, U.S.C. regarding the non-Federal share  apply to Title 23 funds used for transit projects. Thus, flexible funds  transferred to FTA retain the same matching share that the funds would  have if used for highway purposes and administered by the FHWA.     There are three instances in which a higher than 80 percent Federal  share would be maintained. First, in states with large areas of Indian  and certain public domain lands, and national forests, parks and  monuments, the local share for highway projects is determined by a  sliding scale rate, calculated based on the percentage of public lands  within that state. This sliding scale, which permits a greater Federal  share, but not to exceed 95 percent, is applicable to transit projects  funded with flexible funds in these public land states. FHWA develops  the sliding scale matching ratios for the increased Federal share.     Secondly, commuter carpooling and vanpooling projects and transit  safety projects using flexible funds administered by FTA may retain the  same 100 percent Federal share that would be allowed for ride-sharing  or safety projects administered by the FHWA. The third instance  includes the 100 percent Federal safety projects; however, these are  subject to a nationwide 10 percent program limitation.  C. Other Funds Transferred to FTA      Certain demonstration projects authorized in title 23 are specified  to be used for transit projects and are more appropriately administered  by FTA. In such cases, FHWA has transferred the funds to FTA for  administration. Since these funds are not STP flexible funds, they are  transferred into the appropriate Capital Program category (Bus, New  Starts, or fixed Guideway Modernization) for obligation and are  administered as Capital projects.  XII. Section 5309 Capital Program  A. Fixed Guideway Modernization      TEA-21 modified the formula for allocating the Fixed Guideway  Modernization funds. The new formula contains seven tiers. The  allocation of funding under the first four tiers, through fiscal year  2003, will be allocated based on data used to apportion the funding in  fiscal year 1997. Funding in the three new tiers will be apportioned  based on the latest available route miles and revenue vehicle miles on  segments at least seven years old as reported to the National Transit  Database.     Table 7 displays the fiscal year 1999 Fixed Guideway Modernization  apportionments. Fixed Guideway  [[Page 60061]]  Modernization funds apportioned for this section must be used for  capital projects to maintain, modernize, or improve fixed guideway  systems.     All urbanized areas with fixed guideway systems that are at least  seven years old are eligible to receive Fixed Guideway Modernization  funds. A request for the start-up service dates for fixed guideways has  been incorporated into the National Transit Database reporting system  to ensure that all eligible fixed guideway data is included in the  calculation of these apportionments. A threshold level of more than one  mile of fixed guideway is required to receive Fixed Guideway  Modernization funds. Therefore, urbanized areas reported one mile or  less of Fixed Guideway mileage under the National Transit Database are  not included.     For fiscal year 1999, $902,800,000 was appropriated for fixed  guideway modernization. After deducting the three-fourth percent for  Oversight ($6,771,000), $896,029,000 is available for apportionment to  the specified urbanized areas.     Each year, the new fixed guideway modernization formula will  allocate funds by seven tiers as follows: Tier 1     The first $497,700,000 shall be apportioned to the following  urbanized areas as follows: Baltimore $8,372,000; Boston $38,948,000;  Chicago/Northwestern Indiana $78,169,000; Cleveland $9,509,500; New  Orleans $1,730,588; New York $176,034,461; Northeastern New Jersey  $50,604,653; Philadelphia/Southern New Jersey $58,924,764; Pittsburgh  $13,662,463; San Francisco $33,989,571; Southwestern Connecticut  $27,755,000. Tier 2     The next $70,000,000 shall be apportioned as follows: 50 percent to  areas identified in Tier I and 50 percent to other urbanized areas with  fixed guideway segments which have been in operation at least seven  years. These funds are apportioned using the Urbanized Area Formula  Program fixed guideway tier formula factors that were used to apportion  funds for the Fixed Guideway Modernization Program in fiscal year 1997. Tier 3     The next $5,700,000 shall be apportioned to the following urbanized  areas as follows: Pittsburgh, 61.76 percent; Cleveland, 10.73 percent;  New Orleans, 5.79 percent; the remaining 21.72 percent is apportioned  to all other cities using the same fixed guideway tier data used for  Tier II. Tier 4     The next $186,600,000 shall be apportioned to all eligible areas  using the same year fixed guideway tier data that was used for Tiers II  and III. Tier 5     The next $70,000,000 shall be apportioned as follows: 65 percent to  the eleven areas specified in Tier I, and 35 percent to other urbanized  areas with fixed guideway system segments in revenue service for at  least seven years. Allocations will be based on the latest available  route miles and revenue vehicle miles for fixed guideway segments at  least seven years old as reported to the National Transit Database. Tier 6     The next $50,000,000 shall be apportioned as follows: 60 percent to  the eleven areas specified in Tier I, and 40 percent to the other  urbanized areas with fixed guideway system segments in revenue service  for at least seven years. Allocations will be based on the latest  available route miles and revenue vehicle miles for fixed guideway  segments at least seven years old as reported to the National Transit  Database. Tier 7     Any remaining amounts shall be apportioned as follows: 50 percent  to the eleven urbanized areas specified in Tier I, and 50 percent to  the other urbanized areas with fixed guideway system segments in  revenue service for at least seven years. Allocations will be based on  the latest available route miles and revenue vehicle miles for fixed  guideway segments at least seven years old as reported to the National  Transit Database.     Table 12 contains the fiscal years 1998-2003 apportionment formula  for the Section 5309 Fixed Guideway Modernization Program.  B. New Starts      The fiscal year 1999 appropriation for New Starts is $902,800,000  which was fully allocated in the fiscal year 1999 DOT Appropriations  Act. However, by statute, this amount is reduced by three-fourth  percent ($6,771,000) for Oversight activities, leaving $896,029,000  available for allocations to areas. The Oversight reduction was applied  on a prorata basis to all 95 projects specified in the fiscal year 1999  Omnibus Appropriations Act yielding the final allocation for each of  these projects (contain in Table 8 of this Federal Register Notice).     Prior year unobligated appropriations for New Starts in the amount  of $430,856,230 remain available for obligation in fiscal year 1999.  These carryover amounts are displayed in Table 8A, along with  explanatory notes.     Since New Starts funds are used for design and construction of new  systems or extensions to existing systems, preventive maintenance is  not an eligible cost under this program.  C. Bus      The fiscal year 1999 appropriation for Bus is $451,400,000 for the  purchase of buses, bus-related equipment and paratransit vehicles, and  for the construction of bus-related facilities. TEA-21 established a  $100,000,000 Clean Fuels Formula Program under Section 5308. The  program is authorized to be funded with $50,000,000 from the Bus  category of the Capital Program, and $50,000,000 from the Formula  Program. However, the fiscal year 1999 Omnibus Appropriations Act  directs FTA to transfer $50,000,000 Appropriated under the Formula  Program to and merge it with funding provided for the Bus category of  the Capital Program. Thus, $501,400,000 is available for funding the  Bus category of the Capital Program. After deducting the three-fourth  percent for oversight ($3,760,500), $497,639,500 remains available for  projects.     The 1999 Omnibus Appropriations Act earmarked all of the fiscal  year 1999 Bus funds to specified states or localities for bus and bus- related projects.     Because the three-fourth percent for oversight was subtracted from  the amount appropriated, each bus project identified in the Conference  Report receives three-fourth percent less than the funding level  contained in the report. No funds remain available for discretionary  allocation by the Federal Transit Administrator. Table 9 displays the  allocations of the fiscal year 1999 Bus funds by area and also shows  prior year unobligated earmarks for the Bus Program. The fiscal year  1999 bus allocations include the funding which would have been  available for the Clean Fuels Formula Program under TEA-21.     Prior year unobligated appropriations for Bus in the amount of  $379,813,842 remain available for obligation in fiscal year 1999, and  are displayed in Table 9A.  [[Page 60062]]  XIII. New Programs  A. Section 5308 Clean Fuels Formula Program      TEA-21 established a $100,000,000 Clean Fuels Formula Program under  Section 5308, to be funded with $50,000,000 from the Bus category of  the Capital Program, and $50,000,000 from the Formula Program. However,  the fiscal year 1999 Omnibus Appropriations Act transfers $50,000,000  appropriated under the Formula Program to and merges it with funding  provided for the replacement, rehabilitation and purchase of buses and  related equipment and the construction of bus related facilities under  the Bus category of the Capital Program. In addition, in fiscal year  1999 Congress allocated the entire Bus category, including the  $100,000,000, which TEA-21 provides for funding of the Clean Fuels  Formula Program. These appropriation actions override the provisions  established in TEA-21 for the Clean Fuels Formula Program. Therefore,  FTA cannot implement this new program. A rulemaking to implement the  Clean Fuels Formula program is being developed for use in fiscal year  2000. The fiscal year 1999 Bus Allocations on Table 9 include the  funding which would have been available for the Clean Fuels Formula  Program under TEA-21.  B. Over-the-Road Bus Accessibility Program      The Over-the-Road Bus Accessibility Program (OTRB) authorizes FTA  to make grants to operators of over-the-road buses to finance the  incremental capital and training costs of complying with the DOT over- the-road bus accessibility final rule, published on September 24, 1998.  The legislation calls for national solicitation of applications, with  grantees to be selected on a competitive basis. Federal funds are  available for up to 50 percent of the project cost. A total of  $2,000,000 is apportioned for intercity fixed route operators in fiscal  year 1999.     FTA is exploring two approaches for implementation of the capital  portion of the program. One approach would be to enter into a  cooperative agreement with an intermediate entity which represents the  over-the-road bus industry. This entity would serve as the funding  distribution mechanism. This approach has the merit of consolidating  numerous small grants and would allow a group familiar with the over- the-road bus industry to carry out the program. The entity would accept  and review grant applications and make recommendations for funding  based on the criteria in TEA-21 and in coordination with FTA and enter  into agreements with over-the-road bus providers. The entity would also  pass on all Federal requirements to the over-the-road bus operators.  TEA-21 provides that all Federal requirements applicable to the Section  5311 Nonurbanized Area Formula Program are applicable to the Over-the- Road Bus Program. Federal requirements include but are not limited to  competitive procurement, labor protections, Buy America, and civil  rights requirements.     Alternately, FTA may implement the program with individual grants  to over-the-road bus operators. With this approach, there would be a  national solicitation of applications and FTA would review applications  against the criteria in TEA-21 and make recommendations for funding.  The appropriate FTA regional office would review the application and  approve the grant.     In addition, FTA is proposing to enter into an agreement with a  single agency which represents the disability community to take the  lead on a national training initiative.     FTA will issue further guidance and application instructions for  this program.  C. Job Access and Reverse Commute Program      A total of $75,000,000 is appropriated for the Job Access and  Reverse Commute Program in fiscal year 1999. Of this amount,  $50,000,000 is guaranteed under the discretionary spending cap and  $25,000,000 was made available from other discretionary spending  offsets. This program, established under TEA-21, provides funding for  the provision of transportation services designed to increase access to  jobs and employment-related activities. Job Access projects are those  which transport welfare recipients and low-income individuals in urban,  suburban, or rural areas to and from jobs and activities related to  their employment. Reverse Commute projects provide transportation  services for the general public from urban, suburban, and rural areas  to suburban employment opportunities.     One of the major goals of the Job Access and Reverse Commute  program is to increase collaboration among transportation providers,  human service agencies, employers, metropolitan planning organizations,  states, and affected communities and individuals. All projects funded  under this program must be derived from a regional Job Access and  Reverse Commute Transportation Plan, developed through a regional  approach which supports the implementation of a variety of  transportation services designed to connect welfare recipients to jobs  and related activities. A key element of the program is making the most  efficient use of existing public, nonprofit and private transportation  service providers.     A Federal Register Notice will be published by the end of October  which will provide program guidance and application procedures. The  notice will also be available on the FTA website.  D. Transportation and Community and System Preservation Pilot Program  (TCSP)      Section 1221 of TEA-21 established a pilot program that will enable  grantees to plan or implement activities that investigate and address  the relationship between transportation and community and system  preservation. Eligible grantees are State agencies, metropolitan  planning organizations (MPOs) and units of local governments, including  public transit agencies. TCSP will provide $20,000,000 in fiscal year  1999 and $25,000,000 per year for fiscal years 2000 through 2003 for  planning and implementation grants, as well as research, which address  transportation efficiency while meeting community preservation and  environmental goals.     TCSP activities must be eligible under Title 23 (the Federal  highway program) of Chapter 52 of Title 49 (the Federal transit  program) of the United States Code, or must be activities which the  Secretary of Transportation determines to be appropriate. TCSP  discretionary grants will be used to plan and implement strategies  which (1) improve the efficiency of the transportation system; (2)  reduce the impacts of transportation on the environment; (3) reduce the  need for costly future public infrastructure; (4) ensure efficient  access to jobs, services and centers of trade, and (5) encourage  private sector development patterns which achieve these goals. Grants  will be directed to new and innovative activities that are eligible but  under the current Federal-aid program. TCSP activities must be  coordinated with the MPO and/or state transportation planning  processes.     The FHWA is administering this program and has established an  interagency working group, which includes the FTA, to design and  implement TCSP. On September 16, 1998, a Federal Register Notice  requested comments within 60 days on TCSP implementation in fiscal year  2000 and beyond. The Notice also requested that eligible entities  interested in applying for fiscal year 1999 planning and implementation  grants should  [[Page 60063]]  submit letters of intent within 60 days. The DOT expects to select  about 50 letters of intent to be developed into full proposals, and to  fund 20 to 30 planning and implementation grants in fiscal year 1999.  TCSP research activities will begin in fiscal year 2000. The voice mail  for information on TCSP is (800) 488-6034.  XIV. Unit Values of Data for the Section 5307 Urbanized Area  Formula Program, Section 5311 Nonurbanized Area Formula Program,  and Section 5309 Capital Fixed Guideway Modernization      For technical assistance purposes, the dollar unit values of data  derived from the computations of the Urbanized Area Formula Program,  the Nonurbanized Area Formula Program, and the Capital Program--Fixed  Guideway Modernization apportionments are included in this Notice in  Table 13. To determine how a particular apportionment amount was  developed, areas may multiply their population, population density, and  data from the NTD by these unit values.  XV. Period of Availability of Funds      The funds apportioned under the Metropolitan Planning Program and  the State Planning and Research Program, the Urbanized Area Formula  Program, and the Fixed Guideway Modernization Program, in this notice,  will remain available to be obligated by FTA to recipients for three  fiscal years following fiscal year 1999. Any of these apportioned funds  unobligated at the close of business on September 30, 2002 will revert  to FTA for reapportionment under these respective programs.     Funds apportioned to nonurbanized areas under the Nonurbanized Area  Formula Program, including RTAP funds, will remain available for two  fiscal years following fiscal year 1999. Any such funds remaining  unobligated at the close of business on September 30, 2001, will revert  to FTA for reapportionment among the states under the Nonurbanized Area  Formula Program. Funds allocated to States under the Elderly and  Persons with Disabilities Program in this Notice must be obligated by  September 30, 1999. Any such funds remaining unobligated as of this  date will revert to FTA for reapportionment among the states under the  Elderly and Persons with Disabilities Program. The fiscal year 1999  Omnibus Appropriations Act includes a provision requiring that fiscal  year 1999 New Starts and Bus funds not obligated for their original  purpose as of September 30, 2001, shall be made available for other  discretionary projects within the respective categories of the Capital  Program. Similar provisions in the 1998 and 1997 DOT Appropriations  Acts required that fiscal year 1998 Bus and New Starts funds that are  not obligated by September 30, 2000 also be made available for other  discretionary Bus or New Starts projects, respectively; and fiscal year  1997 Bus and New Starts funds unobligated by September 30, 1999 shall  be made available for other discretionary Bus or New Starts projects,  respectively.  XVI. Automatic Pre-Award Authority to Incur Project Cost  A. Background      Since fiscal year 1994, FTA has provided pre-award authority to  cover certain planning and capital costs prior to grant award. This  automatic pre-award spending authority permits a grantee to incur costs  on an eligible transit capital or planning project without prejudice to  possible future Federal participation in the cost of the project or  projects. Prior to exercising pre-award authority, grantees must comply  with the conditions and environmental planning and other Federal  requirements outlined in paragraphs B and C immediately below. Failure  to do so will render an otherwise eligible project ineligible for FTA  financial assistance. In addition, grantees are strongly encouraged to  consult with the appropriate regional office if there could be any  question regarding the eligibility of the project for future FTA funds  or the applicability of the conditions and Federal requirements.     Authority to incur costs for fiscal year 1998 Fixed Guideway  Modernization, Metropolitan Planning, Urbanized Area Formula, Elderly  and Persons with Disabilities, Nonurbanized Area Formula, STP or CMAQ  flexible funds to be transferred from the FHWA and State Planning and  Research Programs in advance of possible future Federal participation  was provided in the December 5, 1997, Federal Register Notice. Pre- award authority was extended in the June 24, 1998 Federal Register  Notice on TEA-21 to all formula funds and flexible funds that will be  apportioned during the authorization period of TEA-21, 1998-2003. Pre- award authority also applies to Capital Bus funds identified in this  notice. Pre-award authority does not apply to Capital New Start funds,  or to Capital Bus projects not specified in this or previous notices.  Pre-award authority also applies to preventive maintenance costs  incurred within a local fiscal year ending during calendar year 1997,  or thereafter, under the formula programs cited above.  B. Conditions      Similar to the FTA Letter of No Prejudice (LONP) authority, the  conditions under which this authority may be utilized are specified  below:     (1) This pre-award authority is not a legal or moral commitment  that the project(s) will be approved for FTA assistance or that FTA  will obligate Federal funds. Furthermore, it is not a legal or moral  commitment that all items undertaken by the applicant will be eligible  for inclusion in the project(s).     (2) All FTA statutory, procedural, and contractual requirements  must be met at the appropriate time.     (3) No action will be taken by the grantee that prejudices the  legal and administrative findings which the Federal Transit  Administrator must make in order to approve a project.     (4) Local funds expended by the grantee pursuant to and after the  date of this authority will be eligible for credit toward local match  or reimbursement if FTA later makes a grant for the project(s) or  project amendment(s).     (5) The Federal amount of any future FTA assistance to the grantee  for the project will be determined on the basis of the overall scope of  activities and the prevailing statutory provisions with respect to the  Federal/local match ratio at the time the funds are obligated.     (6) For funds to which this authority applies, the authority  expires with the lapsing of the fiscal year funds.  C. Environmental, Planning, and Other Federal Requirements      FTA emphasizes that all of the Federal grant requirements must be  met for the project to remain eligible for Federal funding. Some of  these requirements must be met before pre-award costs are incurred,  notably the requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act  (NEPA), and the planning requirements. Compliance with NEPA and other  environmental laws or executive orders (e.g., protection of parklands,  wetlands, historic properties) must be completed before state or local  funds are spent on implementing activities such as final design,  construction, and acquisition for a project that is expected to be  subsequently funded with FTA funds. Depending on which class the  project is included under in FTA environmental regulations (23 CFR part  771), the grantee may not advance the project beyond planning and  preliminary engineering before FTA has approved either a categorical  exclusion (refer to 23 CFR part 771.117(d)), a finding of no  [[Page 60064]]  significant impact, or a final environmental impact statement. The  conformity requirements of the Clean Air Act (40 CFR part 93) also must  be fully met before the project may be advanced with non-Federal funds.     Similiarly, the requirement that a project be included in a locally  adopted metropolitan transportation improvement program and federally  approved statewide transportation improvement program must be followed  before the project may be advanced with non-Federal funds. In addition,  Federal procurement procedures, as well as the whole range of Federal  requirements, must be followed for projects in which Federal funding  will be sought in the future. Failure to follow any such requirements  could make the project ineligible for Federal funding. In short, this  increased administrative flexibility requires a grantee to make certain  that no Federal requirements are circumvented through the use of pre- award authority. If a grantee has questions or concerns regarding the  environmental requirements, or any other Federal requirements that must  be met before incurring costs, it should contact the appropriate  regional office.     Before an applicant may incur costs either for activities expected  to be funded by New Start funds, or for Bus Capital projects not listed  in this notice or previous notices, it must first obtain a written LONP  from FTA. To obtain an LONP, a grantee must submit a written request  accompanied by adequate information and justification to the  appropriate FTA regional office.  XVII. Letter of No Prejudice Policy (Prior Approval of Pre-Award  Authority)  A. Policy      The latest guidance on Letters of No Prejudice (LONP) policy and  procedures is contained in an October 21, 1982 Federal Register Notice.  Since the issuance of that notice in 1982 there have been many changes  to the FTA program including automatic pre-award authority for formula  funds, flexible funds transferred from the FHWA and for bus earmarks.  The 1982 policy was based on the philosophy that LONPs would only be  issued under the most extenuating circumstances. With substantial  experience with automatic pre-award authority, this philosophy is no  longer an accurate reflection of FTA policy. This Federal Register  Notice supersedes the Letter of No Prejudice (LONP) policy issued  October 21, 1982.     LONP authority allows an applicant to incur costs on a future  project utilizing non-Federal resources with the understanding that the  costs incurred subsequent to the issuance of the LONP may be  reimbursable as eligible expenses or eligible for credit toward the  local match should the FTA approve the project at a later date. LONPs  are applicable to projects not covered by automatic pre-award  authority. The majority of LONPs will be for New Starts not covered  under a full funding grant agreement or for Section 5309 bus funds not  yet appropriated by Congress. At the end of an authorization period,  there may be LONPs for formula funds beyond the life of the current  authorization.     Under most circumstances the LONP will cover the total project.  Under certain circumstances the LONP may be issued for local match  only. In such cases the local match would be to permit real estate to  be used for match for the project at a later date.  B. Conditions      The following conditions apply to all LONPs.     (1) LONP pre-award authority is not a legal or moral commitment  that the project(s) will be approved for FTA assistance or that FTA  will obligate Federal funds. Furthermore, it is not a legal or moral  commitment that all items undertaken by the applicant will be eligible  for inclusion in the project(s).     (2) All FTA statutory, procedural, and contractual requirements  must be met.     (3) No action will be taken by the grantee that prejudices the  legal and administrative findings which the Federal Transit  Administrator must make in order to approve a project.     (4) Local funds expended by the grantee pursuant to and after the  date of the LONP will be eligible for credit toward local match or  reimbursement if FTA later makes a grant for the project(s) or project  amendment(s).     (5) The Federal amount of any future FTA assistance to the grantee  for the project will be determined on the basis of the overall scope of  activities and the prevailing statutory provisions with respect to the  Federal/local match ratio at the time the funds are obligated.     (6) For funds to which this pre-award authority applies, the  authority expires with the lapsing of the fiscal year funds.  C. Environmental, Planning, and Other Federal Requirements      As with automatic pre-award authority, FTA emphasizes that all of  the Federal grant requirements must be met for the project to remain  eligible for Federal funding. Some of these requirements must be met  before pre-award costs are incurred, notably the requirements of the  National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), and the planning  requirements. Compliance with NEPA and other environmental laws or  executive orders (e.g., protection of parklands, wetlands, historic  properties) must be completed before state or local funds are spent on  implementation activities such as final design, construction, or  acquisition for a project expected to be subsequently funded with FTA  funds. Depending on which class the project is included under in FTA's  environmental regulations (23 CFR part 771), the grantee may not  advance the project beyond planning and preliminary engineering before  FTA has approved either a categorical exclusion (refer to 23 CFR part  771.117(d)), a finding of no significant impact, or a final  environmental impact statement. The conformity requirements of the  Clean Air Act (40 CFR part 93) also must be fully met before the  project may be advanced with non-Federal funds.     Similarly, the requirement that a project be included in a locally  adopted metropolitan transportation improvement program and federally  approved statewide transportation improvement program must be followed  before the project may be advanced with non-Federal funds. In addition,  Federal procurement procedures, as well as the whole range of Federal  requirements, must be followed for projects in which Federal funding  will be sought in the future. Failure to follow any such requirements  could make the project ineligible for Federal funding. In short, this  pre-award authority requires a grantee to make certain that no Federal  requirements are circumvented. If a grantee has questions or concerns  regarding the environmental requirements, or any other Federal  requirements that must be met before incurring costs, it should contact  the appropriate regional office.  D. Request for LONP      Before an applicant may incur costs for a project not covered by  automatic pre-award authority, it must first submit a written request  for an LONP to the appropriate regional office. This written request  must include a description of the project for which pre-award authority  is desired and a justification for the request.  XVIII. State Infrastructure Banks      The State Infrastructure Bank (SIB) pilot program was authorized in  the National Highway System Designation Act of 1995. It allows the  creation of state-level institutions that can use Federal Highway  Administration (FHWA) and FTA funds to make loans  [[Page 60065]]  and loan guarantees (and other forms of credit enhancement) to transit  and highway projects. The SIBs may earn interest on deposits of Federal  funds, and they may charge below-market interest rates on long-term  loans.     While 31 states established SIBs under the NHS Act authorizations,  TEA-21 only renewed this authority to four states--California, Florida,  Missouri, and Rhode Island. Thus, the original SIBs may continue to  function with funds appropriated for their use in 1996 and 1997, but  only the four SIBs authorized in TEA-21 will be allowed to use fiscal  year 1998 and subsequent year grant funds for capitalization. These  states may use up to 100 percent of their highway or transit formula  funds for capitalization, but there are no additional funds apportioned  specifically to SIBs. TEA-21 also allowed the four authorized SIBs to  use any Federal capital funds to make loans to highway, transit, and  rail projects--a significant increase in flexibility.  XIX. FTA Home Page on the Internet      FTA provides extended customer service by making available transit  information on the FTA Home Page web site, including this Apportionment  Notice. Also posted on the web site are FTA program circulars:  C9030.1C, Urbanized Area Formula Program: Grant Application  Instructions, dated October 1, 1998; C9040.1E, Nonurbanized Area  Formula Program Guidance and Grant Application Instructions, dated  October 1, 1998; C9070.1E, Elderly and Persons with Disabilities  Program Guidance and Application Instructions, dated October 1, 1998;  C9300.1A, Capital Program: Grant Application Instructions, dated  October 1, 1998; 4220.1D, Third Party Contracting Requirements, dated  April 15, 1996; C5010.1C, Grant Management Guidelines, dated October 1,  1998; and C8100.1B, Program Guidance and Application Instructions for  Metropolitan Planning Program Grants, dated October 25, 1996. The  fiscal year 1999 Annual List of Certifications and Assurances is also  posted on the FTA web site. Other documents on the FTA web site of  particular interest to public transit providers and users include the  1997 Statistical Summaries of FTA Grant Assistance Programs, and the  National Transit Database Profiles.     The FTA Home Page may be accessed at: http://www.fta.dot.gov. FTA  circulars and other guidance are at: http://www.fta.dot.gov/program.     Grantees should check our web site frequently to keep up to date on  new postings.  XX. 1999 Annual List of Certifications and Assurances      The Fiscal Year 1999 Annual List of Certifications and Assurances  is published in conjunction with the Apportionments, as per 49 U.S.C.  section 5307(k). It appears as a separate Part of the Federal Register  on the same date whenever possible. The 1999 list contains several  changes to the previous year's Federal Register publication. (1) All  applicants for FTA Capital Program or Formula Program assistance, and  current grantees with an active project financed with FTA Capital  Program or Formula Program assistance, will be required to provide the  Appendix A Certifications and Assurances within 90 days from the date  of the above Federal Register publication or with its first grant  application in fiscal year 1999, whichever comes first. (2) The  attorney signature from previous years on the single signature page is  not acceptable. A current attorney's affirmation is required to certify  applicant's legal authority to comply with fiscal year 1999 FTA funding  assistance. (3) As in previous years, the grant applicant should (when  possible) certify electronically, indicating that a current attorney's  signature is on file. (4) The applicant is advised that Transit  Enhancement activities (49 U.S.C. 5307(k)) require an annual report  listing projects carried out during the previous year.     The fiscal year 1999 Annual List of Certifications and Assurances  is accessible on the Internet at www.fta.dot.gov. Any questions  regarding this document may be addressed to the appropriate Regional  Office or to Pat Berkley, Office of Program Management, Federal Transit  Administration, (202) 366-6470.  XXI. Grant Application Procedures      All applications for FTA funds should be submitted to the  appropriate FTA Regional Office. As described in Section V, FTA is  expecting that most applications will be  filed  electronically in FY  1999 using the new TEAM system. Formula grant applications should be  prepared in conformance with the following FTA Circulars: Program  Guidance and Application Instructions for Metropolitan Planning Program  Grants--C8100.1B, October 25, 1996; Urbanized Area Formula Program:  Grant Application Instructions--C9030.1C, October 1, 1998; Nonurbanized  Area Formula Program Guidance and Grant Application Instructions-- C9040.1E, October 1, 1998; Section 5310 Elderly and Persons with  Disabilities Program Guidance and Application Instructions C9070.1E,  October 1, 1998; and Section 5309 Capital Program: Grant Application  Instructions--C9300.1A, October 1, 1998. Applications for STP  ``flexible'' fund grants should be prepared in the same manner as the  apportioned funds under the Urbanized Area Formula, Nonurbanized Area  Formula, or Elderly and Persons with Disabilities Programs. Guidance on  preparation of applications for State Planning and Research funds may  be obtained from each FTA Regional Office. Copies of circulars are  available from FTA Regional Offices as well as the FTA Home Page on the  Internet.      Issued on: October 29, 1998. Gordon J. Linton, Administrator.

GX268-13-15252176	"3745-31-29  General permit to install.  (A) Development of model general permits The director may develop a model general permit for any category of air contamination sources, or specific portions of any category of air contamination sources, subject to the following conditions: (1) A model general permit shall apply to: (a) Processes producing the same or similar products; (b) Processes emitting the same or similar air contaminants; (c) Methods for capturing and controlling the air contaminants that are the same or limited to a small number of specific alternatives; and (d) Processes that are subject to the same emission limitations, monitoring requirements, federal standards, or state rules. (2) A model general permit shall identify criteria by which an air contaminant source(s) may qualify for the associated general permit and shall include terms and conditions under which the owner or operator agrees to install and/or operate the permitted air contaminant source(s). At a minimum, these terms and conditions shall include: (a) Applicable emissions limitations and/or control requirements; (b) Any necessary operational restrictions; (c) Any necessary monitoring, reporting and record keeping requirements; and (d) Testing requirements. (3) The director shall provide an opportunity for public comment on the form and content of a model general permit as follows: (a) The director shall announce availability for comment on draft model general permits under development containing the requirements in paragraph (A)(2) of this rule, providing a minimum of thirty days comment period. The director shall publish notice in Ohio's major newspapers, the ""Weekly Review,"" on the Ohio EPA website, and provide electronic notification to interested parties.   (b) The director shall announce the final form of model general permits that were under development by publishing notice in Ohio's major newspapers, the ""Weekly Review,"" on the Ohio EPA website, and provide electronic notification to interested parties. (c) Final model general permits are not actions of the director and are, therefore, not subject to appeal. (4) Model general permits shall be reviewed at least once every five years from the date of announcement of the final form. (a) The review of the model general permit shall follow the same procedures for public comment as the draft and final form of the model general permits under development pursuant to paragraph (A)(3) of this rule. (b) Any person may make a written request for Ohio EPA review of the model general permit document prior to the Ohio EPA initiated review. Upon receipt of the request, the Ohio EPA will initiate the review procedure described in this rule. (5) Only the director may modify model general permits. Modifications to model general permits shall follow the same procedures pursuant to paragraph (A)(3) of this rule, except administrative modifications may occur without following the rules of procedure contained within this chapter. Existing final general permits are not affected by changes to the model general permit. (B) General permit to install applicability A general permit to install may be applied for and obtained if: (1) All of the qualification and requirements described in this chapter are met, except as noted in paragraph (C)(2) of this rule; (2) The air contaminant source meets all of the qualifications listed in the requested model general permit; (3) The requested air contaminant source(s) are not affected sources under the acid rain program unless otherwise provided in regulations promulgated under Title IV of the Clean Air Act; and (4) The requested air contaminant source is not part of a new major stationary source or major modification subject to the attainment or nonattainment provisions contained in rules 3745-31-10 to 3745-31-27 of the Administrative Code. (C) General permit application   (1) Owners or operators of air contaminant sources requesting a general permit to install shall do so using the forms prepared by the Ohio EPA. The application must include all information necessary to determine qualification for, and to assure compliance with, the general permit to install. (2) The applications submitted shall comply with the requirements listed under rule 3745-31-04 of the Administrative Code except that the director may provide, in the model general permit to install, for applications that deviate from the requirements of rule 3745-31-04 of the Administrative Code, provided that such applications include all information necessary to determine qualification for, and assure compliance with, the general permit to install. (D) General permit processing The director may issue a general permit to install for any model general permit developed in accordance with paragraph (A) of this rule for a new air contaminant source(s) or modification(s) of an existing air contaminant source(s) as follows: (1) The director, at his discretion, shall issue either a draft action or a final action within forty-five days of receipt of a complete application. The director does not need to meet the forty-five day deadline for applications from air contaminant source(s) that do not require authorization to construct because the air contaminant source(s) currently holds a permit covering the source(s) that would be covered under the general permit to install. (2) The director shall comply with the procedures for notification under Chapter 3745-47 of the Administrative Code prior to issuing a general permit to install as follows: (a) The director shall provide notification of requests by owners or operators of an air contaminant source(s) to be covered under the terms of the general permit to install. The director shall publish notice in a newspaper of general circulation in each county in which the air contaminant source(s) would be constructed, and provide electronic notification to interested parties. (b) The director shall maintain, and make available to the public upon request, a list of all air contaminant source(s) that have obtained a general permit to install. (3) The director may require any applicant applying for a general permit to install to apply for and obtain an individual permit if it is determined that unique site specific circumstances warrant additional limitations or permit conditions to control or mitigate environmental impacts that were not considered and addressed in the development and issuance of the general permit to install.   (4) Authorization to construct under the general permit to install shall be granted by the director in the form of a final permit action. (5) If the model general permit that was the basis of any install has been changed per the procedures in paragraph the director can issue revised general permit to installs affected owner or operator following the issuance paragraph (D)(2) of this rule. (E) Start construction limitation The owner or operator of a new or modified air contaminant source(s) that qualifies for a general permit to install may not begin actual construction of the new or modified air contaminant source(s) until the air contaminant source(s)'s owner or operator has been granted the authorization required by the director under paragraph (D)(4) of this rule. (F) Modification and/or replacement of equipment (1) If the owner or operator of the air contaminant source covered by a general permit to install wishes to replace the air contaminant source, then the owner or operator must apply for and obtain either a general permit to install or an individual permit to install prior to beginning construction. (2) If the owner or operator of the air contaminant source covered by a general permit to install wishes to modify the air contaminant source (per rule 3745-3101 of the Administrative Code), then the owner or operator must apply for and obtain either a general permit to install or an individual permit to install prior to beginning construction. (3) If the owner or operator of the air contaminant source covered by a general permit to install wishes to administratively modify the air contaminant source, then the owner or operator must submit a request to the director, with supporting documentation, for that request. (G) General permit termination (1) Any owner or operator who was issued a general permit to install may request to be excluded from the coverage of the general permit to install by applying for an individual permit or alternative general permit to install. The owner or operator shall submit an application with reasons supporting the request.

Once selected, the vendor will assist ODJFS in monitoring and evaluating the effectiveness of the Adoption Services program and assessing compliance with the adoption measures mandated by the Child and Family Service Reviews (CFSR) Final Report. Specific measures include: 1) at least thirty-two percent of children whose adoptions are finalized attain that finalization within 24 months from latest removal from home; and 2) diligent efforts are made to recruit and retain families who reflect the diversity of the children in foster care and those waiting for adoption. Services to be performed and information to be gathered by the selected Quality Assurance vendor will allow ODJFS to continuously improve and enhance the Adoption Services program, thereby reducing the number of children awaiting adoption in Ohio. The information will also allow ODJFS to identify areas where corrective action may be required for compliance with CFSR mandates. In addition, the selected vendor=s responsibilities include, but may not be limited to: 1) providing statistical information on various aspects of the Adoption Services program through development of semi-annual reports; 2) providing technical assistance to county and state personnel regarding the statistical information obtained; and 3) facilitating and reporting on outcomes of adoption-related meetings focusing on improving the Adoption Services program. It is critical that the selected Quality Assurance vendor work closely with participating adoption program vendors including the Ohio Adoption Photo Listing (OAPL) vendor, whose responsibilities include managing, maintaining and further developing the OAPL web page and Features Books, and the Marketing vendor whose responsibilities include planning and coordinating the Statewide Adoption and Foster Care Conference. 1.2 Issuing Office  This RFP is released by and the subsequent contract will be with ODJFS. The ODJFS Office for Children and Families (OCF), which will administer the contract, is responsible for state level supervision for children=s permanency planning programs. OCF supports communities and those who serve and advocate for children, adults and families in achieving safety, self sufficiency and stability. Through partnerships, OCF promotes solutions that are flexible, accountable, broad-based and diverse. The contract expected to result from this RFP process will be an agreement between ODJFS and the selected contractor. The Ohio Department of Administrative Services= (DAS) involvement is limited to providing support by publishing this RFP and its related documents on the State of Ohio procurement opportunities web site, which it manages. This consolidated web site is intended to provide vendors of all types with the convenience of a single web site from which to search all procurement opportunities offered by any State of Ohio governmental agency.   Page 2 of 21  Adoption Services Quality Assurance  RFP#: R-04-06-0019  DAS is not involved in the development of this RFP, the receipt of vendor responses/proposals, the evaluation of those proposals, contractor selection, or in the development or execution of the contract. If interested vendors have a need to communicate regarding this RFP, they must contact ODJFS using one of the mechanisms provided for in Sections 1.7, Internet Question and Answer Period; RFP Clarification Opportunity, or 1.9, Communications Prohibited, of this RFP. Vendor proposals must be submitted to ODJFS in strict accordance with proposal submission instructions provided in Section 4.1, Proposal Submission. Vendors are cautioned that communication attempts which do not comply with these instructions will not be answered, and that ODJFS will not consider any proposals submitted to any address other than the one provided in Section 4.1 of this RFP. 1.3 Background  It is a philosophical foundation of ODJFS that a permanent family is an inherent right of every child, and that for most children entering the child protection services system the family of choice is the child=s birth or kin family. However, at any given time, over 3,500 Ohio children are in the permanent custody of a public children services agency (PCSA) where returning to a birth or kin family is not an option. For the majority of these children in permanent custody, the most viable method for assuring a sense of permanency is through placement in adoptive homes. In Federal Fiscal Year (FFY) 02, over 2,165 children in permanent custody were adopted. Some of the children waiting to be adopted are living with the families who intend to adopt them but the adoption has not yet been finalized. For others, a permanent home has not yet been found. These children have come from homes where they may have suffered from abuse and/or neglect. Many of the children are older, are African-American, and/or often have brothers and sisters with whom they want to remain. In the vast majority of cases, their months or years in foster care have left an imprint on their self-esteem and emotional security which needs to be addressed. Child protection services in Ohio are operated by the 88 county PCSAs. ODJFS is responsible for policy development, supervision and the provision of technical assistance to Ohio=s PCSAs. Thus, responsibility for the safety and permanency of children entering the system rests primarily with each county PCSA. In instances where it is necessary to seek and receive permanent custody of children, the PCSA or private child placing agency (PCPA), awarded custody has complete parental rights and responsibilities. For the past five years, ODJFS operated a program called AdoptOHIO which provided incentive payments to increase the number of private agencies which developed adoptive families for children in the custody of PCSAs. Due to budgetary constraints, the AdoptOHIO program was restructured beginning this State Fiscal Year (SFY). However, funds will be made available to PCSAs to encourage increased adoptions, specifically for children over the age of ten and for children who can be adopted within 24 months. Many PCSAs will seek to continue collaboration with private agencies. Recent strides to improve permanency and adoption practices have been made in Ohio and in the nation. Among some of the more recent pieces of legislation and initiatives which govern the adoption of children are: The Adoption and Safe Families Act of 1997 (ASFA) [PL 105-89]: This act helps to dismantle many barriers that may exist to finding permanent homes for children in foster care. It requires states to avoid foster care drift, moving children into permanent placement more quickly and measuring program success in terms of outcomes rather than process. ASFA intends to address the need to reduce the time children spend in foster care, reduce the disparity in permanency outcomes across racial categories and increase the   Page 3 of 21  Adoption Services Quality Assurance  RFP#: R-04-06-0019  placements of children with special needs. Multi Ethnic Placement Act and Inter-ethnic Adoption Provision of the Small Business Job Protection Act of 1996: These provisions prohibit delays in placing children on the basis of race, color or national origin. Any considerations of race, color or national origin in foster or adoptive placements must be narrowly tailored to advance the child=s best interests and must be made as an individualized determination of each child=s needs and in light of a specific prospective adoptive or foster care parent=s capacity to care for that child. The legislation also requires states to recruit prospective foster and adoptive families which reflect the pool of waiting children. Adoption 2002 Initiative: This initiative was a result of the federal government=s Executive Memorandum on Adoption which was enforced by several provisions of ASFA. It challenged states to double the number of adoptions it achieved in five years (1998-2002). The Executive Memorandum on Adoption and its future iterations established a baseline and set a target for Ohio constituting one of the critical measures for determining adoption success. If Ohio met its targets, it would receive additional funding from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. These rates were established at $4,000 for every qualified child adopted over the FFY 1998 baseline and $2,000 for every special needs child adopted over the FFY 1998 special needs baseline. Additional monies have been allocated for the Adoption 2002 Incentive funds. The Department of Health and Human Services is determining a new formula for states eligible for incentive payments. It is the belief of ODJFS that all factions of the community have a stake and role in the welfare of its children. Thus, it is critical to acknowledge, solicit and facilitate the active participation and support of all community members including: private enterprise, professional, social, auxiliary, civic and charitable associations; religious organizations and entities; government bodies; social service providers; media; and schools. 1.4 Overview of the Project  The Adoption Services program includes an array of innovative, coordinated approaches to address the challenge of finding homes for Ohio=s waiting children. Strategies include implementation of child-specific recruitment projects in the three largest metropolitan counties; a faith-based initiative in 25 counties to encourage the religious community to partner with ODJFS in the recruitment and retention of families; and an improved web site and photo listing so that people throughout the state have access to information on the waiting children. The initiative includes extensive efforts in publicizing the needs of waiting children, recruiting families, matching those families to the children who are waiting, and fostering collaboration between public and private agencies. 1.5 Objectives of the Project  The objectives of this project are to: A. B. C. Monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of the various components of the Adoption Services program to ensure that it is having the intended effect, such as, or including but not limited to compliance with the adoption measures as specified in the CFSR final report; Continuously improve and enhance the Adoption Services program in an ongoing effort to reduce the number of children awaiting adoption in Ohio; Facilitate adoption-related meetings with ODJFS and county staff in regards to analysis and evaluation of adoption measures mandated by the CFSR; and   Page 4 of 21  Adoption Services Quality Assurance  RFP#: R-04-06-0019  D. 1.6  Facilitate other committee meetings related to evaluating and improving adoption policies and practices.

Potential vendors may ask RFP clarification questions either via FAX or through the following Internet process:        Access the Ohio Department of Job and Family Services Web Page at http://www.state.oh.us/ODJFS; Select ""About Us"" on the front page; Select ""Doing Business with ODJFS""; Select ""Requests for Proposals (RFP), Letterhead Solicitations, and Other Invitations""; Select RFP Number R-04-06-0019; Select the ""Ask a Question about this RFP"" function; and Follow the instruction to send an e-mail question.   Page 5 of 21  Adoption Services Quality Assurance  RFP#: R-04-06-0019  Questions on this RFP must reference the relevant part of the document, the heading for the provision under question, and preferably the page number of the RFP where the provision can be found. The potential vendor must also include the name of a representative of the potential vendor, and the company name and business phone number. ODJFS may, at its option, disregard any questions which do not appropriately reference an RFP provision or location, or which do not include an identification of the originator of the question. ODJFS will not respond to any questions submitted after 10:00 a.m. on the date that the Question and Answer Period closes. ODJFS responses to all inquiries submitted either via the Internet or fax* will be accessible from the Internet web site dedicated to this RFP, for references by all potential vendors. Potential vendors will not receive personalized or individual e-mail responses. Clarifying questions asked and ODJFS responses to them comprise the ""ODJFS Question and Answer Document"" for this RFP; when possible, ODJFS may post an interim Q & A Document as well as the final version. Vendor proposals in response to this RFP are to take into account any information communicated by ODJFS in the Final Q & A Document for the RFP. It is the responsibility of all potential vendors to check the DAS web site dedicated to this RFP on a regular basis for responses to questions, as well as for any amendments, alerts, or other pertinent information regarding this or any other ODJFS RFP. Accessibility to the ODJFS Question and Answer Document will be clearly identified on the DAS web site dedicated to this RFP, once that document is made available. IMPORTANT: Requests from potential vendors for copies of previous RFPs, past vendor proposals, or contracts for this or similar past projects, are requests for public information, and are not clarification questions regarding the present RFP. Public Information Requests (PIRs), submitted in accordance with directions provided in Section 1.9, Communications Prohibited, will be honored, but the posted time frames for ODJFS responses to Internet or faxed questions for RFP clarification do not apply to requests for public information. Vendors are to base their RFP responses, and the details and costs of their proposed projects, on the requirements and performance expectations established in the RFP for the future contract, NOT on details of a current or past related contract. Requirements under a current or past project may or may not be required by ODJFS under any future contract, and so may not be useful information for vendors who choose to respond to the RFP. If vendors ask questions about existing or past contracts using the Internet Q&A process, ODJFS will use its discretion in deciding whether to provide answers. There is an established time period for the Vendor Question & Answer process (see Section 1.6, Anticipated Procurement Timetable, above). ODJFS will only answer those questions submitted within the stated time frame for submission of vendor questions, and which pertain to issues of RFP clarity, and which are not requests for public information. ODJFS is under no obligation to acknowledge questions submitted through the Q&A process if those questions are not in accordance with these instructions. * Potential vendors who do not have Internet access may submit RFP clarification questions via fax during the same time period described in Section 1.6, Anticipated Procurement Timetable. Questions may be faxed to (614) 995-4876. Any potential vendor making a fax request must include a return fax number so that ODJFS may reply with the Question and Answer document when it becomes available (i.e., when it is simultaneously posted on the Internet web page for the RFP). 1.8 Vendors= Library  ODJFS recognizes that vendors may not be familiar with some of the documents referenced in this RFP.   Page 6 of 21  Adoption Services Quality Assurance  RFP#: R-04-06-0019  The following documents are available, via the web, for review by vendors to provide additional information on the Adoption Services Program: C Ohio Adoption Photo Listing at http://www.state.oh.us/odjfs/oapl and C past ODJFS Adoption Services Performance Reports at http://www.state.oh.us/odjfs/ocf/publications.stm 1.9 Communications Prohibited  From the issuance date of this RFP until an actual contract is awarded to a vendor, there may not be communications concerning the RFP between any vendor which expects to submit a proposal and any employee of ODJFS in the issuing office, or any other ODJFS employee, or any other individual regardless of their employment status, who is in any way involved in the development of the RFP or the selection of the Contractor. The only exceptions to this prohibition are as follows: 1. 2. 3. 4. Communications conducted pursuant to Section 1.7 above.

All interested vendors are strongly encouraged to refer to that web page regularly for amendments or other announcements. Failure on the part of ODJFS to notify any vendors of any possible changes or announcements related to this RFP does not absolve the vendors from their responsibility to look for updated information through this web page. ODJFS is not responsible for the accuracy of any information regarding this RFP that was obtained or gathered through a source other than the Question and Answer process (the RFP Clarification Opportunity) described in this RFP. Any attempts at prohibited communications by vendors may result in the disqualification of those vendors' proposals. 1.10 Time Frames and Funding Available  ODJFS is seeking to contract with a vendor to provide services as stipulated in this RFP between (approximately) December 1, 2003 and June 30, 2005, subject to approval by the State Controlling Board. At the sole discretion of ODJFS and upon approval of funds by the State Controlling Board, a two year renewal may be utilized to extend the contract through June 30, 2007.

COST PROPOSAL ENCLOSED FOR ADOPTOHIO QUALITY ASSURANCE RFP#: R-04-06-0019 FROM [VENDOR=S NAME]"". The sealed envelope containing the Cost Proposal must include an additional copy of the Cost Proposal on a CD-ROM (separate from the Technical Proposal CD-ROM), in non-re-writeable CD format. The above Technical Proposal must not contain cost information, or the entire proposal will be disqualified from further consideration. The Cost Proposal must include a statement that the prices quoted are firm, and must contain the following information: The Cost Proposal must display the per-deliverable cost for all contract deliverables per SFY 04 and 05 as well as for SFYs 06 and 07 (for renewal purposes), which includes, at minimum, Deliverables A through H, as described in Section 2.4, Specifications of   Page 18 of 21  Adoption Services Quality Assurance  RFP#: R-04-06-0019  Deliverables. The Cost Proposal should display cost information explaining each per-deliverable cost. The selected vendor will invoice ODJFS after satisfactory completion of each of the contract deliverables*, for the cost, as represented on the selected vendor's Cost Proposal, of the deliverable(s) completed. All costs, including staff time and other administrative costs, that will be incurred by the selected vendor in order to successfully accomplish the entire scope of work and project objectives of this RFP, must be included in the vendor's Cost Proposal and be rolled into the costs of one or more deliverables, as appropriate. The sum of the total costs for all deliverables must represent the firm, all-inclusive price for performance of all project work. This sum total of all of the vendor's proposed deliverable costs (for SFYs 04 and 05) will be the vendor's grand total used in Phase III of the Proposal Evaluation and Selection process, described below in Section V. *ODJFS may negotiate with the selected vendor for a payment schedule permitting interim payments for certain deliverables, not to exceed the per-deliverable total cost. SECTION V. 5.1 CRITERIA FOR PROPOSAL EVALUATION AND SELECTION  Scoring of Proposals  The Technical Proposal will be reviewed and collectively scored by the Proposal Review Committee (PRC), comprised of employees of ODJFS. Vendors are encouraged to review the Technical Proposal Score Sheet provided as Attachment B to be aware of evaluation criteria. The Proposal Review Committee will collectively evaluate and score proposals in three (3) phases: Phase I: Initial Qualifying Criteria; Phase II: Scoring of the Technical Proposal and Phase III: Consideration of the Cost Proposal. A. Phase I. ReviewBInitial Qualifying Criteria: The vendor=s proposal must meet the following Phase I criteria in order to be distributed to the Proposal Review Committee for Phase II review. Any Ano@ response for the listed Phase I criteria will eliminate a proposal from any further consideration. 1. 2. Was the proposal received by the deadline as specified in the RFP (Sections 1.6 and 4.1)? Did the vendor submit one signed original and six (6) copies of the Technical Proposal and a separate sealed Cost Proposal, labeled ANOTE: DO NOT OPEN. COST PROPOSAL ENCLOSED FOR ADOPTION SERVICES SPECIALIZED ADMINISTRATIVE SUPPORT, QUALITY ASSURANCE RFP#: R-04-06-0019 FROM [VENDOR=S NAME]@? (Sections 4.1 & 4.2, B.)  B.  Phase II. ReviewBCriteria for Scoring the Technical Proposal A maximum of 440 points will be awarded for the Technical Proposal, as outlined in this section. Any proposal which does not meet or exceed 352 points out of the possible 440 points will be disqualified from further consideration, and the Cost Proposal will neither be   Page 19 of 21  Adoption Services Quality Assurance  RFP#: R-04-06-0019  opened nor considered. Only those remaining qualified proposals will proceed to the next level of review, which is the consideration of the Cost Proposal. Scoring on the Technical Proposal will be for the vendor and any extensively used subcontractor. The Technical Proposal will be scored as follows: The Proposal Review Committee will score the Technical Proposal by reviewing how well the vendor meets the requirements of the statements listed below. The vendor must provide relevant evidence, as discussed in Section II, of meeting the requirements for each statement. For each evaluation issue, a vendor=s response will be rated as one of the following: ADoes Not Meet Expectations@BThe response is completely unacceptable or the information is missing altogether. Score: 0 APartially Meets Expectations@BThough an attempt to meet expectation is demonstrated, the attempt is deemed incapable of meeting ODJFS= needs. Score: 6 AMeets Expectations@BThe vendor proposal fulfills a particular RFP requirement in all material respects, potentially with only minor, non-substantial deviation. Score: 8 AExceeds Expectations@BThe vendor=s proposal fulfills a particular RFP requirement in all material respects, and offers some additional level of quality in excess of ODJFS expectations, Score: 10. C. Phase III. ReviewBConsideration of the Cost Proposal Only those Technical Proposals which meet or exceed the minimum technical score of 352 points will proceed to the next level of review, which is the consideration of the Cost Proposal. The PRC will divide the grand total of each qualifying vendor=s Cost Proposal (total for SFY 04 plus total for SFY 05) by that vendor=s Technical Proposal score. This ratio compares the cost with the quality of the Technical Proposal, to provide an average cost-per-quality point earned on the Technical Proposal. 5.2 Tie Breaker  In the event that two or more of the proposals have a score which is tied after final calculation of both the technical proposal and the cost proposal, the proposal with the higher score in the technical proposal will prevail. 5.3 Final Selection  The PRC will select a vendor whose Technical Proposal, Cost Proposal, and (if applicable) results from the Interview is in the State=s best interest to consider. ODJFS may, at its sole discretion, elect to conduct interviews of vendors prior to final selection. SECTION VI. 6.1 Protests PROTEST PROCEDURE  Any potential, or actual, vendor objecting to the award of a contract resulting from the issuance of this RFP   Page 20 of 21  Adoption Services Quality Assurance  RFP#: R-04-06-0019  may file a protest of the award of the contract, or any other matter relating to the process of soliciting the proposals. Such a protest must comply with the following guidelines: 1. A protest may be filed by a prospective or actual bidder objecting to the award of a contract resulting from this RFP. The protest shall be in writing and shall contain the following information: a. b. c. d. e. f. 2. The name, address, and telephone number of the protestor; The name and number of the RFP being protested; A detailed statement of the legal and factual grounds for the protest, including copies of any relevant documents; A request for a ruling by ODJFS; A statement as to the form of relief requested from ODJFS; and Any other information the protestor believes to be essential to the determination of the factual and legal questions at issue in the written protest.  A timely protest shall be considered by ODJFS, if it is received by ODJFS= Office of Legal Services, within the following periods: a. A protest based on alleged improprieties in the issuance of the RFP or any other event preceding the closing date for receipt of proposals which are apparent or should be apparent prior to the closing date for receipt of proposals shall be filed no later than 3:00 p.m. the closing date for receipt of proposals, as specified in Section 1.6 of this RFP. If the protest relates to the announced intent to award a contract, the protest shall be filed no later than 3:00 p.m. of the tenth (10th) business day after the issuance of the Letter of Intent to Award the contract.  b.  3.  An untimely protest may be considered by ODJFS if ODJFS determines that the protest raises issues significant to the department=s procurement system. An untimely protest is one received by ODJFS=s Office of Legal Services after the time periods set forth in Item #2 of this section. All protests must be filed at the following location: Chief Legal Counsel Office of Legal Services Ohio Department of Job and Family Services 30 East Broad Street, 31st Floor Columbus, Ohio 43215-3414  4.  5.  When a timely protest is filed, a contract award shall not proceed until a decision on the protest is issued or the matter is otherwise resolved, unless the Director of ODJFS determines that a delay will severely disadvantage the Department. The vendor(s) who   Page 21 of 21  Adoption Services Quality Assurance  RFP#: R-04-06-0019  would have been awarded the contract shall be notified of the receipt of the protest. 6. ODJFS=s Office of Legal Services shall issue written decisions on all timely protests and shall notify any vendor who filed an untimely protest as to whether or not the protest will be considered.  6.2  Caveats  ODJFS is under no obligation to issue a contract as a result of this solicitation if, in the opinion of ODJFS and the PRC, none of the proposals were responsive to the objectives and needs of the Department. ODJFS reserves the right to not select any vendor should ODJFS decide not to proceed. Changes in this RFP of a material nature will be provided via the DAS web site dedicated to this RFP. All vendors are responsible for obtaining any such changes without further notice by ODJFS. Payments for any and all services provided pursuant to the contract are contingent upon the availability of state and federal funds. Thank you for your interest in this project. SECTION VII. 7.1 A.

Compliance Requirements VI.A. Compliance with the Permit (a) The permittee must comply with all conditions of this Part 71 permit. Any permit noncompliance constitutes a violation of the Clean Air Act and is grounds for enforcement action; for permit termination, revocation and reissuance, or modification; or for denial of a permit renewal application. [40 CFR  71.6(a)(6)(i)] It shall not be a defense for a permittee in an enforcement action that it would have been necessary to halt or reduce the permitted activity in order to maintain compliance with the conditions of this permit. [40 CFR  71.6(a)(6)(ii)] For the purpose of submitting compliance certifications in accordance with Section VI.B. of this permit, or establishing whether or not a person has violated or is in violation of any requirement of this permit, nothing shall preclude the use, including the exclusive use, of any credible evidence or information, relevant to whether a source would have been in compliance with applicable requirements if the appropriate performance or compliance test or procedure had been performed. [Section 113(a) and 113(e)(1) of the Act, 40 CFR  51.212,  52.12,  52.33,  60.11(g), and  61.12.]  (b)  (c)  VI.B. Compliance Certification (a) The permittee shall submit to EPA Region 10 a certification of compliance with permit terms and conditions, including emission limitations, standards, or work practices, postmarked by January 30 of each year and covering the previous calendar year except that the first certification shall cover the period from the effective date of this permit through December 31.

[40 CFR  71.6(c)(5)] The certification shall include the following: (i) (ii) The identification of each permit term or condition that is the basis of the certification. The identification of the method(s) or other means used for determining the 11  (b)   compliance status of each term and condition during the certification period, and whether such methods or other means provide continuous or intermittent data. Such methods and other means shall include, at a minimum, the methods and means required in this permit. If necessary, the owner or operator also shall identify any other material information that must be included in the certification to comply with section 113(c)(2) of the Clean Air Act, which prohibits knowingly making a false certification or omitting material information. (iii) The status of compliance with each term and condition of the permit for the period covered by the certification, based on the method or means designated above. The certification shall identify each deviation and take it into account in the compliance certification. Whether compliance with each permit term was continuous or intermittent. [40 CFR  71.6(c)(5)(iii)]  (iv)  VI.C Emergency Provisions (a) In addition to any emergency or upset provision contained in any applicable requirement, the permittee may seek to establish that noncompliance with a technology-based emission limitation under this permit was due to an emergency. To do so, the permittee shall demonstrate the affirmative defense of emergency through properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs, or other relevant evidence that: (i) (ii) (iii) an emergency occurred and that the permittee can identify the cause(s) of the emergency; the permitted facility was at the time being properly operated; during the period of the emergency the permittee took all reasonable steps to minimize levels of emissions that exceeded the emissions standards, or other requirements in this permit; and the permittee submitted notice of the emergency to EPA Region 10 within 2 working days of the time when emission limitations were exceeded due to the emergency. This notice must contain a description of the emergency, any steps taken to mitigate emissions, and corrective actions taken. This notice fulfills the requirements of Section V.C.(2)(b) of this permit, concerning prompt notification of deviations. In any enforcement proceeding the permittee attempting to establish the occurrence of an emergency has the burden of proof. 12  (iv)  (v)   (b)  An ""emergency"" means any situation arising from sudden and reasonably unforeseeable events beyond the control of the source, including acts of God, which situation requires immediate corrective action to restore normal operation, and that causes the source to exceed a technology-based emission limitation under the permit due to unavoidable increases in emissions attributable to the emergency. An emergency shall not include noncompliance to the extent caused by improperly designed equipment, lack of preventive maintenance, careless or improper operation, or operator error.

Of the remaining amount of $3,039,450,050, 91.23 percent  ($2,772,890,281) is made available to the Urbanized Area Formula  Program, 6.37 percent ($193,612,968) is made available to the  Nonurbanized Area Formula Program, and 2.4 percent ($72,946,801) is  made available to the Elderly and Persons with Disabilities Program.     The other program appropriations contained in this notice are as  follows: $5,250,000 for the Rural Transit Assistance Program (RTAP);  and $2,501,000,000 for the Capital Investment Program. Of the Capital  Investment Program amount, $980,400,000 is for Fixed Guideway  Modernization, $980,400,000 is for New Starts, and $490,200,000 is for  Bus Capital. In addition, $50,000,000 of formula funds for Clean Fuels  was transferred and merged with the Bus Capital Program increasing that  program to $540,200,000. An amount of $75,000,000 is for the Job Access  and Reverse Commute Program.     Table 1 displays the amounts appropriated by program, including  adjustments and final apportioned and allocated amounts. The following  text provides a narrative explanation of the funding levels and other  factors affecting the apportionments and allocations.  B. TEA-21 Authorized Program Levels      TEA-21 provides a combination of trust and general fund  authorizations that total $6,810,000,000 for the fiscal year 2000 FTA  program. Of this amount, $5,797,000,000 is guaranteed under the  discretionary spending cap. See Table 11 for fiscal years 1998-2003  guaranteed fund levels by program and Table 11A for the total of  guaranteed and non-guaranteed levels by program.     Information regarding estimates of the funding levels for 1999-2003  by state and urbanized area is available on the FTA homepage at  [www.fta.dot.gov]. The numbers are for planning purposes only as they  will be revised in the future but may be used for programming  metropolitan transportation improvement programs and statewide  transportation improvement programs.  C. Project Management Oversight      Section 5327 of 49 U.S.C. allows the Secretary of Transportation to  use not more than one-half percent of the funds made available under  the Urbanized Area Formula Program and the Nonurbanized Area Formula  Program, and three-quarters percent of funds made available under the  Capital Investment Program to contract with any person to oversee the  construction of any major project under these statutory programs to  conduct safety, procurement, management and financial reviews and  audits, and to provide technical assistance to correct deficiencies  identified in compliance reviews and audits. Therefore, one-half  percent of the funds appropriated for the Urbanized Area Formula  Program, and the Nonurbanized Area Formula Program for fiscal year  2000, and three-quarters percent of Capital Investment Program funds  were reserved for these purposes before funds were apportioned.  III. Fiscal Year 2000 Focus  A. Y2K      FTA began working on the Year 2000 (Y2K) issue as early as 1996.  The goal of FTA's efforts is to ensure that transit services are not  interrupted by computer failures resulting from Y2K problems. In order  to accomplish this, FTA is providing Y2K information, guidance and  assistance to the transit community. A series of ``Dear Colleague  Letters'' was sent to FTA grantees, which provided guidance on Y2K and  a five-phased approach FTA Y2K Management Plan. The five phases were as  follows: (1) Assessment; (2) Renovation/Validation; (3) Certifications;  (4) Submission of Business Continuity and Contingency Plan (BCCP) or  outline of BCCP; and (5) Reporting test results of the BCCP.     In January 1999, FTA Grantees were required to complete the  Assessment Phase, and in March 1999, FTA Grantees were required to  complete the Renovation/Validation Phase. On June 30, 1999, the FTA  grantees were required to certify Y2K compliance or submit an outline  of the contingency plan for continuing operations of their systems  while repairing or replacing the calendar year 2000 non-compliant  elements. The 30 largest grantees were required to submit a copy of the  Business Continuity and Contingency Plan. Other transit operators were  asked to submit an outline of their BCCP. All grantees are also to  submit to FTA the results of their first two tests of the BCCP by  October 31, 1999.     As the changeover approaches, FTA will continue to work with  grantees to  [[Page 58214]]  ensure a smooth transition. FTA will monitor transit activity during  the Y2K changeover, with emphasis on the 30 largest operators. FTA will  also serve as a clearinghouse for information during the changeover.  B. Disadvantaged Business Enterprise (DBE) Regulation      The Department of Transportation's (DOT's) new regulation  implementing the disadvantaged business enterprise (DBE) program was  published February 2, 1999, in the Federal Register and was effective  March 4, 1999. The DBE program is intended to remedy past and current  discrimination against disadvantaged business enterprises, ensure a  ``level playing field'' and foster equal opportunity in DOT-assisted  contracts, improve the flexibility and efficiency of the DBE program,  and reduce burdens on small businesses.     FTA grantees were required to submit revised DBE programs by  September 1, 1999. FTA has reviewed all programs received. A sample DBE  Program has been created for grantees along with DOT approved Q&As for  assistance to grant recipients required to submit programs. For more  information, contact Arthur Andrew Lopez, Director, Office of Civil  Rights, at (202) 366-4018, or Gloria Dixon at (816) 329-3920 or (816)  523-0204, or go to the Office of Small and Disadvantaged Business  Utilization website at: [http://osdbuweb.dot.gov/programs/dbe/dbe.htm].  C. Urbanized Area Formula Study      Section 3033 of TEA-21 requires FTA to conduct a study to assess  whether the formula for apportioning funds to urbanized areas (at 49  U.S.C. 5336) accurately reflects the transit needs of small urbanized  areas that provide an unusually high level of transit service for their  size. A Federal Register Notice on the commencement of the study was  published on July 9, 1999, and numerous comments were received.     In that notice, FTA sought suggestions on conducting the study and  comment on the following questions from interested parties: (1) Are  population and population density adequate factors for use in  apportioning funds to small urbanized areas; (2) Are there specific  reasons why other factors should not be applied to these small cities;  (3) Should service factors also be applied to small urbanized areas in  apportioning formula funds--in particular, should bus revenue vehicle  miles be applied to small urbanized areas as well; (4) Should bus  passenger miles and operating costs used in the incentive tier be  applied to small urbanized areas; (5) Would examining other aid sources  available to small urbanized areas be useful and informative; and (6)  What other mechanisms besides changing the formula might be practical  and useful in order to assist small transit-intensive cities?     The study is to be submitted to Congress by December 31, 1999. For  more information, contact Darren Timothy, FTA Office of Policy  Development, at (202) 366-0177.  D. Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS)      Section 5206(e) of TEA-21 requires that Intelligent Transportation  Systems (ITS) projects using funds from the Highway Trust Fund  (including the Mass Transit Account) conform to the National ITS  Architecture and Standards. Interim guidance on conformity with  National ITS Performance Standards was issued October 2, 1998, jointly  by FTA and FHWA. This document provides guidance for meeting this  provision of TEA-21 and is available from FTA regional offices and on  the FTA website. These standards and requirements apply to fiscal year  2000 allocations included in this notice that contain ITS components.     Questions regarding the applicability of these standards and  requirements should be addressed to the FTA regional office or Ronald  Boenau, FTA Office of Research, Demonstration and Innovation, at (202)  366-0195.  IV. Section 5303 Metropolitan Planning Program and Section 5313(b)  State Planning and Research Program  A. Metropolitan Planning Program      The fiscal year 2000 Metropolitan Planning apportionment to states  for MPOs' use in urbanized areas totals $49,642,128. This amount  includes $49,632,000 in fiscal year 2000 appropriated funds, and  $10,128 in prior year deobligated funds available for reapportionment  under this program. A basic allocation of 80 percent of this amount  ($39,713,702) is distributed to the states based on the state's  urbanized area population as defined by the U.S. Census Bureau for  subsequent state distribution to each urbanized area, or parts thereof,  within each state. A supplemental allocation of the remaining 20  percent ($9,928,426) is also provided to the states based on an FTA  administrative formula to address planning needs in the larger, more  complex urbanized areas. Table 2 contains the final state  apportionments for the combined basic and supplemental allocations.  Each state, in cooperation with the MPOs, must develop an allocation  formula for the combined apportionment, which distributes these funds  to MPOs representing urbanized areas, or parts thereof, within the  state. This formula, which must be approved by the FTA, must ensure to  the maximum extent practicable that no MPO is allocated less than the  amount it received by administrative formula under the Metropolitan  Planning Program in fiscal year 1991 (minimum MPO allocation). Each  state formula must include a provision for the minimum MPO allocation.  Where the state and MPOs desire to use a new formula not previously  approved by FTA, it must be submitted to the appropriate FTA Regional  Office for prior approval.  B. State Planning and Research Program      The fiscal year 2000 apportionment for the State Planning and  Research Program totals $10,374,946. This amount includes $10,368,000  in fiscal year 2000 appropriated funds, and $6,946 in prior year  deobligated funds, which have become available for reapportionment  under this program. Final state apportionments for this program are  also contained on Table 2. These funds may be used for a variety of  purposes such as planning, technical studies and assistance,  demonstrations, management training, and cooperative research. In  addition, a state may authorize a portion of these funds to be used to  supplement planning funds allocated by the state to its urbanized  areas, as the state deems appropriate.  C. Data Used for Metropolitan Planning and State Planning and Research  Apportionments      Population data from the 1990 Census is used in calculating these  apportionments. The Metropolitan Planning funding provided to urbanized  areas in each state by administrative formula in fiscal year 1991 was  used as a ``hold harmless'' base in calculating funding to each State.  D. FHWA Metropolitan Planning Program and State Planning and Research  Program      For informational purposes, the fiscal year 2000 apportionment for  the FHWA Metropolitan Planning Program (PL) and estimated apportionment  for fiscal year 2000 State Planning and Research Program (SP&R) are  contained in Table 3. These estimates do not include expected SP&R  funding increases from the Revenue Budget Aligned Authority authorized  in TEA-21, Section 1105.  [[Page 58215]]  E. Local Match Waiver for Specified Planning Activities      (1) Job Access Planning Activities. Federal, state and local  welfare reform initiatives may require the development of new and  innovative public and other transportation services to ensure that  former welfare recipients have adequate mobility for reaching  employment opportunities. In recognition of the key role that  transportation plays in ensuring the success of welfare-to-work  initiatives, FTA and FHWA permit the waiver of the local match  requirement for job access planning activities undertaken with  Metropolitan Planning Program and State Planning and Research Program  funds. FTA and FHWA will support requests for waivers when they are  included in metropolitan Unified Planning Work Programs and State  Planning and Research Programs and meet all other appropriate  requirements.     (2) Contributions to the Development of the Census Transportation  Planning Package (CTPP). In conjunction with the increased emphasis on  the use of Census data in the planning process, FTA will permit the  waiver of the local match requirement for activities intended to  contribute to the development of the CTPP. FHWA PL and SPR funds can be  used without match only to purchase the CTPP package through AASHTO.  F. Planning Emphasis Areas for Fiscal Year 2000      The FTA and FHWA cooperatively develop Planning Emphasis Areas  (PEAs) to promote priority themes for consideration, as appropriate, in  metropolitan and statewide transportation planning processes.  Identification as a PEA brings attention to the need for guidance and  training for FTA/FHWA, as well as attention to the allocation of  planning resources by participants in planning processes. Three  planning topics have been identified as PEAs due to their importance in  the coming year: Transportation equity/public involvement, the  Intelligent Transportation Systems National Architecture, and  preparations for the Year 2000 Census. By identifying these as PEAs FTA  and FHWA encourage planning organizations to consider expanding and  reporting on their work activities on these themes. (1) Transportation Equity and Public Involvement     Increasingly, concerns for compliance with provisions of Title VI  of the Civil Rights Act have been raised by citizens and advocacy  groups with regard to broad patterns of transportation investment and  impact considered in metropolitan and statewide planning. While Title  VI and environmental justice concerns have most often been raised  during project development, it is important to recognize that the law  applies equally to the processes and products of metropolitan and  statewide planning. Public involvement is a major element of this  process.     FTA and FHWA are working jointly to develop guidance to support  metropolitan areas and states in their efforts to incorporate  considerations of transportation equity in their local planning  processes and substantiate compliance through demonstrated actions.  States and Metropolitan Planning Organizations in their planning  processes are generally advised to expand and document their efforts in  two categories of work activity:     (a) Expanding the focus of public involvement efforts, with special  attempts to include the traditionally under-served and under- represented in the planning process;     (b) Assessing the distribution of benefits and adverse  environmental impacts at both the plan and project level.     Over the fiscal year, a range of possible procedural and analytical  approaches for complying with provisions of Title VI and the Executive  Order on Environmental Justice at the planning stage will be developed  and disseminated through guidance and regulation. To support that  effort, ``innovative practice'' case study development and training  opportunities will be enhanced, based in part on the reported  activities and experiences of metropolitan and statewide planning  processes in this area. (2) Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) National Architecture     TEA-21 identifies system management and operation as a focal theme  and context for transportation investment nationwide. The Act further  identifies the need for integrated planning and application of ITS  strategies and the role of the ITS National Architecture as a resource  for achieving this functional integration. Section 5206(e) of TEA-21  requires all ITS projects funded through the Highway Trust Fund,  including the Mass Transit Account, to be consistent with the National  Architecture and Standards.     FTA and FHWA have prepared guidance for developing ITS projects and  programs in a coordinated way through metropolitan and statewide  planning processes, using the ITS National Architecture. This guidance  is being disseminated in a number of ways, including training,  technical assistance, and formal regulation. FTA and FHWA will work to  provide assistance to participants in planning processes to facilitate  attention and response to this requirement. (3) Preparing for the Year 2000 Census     As with prior decennial censuses, the Year 2000 Census will be an  invaluable information resource for transportation planning at both the  metropolitan and statewide levels. The journey-to-work and other  socioeconomic data from it will provide a key baseline for a wide range  of planning activities, including regional transportation equity  analyses, job access planning, development and validation of travel  demand models, and more. The Year 2000 census will be especially  important because it will likely be the last to include a ``long form''  questionnaire to collect the types of detailed household, traveler, and  travel information most useful to transportation planning. In future  years, the Bureau of the Census will initiate a program to collect such  data during the next decade as part of a continuous monthly survey  called the American Community Survey. Data from the Year 2000 census  will be critical for states and MPOs to make the transition to American  Community Survey data.     To leverage use of this important information resource, planning  processes need to consider a wide range of ancillary work activities,  including:     <bullet> Aligning census geography with transportation analysis  geography in their areas;     <bullet> Conducting origin/destination and home interview travel  surveys; and     <bullet> Expanding travel monitoring programs to develop  comprehensive area-wide and corridor inventories.  G. Federal Planning Certification Reviews      Federal certification of the planning process is conducted in a  Transportation Management Area (TMA), which is an urbanized area with a  population of 200,000 and above or other urbanized areas designated by  the Secretary of Transportation (the Secretary). The Secretary is  responsible for certifying, at least once every three years, that the  metropolitan transportation planning process in the TMA is being  carried out under applicable provisions of Federal law.     Dates for site visits for the TMAs to be reviewed in fiscal year  2000 are being established and will be available on the  [[Page 58216]]  FTA website at [http://www.fta.dot.gov/office/planning].     For further information regarding Federal certifications of the  planning process contact: For FTA: Mr. Charles Goodman, FTA  Metropolitan Planning Division, (202) 366-1944; or Scott Biehl, FTA  Office of Chief Counsel, (202) 366-4063. For FHWA: Mr. Sheldon Edner,  FHWA Metropolitan Planning Division, 202-366-4066; or Reid Alsop, FHWA  Office of the Chief Counsel, 202-366-1371.  H. Consolidated Planning Grant      In fiscal year 1997, FTA and FHWA began offering states the option  of participating in a pilot Consolidated Planning Grant (CPG) program.  FTA and FHWA have now made CPG a permanent pilot. As part of the  permanent pilot, additional participants are sought so that FTA and  FHWA can benefit from the widest possible range of participant input to  improve and further streamline the process.     Since the first CPG grant was awarded in April 1997, almost $159  million has been obligated by the pilot states. Of this total, more  than $125 million is from FHWA sources. All but one of the participants  have elected to amend the original CPG grant to add new fiscal year  funds to treat the CPG more like an FTA grant, but with even greater  flexibility. Under the multi-year approach option, the CPG grant would  stay open for a period of years to be determined by the state (and MPO,  jointly, for Metropolitan Planning funds) with the approval of the  Federal Government. New apportionments can be added by grant amendment  as funds become available. One state has elected to continue the pilot  with new, separate CPG grants for each year. This approach treats the  CPG much as FHWA funds are treated currently, that is, as basically  annual apportionments with a yearly close-out of project activities and  a deobligation and reobligation cycle. The obligation pattern so far is  somewhat of a hybrid of the two approaches with at least one state  starting out with annual grants and switching in later years to the  multi-year grant approach. Those with the multi-year grants can close  them at any time and begin the next year with either a new multi-year  grant or an annual grant. The ease with which a state can opt for the  single year or the multi-year approach to the CPG grant is just one  example of the flexibility intended for the pilot.     As part of a survey of experiences in the first two years of the  pilot, FTA and FHWA have made two pilot-wide changes in response to  recommendations from participants. States can now report metropolitan  planning expenditures (to comply with the Single Audit Act) for both  FTA and FHWA under the Catalogue of Federal Domestic Assistance (CFDA)  number for FTA's Metropolitan Planning Program. Additionally, for  states with an FHWA Metropolitan Planning fund matching ratio greater  than 80 percent, the state (through FTA) can request a waiver of the 20  percent local share requirement in order that all FTA funds used for  metropolitan planning in a CPG can be granted at the higher, FHWA rate.  For some states, this Federal match rate can exceed 90 percent.     As in previous years, pre-award authority is granted to both of  FTA's planning programs as part of this annual notice. This pre-award  authority enables states to continue planning program activities from  year to year with the assurance that eligible costs can later be  converted to a regularly funded Federal project without the need for  prior approval or authorization from the granting agency. As part of  the pilot, FTA will continue to work with participating states to  increase the flexibility and further streamline the consolidated  approach to planning grants. For further information on participating  in the CPG Pilot, contact Ms. Candace Noonan, Intermodal and Statewide  Planning Division, FTA, at (202) 366-1648 or Anthony Solury, Planning  and Environment Core Business Unit, FHWA, at (202) 366-5003.  I. New Starts Approval to Enter Preliminary Engineering and Final  Design      TEA-21 extends FTA's long-standing authority for approving the  advancement of candidate New Starts projects into preliminary  engineering (PE) by requiring that FTA also approve entrance into the  final design (FD) stage of project development. Specifically, 49 U.S.C.  5309(e)(6) requires that the basis for PE/FD approval is FTA's  evaluation of candidate project's New Start criteria, leading to an  overall project rating of ``Highly Recommended,'' ``Recommended,'' or  ``Not Recommended.'' FTA has established a set of decision rules for  approving entrance into preliminary engineering and final design. After  first meeting several basic planning, environmental, and project  management requirements which demonstrate the ``readiness'' of the  project to advance into the next stage of project development,  candidate projects are subject to FTA evaluation against the New Starts  project justification and local financial commitment criteria. Projects  may advance to the next appropriate stage of project development (PE or  FD) only if rated ``Recommended'' or ``Highly Recommended,'' based on  the criteria. Projects rated ``Not Recommended'' will not be approved  to advance.     49 U.S.C. Section 5309(e)(8)(A) exempts projects which request a  Section 5309 New Starts share of less than $25 million from the  requirements of Section 5309(e). TEA-21 also provides statutory  exemptions to certain specific projects. It is important to note that  any exemption under 5309(e)(8)(A) applies only to the New Starts  criteria serving as the basis for FTA's approval to advance to  preliminary engineering and final design for such projects. New Starts  projects which request less than $25 million in New Starts funding must  still request entrance to the next stage of development, and must  fulfill all appropriate planning, environmental, and project management  requirements.     Aside from the formal evaluation and rating of (non-exempt) New  Starts projects, the general process for approving entrance into FD and  PE is largely consistent with FTA's prior procedures for approving  entrance into preliminary engineering. FTA is revising its guidance for  evaluating and approving local agency requests for advancing projects  in the New Starts project development process. These revised procedures  will be available in fiscal year 2000.  V. Section 5307 Urbanized Area Formula Program  A. Total Urbanized Area Formula Apportionments      In addition to the appropriated fiscal year 2000 Urbanized Area  Formula funds of $2,772,890,281, the apportionment also includes  $4,589,012 in deobligated funds which became available for  reapportionment for the Urbanized Area Formula Program as provided by  49 U.S.C. 5336(i).     Table 4 displays the amount apportioned for the Urbanized Area  Formula Program. After the one-half percent for oversight is set-aside  ($13,864,451), the amount of appropriated funds available for  apportionment is $2,759,025,830. The funds to be reapportioned,  described in the previous paragraph, are then added and increase the  total amount apportioned for this program to $2,763,614,842.     An additional $4,849,950 is appropriated for the Alaska Railroad  for improvements to its passenger operations. After the one-half  percent for oversight is reserved ($24,250),  [[Page 58217]]  $4,825,700 is available for the Alaska Railroad.     Table 12 contains the fiscal year 2000 apportionment formula for  the Section 5307 Urbanized Area Formula Program.  B. Data Used for Urbanized Area Formula Apportionments      Data from the 1998 NTD (49 U.S.C. 5335) Report Year submitted in  late 1998 and early 1999 have been used to calculate the fiscal year  2000 Urbanized Area Formula apportionments for urbanized areas 200,000  in population and over. The population and population density figures  used in calculating the Urbanized Area Formula are from the 1990  Census.  C. Urbanized Area Formula Fiscal Year 2000 Apportionments to Governors      The total Urbanized Area Formula apportionment to the Governor for  use in areas under 200,000 in population for each state is shown in  Table 4. This table also contains the total apportionment amount  attributable to each of the urbanized areas within the state. The  Governor may determine the allocation of funds among the urbanized  areas under 200,000 in population with one exception. As further  discussed below in Section G, funds attributed to an urbanized area  under 200,000 in population, located within the planning boundaries of  a transportation management area, must be obligated in that area.  D. Transit Enhancements      For urbanized areas with populations 200,000 and over, TEA-21  established a minimum annual expenditure requirement of one percent for  transit projects and project elements that qualify as enhancements  under the Urbanized Area Formula Program. Table 4 indicates the amount  set aside for enhancements in these areas. The term ``transit  enhancement'' includes projects or project elements that are designed  to enhance mass transportation service or use and are physically or  functionally related to transit facilities.     (1) Eligible Enhancements. The following are transit projects and  project elements that may be counted to meet the minimum enhancement  expenditure requirement:     (a) Historic preservation, rehabilitation, and operation of  historic mass transportation buildings, structures, and facilities  (including historic bus and railroad facilities);     (b) Bus shelters;     (c) Landscaping and other scenic beautification, including tables,  benches, trash receptacles, and street lights;     (d) Public art;     (e) Pedestrian access and walkways;     (f) Bicycle access, including bicycle storage facilities and  installing equipment for transporting bicycles on mass transportation  vehicles;     (g) Transit connections to parks within the recipient's transit  service area;     (h) Signage; and     (i) Enhanced access for persons with disabilities to mass  transportation.     (2) Requirements. One percent of the Urbanized Area Formula Program  apportionment in each urbanized area with a population of 200,000 and  over must be made available only for transit enhancements. When there  are several grantees in an urbanized area, it is not required that each  grantee spend one percent of its Urbanized Area Formula Program funds  on transit enhancements. Rather, one percent of the urbanized area's  apportionment must be expended on projects and project elements that  qualify as enhancements. If these funds are not obligated for transit  enhancements within three years following the fiscal year in which the  funds are apportioned, the funds will lapse and no longer be available  to the urbanized area, and will be reapportioned under the Urbanized  Area Formula Program.     It will be the responsibility of the MPO to determine how the one  percent will be allotted to transit projects. The one percent minimum  requirement does not preclude more than one percent being expended in  an urbanized area for transit enhancements. Items that are only  eligible as enhancements--in particular, operating costs for historic  facilities--may be assisted only within the one percent fund level.     (3) Project Budget. The project budget for each grant application  that includes enhancement funds must include a scope code for transit  enhancements and specific budget activity line items for transit  enhancements.     (4) Bicycle Access. TEA-21 provides that projects providing bicycle  access to transit assisted with the FTA enhancement apportionment shall  be eligible for a 95 percent Federal share.     (5) Enhanced Access for Persons with Disabilities. Enhancement  projects or elements of projects designed to enhance access for persons  with disabilities must go beyond the requirements contained in the  Americans with Disabilities Act.     (6) Enhancement Report. The recipient must submit a report to the  appropriate FTA Regional Office listing the projects or elements of  projects carried out with those funds during the previous fiscal year  and the amount awarded. The report must be submitted in the Federal  fiscal year's final quarterly report, in the Transportation Electronic  Awards and Management System (TEAM). The report should include the  following elements: (a) grantee name, (b) urbanized area name and  number, (c) FTA project number, (d) transit enhancement category, (e)  brief description of enhancement and progress towards project  implementation, (f) activity line item code from the approved budget,  and (g) amount awarded by FTA for the enhancement.  E. Fiscal Year 2000 Operating Assistance      Fiscal year 2000 funding for operating assistance is available only  to urbanized areas with populations under 200,000. For these areas,  there is no limitation on the amount of the state apportionment that  may be used for operating assistance, and the Federal/local share ratio  is 50/50.     TEA-21 provided two exceptions to the prohibition on operating  assistance in areas over 200,000 in population. These areas were  identified and addressed in fiscal year 1999.  F. Carryover Funds for Operating Assistance      Carryover funds for fiscal years 1997-1998, which were eligible for  use as operating assistance are still available for operating  assistance. However, the operating assistance limitations remain on the  unused fiscal years 1997-1998 funds. These funds continue to be  available for obligation at the Federal/local share ratio of 50/50 in  fiscal year 2000 and throughout the period of availability. For unused  fiscal year 1998 funds for areas under 200,000, operating assistance as  a capital project with an 80 percent federal match ratio (without  limitation) will continue to be available throughout the period of  availability.  G. Designated Transportation Management Areas      All urbanized areas over 200,000 in population have been designated  as transportation management areas (TMAs), in accordance with 49 U.S.C.  Section 5305. These designations were formally made in a Federal  Register Notice dated May 18, 1992 (57 FR 21160), signed by the Federal  Highway Administrator and the Federal Transit Administrator. Additional  areas have been designated as TMAs upon the request of the Governor and  the MPO designated for such area or the affected local officials.  During fiscal year 1999, one addition to an existing TMA was formally  designated: Titusville, Florida,  [[Page 58218]]  is included within the boundaries of the Melbourne/Palm Bay, Florida  TMA.     Guidance for setting the boundaries of TMAs is contained in the  joint transportation planning regulations codified at 23 CFR part 450  and 49 CFR part 613. In some cases, the TMA boundaries, which have been  established by the MPO for the designated TMA, also include one or more  urbanized areas with less than 200,000 in population. Where this  situation exists, the discretion of the Governor to allocate Urbanized  Area Formula program ``Governor's Apportionment'' funds for urbanized  areas with less than 200,000 in population is restricted.     As required by 49 U.S.C. 5307(a)(2), a recipient(s) must be  designated to dispense the Urbanized Area Formula funds attributable to  TMAs. Those urbanized areas that do not already have a designated  recipient must name one and notify the appropriate FTA regional office  of the designation. This includes those urbanized areas with less than  200,000 in population that may receive TMA designation independently,  or those with less than 200,000 in population which are currently  included within the boundaries of a larger designated TMA. In both  cases, the Governor only has discretion to allocate Governor's  Apportionment funds attributable to areas which are outside of  designated TMA boundaries. In order for the FTA and Governors to know  which urbanized areas under 200,000 in population are included within  the boundaries of an existing TMA, and so that they can be identified  in future Federal Register notices, each MPO whose TMA planning  boundaries include these smaller urbanized areas is asked to identify  such areas to the FTA. This notification should be made in writing to  the Associate Administrator for Program Management, Federal Transit  Administration, 400 Seventh Street, SW, Washington, DC 20590, no later  than July 1 of each fiscal year. To date, FTA has been notified of the  following urbanized areas with less than 200,000 in population that are  included within the planning boundaries of designated TMAs:  ------------------------------------------------------------------------                                   Small urbanized area included in TMA         Designated TMA                         boundaries ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Baltimore, Maryland..........  Annapolis, Maryland. Dallas-Fort Worth, Texas.....  Denton, Texas; Lewisville, Texas. Houston, Texas...............  Galveston, Texas; Texas City, Texas. Orlando, Florida.............  Kissimmee, Florida. Melbourne-Palm Bay, Florida..  Titusville, Florida. Philadelphia, Pennsylvania...  Pottstown, Pennsylvania. Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.....  Monessen, Pennsylvania; Steubenville-                                 Weirton, OH-WV-PA (PA portion). Seattle, Washington..........  Bremerton, Washington. Washington, DC-MD-VA.........  Frederick, Maryland (MD portion). ------------------------------------------------------------------------  H. Urbanized Area Formula Funds Used for Highway Purposes      Urbanized Area Formula funds apportioned to a TMA are also  available for highway projects if the following three conditions are  met: (1) such use must be approved by the MPO in writing after  appropriate notice and opportunity for comment and appeal are provided  to affected transit providers; (2) in the determination of the  Secretary, such funds are not needed for investments required by the  Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA); and (3) the MPO  determines that local transit needs are being addressed.     Urbanized Area Formula funds that are designated for highway  projects will be transferred to and administered by the FHWA. The MPO  should notify FTA of its intent to program FTA funds for highway  purposes.  I. National Transit Database Internet Reporting      The National Transit Database (NTD) is FTA's national database for  statistics on the transit industry. Each year, FTA grantees use  diskettes to report on their operating and financial statistics to FTA.  These grantees receive formula funds based, in part, on the statistics  they submit. NTD data is summarized and used to report to Congress on  the performance of the transit industry and to assess whether FTA goals  have been met. In addition, a profile report is produced for each  transit authority that submits data. NTD profile report data is often  used in transit planning. These annual NTD summary reports and profile  reports have been available on FTA's website for several years.     During the fall of 1999, FTA will begin testing a new Internet  reporting system to replace diskette reporting. A number of agencies  have volunteered to test this new system of transit operator data input  via the Internet. Internet reporting should speed data collection and  validation. Internet reporting is scheduled to begin in the fall of  year 2000.  VI. Section 5311 Nonurbanized Area Formula Program and Section  5311(b)(2) Rural Transit Assistance Program (RTAP)  A. Nonurbanized Area Formula Program      The fiscal year 2000 Nonurbanized Area Formula apportionments to  the states total $192,717,384 and are displayed in Table 5. Of the  $193,612,968 appropriated, one-half percent ($968,065) was reserved for  oversight. In addition to the current appropriation, the funds  available for apportionment included $72,481 in deobligated funds from  fiscal years prior to 2000. The population figures used in calculating  these apportionments are from the 1990 Census.     The Nonurbanized Formula Program provides capital, operating and  administrative assistance for areas under 50,000 in population. Each  state must spend no less than 15 percent of its fiscal year 2000  Nonurbanized Area Formula apportionment for the development and support  of intercity bus transportation, unless the Governor certifies to the  Secretary that the intercity bus service needs of the state are being  adequately met. Fiscal year 2000 Nonurbanized Area Formula grant  applications must reflect this level of programming for intercity bus  or include a certification from the Governor.  B. Rural Transit Assistance Program (RTAP)      The fiscal year 2000 RTAP apportionments to the states total  $4,800,180 and are also displayed on Table 5. This amount includes  $4,725,000 in fiscal year 2000 appropriated funds, and $75,180 in prior  year deobligated funds, which are available for reapportionment.     Of the total $5,250,000 authorized and appropriated for RTAP in  fiscal year 2000, FTA set-aside 10 percent in order to fund RTAP  activities carried out at  [[Page 58219]]  the national level. Due to the limited amount of discretionary funds  available this year in the national planning and research program, FTA  elected to fund both state and national components from the RTAP  appropriation in order to ensure the continuity of national program  activities, such as the Transit Resource Center and production and  distribution of training materials that support the various states'  RTAP activities.     All states will notice a reduction in their apportionment compared  to fiscal year 1999 as a result of the 10 percent takedown. However,  the impact on the larger states is proportionately greater because the  formula includes a minimum allocation of $65,000 to each state. For  most states, however, the fiscal year 2000 allocation is greater than,  or only slightly less than, their apportionment in fiscal year 1998.     The funds are allocated to the states to undertake research,  training, technical assistance, and other support services to meet the  needs of transit operators in nonurbanized areas. These funds are to be  used in conjunction with the states' administration of the Nonurbanized  Area Formula Program.  VII. Section 5310 Elderly and Persons With Disabilities Program      A total of $72,986,415 is apportioned to the states for fiscal year  2000 for the Elderly and Persons with Disabilities Program. In addition  to the fiscal year 2000 appropriation of $72,946,801, the fiscal year  2000 apportionment also includes $39,614 in prior year unobligated  funds, which are available for reapportionment under the Elderly and  Persons with Disabilities Program. Table 6 shows each state's  apportionment.     The formula for apportioning these funds uses 1990 Census  population data for persons aged 65 and over and for persons with  disabilities.     The funds provide capital assistance for transportation for elderly  persons and persons with disabilities. Eligible capital expenses may  include, at the option of the recipient, the acquisition of  transportation services by a contract, lease, or other arrangement.     While the assistance is intended primarily for private non-profit  organizations, public bodies that coordinate services for the elderly  and persons with disabilities, or any public body that certifies to the  state that there are no non-profit organizations in the area that are  readily available to carry out the service, may receive these funds.     These funds may be transferred by the Governor to supplement the  Urbanized Area Formula or Nonurbanized Area Formula capital funds  during the last 90 days of the fiscal year.  VIII. Surface Transportation Program and Congestion Mitigation and  Air Quality Flexible Funds Used for Transit Purposes (Title 23,  U.S.C.)  A. Transfer Process      TEA-21 made changes in how funds are to be transferred from FHWA to  FTA. Section 1103(i) of TEA-21, as amended, provides that when funds  are transferred or ``flexed,'' obligation authority will be transferred  to the receiving agency. Under ISTEA obligation authority was not  transferred.     Effective October 1, 1999, new procedures were implemented to  accommodate this change for fiscal year 2000 and subsequent years. The  transfer process is described below.     Transfer from FHWA to FTA. Flexible funds designated for use in  transit projects must result from the metropolitan and state planning  and programming process, and must be included in an approved State  Transportation Improvement Program (STIP) before the funds can be  transferred. To initiate the process the grantee must submit a  completed application to the FTA regional office and notify the State  Highway Agency that it has submitted an application that requires a  transfer of funds. By letter, the State Highway Agencies (SHA) request  the transfer of highway funds for a transit project(s) through their  FHWA Division. The letter should specify the project, amount to be  transferred, apportionment year, State, federal aid apportionment  category (i.e. Surface Transportation Program (STP), Congestion  Mitigation and Air Quality (CMAQ), Interstate Substitute, or Other-- Earmarks), and a description of the project as contained in the STIP.     The FHWA Division Office confirms that the apportionment amount is  available for transfer and concurs in the transfer by letter to the  State Highway Agency and FTA. FHWA then transfers obligation authority  and an equal amount of cash to FTA. All CMAQ or STP, or Other funds  (FHWA earmarks) will be transferred to one of the three FTA formula  programs (i.e. Urbanized Area Formula (Section 5307), Nonurbanized Area  Formula (Section 5311) or Elderly and Persons with Disabilities  (Section 5310).     The FTA grantee application for the project must specify which  transit program (title 49 U.S.C. section) funds will be utilized and  the application should be prepared in conformance with the requirements  and procedures governing that section. Upon review and approval of the  grantee's application, FTA obligates funds for the project.     The flexible funds are treated as FTA formula funds, although they  retain a special identifying code. The funds may be used for any  purpose eligible under the FTA formula programs. CMAQ funds, however,  have to be used for air quality purposes and some eligible projects are  defined by the Clean Air Act. All FTA requirements are applicable to  transferred funds. Flexible funds should be combined with regular FTA  funds in a single annual grant application.     Transfers from FTA to FHWA. The Metropolitan Planning Organization  (MPO) submits a request to the FTA Regional Office for a transfer of  FTA Section 5307 formula funds (apportioned to an urbanized area  200,000 and over in population) to FHWA based on its approved use for  highway purposes, as contained in the State governor's approved multi- year STIP document. The MPO must certify that: (1) the funds are not  needed for capital investments required by the Americans with  Disabilities Act; (2) notice and opportunity for comment and appeal has  been provided to affected transit providers; and (3) local funds used  for non-Federal match are eligible to provide assistance for either  highway or transit projects. The FTA Regional Administrator reviews and  concurs in the request then forwards the approval to FTA Headquarters,  where the grantee's formula apportionmment is reduced, in TEAM (FTA's  electronic grant making and management system), by the dollar amount  being transferred to FHWA.     For information regarding these procedures, please contact Kristen  D. Clarke, FTA Budget Division at (202) 366-2918 or Fred Gessler, FHWA  Finance Division at (202) 366-2847.  B. Matching Share for Flexible Funds      The provisions of Title 23, U.S.C. regarding the non-Federal share  apply to Title 23 funds used for transit projects. Thus, flexible funds  transferred to FTA retain the same matching share that the funds would  have if used for highway purposes and administered by the FHWA.     There are three instances in which a higher than 80 percent Federal  share would be maintained. First, in states with large areas of Indian  and certain public domain lands, and national forests, parks and  monuments, the local share for highway projects is determined by a  sliding scale rate, calculated based on the percentage of public lands  within that state. This sliding scale, which permits a greater  [[Page 58220]]  Federal share, but not to exceed 95 percent, is applicable to transit  projects funded with flexible funds in these public land states. FHWA  develops the sliding scale matching ratios for the increased Federal  share.     Secondly, commuter carpooling and vanpooling projects and transit  safety projects using flexible funds administered by FTA may retain the  same 100 percent Federal share that would be allowed for ride-sharing  or safety projects administered by the FHWA.     The third instance includes the 100 percent Federal safety  projects; however, these are subject to a nationwide 10 percent program  limitation.  IX. Section 5309 Capital Investment Program  A. Fixed Guideway Modernization      The formula for allocating the Fixed Guideway Modernization funds  contains seven tiers. The allocation of funding under the first four  tiers, through fiscal year 2003, will be based on data used to  apportion the funding in fiscal year 1997. Funding under the last three  tiers will be apportioned based on the latest available route miles and  revenue vehicle miles on segments at least seven years old as reported  to the National Transit Database.     Table 7 displays the fiscal year 2000 Fixed Guideway Modernization  apportionments. Fixed Guideway Modernization funds apportioned for this  section must be used for capital projects to maintain, modernize, or  improve fixed guideway systems.     All urbanized areas with fixed guideway systems that are at least  seven years old are eligible to receive Fixed Guideway Modernization  funds. A request for the start-up service dates for fixed guideways has  been incorporated into the National Transit Database reporting system  to ensure that all eligible fixed guideway data is included in the  calculation of the apportionments. A threshold level of more than one  mile of fixed guideway is required to receive Fixed Guideway  Modernization funds. Therefore, urbanized areas reporting one mile or  less of Fixed Guideway mileage under the National Transit Database are  not included.     For fiscal year 2000, $980,400,000 was appropriated for fixed  guideway modernization. After deducting the three-fourth percent for  oversight ($7,353,000), $973,047,000 is available for apportionment to  the specified urbanized areas.     Each year, the new fixed guideway modernization formula will  allocate funds by seven tiers. A listing of the tiers and the funds  available under each are delineated in Table 13. For tiers 5, 6, and 7,  allocations will be based on the latest available route miles and  revenue vehicle miles for fixed guideway segments at least seven years  old as reported to the National Transit Database.  B. New Starts      The fiscal year 2000 appropriation for New Starts is $980,400,000,  which was fully allocated in the fiscal year 2000 DOT Appropriations  Act. However, by statute, this amount is reduced by three-fourth  percent ($7,353,000) for oversight activities, leaving $973,047,000  available for allocations to projects. The oversight reduction was  applied on a pro-rata basis to all projects specified in the fiscal  year 2000 DOT Appropriations Act, yielding the final allocation for  each project as shown in Table 8 of this notice. Prior year unobligated  appropriations for New Starts in the amount of $542,823,668 remain  available for obligation in fiscal year 2000. These carryover amounts  are displayed in Table 8A.  C. Bus      The fiscal year 2000 appropriation for Bus is $490,200,000 for the  purchase of buses, bus-related equipment and paratransit vehicles, and  for the construction of bus-related facilities. TEA-21 established a  $100,000,000 Clean Fuels Formula Program under Section 5308. The  program is authorized to be funded with $50,000,000 from the Bus  category of the Capital Investment Program, and $50,000,000 from the  Formula Program. However, the fiscal year 2000 DOT Appropriations Act  directs FTA to transfer $50,000,000 appropriated under the Formula  Program to and merge it with funding provided for the Bus category of  the Capital Investment Program. Thus, $540,200,000 of funds  appropriated in fiscal year 2000 are available for funding the Bus  category of the Capital Program. After deducting the three-fourth  percent for oversight ($4,051,500) the amount of fiscal year 2000  appropriated funds available for allocation is $536,148,500. Prior year  unobligated funds directed by Congress to be reallocated in the amount  of $1,199,750 are then added and increase the total amount allocated to  $537,348,250 under the Bus category.     The 2000 DOT Appropriations Act allocated all of the fiscal year  2000 Bus funds to specified states or localities for bus and bus- related projects.     Because the three-fourth percent for oversight was subtracted from  the amount appropriated in the DOT Appropriations Act and not the  reallocated funds, each bus project receives less than the funding  level contained in the DOT Appropriations Act. No funds remain  available for discretionary allocation by the Federal Transit  Administrator. Table 9 displays the allocations of the fiscal year 2000  Bus funds by area.     Prior year unobligated appropriations for Bus Program earmarks in  the amount of $472,955,785 remain available for obligation in fiscal  year 2000, and are displayed in Table 9A.     For Section 5309 projects funding battery electric, hybrid electric  or fuel cell vehicles, FTA intends to ask for additional information as  part of project quarterly progress reports. Grantees will be advised of  the specifics of this at a later date. See section XII, Clean Fuels  Formula Program, for a discussion of this proposal.  X. Job Access and Reverse Commute Program      The fiscal year 2000 appropriation for the Job Access and Reverse  Commute Program is $75,000,000. Of this amount $49,570,000 has been  allocated to projects specified in the fiscal year 2000 Conference  report. These allocations are listed in Table 10.     This program, established under TEA-21, provides funding for the  provision of transportation services designed to increase access to  jobs and employment-related activities. Job Access projects are those  which transport welfare recipients and low-income individuals in urban,  suburban, or rural areas to and from jobs and activities related to  their employment. Reverse Commute projects provide transportation  services for the general public from urban, suburban, and rural areas  to suburban employment opportunities. A total of $10 million from the  appropriation can be used for Reverse Commute Projects.     One of the goals of the Job Access and Reverse Commute program is  to increase collaboration among transportation providers, human service  agencies, employers, metropolitan planning organizations, states, and  affected communities and individuals. All projects funded under this  program must be derived from an area-wide Job Access and Reverse  Commute Transportation Plan, developed through a regional approach  which supports the implementation of a variety of transportation  services designed to connect welfare recipients to jobs and related  activities. A key element of the  [[Page 58221]]  program is making the most efficient use of existing public, nonprofit  and private transportation service providers.     In fiscal year 1999, FTA undertook a national solicitation of  applications for this program and established a competitive process to  review all applications. As a result of this process, FTA selected 179  different projects in agencies and organizations in 42 states for  funding.     A separate Federal Register Notice providing program guidance and  application procedures for fiscal year 2000 will be issued for the  program. The notice will be also available on the FTA website.  XI. Over-the-Road Bus Accessibility Program      The amount available for the Over-the-Road Bus Accessibility (OTRB)  Program in fiscal year 2000 is $3,710,000. In addition to $3,700,000  appropriated for fiscal year 2000, $10,000 remaining from the fiscal  year 1999 appropriation is available for award in fiscal year 2000. Of  the $3,710,000 available for the program, $2,010,000 is available to  providers of intercity fixed-route service, and $1,700,000 is available  to other providers of the over-the-road bus services, including local  fixed-route service, commuter service, and charter and tour service.     The Over-the-road Bus (OTRB) Accessibility program authorizes FTA  to make grants to operators of over-the-road buses to help finance the  incremental capital and training costs of complying with the DOT over- the-road bus accessibility final rule, published in a Federal Register  Notice on September 24, 1998. FTA conducts a national solicitation of  applications and grantees are selected on a competitive basis.     In fiscal year 1999, the first year in which the program was  implemented, a total of $2 million was available to intercity fixed- route providers. FTA selected 11 applicants from among the 20  applications submitted for funding incremental capital and training  costs.     A separate Federal Register Notice providing program guidance and  application procedures for fiscal year 2000 will be issued for this  program. The notice will be available on the FTA website.  XII. Clean Fuels Formula Program      TEA-21 established a $100,000,000 Clean Fuels Formula Grant Program  under Section 5308 to assist non-attainment and maintenance areas in  achieving or maintaining attainment status and to support markets for  emerging clean fuel technologies. Under the program, public transit  agencies in maintenance and non-attainment areas (as defined by the  EPA) were to apply for formula funds to acquire clean fuel vehicles, to  repower or retrofit engines for clean fuels operation, and to construct  or improve facilities to support clean fuel vehicles. The legislation  specified the program to be funded with $50,000,000 from the Bus  category of the Capital Investment Program, and $50,000,000 from the  Formula Program. The fiscal year 2000 DOT Appropriations Act transfers  $50,000,000 appropriated under the Formula Program to and merges it  with funding provided for the replacement, rehabilitation and purchase  of buses and related equipment and the construction of bus related  facilities under the Bus category of the Capital Investment Program. In  addition, in fiscal years 1999 and 2000 Congress allocated the entire  Bus category, including the $100,000,000, which TEA-21 provides for  funding of the Clean Fuels Formula Program. The appropriation actions  of Congress override the provisions established in TEA-21 for the Clean  Fuels Formula Program. Therefore, FTA cannot implement this new program  in fiscal year 2000. The fiscal year 2000 Bus Allocations on Table 9  include the funding which would have been available for the Clean Fuels  Formula Program under TEA-21.     While the Clean Fuels Formula Program was not funded by Congress in  fiscal year 2000, as in fiscal year 1999, FTA supports the objectives  of the program and is interested in collecting relevant information on  the operations and performance of clean fuel technology buses in  revenue service to help assess the reliability, benefits, and costs of  these technologies compared to conventional vehicle technologies, and  to provide more accurate information to transit agencies for future  clean fuel and advanced propulsion vehicle purchases. It was FTA's  intent to require grantees receiving Clean Fuels Formula funds for  projects to purchase or lease buses powered by advanced propulsion  technologies (e.g. battery electric, hybrid electric and fuel cell  powered vehicles) to provide information to FTA on the operations,  performance and maintenance of those vehicles. Since the Clean Fuels  Formula Program was not funded in fiscal year 2000, but rather funds  were allocated as part of the capital program for bus, FTA intends to  require grantees receiving capital funds to purchase or lease buses  powered by advanced propulsion technologies (battery electric, hybrid  electric, and fuel cell) to report to FTA information that will further  the state of the industry's knowledge about operation of these advanced  technologies. Grantees receiving funds to purchase or lease alternative  fuel technologies such as CNG or LNG may voluntarily provide similar  information. Grantees will be advised of the new reporting requirements  for the Section 5309 program for these specific bus technologies in the  near future.  XIII. Unit Values of Data for the Section 5307 Urbanized Area  Formula Program, Section 5311 Nonurbanized Area Formula Program,  and Section 5309 Capital Fixed Guideway Modernization      The dollar unit values of data derived from the computations of the  Urbanized Area Formula Program, the Nonurbanized Area Formula Program,  and the Capital Investment Program--Fixed Guideway Modernization  apportionments are displayed in Table 14 of this notice. To determine  how an apportionment amount was computed for an area, multiply its  population, population density, and data from the NTD by the unit  values.  XIV. Period of Availability of Funds      The funds apportioned under the Metropolitan Planning Program and  the State Planning and Research Program, the Urbanized Area Formula  Program, and the Fixed Guideway Modernization Program, in this notice,  will remain available to be obligated by FTA to recipients for three  fiscal years following fiscal year 2000. Any of these apportioned funds  unobligated at the close of business on September 30, 2003 will revert  to FTA for reapportionment under these respective programs.     Funds apportioned to nonurbanized areas under the Nonurbanized Area  Formula Program, including RTAP funds, will remain available for two  fiscal years following fiscal year 2000. Any such funds remaining  unobligated at the close of business on September 30, 2002, will revert  to FTA for reapportionment among the states under the Nonurbanized Area  Formula Program. Funds allocated to states under the Elderly and  Persons with Disabilities Program in this notice must be obligated by  September 30, 2000. Any such funds remaining unobligated as of this  date will revert to FTA for reapportionment among the states under the  Elderly and Persons with Disabilities Program. The fiscal year 2000 DOT  Appropriations Act includes a provision requiring that fiscal year 2000  New Starts and Bus funds not obligated for their original purpose as of  September 30, 2002, shall be made  [[Page 58222]]  available for other discretionary projects within the respective  categories of the Capital Investment Program.  XV. Automatic Pre-Award Authority To Incur Project Costs  A. Policy      FTA provides blanket or automatic pre-award authority to cover  certain program areas described below. This pre-award authority allows  grantees to incur project costs prior to grant approval and retain  their eligibility for subsequent reimbursement after grant approval.  The grantee assumes all risk and is responsible for ensuring that all  conditions, which are described below, are met to retain eligibility.  This automatic pre-award spending authority permits a grantee to incur  costs on an eligible transit capital or planning project without  prejudice to possible future Federal participation in the cost of the  project or projects. Prior to exercising pre-award authority, grantees  must comply with the conditions and Federal requirements outlined in  paragraphs B and C immediately below. Failure to do so will render an  otherwise eligible project ineligible for FTA financial assistance. In  addition, grantees are strongly encouraged to consult with the  appropriate regional office if there could be any question regarding  the eligibility of the project for future FTA funds or the  applicability of the conditions and Federal requirements.     Authority to incur costs for fiscal year 1998 Fixed Guideway  Modernization, Metropolitan Planning, Urbanized Area Formula, Elderly  and Persons with Disabilities, Nonurbanized Area Formula, STP or CMAQ  flexible funds to be transferred from the FHWA and State Planning and  Research Programs in advance of possible future Federal participation  was provided in the December 5, 1997, Federal Register Notice. Pre- award authority was extended in the June 24, 1998 Federal Register  Notice on TEA-21 to all formula funds and flexible funds that will be  apportioned during the authorization period of TEA-21, 1998-2003. Pre- award authority also applies to Capital Investment Bus allocations  identified in this notice. Pre-award authority does not apply to  Capital New Start funds, or to Capital Investment Bus projects not  specified in this or previous notices, except as described in D. below.  Pre-award authority also applies to preventive maintenance costs  incurred within a local fiscal year ending during calendar year 1997,  or thereafter, under the formula programs cited above.     For Section 5309 Capital Investment Bus projects, the date that  costs may be incurred is the date that the appropriation bill in which  they are contained is enacted. For blanket pre-award authority in  formula programs described above, the effective date is June 9, 1998.  B. Conditions      Similar to the FTA Letter of No Prejudice (LONP) authority, the  conditions under which this authority may be utilized are specified  below:     (1) The pre-award authority is not a legal or moral commitment that  the project(s) will be approved for FTA assistance or that FTA will  obligate Federal funds. Furthermore, it is not a legal or moral  commitment that all items undertaken by the applicant will be eligible  for inclusion in the project(s).     (2) All FTA statutory, procedural, and contractual requirements  must be met.     (3) No action will be taken by the grantee that prejudices the  legal and administrative findings which the Federal Transit  Administrator must make in order to approve a project.     (4) Local funds expended by the grantee pursuant to and after the  date of the pre-award authority will be eligible for credit toward  local match or reimbursement if FTA later makes a grant for the  project(s) or project amendment(s).     (5) The Federal amount of any future FTA assistance awarded to the  grantee for the project will be determined on the basis of the overall  scope of activities and the prevailing statutory provisions with  respect to the Federal/local match ratio at the time the funds are  obligated.     (6) For funds to which the pre-award authority applies, the  authority expires with the lapsing of the fiscal year funds.  C. Environmental, Planning, and Other Federal Requirements      FTA emphasizes that all of the Federal grant requirements must be  met for the project to remain eligible for Federal funding. Some of  these requirements must be met before pre-award costs are incurred,  notably the requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act  (NEPA), and the planning requirements. Compliance with NEPA and other  environmental laws or executive orders (e.g., protection of parklands,  wetlands, historic properties) must be completed before state or local  funds are spent on implementing activities such as final design,  construction, and acquisition for a project that is expected to be  subsequently funded with FTA funds. Depending on which class the  project is included under in FTA environmental regulations (23 CFR part  771), the grantee may not advance the project beyond planning and  preliminary engineering before FTA has issued either a categorical  exclusion (refer to 23 CFR part 771.117(d)), a finding of no  significant impact, or a final environmental impact statement. The  conformity requirements of the Clean Air Act (40 CFR part 93) also must  be fully met before the project may be advanced with non-Federal funds.     Similarly, the requirement that a project be included in a locally  adopted metropolitan transportation improvement program and federally  approved statewide transportation improvement program must be followed  before the project may be advanced with non-Federal funds. In addition,  Federal procurement procedures, as well as the whole range of Federal  requirements, must be followed for projects in which Federal funding  will be sought in the future. Failure to follow any such requirements  could make the project ineligible for Federal funding. In short, this  increased administrative flexibility requires a grantee to make certain  that no Federal requirements are circumvented through the use of pre- award authority. If a grantee has questions or concerns regarding the  environmental requirements, or any other Federal requirements that must  be met before incurring costs, it should contact the appropriate  regional office.     Before an applicant may incur costs either for activities expected  to be funded by New Start funds, or for Bus Capital projects not listed  in this notice or previous notices, it must first obtain a written LONP  from FTA. To obtain an LONP, a grantee must submit a written request  accompanied by adequate information and justification to the  appropriate FTA regional office.  D. Extension of Pre-Award Authority to New Start Projects Approved for  Preliminary Engineering and/or Final Design      New Starts Projects are required to follow a federally defined  planning process. This process includes, among other things, FTA  approval of entry of a project into preliminary engineering and  approval to enter final design. The grantee requests for entry into  preliminary engineering and the request for entry into final design  both document the project and how it meets the New Starts criteria in  detail. With FTA approval to enter preliminary engineering, and  subsequently approval to enter final design, FTA will automatically  extend pre-award authority to that phase of project development. The  pre-award authority  [[Page 58223]]  to incur costs for final design is strictly limited to design work. No  capital items or right of way acquisition is included in this blanket  pre-award authority.     This is a new provision and is intended to streamline and eliminate  duplicative and unnecessary paperwork and reinforce the importance of  these new starts approval actions. New Starts construction or right-of- way acquisition as well as New Starts planning funded with Section 5309  funds not covered by preliminary engineering or final design approval  still need to request letters of no prejudice as described below.  XVI. Letter of No Prejudice Policy (Prior Approval of Pre-Award  Authority)  A. Policy      Letter of No Prejudice (LONP) Policy authority allows an applicant  to incur costs on a future project utilizing non-Federal resources with  the understanding that the costs incurred subsequent to the issuance of  the LONP may be reimbursable as eligible expenses or eligible for  credit toward the local match should the FTA approve the project at a  later date. LONPs are applicable to projects not covered by automatic  pre-award authority. The majority of LONPs will be for Section 5309 New  Starts funds not covered under a full funding grant agreement or for  Section 5309 Bus funds not yet appropriated by Congress. At the end of  an authorization period, there may be LONPs for formula funds beyond  the life of the current authorization.     Under most circumstances the LONP will cover the total project.  Under certain circumstances the LONP may be issued for local match  only. In such cases the local match would be to permit real estate to  be used for match for the project at a later date.  B. Conditions      The following conditions apply to all LONPs.     (1) LONP pre-award authority is not a legal or moral commitment  that the project(s) will be approved for FTA assistance or that FTA  will obligate Federal funds. Furthermore, it is not a legal or moral  commitment that all items undertaken by the applicant will be eligible  for inclusion in the project(s).     (2) All FTA statutory, procedural, and contractual requirements  must be met.     (3) No action will be taken by the grantee that prejudices the  legal and administrative findings which the Federal Transit  Administrator must make in order to approve a project.     (4) Local funds expended by the grantee pursuant to and after the  date of the LONP will be eligible for credit toward local match or  reimbursement if FTA later makes a grant for the project(s) or project  amendment(s).     (5) The Federal amount of any future FTA assistance to the grantee  for the project will be determined on the basis of the overall scope of  activities and the prevailing statutory provisions with respect to the  Federal/local match ratio at the time the funds are obligated.     (6) For funds to which this pre-award authority applies, the  authority expires with the lapsing of the fiscal year funds.  C. Environmental, Planning, and Other Federal Requirements      As with automatic pre-award authority, FTA emphasizes that all of  the Federal grant requirements must be met for the project to remain  eligible for Federal funding. Some of these requirements must be met  before pre-award costs are incurred, notably the requirements of the  National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), and the planning  requirements. Compliance with NEPA and other environmental laws or  executive orders (e.g., protection of parklands, wetlands, historic  properties) must be completed before state or local funds are spent on  implementation activities such as final design, construction, or  acquisition for a project expected to be subsequently funded with FTA  funds. Depending on which class the project is included under in FTA's  environmental regulations (23 CFR part 771), the grantee may not  advance the project beyond planning and preliminary engineering before  FTA has approved either a categorical exclusion (refer to 23 CFR part  771.117(d)), a finding of no significant impact, or a final  environmental impact statement. The conformity requirements of the  Clean Air Act (40 CFR part 93) also must be fully met before the  project may be advanced with non-Federal funds.     Similarly, the requirement that a project be included in a locally  adopted metropolitan transportation improvement program and federally  approved statewide transportation improvement program must be followed  before the project may be advanced with non-Federal funds. In addition,  Federal procurement procedures, as well as the whole range of Federal  requirements, must be followed for projects in which Federal funding  will be sought in the future. Failure to follow any such requirements  could make the project ineligible for Federal funding. In short, this  pre-award authority requires a grantee to make certain that no Federal  requirements are circumvented. If a grantee has questions or concerns  regarding the environmental requirements, or any other Federal  requirements that must be met before incurring costs, it should contact  the appropriate regional office.  D. Request for LONP      Before an applicant may incur costs for a project not covered by  automatic pre-award authority, it must first submit a written request  for an LONP to the appropriate regional office. This written request  must include a description of the project for which pre-award authority  is desired and a justification for the request.  XVII.

XVIII. FTA Fiscal Year 2000 Annual List of Certifications and  Assurances      The Fiscal Year 2000 Annual List of Certifications and Assurances  is published in conjunction with the Apportionments, as per 49 U.S.C.  section 5307(k). It appears as a separate  [[Page 58224]]  Part of the Federal Register on the same date whenever possible. The  fiscal year 2000 list contains several changes to the previous year's  Federal Register publication. As in previous years, the grant applicant  should certify electronically. Under certain circumstances the  Applicant may enter its PIN number in lieu of an electronic signature  provided by its Attorney, provided the Applicant has on file the  current Affirmation of its Attorney in writing dated this Federal  fiscal year. The applicant is advised to contact the appropriate FTA  Regional Office for electronic procedure information.     The fiscal year 2000 Annual List of Certifications and Assurances  is accessible on the Internet at: http://www.fta.dot.gov/. Any  questions regarding this document may be addressed to the appropriate  Regional Office.  XIX. Grant Application Procedures      All applications for FTA funds should be submitted to the  appropriate FTA Regional Office. FTA utilizes an electronic grant  application system known as TEAM and all applications should be  filed   electronically. FTA has provided exceptions to the requirement for  electronic filing of applications for certain new, non-traditional  grantees in the Job Access and Reverse Commute and Over the Road Bus  programs as well as to a few grantees who have not successfully  connected to or accessed TEAM. Formula and Capital Investment grant  applications should be prepared in conformance with the following FTA  Circulars: Program Guidance and Application Instructions for  Metropolitan Planning Program Grants--C8100.1B, October 25, 1996;  Urbanized Area Formula Program: Grant Application Instructions-- C9030.1C, October 1, 1998; Nonurbanized Area Formula Program Guidance  and Grant Application Instructions--C9040.1E, October 1, 1998; Section  5310 Elderly and Persons with Disabilities Program Guidance and  Application Instructions C9070.1E, October 1, 1998; and Section 5309  Capital Program: Grant Application Instructions--C9300.1A, October 1,  1998. Guidance on preparation of applications for State Planning and  Research funds may be obtained from each FTA Regional Office. Copies of  circulars are available from FTA Regional Offices as well as the FTA  Home Page on the Internet.     Applications for STP or CMAQ ``flexible'' fund grants should be  prepared in the same manner as for funds under the program to which  they are being transferred. The application for flexible funds needs to  specifically indicate the type and amount of flexible funds being  transferred to FTA. The application should also describe which items  are being funded with flexible funds, consistent with the Statewide  Transportation Improvement Program (STIP).      Issued on: October 21, 1999.
