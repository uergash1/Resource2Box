These records are open to public view under Wisconsin's Open Records law, sections 19.31-19.39, Wisconsin Statutes.                                                                       Please read this agreement prior to using WCCA:                                                                                           Records not open to public inspection by statute are not contained on this website.  WCCA is not the official Judgment and Lien Docket. The official Judgment and Lien Docket is located in  each county's Clerk of Circuit Court Office.  The data available in the CCAP database is limited by: 1. One county, Walworth, does not use CCAP, and therefore does not have data on WCCA. 2. Some counties currently use CCAP for selected case types. Portage has data only for Probate cases. 3. Counties that are on CCAP began using it at different times and made independent decisions about the ""backloading"" of pre-CCAP cases. 4. All the data in the CCAP database is entered in the individual counties where the case files are located. Case information is updated hourly unless CCAP is performing periodic maintenance or experiencing technical problems.  If you believe any of the data contained in this database is inaccurate, please contact the circuit court where the original record was created and filed. CCAP provides no warranties insuring the accuracy of the information contained in records available on WCCA, or that electronic mail sent via WCCA is delivered to, accessed by, or read by its intended recipient.                                                                          Please indicate that you have read the above and agree to the use of WCCA subject to the above terms, and understand the limitations of the CCAP database.                                                                                                                                      NEW FEATURE                                      The Director of State Courts' Office has adopted a Policy on Disclosure of Public Information            Over the Internet.

WCCA data is available through a Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) interface on a            subscription basis.            For subscription, contact, and technical information, please                        click here .                                                                                    Given the large number of users, CCAP will not be able to respond to questions about WCCA. If you find problems with WCCA please               contact  CCAP.

If you are searching statewide, you must select Statewide and enter at least 3 characters in the Last Name of the Party Name field followed by the wildcard symbol '*'. You must also enter at least 3 characters of the first or middle name in the Party Name field, which may also be followed by a wildcard '*'. Provide as much information as possible, as the results will return faster and there will be fewer records to sort through. If your search runs too long, you will need to re-submit your search with more details.                         Business Name                           When searching for a business, you must select either Statewide or a County and enter at least 3 characters of the business name in the                 Business  Name field, followed by the wildcard symbol '*'.

If you are searching statewide, you must select Statewide and enter at least 3 characters in the Last Name of the Party Name field followed by the wildcard symbol '*'. You must also enter at least 3 characters of the first or middle name in the Party Name field, which may also be followed by a wildcard '*'. Provide as much information as possible, as the results will return faster and there will be fewer records to sort through. If your search runs too long, you will need to re-submit your search with more details.                         Business Name                           When searching for a business, you must select either Statewide or a County and enter at least 3 characters of the business name in the                 Business  Name field, followed by the wildcard symbol '*'.

These records are open to public view under Wisconsin's Open Records law, sections 19.31-19.39, Wisconsin Statutes.                                                                       Please read this agreement prior to using WCCA:                                                                                           Records not open to public inspection by statute are not contained on this website.  WCCA is not the official Judgment and Lien Docket. The official Judgment and Lien Docket is located in  each county's Clerk of Circuit Court Office.  The data available in the CCAP database is limited by: 1. One county, Walworth, does not use CCAP, and therefore does not have data on WCCA. 2. Some counties currently use CCAP for selected case types. Portage has data only for Probate cases. 3. Counties that are on CCAP began using it at different times and made independent decisions about the ""backloading"" of pre-CCAP cases. 4. All the data in the CCAP database is entered in the individual counties where the case files are located. Case information is updated hourly unless CCAP is performing periodic maintenance or experiencing technical problems.  If you believe any of the data contained in this database is inaccurate, please contact the circuit court where the original record was created and filed. CCAP provides no warranties insuring the accuracy of the information contained in records available on WCCA, or that electronic mail sent via WCCA is delivered to, accessed by, or read by its intended recipient.                                                                          Please indicate that you have read the above and agree to the use of WCCA subject to the above terms, and understand the limitations of the CCAP database.

If you are searching statewide, you must select Statewide and enter at least 3 characters in the Last Name of the Party Name field followed by the wildcard symbol '*'. You must also enter at least 3 characters of the first or middle name in the Party Name field, which may also be followed by a wildcard '*'. Provide as much information as possible, as the results will return faster and there will be fewer records to sort through. If your search runs too long, you will need to re-submit your search with more details.                         Business Name                           When searching for a business, you must select either Statewide or a County and enter at least 3 characters of the business name in the                 Business  Name field, followed by the wildcard symbol '*'.

Because of statutory requirements, certain case types are not available using WCCA.                                       While some counties have loaded historical cases (Door County has probate cases going back to 1859), most counties have data going back to the time when they began using CCAP's Case Management System. To view any cases not available on WCCA, visit the Clerk of Court's office in the county where the case took place.  See                 When counties began using CCAP .

Navigate to the various selection windows using the Navigation bar at the top of each window. To do an advanced case search, select 'Advanced Search'.                                       To use WCCA, you must enter data into one of the selection windows and select the [Search] button. Any results display in a list. To view the details of the record, select the link. For example, on a Simple Case Search, you will retrieve a list of cases. To view a case, select the Case Number link.                                       If your search results in multiple rows, you can move through the records by selecting the                                   Next                  or                                   Previous                  link.

Simple Search                         Party Name                           The simple search allows you to easily search for parties on circuit court cases. You can search statewide for parties. If you are searching statewide, you must select Statewide and enter at least 3 characters in the Last Name of the Party Name field followed by the wildcard symbol '*'. You must also enter at least 3 characters of the first or middle name in the Party Name field, which may also be followed by a wildcard '*'. Provide as much information as possible, as the results will return faster and there will be fewer records to sort through. If your search runs too long, you will need to re-submit your search with more details.                         Business Name                           When searching for a business, you must select either Statewide or a County and enter at least 3 characters of the business name in the                 Business  Name field, followed by the wildcard symbol '*'. Provide as much information as possible, as the results will return faster and there will be fewer records to sort through.

Case Number                           Wisconsin Circuit Court case numbers consist of a four-digit year, a two-character (alpha) case type, and a six-digit number. To search a case number, enter a  case number in the box provided. Case numbers may be entered such that  the century part of the four-digit year and any leading zeros of the  six-digit number can be omitted. Ex: 02cf1 will be converted to  2002CF000001.                                       You must select a county when using                 Case number .                                                    Wild card searches are not supported for Case number.

When                 Birth Date  is entered, a Party Name must be used.  Not all party entries will have a corresponding birth date, especially on civil-type cases. Try using                 Party name  without                 Birth date  and only use                 Birth date  when you need to further limit your search.                                                    The full birth date will display on criminal cases. For other case types, you will only see the month and year of birth.

For criminal, traffic, and forfeiture cases, the name search only looks for defendant party types.                                                    If you want to search statewide, you must select Statewide and enter at least 3 characters in the Last Name of the Party Name field followed by the wildcard symbol '*'.

If you are searching statewide, you must select Statewide and enter at least 3 characters in the Last Name of the Party Name field followed by the wildcard symbol '*'. You must also enter at least 3 characters of the first or middle name in the Party Name field, which may also be followed by a wildcard '*'. Provide as much information as possible, as the results will return faster and there will be fewer records to sort through. If your search runs too long, you will need to re-submit your search with more details.                         Business Name                           When searching for a business, you must select either Statewide or a County and enter at least 3 characters of the business name in the                 Business  Name field, followed by the wildcard symbol '*'.

Because of statutory requirements, certain case types are not available using WCCA.                                       While some counties have loaded historical cases (Door County has probate cases going back to 1859), most counties have data going back to the time when they began using CCAP's Case Management System. To view any cases not available on WCCA, visit the Clerk of Court's office in the county where the case took place.  See                 When counties began using CCAP .

Navigate to the various selection windows using the Navigation bar at the top of each window. To do an advanced case search, select 'Advanced Search'.                                       To use WCCA, you must enter data into one of the selection windows and select the [Search] button. Any results display in a list. To view the details of the record, select the link. For example, on a Simple Case Search, you will retrieve a list of cases. To view a case, select the Case Number link.

If you are searching statewide, you must select Statewide and enter at least 3 characters in the Last Name of the Party Name field followed by the wildcard symbol '*'. You must also enter at least 3 characters of the first or middle name in the Party Name field, which may also be followed by a wildcard '*'. Provide as much information as possible, as the results will return faster and there will be fewer records to sort through. If your search runs too long, you will need to re-submit your search with more details.                         Business Name                           When searching for a business, you must select either Statewide or a County and enter at least 3 characters of the business name in the                 Business  Name field, followed by the wildcard symbol '*'. Provide as much information as possible, as the results will return faster and there will be fewer records to sort through.

Case Number                           Wisconsin Circuit Court case numbers consist of a four-digit year, a two-character (alpha) case type, and a six-digit number. To search a case number, enter a  case number in the box provided. Case numbers may be entered such that  the century part of the four-digit year and any leading zeros of the  six-digit number can be omitted. Ex: 02cf1 will be converted to  2002CF000001.                                       You must select a county when using                 Case number .                                                    Wild card searches are not supported for Case number.

When                 Birth Date  is entered, a Party Name must be used.  Not all party entries will have a corresponding birth date, especially on civil-type cases. Try using                 Party name  without                 Birth date  and only use                 Birth date  when you need to further limit your search.                                                    The full birth date will display on criminal cases. For other case types, you will only see the month and year of birth.

For criminal, traffic, and forfeiture cases, the name search only looks for defendant party types.                                                    If you want to search statewide, you must select Statewide and enter at least 3 characters in the Last Name of the Party Name field followed by the wildcard symbol '*'.

If you want to search in a county, you must select a County and enter at least 3 characters in the Last Name of the Party Name field followed by the wildcard symbol '*'. You must also enter at least 3 characters of either a first or middle name in the Party Name field.

Because of statutory requirements, certain case types are not available using WCCA.                                       While some counties have loaded historical cases (Door County has probate cases going back to 1859), most counties have data going back to the time when they began using CCAP's Case Management System. To view any cases not available on WCCA, visit the Clerk of Court's office in the county where the case took place.  See                 When counties began using CCAP .

Navigate to the various selection windows using the Navigation bar at the top of each window. To do an advanced case search, select 'Advanced Search'.                                       To use WCCA, you must enter data into one of the selection windows and select the [Search] button. Any results display in a list. To view the details of the record, select the link. For example, on a Simple Case Search, you will retrieve a list of cases. To view a case, select the Case Number link.                                       If your search results in multiple rows, you can move through the records by selecting the                                   Next                  or                                   Previous                  link.

Simple Search                         Party Name                           The simple search allows you to easily search for parties on circuit court cases. You can search statewide for parties. If you are searching statewide, you must select Statewide and enter at least 3 characters in the Last Name of the Party Name field followed by the wildcard symbol '*'. You must also enter at least 3 characters of the first or middle name in the Party Name field, which may also be followed by a wildcard '*'. Provide as much information as possible, as the results will return faster and there will be fewer records to sort through. If your search runs too long, you will need to re-submit your search with more details.                         Business Name                           When searching for a business, you must select either Statewide or a County and enter at least 3 characters of the business name in the                 Business  Name field, followed by the wildcard symbol '*'. Provide as much information as possible, as the results will return faster and there will be fewer records to sort through.

Case Number                           Wisconsin Circuit Court case numbers consist of a four-digit year, a two-character (alpha) case type, and a six-digit number. To search a case number, enter a  case number in the box provided. Case numbers may be entered such that  the century part of the four-digit year and any leading zeros of the  six-digit number can be omitted. Ex: 02cf1 will be converted to  2002CF000001.                                       You must select a county when using                 Case number .                                                    Wild card searches are not supported for Case number.

When                 Birth Date  is entered, a Party Name must be used.  Not all party entries will have a corresponding birth date, especially on civil-type cases. Try using                 Party name  without                 Birth date  and only use                 Birth date  when you need to further limit your search.                                                    The full birth date will display on criminal cases. For other case types, you will only see the month and year of birth.

For criminal, traffic, and forfeiture cases, the name search only looks for defendant party types.

If your search runs too long, you will need to re-submit your search with more details.                                                    The                 Party name   search looks for any matching aliases. Alias types are: Also known as, adoptive name, doing business as, formerly doing business as, now known as, previously known as, personal representative, and true name.                                                    Middle Name/Initial                                       Use this checkbox when you want records to display that match the middle initial you entered into the middle name field and those records that do not contain a middle name or initial. If the ""Also Show Those With No Middle Name/Initial"" checkbox is checked, you must enter a complete First Name and a middle name/initial.

When                 Birth Date  is entered, a Party Name must be used. Not all party entries will have a corresponding birth date, especially on civil-type cases. Try using                 Party name   without                 Birth Date  and only use                 Birth Date  when you need to further limit your search.                                                    The full birth date will display on criminal cases. For other case types, you will only see the month and year of birth.                                                       Note:  If Birth Date is used, the Party Name must be matched to the party birth date, and the alias name to the alias birth date. If the alias birth date is different than the party birth date on a case, and you enter the party name and the alias birth date, your search will not return the case.

Because of statutory requirements, certain case types are not available using WCCA.                                       While some counties have loaded historical cases (Door County has probate cases going back to 1859), most counties have data going back to the time when they began using CCAP's Case Management System. To view any cases not available on WCCA, visit the Clerk of Court's office in the county where the case took place.

If you are searching statewide, you must select Statewide and enter at least 3 characters in the Last Name of the Party Name field followed by the wildcard symbol '*'. You must also enter at least 3 characters of the first or middle name in the Party Name field, which may also be followed by a wildcard '*'. Provide as much information as possible, as the results will return faster and there will be fewer records to sort through. If your search runs too long, you will need to re-submit your search with more details.                         Business Name                           When searching for a business, you must select either Statewide or a County and enter at least 3 characters of the business name in the                 Business  Name field, followed by the wildcard symbol '*'. Provide as much information as possible, as the results will return faster and there will be fewer records to sort through.

Case Number                           Wisconsin Circuit Court case numbers consist of a four-digit year, a two-character (alpha) case type, and a six-digit number. To search a case number, enter a  case number in the box provided. Case numbers may be entered such that  the century part of the four-digit year and any leading zeros of the  six-digit number can be omitted. Ex: 02cf1 will be converted to  2002CF000001.                                       You must select a county when using                 Case number .                                                    Wild card searches are not supported for Case number.

When                 Birth Date  is entered, a Party Name must be used.  Not all party entries will have a corresponding birth date, especially on civil-type cases. Try using                 Party name  without                 Birth date  and only use                 Birth date  when you need to further limit your search.                                                    The full birth date will display on criminal cases. For other case types, you will only see the month and year of birth.

For criminal, traffic, and forfeiture cases, the name search only looks for defendant party types.                                                    If you want to search statewide, you must select Statewide and enter at least 3 characters in the Last Name of the Party Name field followed by the wildcard symbol '*'.

If you want to search in a county, you must select a County and enter at least 3 characters in the Last Name of the Party Name field followed by the wildcard symbol '*'. You must also enter at least 3 characters of either a first or middle name in the Party Name field.                                       When searching for a business, you must select either Statewide or a County and enter at least 3 characters of the business name in the                 Business  Name field, followed by the wildcard symbol '*'.

The                 Party name   search looks for any matching aliases. Alias types are: Also known as, adoptive name, doing business as, formerly doing business as, now known as, previously known as, personal representative, and true name.

If the ""Also Show Those With No Middle Name/Initial"" checkbox is checked, you must enter a complete First Name and a middle name/initial.

If you are searching statewide, you must select Statewide and enter at least 3 characters in the Last Name of the Party Name field followed by the wildcard symbol '*'. You must also enter at least 3 characters of the first or middle name in the Party Name field, which may also be followed by a wildcard '*'. Provide as much information as possible, as the results will return faster and there will be fewer records to sort through. If your search runs too long, you will need to re-submit your search with more details.                         Business Name                           When searching for a business, you must select either Statewide or a County and enter at least 3 characters of the business name in the                 Business  Name field, followed by the wildcard symbol '*'.

Business Name                           When searching for a business, you must select either Statewide or a County and enter at least 3 characters of the business name in the                 Business  Name field, followed by the wildcard symbol '*'.

Case Number                           Wisconsin Circuit Court case numbers consist of a four-digit year, a two-character (alpha) case type, and a six-digit number. To search a case number, enter a  case number in the box provided. Case numbers may be entered such that  the century part of the four-digit year and any leading zeros of the  six-digit number can be omitted. Ex: 02cf1 will be converted to  2002CF000001.

When                 Birth Date  is entered, a Party Name must be used.  Not all party entries will have a corresponding birth date, especially on civil-type cases. Try using                 Party name  without                 Birth date  and only use                 Birth date  when you need to further limit your search.

If you are searching statewide, you must select Statewide and enter at least 3 characters in the Last Name of the Party Name field followed by the wildcard symbol '*'. You must also enter at least 3 characters of the first or middle name in the Party Name field, which may also be followed by a wildcard '*'. Provide as much information as possible, as the results will return faster and there will be fewer records to sort through. If your search runs too long, you will need to re-submit your search with more details.                         Business Name                           When searching for a business, you must select either Statewide or a County and enter at least 3 characters of the business name in the                 Business  Name field, followed by the wildcard symbol '*'.

Case Number                           Wisconsin Circuit Court case numbers consist of a four-digit year, a two-character (alpha) case type, and a six-digit number. To search a case number, enter a  case number in the box provided. Case numbers may be entered such that  the century part of the four-digit year and any leading zeros of the  six-digit number can be omitted.

If you are searching statewide, you must select Statewide and enter at least 3 characters in the Last Name of the Party Name field followed by the wildcard symbol '*'. You must also enter at least 3 characters of the first or middle name in the Party Name field, which may also be followed by a wildcard '*'. Provide as much information as possible, as the results will return faster and there will be fewer records to sort through. If your search runs too long, you will need to re-submit your search with more details.                         Business Name                           When searching for a business, you must select either Statewide or a County and enter at least 3 characters of the business name in the                 Business  Name field, followed by the wildcard symbol '*'.
