If so, you have been solicited for an illegal pyramid. What is a Pyramid Scheme? Pyramid schemes are illegal money-making ventures used by individuals, businesses, and small groups of people. A typical pyramid scheme involves a few people at the top who recruit participants to recruit more participants to offer something of value (usually money, but in some cases, time) to the organization. Participants are promised large sums of money if they successfully recruit others to pay money to join the pyramid. Pyramid schemes focus on the exchange of money and recruitment; usually, no legitimate product is sold. How are Pyramid Schemes Disguised? Pyramid schemes may be disguised as games, chain letters, buying clubs, gifting clubs, motivational companies, mail order operations, or investment organizations. Some pyramid schemes also call themselves multilevel marketing operations, but not all multilevel marketing companies are pyramids. The sale of legitimate products is what distinguishes multilevel operations from pyramids. If you are told you will earn commissions for recruiting new members rather than for selling something of value, the organization is probably an illegal pyramid. How Are Pyramids Formed? Basically, a pyramid scheme is formed when a single promoter (or small group of promoters) collects money from a certain number of ""friends"" and instructs them to collect more money from their ""friends."" The cycle goes on from there. Why Do Pyramids Fail? For a pyramid scheme to profit, there would have to be an endless supply of willing participants. However, the supply of participants is limited, and each new level of participants has less chance of recruiting others and a greater chance of losing money. In fact, pyramids inevitably collapse because it is mathematically impossible to recruit the number of people required to support the pyramid. A nine-level pyramid, which is built when each participant gets six ""friends"" to join, would involve over ten million people! 1>6 2>36 3>216 4>1,296 5>7,776 6>46,656 7>279,936   8>1,679,616 9>10,077,696 What Laws Do Pyramid Schemes Violate? Pyramid schemes violate state criminal and civil laws. The Illinois Criminal Code makes it a Class A misdemeanor (prison sentence of one year and $1,000 fine) for any person to knowingly sell, offer to sell, or attempt to sell the right to participate in a pyramid sales scheme. Pyramid schemes also violate the Illinois Consumer Fraud and Deceptive Business Practices Act, which is enforced by the Consumer Fraud Bureau of the Office of the Illinois Attorney General. The law allows the Attorney General to ask the court to impose a civil penalty in the amount of $50,000 per violation. Pyramid Scheme Reality  Pyramids have been made illegal by the Illinois legislature. If discovered, pyramids will be closed down by police, leaving participants subject to fines and possible arrest.  Pyramids are deceptive. Participants in a pyramid, whether they mean to or not, are deceiving those they recruit. Few would pay to join if the odds stacked against them were fully explained.  Pyramids are risky. Pyramiding is based on simple mathematics: many losers pay a few winners.

GX241-03-7346166	Moving Forward with a Reverse Mortgage?                                       Printer-friendly PDF version                       No one  plans       to go broke during retirement. Most seniors fill up their retirements gas      tank and get ready to cruise. But with todays longer life spans, seniors      often need more cash to help them motor through their golden years. No one      can predict the financial roadblocks that may arise, such as the need for      expensive prescriptions or medical procedures. Just one major setback could      drain more of those hard-earned retirement dollars than anyone expects.      Fortunately,      seniors have some options to keep the financial engine running during retirement.      One option is the reverse mortgage. This loan allows senior Texans to liquidate      the equity in their homes for cash without selling the home or incurring a      monthly loan payment. The money can be used to supplement an income, make      a purchase, or cover upcoming expenses.     How does a reverse      mortgage work?      The borrower      typically chooses from three payment options: 1) one lump sum in cash, 2)      equal monthly payments for as long as both borrowers live in the home, or      3) equal monthly payments over time. Repayment is not required until both      borrowers move, sell their home, or are deceased. At that time, the lender      takes the house as payment for the loan. Sometimes families or heirs arrange      to pay off the loan in order to keep the home. Naturally, heirs may object      to a reverse mortgage for that reason.     Like any other      loan, a reverse mortgage accrues interest charges, beginning when the first      payment is made to the borrower. Usually a reverse mortgage is an Adjustable      Rate Mortgage (ARM), with interest compounded monthly.     Are you eligible?           To be eligible      for a reverse mortgage, a borrower must be 62 or older, own the home outright      (or have a low loan balance), and have no other liens against the home. A      borrower continues to be responsible for property taxes, homeowners insurance,      and upkeep of the home; failure to do so can result in foreclosure.      Borrowers are      also required to attend financial counseling before closinga crucial step      that helps a borrower avoid paperwork potholes and learn more about the loan.      You can view a list of local credit counseling agencies  here .     Using the equity      a homeowner has built up over the years can help a borrower detour away from      public assistance programs. Seniors who rely on public assistance need to      research the impact reverse mortgage payouts may have on their benefits.     What about your heirs?            A borrower should      discuss the reverse mortgage loan option with family or other heirs before      closing on the loan. An heir will need to be prepared to pay off the loan      balance if the heir would like to keep the home. Open communication, along      with strong monthly financial planning, is necessary to keep family affairs      running smoothly. One possible financial plan is for the family or heirs to      obtain and maintain life insurance on the borrower, with proceeds designated      for paying off the loan balance.     A reverse mortgage      is not for everyone     If you are running      low on cash, put on the brakes and carefully analyze cash flow before obtaining      a reverse mortgage. Because of the high closing costs, a reverse mortgage      is a bad idea if you plan to move in a couple years, or if you have a temporary      financial emergency that might be better resolved with a home equity loan.      Carefully weigh the pros and cons of all cash flow options. Folks in early      retirement should remember that the younger they are, the less money they      are eligible to receive because of the life expectancy factor in the loan      payment formula.     Consider      your alternatives     Because      these loans can be complicated and expensive, a reverse mortgage is not an      answer to every seniors situation. Consider other strategies before committing      to a reverse mortgage:           Take        out a home equity loan       Decrease        expenses by moving into a smaller home or an apartment       Seek         property tax credit or abatement based on your senior status         If you would like to learn      more about reverse mortgage lending in Texas, contact the Office of Consumer      Credit Commissioner, 2601 North Lamar Boulevard, Austin TX 78705; toll-free      Consumer Helpline (800) 538-1579.

Have you ever received a chain letter that asked you to mail one dollar to the top person on the list and to send the letter to 10 friends? If so, you were solicited for an illegal pyramid scheme.   Pyramid schemes are illegal money-making ventures for individuals, businesses, and small groups of people. A typical pyramid scheme involves a few individuals at the top who recruit participants who, in turn, recruit other participants to offer something of value (usually money, but in some cases, time) to the organization. Recruits are offered the promise of large sums of money if they successfully bring in others to pay money to join the pyramid. Pyramid schemes focus on the exchange of money and recruitment. Usually, there is no legitimate product being sold.   How are Pyramid Schemes Disguised?   Pyramid schemes may be disguised as gift clubs, games, chain letters, buying clubs, motivational companies, mail order operations, or investment organizations. Although some pyramid schemes call themselves multi-level marketing operations, not all multi-level marketing companies are pyramids. The sale of legitimate products is what distinguishes multi-level operations from pyramids. When the emphasis is on recruiting new members rather than selling something of value the organization is probably an illegal pyramid.   How do Pyramid Schemes Work?   Basically, a pyramid scheme is formed when a single promoter (or small group of promoters) collects money from a certain number of ""friends"" and instructs them to collect more money from more of their ""friends."" The cycle goes on from there. As the pyramid grows, the number of people involved becomes too large to sustain the pyramid. Some people will fail to send in their money, or recruit the required number of ""friends,"" and the pyramid crumbles. The majority of people end up on the ""bottom"" of the pyramid and inevitably will lose their initial ""investment."" They won't get their money back or earn their promised fortune because no one is beneath them in the pyramid adding new money to the pot.   Why do Pyramid Schemes Fail?   Pyramid schemes collapse when a few people drop out or refuse to pay, and new members are not recruited in their place. In order for a pyramid scheme to profit, there would have to be a never-ending supply of potential (and willing) participants. In reality, however, the supply of participants is limited, and each new level of participants has less chance of recruiting others and a greater chance of losing money.   How a Typical Pyramid is Organized   A simple pyramid - for example, a five level program built on recruitment by fours - might work like this:     A new recruit would pay $100 to ""join"" the organization.       That money would then be disbursed at regular intervals by the company - $25 to the recruiter, $25 to the company, and $50 to the recruiter's ""upline"" in the form of $10 payments to the recruiter's recruiter, and so on through five levels.       The new recruit would recover the $100 ""fee"" by recruiting four more people, each of whom would pay the recruiter $25.       From this point a participant would then make money from all recruiting done by the four recruits and their recruits.       Assuming successful recruiting by four people down through each of five levels, a participant could (but probably never will) make a cumulative total of $54,560:         $160 on the first level - e.g., four people each recruiting four others at $10 a person (4x4=16 x $10=$160);   $640 on the second level - e.g., 16 people each recruiting four persons at $10 each (16x4=64 x $10=$640);   $2,560 on the third level (64x4=256 x $10);   $10,240 on the fourth level (256x4=1024 x $10);   $40,960 on the fifth level (4x1024=4096 x $10).   $54,560 total ($160+$640+$2,560+$10,240+$40,960)       Pyramid Reality                                           Pyramids are illegal. Because pyramid sales plans are by their very nature deceptive, they are illegal. There is a real risk that a pyramid operation will be closed down by police and the participants subject to fines and possible arrest.                                               Pyramids are deceptive. Participants in a pyramid, whether they mean to or not, are deceiving those they recruit. Few would pay to join if the odds stacked against them were fully explained.                                               Pyramids are losers. Pyramid Schemes are based on simple mathematics: many losers pay a few winners.                                               Pyramids inevitably collapse because it is mathematically impossible to recruit the numbers of people required to support the pyramid. A nine-level pyramid, which is built when each participant gets six ""friends"" to join, would involve over ten million people!                       6  36  216  1,296  7,776  46,656  279,936  1,679,616  10,077,696   Why Would Anyone Pay to Join a Pyramid?   Pyramid promoters are masters of group psychology. At recruiting meetings they create a frenzied, enthusiastic atmosphere where group pressure and promises of easy money play upon people's greed and fear of missing a good deal. It is difficult to resist this kind of appeal unless you recognize that the scheme is rigged against you.   Multi-level Marketing Companies   Multi-level marketing companies differ from pyramid schemes because they are usually legitimate business opportunities. The sale of legitimate products is what distinguishes multi-level marketing operations from pyramids.   If the emphasis in a multi-level marketing company is to build a sales force rather than sell the company's products, it may be an illegal pyramid.   The Difference Between Pyramid Schemes and Multi-level Marketing   Many pyramid promoters attempt to make their schemes look like a multi-level marketing company by using a line of near-worthless products or newsletters and claiming to be in the business of selling them. In pyramid schemes, little or no effort is made to actually market the products. Often there is not even an established market for the products. Rather the ""sale"" of such merchandise is used as a front for the transactions which occur only among and between the operation's distributors.   In pyramid schemes, the emphasis in the sales pitch is on recruiting - building up the organization and the number of participants and on collecting the ""start up"" fee - not on selling the products. Pyramid schemes want to make money from you, not the product sales.   Pyramid Scheme vs. Multi-level Marketing                                           Compensation based on recruiting  vs.  Compensation based on sales                       Few or no sales to consumers  vs.  Sell legitimate products to established markets                       Substantial start-up costs  vs.  Generally small start-up fee                       Potential to be stuck with large amounts of unsold goods  vs.  Will buy back unsold goods if you decide to quit the business                       Make money from you  vs.  Make money with you                       Protect Yourself     Take your time. Don't be rushed into any business deal. Show your attorney any contracts you receive from the company. A legitimate business opportunity won't disappear overnight.   Ask questions about the competency and experience of the company and its officers; the products, including the potential market in your area; start-up fees; buy-back provisions; and actual earnings of current distributors.   Get written copies of all available company literature.   Check with others who have experience with the company and its products. Find out if the products are actually being sold to consumers.   Investigate and verify all information. Contact the Division of Consumer   Protection, your local Chamber of Commerce, or the Better Business Bureau if you suspect a company may be engaged in an illegal pyramid scheme.   If a pyramid promoter or recruiter tells you that the program has been examined and approved by the Division of Consumer Protection or any other state agency, know that the claim is  not true!  The Division of Consumer Protection does NOT approve any marketing programs. If such representations are made to you, please notify the Division."

GX235-02-3544566	Dear Fellow Pennsylvanians:  Pyramid schemes are illegal moneymaking ventures for individuals, businesses, and small groups of people, in which large numbers of people at the bottom of the pyramid pay money to a few people at the top. Each new participant pays for the chance to advance to the top and profit from payments of others who might join later. Recruits are offered the promise of large sums of money if they successfully bring in others to pay money to join the pyramid. Pyramid schemes focus on the exchange of money and recruitment. Usually, there is no legitimate product or service being sold. Pyramids and chain-letter schemes that require more than $25 as an investment are illegal in Pennsylvania. Participants are subject to civil penalties of up up $1,000 for each violation. All money obtained through the pyramid must be returned. Those who make any false or misleading statement to help promote or organize a pyramid are subject to fines and jail sentences.  How do Pyramid Schemes Work? A pyramid scheme is formed when a promoter or promoters collect money from a certain number of people and instruct them to collect more money from others. The cycle goes on from there. As the pyramid grows, the number of people needed to sustain the pyramid becomes too large. Some people will fail to send in their money, or to recruit others, and the pyramid crumbles. The majority of people end up on the bottom of the pyramid and inevitably will lose their initial investment. They wont get their money back or earn their promised fortune because no one is beneath them in the pyramid adding new money to the pot.  How are Pyramid Schemes Disguised? s Pyramid schemes may be disguised as games, chain letters, buying clubs, motivational companies, mail order operations, or investment organizations. s Some pyramid promoters try to make their schemes look like multi-level marketing operations. The sale of legitimate products may distinguish multi-level operations from pyramids. When the emphasis is on recruiting new members rather than selling something of value the organization is probably an illegal pyramid. s A pyramid scheme takes on a line of products and claims to be in the business of selling them to consumers. However, little or no ef fort is made to actually market the products. Instead, money is made in typical pyramid fashion, from recruiting. New distributors are pushed to purchase large and costly amounts of inventory when they sign up. s Pyramid schemes often choose products which are cheap to produce and have no established market value, such as new miracle products, exotic cures, etc. The best way to avoid a disguised pyramid fraud is to know what to look for in a legitimate income opportunity.  Why Would Anyone Pay to Join a Pyramid Scheme? Pyramid promoters are masters of group psychology. At recruiting meetings they create a frenzied, enthusiastic atmosphere where group pressure and promises of easy money play upon peoples greed and fear of missing a good deal. It is difficult to resist this kind of appeal unless you recognize that the scheme is rigged against you.  Mike Fisher Attorney General Commonwealth of Pennsylvania   If it seems too good to be true, it probably is! 8 64 512 4,096 32,768 In the typical pyramid scheme for every individual who collects money you need eight individuals to pay. So, if you are not one of the first individuals in, then it is going to be very difficult to recoup your money - not to mention benefit from additional gains!  How to Protect Yourself From a Bad Investment  PYRAMID SCHEMES If You Play... You Pay  Slow Down! Dont let anyone rush you. A good opportunity to build a business in a multi-level structure will not disappear overnight. People who tell you to get in on the ground floor are implying that people joining later will be left out in the cold.  Where to go for Help  s  Contact the...

Par t I  Be fore You Buy Every year the Consumer Federat ion of America and the Nat ional Associat ion of Consumer Agency Administrators sur vey government consumer prot ect ion of f ices to f ind out what transact ions generat e the most complaints. Auto sales, auto repair, and auto leasing are usually near the top of the list. Other f requent ""winners"" include home improvement, ret ail sales, credit and lending, and mail order. A recent addit ion to the list is the purchase of household goods such as appliances, comput ers and furniture. To avoid problems during these and other consumer transact ions, t ake the st eps and heed the warnings set out below.  Decide in advance exact ly what you want and what you can af ford. Don't buy on impulse or because a salesperson is pressuring you. Ask f riends and f amily for recommendat ions based on their experience. Get advice and price quot es f rom several sellers. Remember, their goal is to make a sale. Review product t est results and other informat ion f rom consumer exper ts. See Consumer Informat ion Sources on page 2. Check out a company's complaint record with your local consumer af f airs of f ice   (p. 84) and the Bet t er Business Bureau (p. 139). Ask about the number of complaints filed, and how the company responded. Compare the number of complaints to the company's volume of business.  Make sure that the company has all appropriat e st at e and local licenses. Occupat ional and prof essional licensing boards cover doctors, lawyers, home improvement contractors, and other businesses. See page 84. Read and underst and any contract you are asked to sign. Make sure there are no blank spaces and that any verbal promises made by the salesperson are in the contract. Get a writ t en copy of guarant ees and warrant ies. Compare their f eatures. Ext ended warrant ies or ser vice contracts are very prof it able for business. Decide whether the extra peace of mind is wor th the price. To find out more, cont act the Federal Trade Commission (p. 135) or your st at e or local consumer of fice (p. 84). Get the seller's refund and return policies. Consider paying by credit card. If you lat er have a legit imat e disput e with the seller, you do not have to pay a charge made on your credit card. See page 20.

A vehicle that gets more miles per gallon is good for your wallet as well as for the environment.  Use the Green Vehicle Guide (www.epa.gov/emissweb) to search for the most fuel-ef f icient and clean motor vehicle.

Shop in advance for the best f inance deal at your credit union, bank or f inance company.  CARS        Your Right s: Secret Warranties and Lemon Law s  On occasion, a company makes a mist ake in the manuf acturing of a motor vehicle. If dealers repor t a number of complaints about a cer t ain par t or vehicle, the maker may allow dealers to repair the problem at no cost to the customer even if the warrant y has expired. A ser vice bullet in not if ies the dealer of the problem and how to resolve it. Because these f ree repairs are not publicized, they are called ""secret warrant ies.""

Auto Service Warranties and Contract s Dealers may try to sell you an auto ser vice contract or ""ext ended warrant y"" when you buy a new or used car. A warrant y comes with a new car and is included in the original price of the vehicle. A ser vice contract is sold separat ely and is a promise to pay for cer t ain repairs or ser vices. Ser vice contracts are usually high-prof it add-ons, costing hundreds to more than $1,000. The ser vice contract may duplicat e warrant y coverage you get f rom the manuf acturer or dealer. Ask these quest ions:  Does the dealer, the manuf acturer, or an independent company back the ser vice contract? What happens to your coverage if the dealer or administrator goes out of business? How are claims handled? Can you choose among several ser vice dealers or repair cent ers or do you have to return to one dealer? Is your car covered if it breaks down on a trip or if you move out of town? Do you need prior authorizat ion for repair work? Are there any exclusions or situat ions when coverage can be denied? Common repairs for par ts like brakes and clutches generally are not included in ser vice contracts. Failure to keep up manuf acturer's recommendat ions for rout ine maint enance can void the ser vice contract. The contract may also prohibit you f rom t aking your car to an independent st at ion for rout ine maint enance or performing the work yourself.

In every used car and truck of f ered for sale, dealers are required by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to post a Buyers Guide that specif ies whether the vehicle is being sold ""as is"" or with a warrant y, and what percent age of repair costs a dealer will pay under the warranty. Keep in mind that privat e sellers generally have less responsibility than dealers for def ects or other problems. Privat e sellers generally don't have to post informat ion.

Agree in advance with the seller that you'll pay for the examinat ion if the car passes must er and the seller will pay if signif icant problems are discovered.

Dings that you may regard as normal wear and t ear may be billed as signif icant damage at the end of your lease. Find out how many miles you can drive in a year. Most leases allow 12,000 to 15,000 miles a year. Expect a charge of 10 to 25 cents for each addit ional mile. Make sure the manuf acturer's warrant y covers the ent ire lease t erm and the number of miles you are likely to drive. Ask the dealer about early t erminat ion charges. Expect to pay a subst ant ial charge if you give the car up before the end of your lease. Ask what happens if the car is tot aled six months af t er the lease is signed. Before you sign the deal, t ake a copy of the contract home and review it carefully away from any dealer pressure. Make sure you are get t ing credit for any trade-in.

Carefully inspect the vehicle and its t ires before rent ing. Check refueling policies and charges. Ask if there is a refundable charge being made to your credit card. At the t ime you pick up your car, a company may make a charge of hundreds of dollars to your credit card. Most companies do not process the amount unless you f ail to return the car as specif ied in your rent al contract. If it is processed, your credit card spending limit may be reduced by the amount of the deposit bringing you near or over your credit card limit and creat ing problems when you try to make other transact ions with the card.

Protect Yoursel f: Weight Reduction If you need to lose weight, t alk with your doctor about the weight loss opt ions that are best for you. Most health exper ts agree that the best and saf est way to lose weight is to modest ly cut calories, eat a balanced diet, and be physically act ive each day. St eer clear of harmful ""self help"" weight loss t act ics, such as smoking, f ast ing, purging, or abusing laxat ives. To make sure you saf ely lose pounds not just dollars, ask these quest ions:  How does the product or ser vice work? People usually do best when they reduce their usual calorie int ake or increase the calories they use by 500  1,000 per day. This allows you to eat enough for good nutrit ion and, if followed daily, helps you lose about 1 to 2 pounds a week. How much will it cost? Ask for an it emized price list that includes membership f ees, f ees for weekly visits, and costs for it ems such as diagnost ic t ests, food, meal replacements, diet ary supplements, and other products in the program. How well does it work? Ask to see studies that document success. Look for how many people complet ed the program, how much weight they lost, and how successfully they've kept the weight of f over a one-year period or longer. What are the risks? Get det ails about side ef f ects that can occur. Check with your doctor before you t ake prescript ions, over-the-count er weight loss drugs, or diet ary supplements. Diets that require drast ic food restrict ion should be under the super vision of a physician. How many calories will you eat each day? For diets under 1500 calories, be sure to check with your health care provider to make sure you meet all your nutrient needs. Does the program include regular physical act ivit y? What are the st af f qualif icat ions? Ask about their training, experience and credent ials. What t ype of a t t ent ion will you receive? For example, will you get individual counseling or group suppor t? How of t en?

Are specialists such as eye doctors and dent ists covered? Does the plan cover special condit ions or treatments such as pregnancy, psychiatric care and physical therapy? Does the plan cover home care or nursing home care? Will the plan cover all medicat ions my physician may prescribe? What are the deduct ibles? Are there any copayments? What are the maximum amounts I will have to pay out of my own pocket to cover expenses? Are there any caps on how much I can be reimbursed in a year? In my lif et ime? If there is a disput e about a bill or ser vice, how is it handled? In some plans, arbitration is mandatory.  HEALTH INSURANCE Most consumers have health care coverage from an employer. Others have medical care paid through government programs such as Medicare, Medicaid, or the Vet erans Administrat ion. If you do not have insurance, look in your phone book under Medicaid, Social Ser vices, Medical Assist ance, Human Ser vices, or Communit y Ser vice. Informat ion about Medicare is available at 1-800-MEDICARE. If you have lost group insurance coverage provided by a privat e employer as the result of unemployment, a death, divorce, or loss of ""dependent child"" st atus, you may have the right to t emporary cont inuat ion of coverage under the Consolidat ed Omnibus Budget Reconciliat ion Act (COBRA). You, not the employer, pay the premium for this coverage. When one of these events occur, you must be given at least 60 days to decide whether you wish to purchase the coverage. Some st at es may of f er an insurance pool to provide insurance coverage for residents who are unable to obt ain medical insurance because of health condit ions. These pools may also provide health benef it portability coverage to individuals who have exhaust ed COBRA benef its and have no other por t abilit y opt ions available to them. To find out if a pool is available in your st at e, check with your st at e depar tment of insurance (p. 108). Children who do not have health insurance are likely to be eligible for f ree or low-cost health insurance through similar st at e programs.

Here are some quest ions to ask when considering one of these plans.  What t ype of care is covered? A policy may cover nursing home care, at-home care with the assist ance of visit ing nurses and therapists, or both. There may be restrict ions on assist ed-living f acilit ies that provide less client care than a nursing home. In some cases these f acilit ies are tot ally excluded. At-home care policies may provide coverage for homemaking assist ance such as food preparat ion and housecleaning. What will the benef it amount be? Most plans are writ t en to provide a specif ic dollar benef it per day. The benef it for home care is usually about half the nursing-home benef it. But some policies pay the same for both forms of care. Some pay only the actual charges you incur while others pay the full daily benef it no mat t er what your expenses are. What is the benef it period? It is possible to purchase a policy with lif et ime benef its but this opt ion can be very expensive. Other opt ions for coverage are f rom one to six years. The average nursing home st ay is about two and one-half years. Is the benef it adjust ed for inf lat ion? If you buy a policy prior to age 60, you f ace a signif icant risk that inf lat ion will render a set daily benef it inadequat e by the t ime you need it. Is there a wait ing period before benef its begin? A 20 to 100 day period is not unusual. What qualif ies you for benef its? Some insurers say you must be unable to perform a specif ic number of these act ivit ies of daily living: eat ing, walking, get t ing f rom bed to a chair, dressing, bathing, using a toilet and remaining cont inent.

If PMI is required, ask what the tot al cost of the insurance will be.

Consider ref inancing your mor tgage if you can get a rat e that is a t least one percent age point lower than your exist ing mor tgage rat e and if you plan to keep the new mor tgage for several years or more. Calculat e how much your new mor tgage (including up-f ront f ees) will cost and whether, in the long run, it will cost less than your current mor tgage. One way of saving on ref inancing f ees is to check f irst with the lender who holds your current mor tgage.

The int erest rate on adjust able rat e mor tgage loans (ARMs) can vary a great deal over the lif et ime of the mortgage. An increase of several percent age points might raise payments by hundreds of dollars per month. If a loan has an adjust able-rat e, ask how your rat e and loan payment will vary, including whether payments will be reduced when rat es go down. Ask whether prepayment of a loan is allowed and if there is a penalt y for doing so. Find out what down payment is required.

Prompt ly compare receipts with bank st at ements to be sure there are no errors or unauthorized transact ions.

Although a debit card looks like a credit card, the money for the purchase is transf erred immediat ely f rom your bank account to the store's account. The purchase will be shown on your bank account st at ement. Some stores are beginning to allow a new process of payment called electronic check conversion. With electronic check conversion, your check is used as a source of informat ion - for the check number, your account number, and the number that ident if ies your f inancial inst itut ion. The informat ion is then used to make a onetime electronic payment f rom your account - an electronic funds transf er. When you use a debit card or an electronic funds transf er, f ederal law does not give you the right to stop payment. You must resolve the problem with the seller.

The f ederal government typically backs up bank savings  loans of f ered by f inance companies. When comparing loan of f ers, read all mat erial and ask the following quest ions before you sign:        What is the minimum monthly payment? What is the annual percent age rat e? If the int erest rat e is adjust able, how much can it increase at one t ime? What is the maximum int erest rat e? What are the annual and transact ion f ees?

Insist that they f ill out a form and give you a copy, even if they say the bag will be in on the next f light. Also make sure you know:   the name of the person who f illed out the form; a phone number for follow up.  Airline delays caused by bad weather, air-traf f ic problems, and mechanical repairs are hard to predict or beyond the airlines' control. If your flight is canceled, most airlines will rebook you on their f irst available f light to your dest inat ion, at no addit ional charge. If you are able to f ind a flight on another airline, ask the f irst airline to endorse your t icket to the new carrier. This could save you a f are increase but there is no rule requiring them to do this. Each airline has its own policies about what it will do for delayed passengers; there are no f ederal requirements. If you are delayed, ask the airline if they will pay for meals or a phone call. Contrary to what many people believe, airlines are not required to compensat e passengers whose f lights are delayed or canceled. Overbooked Flight s  Conf irm that the airline will deliver the bag to you without charge when it is found; ask them about this as well. Some airlines will give you money to purchase a few necessit ies. If they don't provide you with cash, ask what t ypes of ar t icles would be reimbursable, and keep all receipts. If a suitcase arrives damaged  the airline will usually pay for repairs. If an it em can't be f ixed, they will negot iat e a set t lement to pay you its depreciat ed value. The same holds true for belongings packed inside. Of course, airlines may decline to pay for damage caused by the fragile nature of the broken it em or inadequat e packing, rather than the airline's handling. Los t Bags  Overbooking is not illegal, and most airlines overbook their scheduled f lights to a cer t ain ext ent in order to compensat e for ""no-shows."" Passengers are somet imes lef t behind or ""bumped"" as a result. When seats are oversold, the U.S. Depar tment of Transpor t at ion requires airlines to ask people to give up their seats volunt arily, in exchange for compensat ion. Airlines set guidelines for what to of f er passengers  money, a f ree trip, food, or lodging. Federal rules prot ect you if you have been bumped against your will on most domest ic flights or outbound int ernat ional f lights. The airline must give you a st at ement describing your rights. If the airline is not able to get you to your final dest inat ion within one hour of your original scheduled arrival t ime, you are ent it led to an onthe-spot payment as compensat ion. The amount depends on the price of the t icket and the length of the delay. An airline may of f er you f ree transpor t at ion on a future f light in place of a check for denied boarding compensat ion, but you have the right to insist on a check. However, to be eligible for compensation, you must have a conf irmed reser vat ion  an ""OK"" in the st atus box of your t icket. You must also meet the airline's deadlines for t icket ing and check-in. Delayed or Damaged Bags  If your bag is declared of f icially lost, you will have to submit a second, more det ailed form within a set t ime period est ablished by the airline. The informat ion you submit is used to est imat e the value of your lost belongings. Airlines consider the depreciat ed value of your possessions, not their original price or the replacement costs. They can invoke a ceiling of $1250 per passenger on the amount of money they'll pay. When your luggage and its cont ents are wor th more than that, you may want to purchase ""excess valuat ion,"" if available, f rom the airline when you check in. The airline may refuse to sell excess valuat ion on some it ems that are especially valuable or breakable, such as ant iques, musical instruments, jewelry, manuscripts, negot iable securit ies and cash. On int ernat ional trips, the airline's liabilit y limit is $9.07 per pound. Keep in mind that these limits are maximums. If the depreciat ed value of your property is worth less than the liabilit y limit, the airline will of f er this lower amount. If the airline's set t lement doesn't fully cover your loss, check your homeowner's or rent er's insurance to see if it covers losses away f rom home. Some credit card companies and travel agencies of f er opt ional or even automat ic supplement al baggage coverage.

Don't make the call if you don't know the cost. Be wary of promises for f ree minut es, gif ts or prizes. Watch out for phony of f ers of f inancial assist ance. Don't st ay on hold, you'll be charged for that t ime. Don't respond to messages to call pay-per-call numbers. Fraudulent pay-per-call ser vices may leave messages that claim to be about a f amily emergency, a prize or a debt. If you use a pay-per-call ser vice, look for new unauthorized monthly charges on your phone bill.  Your Right s: Pay-Per-Call Services Federal law requires adver t isements for pay-per-call ser vices to t ell you:  the cost of the call. It may be a f lat rat e, a per-minut e charge, or calculat ed on some other basis. The ad must also st at e the most you can be charged, if that can be det ermined, and any minimum or addit ional charges that you might have to pay; the odds of winning or the f actors that det ermine your chance of winning any sweepst akes, prizes or awards, and how you can ent er any cont est without calling the 900 number; if the privat e company of f ering informat ion about Federal programs is not endorsed, approved or authorized by the government; and if the ser vice is direct ed primarily to children under the age of 18, that they need their parents' consent to call the number.      The rules bar adver t ising pay-per-call ser vices direct ed to children under age 12 unless they are for legit imat e educat ional services. If the charge for pay-per-call ser vices will be more than $2, you should hear the following informat ion when you dial the number:     the company or organizat ion name and a descript ion of ser vices; the cost of the call; a not ice that you can hang up without any charge within a cer t ain t ime af t er a signal (you can't be charged for list ening to the introduct ion); and a warning to kids under the age of 18 that they need their parents' consent to st ay on the line.  36  For inf ormat ion about Federal programs and ser vices call 1 (800) FED-INFO or visit www.firstgov.gov   TELEPHONE SERVICE  Slamming and Cramming  Pre-Paid Cards  ""Slamming"" is the illegal act of switching your long dist ance, local toll or local telephone company without your permission. You may not know unt il you f ind a dif f erent company name on your bill, or your phone charges are much higher than normal. If you've been slammed:    ask your local phone company to switch you back to your original company at no charge; t ell the original company you're switching back, and ask to be enrolled in your previous calling plan; and cont act the company that slammed you, whose name and number is on the bill, to exercise your rights not to pay those charges.  !  Protect Yoursel f: Slamming and Cramming  If you're unable to resolve your complaint, cont act the Federal Communicat ions Commission (FCC) (p. 134). ""Cramming"" is when companies add charges to your t elephone bill for opt ional ser vices you never agreed to, such as voicemail or ""club memberships."" You may not not ice these monthly charges because they are relat ively small - $5 to $30 dollars - and look like your regular phone charges. To avoid being a vict im:  Consider put t ing a ""block"" on changes in your phone ser vice. Ask your t elephone ser vice provider if they of f er a blocking ser vice, which usually requires the company to not ify you before a change is made. Read the f ine print on cont est entry forms and coupons. You could be agreeing to switch your phone ser vice or buy opt ional ser vices. Watch out for impostors. Companies may f alsely claim to be your regular phone company and of f er some t ype of discount plan or bill consolidat ion. They may also say they are taking a sur vey or pret end to be a government agency. Beware of ""negat ive opt ion not ices."" You can be switched or signed up for opt ional ser vices unless you say no. Look at your t elephone bill carefully every month - especially the pages that show the det ails.        Your phone ser vice cannot be shut of f for refusal to pay for unauthorized ser vices.

For more information, contact SOCAP at 675 North Washington St., Suit e 200, Alexandria, VA 22314; 703-5193700; Fax: 703-549-4886; e-mail: socap@socap.org or on the web at www.socap.org. If you do not f ind the name of the company you are looking for in this sect ion, check the product label or warrant y for the name and address of the manuf acturer. Public libraries also have helpful informat ion. The St andard & Poor's Regist er of Corporat ions, Directors and Execut ives; Trade Names Directory; St andard Directory of Adver t isers; and Dun & Bradstreet Directory are four sources that list informat ion about most f irms. If you cannot find the name of the manuf acturer, the Thomas Register of American Manuf acturers lists the manuf acturers of thousands of products.  A AAMCO Transmissions, Inc.

GX264-31-7843580	"LOAN WORKSHEET #10  HOME EQUITY LENDING OVERVIEW Home equity lending in Texas was allowed by an amendment to the Texas Constitution approved by the voters on November 4, 1997 and became effective January 1, 1998. On November 2, 1989, Texas voters approved changes that corrected problems with reverse mortgages and the size of an urban homestead. The latest changes to the Texas Constitution were approved by the voters on September 13, 2003. These most recent changes authorize home equity lines of credit, allow lenders under certain conditions to cure violations of the home equity lending law, and enables borrowers to refinance home equity loans with a reverse mortgage. This amendment also permits the Finance Commission and Credit Union Commission to issue interpretations of home equity lending provisions at the request of an interested party or on their own motion. Home equity loans are defined as loans that are collateralized by a non-purchase money mortgage or deed of trust on the borrower's principal residence. The borrower's equity, relative to the value of the residence, provides protection for the loan and determines the maximum amount of credit that may be advanced. Traditionally, home equity loans have been used to fund home improvements or consolidate debt, however, their popularity has expanded considerably. Uses now include consumer purchases, personal investments, working capital for small business, and a supplement to personal income. Although home equity lending has existed for many years in other states, home equity loans made under Texas law will differ from these in two major respects: 1) The borrower may not be held personally liable for repayment of the loans; and, 2) The bank may forfeit principal and interest if it fails to comply with the many requirements of the enabling Constitutional Amendment and is not able to cure the violation under Section (6)(Q)(x). Because provisions of the Texas Constitution related to home equity lending have significant penalties to the lender for non-compliance, it will be necessary to evaluate the institution's compliance to the constitutional provision to adequately assess risk. Although many of the following procedures have characteristics of consumer compliance procedures, in reality the primary focus is one of safety and soundness. In addition, a complying loan does not necessarily mean that a loan will be considered low-risk by the examiners. Repayment capacity and history, collateral value and position, and all other traditional measures of loan quality will also be assessed. Although they share many attributes with consumer loans and may be administered by a bank's consumer loan department, home equity loans will be individually sampled by examiners and should be reported in the call report as ""loans secured by 1-4 family residential property.""  Specific policies and procedures: Review the bank's home equity policies and procedures to determine: _____ 1. Does the bank have a board approved policy for making and administering home equity & reverse mortgage loans? 2. Is the bank's documentation and funding system adequate to ensure full compliance with all aspects of the law prior to funding?  _____  f:\dob\proced\comrcl\RB14-Wksht10 - 11-17-03  1  Texas Department of Banking (11/03)   LOAN WORKSHEET #10 - HOME EQUITY LENDING (continued) _____ 3.

Does it seem reasonable? 7. How has the bank set loan pricing? Has it considered and calculated the cost of collection in the event of default? 8. What is the bank's collection policy? Does it evaluate the cost/benefit aspect of acquiring a superior lien? 9. Does the bank offer open-end lines of credit as described in Section 50(t) of the Constitution? If lines of credit are offered, complete the supplemental section in the back of this procedure. _____ 10. How will the bank monitor the property value? Ensure that policy does not deviate from Section 50(a)(6)(J) which prohibits the bank from accelerating the loan or collecting additional monies if the collateral value declines.  _____  _____  _____  _____  _____  _____  f:\dob\proced\comrcl\RB14-Wksht10 - 11-17-03  2  Texas Department of Banking (11/03)   LOAN WORKSHEET #10 - HOME EQUITY LENDING (continued) _____ 11.

It is the intent of the General Assembly that reverse mortgage loans be available so that elderly homeowners may use the equity in their homes to meet their financial needs.  The General Assembly recognizes that there may be restrictions and requirements governing traditional mortgage transactions that should not apply to reverse mortgages. The purpose of this Article is to authorize reverse mortgage transactions and to clarify other provisions of North Carolina law that might otherwise apply to reverse mortgage loans, and to provide protection for elderly homeowners who enter into reverse mortgage transactions. (1991, c. 546, s. 1; 1995, c. 115, s. 1.)     53-257.  Definitions.

(1991, c. 546, s. 1; 1995, c. 115,             s. 1; 1998-116, s. 3.)          53-258.  Authority and procedures governing reverse        mortgage loans.   (a)No person, firm, or corporation shall engage in the business of making reverse mortgage loans without first being approved as an authorized lender by the Commissioner, unless the lender is the North Carolina Housing Finance Agency, or is a bank, savings institution, or credit union authorized to do business under the laws of this State or authorized to do business under the laws of the United States and chartered to do business in this State.   (b) An application for authorization to make reverse mortgage loans shall be in writing to the Commissioner and in the form prescribed by the Commissioner.  The application shall contain the name and complete business address or addresses of the applicant.  The application shall also include affirmation of financial solvency and all capitalization requirements that are required by the Commissioner.  The application shall be accompanied by a nonrefundable fee, payable to the Commissioner, of five hundred dollars ($500.00).   (c) The North Carolina Housing Finance Agency, and any bank, savings institution, or credit union that is not required to obtain authorization to make reverse mortgage loans under subsection (a) of this section, shall, prior to making any reverse mortgage loan, notify the Commissioner of its intent to make reverse mortgage loans.  This notification shall be made on a form prescribed by the Commissioner and shall contain all information required by the Commissioner.   (d) The Commissioner shall, upon determination that a lender should be authorized to make reverse mortgage loans, issue notice of this authority to the lender.  The authority to issue reverse mortgage loans is valid for the period of time specified by the Commissioner.  A lender to whom a notice of authority is issued shall display the notice prominently in any and all offices of the lender that make reverse mortgage loans. Authorizations issued under this section are nontransferable and subject to an annual fee of two hundred fifty dollars ($250.00). (1991, c. 546, s. 1; 1995, c. 115, s. 1.)     53-259.  Application of rules.   In addition to the provisions of this Article, authorized lenders shall comply with rules adopted by the Commissioner that are reasonable and necessary to effectuate the purposes of this Article and to protect the public interest.  Provided, however, that provisions in Chapters 24 or 45 of the General Statutes and the rules adopted under those Chapters that conflict with this Article shall not apply to reverse mortgage transactions governed by this Article. (1991, c. 546, s. 1; 1995, c. 115, s. 1.)     53-260.  Interest.   Notwithstanding any other provisions of law to the contrary, the parties to a reverse mortgage loan may contract for the payment of interest at a rate agreed to by the parties. Interest shall be deferred until the earliest occurrence of one or more events specified in the reverse mortgage loan contract. Payment of interest on deferred interest shall be as agreed upon by the parties to the contract.  The parties may agree that the deferred interest may be added to the outstanding balance of the loan.  The Commissioner may determine that the total annual percentage rate is excessive.  If the Commissioner determines the total annual percentage rate to be excessive, that determination shall be included in the information provided to counselors under G.S. 53-264(a)(7), and to applicants for reverse mortgage loans under G.S. 53-264(b). (1991, c. 546, s. 1; 1995, c. 115, s. 1.)     53-261.  Taxes, insurance, and assessments.   A reverse mortgage loan contract may provide that it is the primary obligation of the borrower to pay all property taxes, insurance premiums, and assessments in a timely manner, and that the failure of the borrower to make these payments and to provide evidence of payment to the lender may constitute grounds for default of the loan.  A reverse mortgage loan contract shall state that if a borrower fails to pay property taxes, insurance premiums, or assessments, the lender may choose, at the lender's option, to pay the amounts due, charge them to the reverse mortgage loan, and recalculate regularly scheduled payments under the loan to account for the increased outstanding loan balance. (1991, c. 546, s. 1; 1995, c. 115, s. 1.)     53-262.  Renegotiation of loan; calculation of outstanding        balance; prepayment.   (a)If a reverse mortgage loan contract allows for a change in the payments or payment options, the lender may charge a reasonable fee when payments are recalculated.   (b) The outstanding loan balance shall be calculated by adding the current totals of items described in subdivisions (1) through (4) below, and subtracting the current totals of all reverse mortgage loan payments made by the borrower to the lender:        (1)  The sum of all disbursements made by the lender to             the borrower, or to another party on the borrower's             behalf.        (2)  All taxes, assessments, insurance premiums, and             other similar charges paid to date by the lender             under G.S. 53-261 and not reimbursed by the             borrower within 60 days of the date payment was             made by the lender.        (3)  All actual closing costs the borrower has deferred,             if a deferral provision is contained in the loan             agreement.        (4)  The total accrued interest to date.   (c) Prepayment of the reverse mortgage loan, in whole or part, shall be permitted without penalty at any time during the term of the loan. (1991, c. 546, s. 1; 1995, c. 115, s. 1.)     53-263.  Limits on borrowers' liability.   (a)When a reverse mortgage loan becomes due, if the borrower mortgaged one hundred percent (100%) of the full value of the house then the amount owed by the borrower shall not be greater than (i) the fair market value of the house, minus sale costs, or (ii) the outstanding balance of the loan, whichever amount is less.   (b) If the borrower mortgaged less than one hundred percent (100%) of the full value of the house, the amount owed by the borrower shall not be greater than (i) the outstanding balance of the loan, or (ii) the percentage of the fair market value, minus sale costs, as provided in the contract, whichever amount is less.   (c) The lender shall enforce the debt only through the sale of the property and shall not obtain a deficiency judgment against the borrower. (1991, c. 546, s. 1; 1995, c. 115, s. 1.)     53-264.  Disclosures of loan terms.   (a)On forms prescribed by the Commissioner, all authorized lenders shall provide all of the following information to the Commissioner for dissemination to all counselors who provide counseling to prospective reverse mortgage borrowers:        (1)  The borrower's rights, obligations, and remedies             with respect to the borrower's temporary absence             from the home, late payments by the lender, and             payment default by the lender.        (2)  Conditions or events that require the borrower to             repay the loan obligation.        (3)  The right of the borrower to mortgage less than the             full value of the home, if permitted by the reverse             mortgage loan contract.        (4)  The projected total annual percentage rate             applicable under various loan terms and             appreciation rates and interest rates applicable at             sample ages of borrowers.        (5)  Standard closing costs.        (6)  All service fees to be charged during the term of             the loan.        (7)  Other information required by the Commissioner.        (8)  Information relating to contracts for shared             appreciation or shared value, as required by G.S.             53-270.1.   (b) Within 10 business days after application is made by a borrower, but not less than 20 business days before closing of the loan, lenders shall provide applicants with the same information required in subsection (a) of this section, shall inform applicants that reverse mortgage counseling is required before the loan can be closed, and shall provide the names and addresses of counselors listed with the Commissioner's office. (1991, c. 546, s. 1; 1995, c. 115, s. 1; 1998-116, s. 4.)     53-265.  Information required of lender.   (a)At the closing of the reverse mortgage loan, the lender shall provide to the borrower the name of the lender's employee or agent who has been designated specifically to respond to inquiries concerning reverse mortgage loans.  This information shall be provided by the lender to the borrower at least annually, and whenever the information concerning the designated employee or agent changes.   (b) On an annual basis and when the loan becomes due, the lender shall issue to the borrower, without charge, a statement of account regarding the activity of the mortgage for the preceding calendar year, or for the period since the last statement of account was provided.  The statement shall include all of the following information for the preceding year:        (1)  The outstanding balance of the loan at the             beginning of the statement period.        (2)  Disbursements to the borrower.        (3)  The total amount of interest added to the             outstanding balance of the loan.        (4)  Any property taxes, insurance premiums, or             assessments paid by the lender.        (5)  Payments made to the lender.        (6)  The total mortgage balance owed to date.        (7)  The remaining amount available to the borrower in             reverse mortgage loans wherein proceeds have been             reserved to be disbursed in one or more lump sum             amounts. (1991, c. 546, s. 1; 1995, c. 115, s. 1.)          53-266.  Effects of lender's default.   (a)A lender's failure to make loan advances to the borrower under the reverse mortgage loan contract shall be deemed the lender's default of the contract.  Upon the lender's default, the lender shall forfeit any right to collect interest or service charges under the contract.  The lender's right to recovery at loan maturity shall be limited to the outstanding balance as of the date of default, minus all interest.  Lenders may also be subject to other default penalties established by the Commissioner.   (b) Subsection (a) of this section shall not apply if the lender has previously declared the borrower in default under G.S. 53-267, or if the lender makes the required loan advance within the time stated in the mortgage contract or within 30 days of receipt of notice from the borrower that the loan advance was not received. (1991, c. 546, s. 1; 1995, c. 115, s. 1.)     53-267.  Repayment upon borrower's default.   A reverse mortgage loan contract may provide for a borrower's default, thereby triggering early repayment of the loan, based only upon one or more of the following terms and conditions:        (1)  The borrower fails to maintain the residence as             required by the contract.        (2)  The borrower sells or otherwise conveys title to             the home to a third party.        (3)  The borrower dies and the home is not the principal             residence of the surviving borrower.        (4)  The home is not the principal residence of at least             one of the borrowers for a period of 12 consecutive             months for reasons of physical or mental illness.        (5)  For reasons other than physical or mental illness,             the home ceases to be the principal residence of             the borrower for a period of 180 consecutive days             and is not the principal residence of another             borrower under the loan, without prior written             permission from the lender.        (6)  The borrower fails to pay property taxes, insurance             premiums, and assessments under G.S. 53-261. (1991,             c. 546, s. 1; 1995, c. 115, s. 1.)          53-268.  Time for initiation of foreclosure.   When a borrower's obligation to repay the reverse mortgage loan is triggered under G.S. 53-267, in addition to all rights conferred upon owners and borrowers under Chapter 45 of the General Statutes, the lender must give the borrower not less than 90 days' notice of its intent to initiate foreclosure proceedings.  If the contract so provides, interest will continue to accrue during the 90-day period. (1991, c. 546, s. 1; 1995, c. 115, s. 1.)     53-269.  Counseling provisions.   (a)The North Carolina Housing Finance Agency shall adopt rules governing the training of counselors and necessary standards for counselor training and shall establish reasonable fees for training.  The North Carolina Housing Finance Agency shall forward the names of all persons satisfying counselor training requirements to the Commissioner.   (b) The Commissioner shall maintain a list of counselors who have satisfied training requirements and shall periodically provide an up-to-date copy of the list to all authorized lenders.   (c) The Commissioner shall provide to all counselors who have satisfied training requirements information provided to the Commissioner by authorized lenders under G.S. 53-265. (1991, c. 546, s. 1; 1995, c. 115, s. 1.)     53-270.  Prohibited acts.   Reverse mortgage lenders are prohibited from engaging in any of the following acts in connection with the making, servicing, or collecting of a reverse mortgage loan:        (1)  Misrepresenting material facts, making false             promises, or engaging in a course of             misrepresentation through agents or otherwise.

(6)  Closing a reverse mortgage loan without receiving             certification from a person who is certified as a             reverse mortgage counselor by the State that the             borrower has received counseling on the             advisability of a reverse mortgage loan and the             various types of reverse mortgage loans and the             availability of other financial options and             resources for the borrower, as well as potential             tax consequences.        (7)  Failing to comply with this Article. (1991, c. 546,             s. 1; 1995, c. 115, s. 1; 1998-116, s. 1.)          53-270.1.  Contracts for shared appreciation or shared        value.   (a)A lender and a borrower may agree, in writing, that in addition to the principal and any interest accruing on the outstanding balance of a reverse mortgage loan, the lender may receive:        (1)  Shared appreciation if it is in an amount not             exceeding ten percent (10%) of the increase in the             value of the property from the date of origination             of the reverse mortgage loan to the date of loan             repayment; or        (2)  Shared value if it is in an amount not exceeding             ten percent (10%) of the value of the property at             the time of repayment of the reverse mortgage loan;             and        (3)  The shared appreciation or shared value is paid in             conjunction with a loan that:             a.   Is outstanding for 24 months or longer; and             b.

At least 14 days prior to closing, the                  borrower receives a disclosure that explains                  the additional costs and benefits of shared                  appreciation or shared value and compares                  those costs and benefits with a comparable                  loan without shared appreciation or shared                  value. These costs and benefits shall also be                  included in the information required under                  G.S. 53-264.   (b) Under subdivisions (a)(1) and (2) of this section, in determining the value of the property at the time of origination of the reverse mortgage loan and at the time of repayment, if repayment is not in conjunction with the sale of the property, the lender and the borrower shall have the right to obtain an appraisal from an appraiser licensed or certified in accordance with G.S. 93E-1-6. If the appraisals differ, and the parties cannot agree on a value, an average of the appraisals shall determine the value. If the borrower does not desire an appraisal, the lender may obtain an appraisal, which shall be controlling. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the parties may agree in writing to waive these requirements and agree upon the value of the property.   (c) If repayment is made in conjunction with the sale of the property, the actual and reasonable costs of sale shall be deducted from the value of the property prior to the calculation of the amount of shared appreciation or shared value.

Yes, you continue to own your home and benefit from any appreciation in value. However, MBOH will have a lien in the form of a first mortgage on your home which secures the RAM. Q.

Generally, the loan will be repaid from the proceeds of the sale of the home upon the death of the last surviving borrower residing in the home or upon the permanent vacation of the home by the borrower(s). Permanent vacation of the home is typically construed as more than 180 days."
GX233-70-4881516	"Department of Law                July 20th, 2000   ATTORNEY GENERAL, DISTRICT ATTORNEY, AND    SHERIFFS ISSUE ALERT ABOUT GIFTING PROGRAM PYRAMIDS    Attorney General Ken Salazar, District Attorney Wyatt Angelo and Sheriffs    Fred McKnight and William Masters of Ouray and San Miguel Counties issued a    consumer alert today warning consumers to avoid certain pyramid schemes promoted    as ""gifting programs"" in several counties on the Western Slope. While    promoted as being legal under state and federal laws, some reported programs    such as ""Gift Givers,"" ""Women Empowering Women,"" and ""Private    Gifting - A Total Team Concept,"" appear to be classic money chains or pyramid    schemes, which are illegal in Colorado and subject those who promote them to    criminal prosecution and civil liability to others in the chain.    Under Colorado law, a pyramid scheme is any program which uses a pyramid or    chain process in which participants pay in excess of $50 for the opportunity    to receive a payoff for inducing others to become participants. In simple terms,    a pyramid scheme is a program which derives its funding primarily from money    paid by newly recruited members and not from the actual sale of products or    merchandise to individuals outside of the program.   This alert is being issued because of a number of complaints and inquiries    from the Western Slope regarding the so-called ""gifting programs.""    Participants are required to invest $2,000 to $5,000 cash, with the promise    by the promoters of the program that participants will eventually receive up    to $35,000 for simply recruiting others to join.      These particular programs involve levels of participants, with one person    at the top. New members are required to ""gift"" between $2,000 and    $5,000 to the top person. The programs do not produce or sell any goods or services    -- the only source for the promised payoff of up to $35,000 is through the recruitment    of new persons willing to invest $2,000 to $5,000 cash.   ""These type of investment schemes are highly illegal in Colorado,""    warns Attorney General Salazar. ""The longer they are allowed to exist,    the greater the likelihood that a large number of people will lose a lot of    money."" said Salazar. Of particular concern to the Attorney General are    reports that some participants in these pyramids are going into significant    debt by obtaining loans and even cash advances from their credit card accounts    in order to join.   ""The great danger of every pyramid scheme,"" warned District Attorney    Angelo, ""is that as the pool of potential new investors dries up, later    participants will necessarily lose their money."" According to Angelo, consumers    should be very careful about being lured into these illegal pyramid schemes    because it is a mathematical certainty that most participants in these ""gifting""    programs will lose their money, with very little chance of ever recovering it.    ""These claims of legality are completely untrue, "" emphasized Ouray    County Sheriff McKnight, noting that ""these schemes are classic money chains,    which can only continue through the recruitment of new participants. Sooner    or later, the pool of new players dries up, and most persons will lose their    money.""   San Miguel County Sheriff Masters pointed out that, ""What has made these    recent programs particularly egregious are the attempts by promoters to persuade    new participants that these schemes are perfectly legal."" Promoters are    misleading new recruits into believing their programs are legal because the    Internal Revenue Service allows persons to receive gifts up to $10,000, without    gift tax liability. The Sheriff noted that, ""In the end, a program which    claims to help those in need, will cause financial hardship to many.""     Anyone with information concerning pyramid programs should contact their    local sheriff's and district attorney's offices. In addition, individuals who    have lost money through pyramid promotional schemes may file small claims or    county court lawsuits against their up-line sponsors, ""receivers,""    or ""seniors,"" to recover treble damages under the Colorado Consumer    Protection Act.                   [  Home  |  Department Home  |  Top  ]    Comments to  attorney.general@state.co.us"

Line of Credit - unscheduled payments or in installments, at times                  and in amount of borrower's choosing until the line of credit                  is exhausted.                                   Modified Tenure - combination of line of credit with monthly payments                  for as long as the borrower remains in the home.                                   Modified Term - combination of line of credit with monthly payments                  for a fixed period of months selected by the borrower.                                            Homeowners                whose circumstances change can restructure their payment options                for a nominal fee of $20.                               Unlike ordinary home equity loans, a HUD reverse mortgage does not                require repayment as long as the home is the borrower's principal                residence. Lenders recover their principal, plus interest, when                the home is sold. The remaining value of the home goes to the homeowner                or to his or her survivors. You can never owe more than your home's                value.                               If the sales proceeds are insufficient to pay the amount owed, HUD                will pay the lender the amount of the shortfall. HUD's Federal Housing                Administration (FHA) collects an insurance premium from all borrowers                to provide this coverage.                               The amount a homeowner can borrow depends on their age, the current                interest rate, other loan fees and the appraised value of their                home or FHA 's mortgage limits for their area, whichever is less.                Generally, the more valuable your home is, the older you are, the                lower the interest, the more you can borrow.                               For example, based on a loan with an interest rates of approximately                9 percent, and a home qualifying for $100,000, a 65-year-old could                borrow up to 22 percent of the home's value; a 75-year-old could                borrow up to 41 percent of the home's value; and, an 85-year-old                could borrow up to 58 percent of the home's value. The percentages                do not include closing costs because these charges can vary.                               There are no asset or income limitations on borrowers receiving                HUD's reverse mortgages.                               There are also no limits on the value of homes qualifying for a                HUD reverse mortgage. The value of the home will be determined by                an independent appraisal. However, the amount that may be borrowed                is capped by the maximum FHA mortgage limit for the area, which                varies from $132,000 to $239,250. For Alaska, Guam, Hawaii and the                Virgin Islands, the FHA mortgage limits may be adjusted up to 150                percent of the ceiling depending on the area. The FHA limits usually                increase each year. As a result, owners of higher-priced homes can't                borrow any more than owners of homes valued at the FHA limit.                               HUD's reverse mortgage program collects funds from insurance premiums                charged to borrowers. Senior citizens are charged 2 percent of the                home's value as an up-front payment plus one-half of one percent                monthly on the loan balance. These amounts are usually paid by the                lender and charged to the borrower's principal balance.               A                homeowner must receive consumer education and counseling by a HUD-FHA                approved  HECM counselor .

Perhaps you have heard the term Reverse Mortgage before; maybe someone has suggested one to you. What are Reverse Mortgages? If you are 62 years of age or older, they are a way to borrow against the equity in your home (the value of your home minus any mortgage debt you now have) to provide you with tax-free income. You continue to own, and live in, the home for the life of the loan. There are no loan payments until the loan ends. The money you receive can be in the form of:       A lump sum of cash.     Regular monthly payments for     your life or for as long as you live in the home.     Regular monthly payments for     a fixed length of time.     A line of credit to draw on     when you need it.     A combination of options 2     & 4 or options 3 & 4 above.     Carefully read this booklet before you decide to pursue a Reverse Mortgage. It is designed to help you make a wise decision about the most valuable asset you may own  your home. This booklet outlines some of the things you should think about before applying for a Reverse Mortgage.   When is a Reverse Mortgage right for you?   A Reverse Mortgage might be worth considering if:       You are committed to staying     in your home, either because you don't want to leave or because other     housing alternatives are unappealing or unaffordable.     You want to enhance your     lifestyle and enjoy your golden years.     You want a cushion for major     expenses such as medical bills for a serious or long-term condition, or for     major home repairs.     You have a regular need for     additional income to live on and your only significant asset is your home.     You want the peace-of-mind     that comes from knowing your financial needs are taken care of.     You own your home free of     debt or you have a small first mortgage.     You don't plan to leave your     home to your heirs through inheritance.     What are some of the potential advantages of Reverse Mortgages?       A Reverse Mortgage can help     you maintain your financial independence or improve your quality of life.     It allows you to remain in     your home and keep title to your property.     The money you receive is     tax-free. It is not usually considered income.     You make no payments     (principal or interest) until the loan ends or the house is sold.     Your income is not a     consideration in obtaining the loan since there are no payments until the     loan ends.     You cannot owe more than the     value of the house at the end of the loan.     What are some of the potential drawbacks of Reverse Mortgages?       Reverse Mortgages are even     more complicated than conventional mortgages and the consequences of various     options are not always obvious up front.     They may be relatively     expensive compared to other alternatives.     Although the money you     receive is tax-free, it may affect your eligibility for need based     public assistance benefits such as Medicare, Supplemental Social Security     Income (SSI) and Medicaid/MediCal.     Reduces the equity you have     in the property which could cause a potential negative impact for your     heirs.     Reverse Mortgages are often     not well understood, even by real estate and legal professionals. (Check out     their experience before accepting their advice.)     In general, what types of Reverse Mortgages are available?       FHA-insured mortgages      Home Equity Conversion Mortgage (HECM).     Lender-insured.     Uninsured.     Each type differs in the amount you can borrow, how the proceeds will be paid, and allowed expenses such as interest, closing costs and other fees.         How much money do I need?     Is there a way to meet my     needs that does not involve getting a Reverse Mortgage?     Will a Reverse Mortgage make     my partner or me ineligible for any government benefits  now or in the     future?     Do I qualify for this     Reverse Mortgage?     How much can I borrow     through a particular Reverse Mortgage product?     How much will it cost me in     fees and interest to borrow this money, even if I don't have any     out-of-pocket expenses?     Will I have to sell my house     before I die to pay off this Reverse Mortgage?     If I die, and my partner is     still living in the home, will he or she have to leave or pay off the loan?     Will the loan become due and     payable if I go to a long-term care or nursing home?     What will my heirs or I have     left after the loan is paid off?     Are there any     early-repayment penalties?     What are my obligations     under the Reverse Mortgage, such as property maintenance, property taxes and     insurance?     * This list of questions is reproduced from Guarding the Golden Years. Reverse Mortgages published by Consumers Union, West Coast Regional Office, 1535 Mission Street, San Francisco, CA 94103. Website:  http://www.consumersunion.org     Six important things to do before you make a decision.             Decide how long you expect to stay in this home. Reverse Mortgages are     relatively expensive for the first 2-3 years. If a Reverse Mortgage doesn't     work as a long-term solution, you should consider other options.     Consult with a HUD-approved Reverse Mortgage counselor before you apply.     This information service is usually offered free of charge. A counselor can     help you decide whether a Reverse Mortgage or some alternative best meets     your needs. They can help you choose between the different kinds of Reverse     Mortgages and answer your what if questions.     Decide if you really need a Reverse Mortgage. Another type of loan may be     a less costly solution to meet your financial needs. A counselor can show     you alternatives.     Include your family, especially grown children, in the decision-making     process. Try to get consensus among your heirs before going ahead. If     inheritance is an issue, adult children may be willing to help.     Shop around and compare offerings! Not all Reverse Mortgages are the same.     They can vary substantially in how much money you get  immediately and in     the long-term, how the money is paid out, how much you pay in interest and     other charges, and in other features.     Determine if your Reverse Mortgage affects your eligibility for need     based public assistance benefits you may receive.     Do you still have questions? Read on. The rest of this booklet will try to make you more knowledgeable about Reverse Mortgages, answer some of the most frequently asked questions and provide pointers to sources of more detailed and specific information.         II.  Reverse Mortgages  Frequently Asked Questions     What's in this section?     Reverse Mortgages are quite different from conventional mortgages. In this section we answer typical questions that potential borrowers ask. We encourage you to discuss more detailed and specific questions with a counselor. Youll find more information about locating a counselor in Section III.B.   What's reverse about a Reverse Mortgage?   You are probably familiar with conventional mortgages. With these, you borrow money and make payments to build equity in a home. You pay off the debt by making regular payments from your income until the loan principal and interest are paid. As you make payments, your equity (the home's value minus any mortgage debt) increases and your debt (loan balance) shrinks. If you fail to make regular payments, you could lose your home. With a Reverse Mortgage, you borrow against the equity you have built in your home to produce income, or a line of credit. The debt is paid off at the end of the loan by selling the home, or using other assets to pay off the loan. You cannot lose the house during the life of the Reverse Mortgage loan for not making payments, because you don't have any payments to make. Meanwhile, the debt (loan balance including interest and fees) increases and your equity shrinks.   Won't that leave me in debt when I die?   Not in debt to the mortgage lender beyond the value of your home. The Reverse Mortgage lender can never require more repayment than the value of your home when it sells. This is called a non-recourse loan. When you or your surviving co-borrower dies, the sale of the house settles the loan. The lender does not have recourse to your other assets or to your heirs. If the loan ends for some other reason (such as if you move to an assisted living facility), the house will have to be sold or the loan paid off some other way. If you plan to leave your home to your children to inherit, think twice before you take out a Reverse Mortgage.               Isn't it risky to put myself into debt when I live on a fixed income?     There are certainly things to look out for; we will discuss these in the fourth section of this booklet. But in general the answer is not usually. Think of it this way: when you bought your home, you depended on money you didn't yet have to pay off the loan (your income). With a Reverse Mortgage, the loan is paid by money you already have (the value of your home). The lender cannot require more than that. You could think of it as a loan that has already been paid.     How much money can I get?     The best short answer to that question is: It depends.    In general, the amount you can receive depends on five things:           The mortgage program and program options you select.     The age of the youngest borrower when you take out the loan.     The appraised value of your home.     Current interest rates.     The amount of equity in your home.         In any program, the most cash generally goes to the oldest borrower(s), living in the most expensive home, when interest rates are low.    The youngest borrowers, living in the least expensive homes, when interest rates are high, get the least cash. But, it is important to remember that the amount you could get each month, and the total amount you could get over the life of the loan, depends on the program and options you select. No single program works best for everyone. We discuss programs and options further in the next section of this booklet.     How can I use the money from a Reverse Mortgage?     There are no restrictions on how you use the money from a Reverse Mortgage. Some borrowers use the proceeds of the loan to repair or remodel the home. Others use the money to improve their lifestyle  free themselves from financial worries, take more trips or keep the money in reserve (a line of credit) to handle future unplanned expenses. Still others receive regular payments to help pay their monthly bills or medical expenses. It's up to you.     Do I qualify for a Reverse Mortgage?     Different programs have different requirements, but most programs:       require the youngest     borrower to be at least 62 years old at the time the loan closes;     will loan on owner-occupied     single-family homes (some programs will also loan on 2-4 unit owner-occupied     dwellings, federally approved condominiums, planned unit developments or     manufactured homes on foundations);     will not loan on mobile     homes or cooperative apartments;     require that your home is     your principal residence, meaning you must live there more than half     of each year;     require that your home meets     minimum FHA property standards;     require that you pay off any     existing mortgage or other liens against your home before getting the     Reverse Mortgage, or use an immediate cash advance from the Reverse Mortgage     to pay them off. (If you cannot pay off the existing mortgage or don't     qualify for a large enough cash advance, you will not be able to get a     Reverse Mortgage.)     While income and general credit history are not considerations for obtaining a Reverse Mortgage, if borrowers are a year or more delinquent in their property tax or insurance payments, an amount equal to three years of taxes and insurance may be set aside in the loan to pay them in the future.     What if one of the homeowners is under 62 years of age?     In this case, the only option for the younger homeowner is to make out a quitclaim deed, releasing their interest in the home to the borrower. The drawback is that when the borrower dies or leaves the home, the loan becomes due, and the home may have to be sold to pay it. If both borrowers are over 62 and own the home as joint tenants or in a family trust and one dies or leaves, the loan continues and the remaining borrower can continue to live in the home. For tenants-in-common there is no right of survivorship so when either party dies, the loan ends and must be paid.     How much will a Reverse Mortgage cost me?     Again, the short answer is: It depends. Because costs vary so much between lenders, and are so difficult to compare, a standard of comparison has been developed called Total Annual Loan Cost (TALC). We will discuss this in more detail in the last section of this booklet. In general, costs come under three categories:           When you apply for the loan, lenders charge an application fee, which pays     for an appraisal to determine how much your home is worth and a check to see     if you are delinquent on any federally insured loans. This out-of-pocket fee     may not be refunded if you later change your mind about taking out the loan.     At the loan closing (signing), a number of fees take effect. Most of them     can be financed. They become part of the loan, and would also accrue     interest. Many of these fees are similar to those for conventional     mortgages; others are unique to Reverse Mortgages. The two fees that     generally vary the most between lenders are the origination fee and the     ongoing fees for servicing the loan. You should check these fees     specifically when comparing loans.     When the loan ends, there may also be shared equity or shared appreciation     fees. These could entitle the lender to a percentage of the remaining value     of the home. When comparing loans, check to see if there are any additional     fees when the loan ends.       What is expected of me as a homeowner during the life of the Reverse Mortgage?     The general requirements are:           That you pay your property taxes on time.     That you keep your homeowner insurance current.     That you maintain your home in good repair.           What about interest rates?     All current programs use adjustable interest rates, either computed annually or monthly (rarely semiannually), depending on the program. Most borrowers choose monthly rates; sometimes there is not a choice. Rates are usually a bit higher than for conventional mortgages, some are much higher. Shop around before deciding on a program.     When will the loan end and how much will I owe at the end of the loan?     Typically the loan ends when the last surviving co-borrower dies, moves away or doesn't live in the home for 12 consecutive months. If the loan is for a fixed amount of time (term), it becomes due when that time runs out. It is also possible the loan could end if you fail to meet the homeowner requirements mentioned above, though most lenders will work with you to meet those requirements.   The amount you owe at the end of the loan (your loan balance) consists of:           All the money you borrowed, including any you used to pay loan-closing     costs.     All the accrued interest on that money and any financed fees  up to the     loan's non-recourse limit, the fair market value of your home.           How do I pay off the loan?     In most cases, the loan is paid when the last surviving borrower dies or moves away. Some people choose to pay off the loan early. There are three ways of paying off the loan:           You or your heirs can sell the house. Either the sale will cover the loan     or it will net more than the loan. Any proceeds of the sale beyond what is     required to pay off the mortgage belong to you or your heirs. The lender can     never get more than the fair market sale price of the home. Your other     assets and your heirs are safe.     Other assets you or your heirs have could be used to pay off the loan (for     example: life insurance or stock). The lender gets the money and you or your     heirs keep the house.     If there is enough equity left, you or your heirs can refinance the home     (probably with a conventional mortgage) and pay off the loan that way.           How does a Reverse Mortgage affect government benefits?     Social Security and Medicare benefits are not affected, since they are not based on income or assets. Supplemental Social Security Income (SSI) and Medicaid/MediCal do have income constraints. Loan advances generally do not affect your benefits if you spend them during the month in which you get them. If you don't spend them in that calendar month (keep them in a savings or checking account, for example), they count as liquid assets and could affect your eligibility. An annuity purchased with a Reverse Mortgage could also make you ineligible. Check with the local SSI or Medicaid office, a senior-citizens attorney or a reverse mortgage counselor, to clear up any specific questions you may have.     What about income taxes?     Generally, the IRS does not consider loan payments made to you as income, so they are not taxed. The interest the lender charges you on the loan can only be deducted in the year the loan interest is paid, at the end of the loan. Annuities may count as taxable income. Talk with a tax professional for specific advice.         III.  Reverse Mortgages  The Process     What's in this section?     In this section, we look at obtaining a Reverse Mortgage and some of the issues and things to think about in the process. This section describes the steps involved and takes a general look at the different programs. It does not include detailed cost and benefit comparison of program options for two reasons:           In most cases, costs and benefits depend on local conditions  housing     prices, interest rates, etc., which change with location and time. Any     general comparison might be misleading.     Preferred Counselors for Reverse Mortgages have computer software     that can give you a detailed analysis and comparisons for loans in your area     that meet your needs. (More about Preferred Counselors later in this     section.)           What steps should I take to determine if a Reverse Mortgage is right for me?             The first step is to find out how much money is coming in and how much is     going out to get an accurate idea of your financial needs. This will become     very important as you examine Reverse Mortgage programs and their options     and alternatives. The approach suggested here follows an outline provided by     the Federal National Mortgage Association (also known as Fannie Mae). A     complete outline may be obtained from Fannie Mae. See the Resources Section     for contact information.               Locate and assemble all of the records that show your sources of         income and expenses for the past year.         List your sources of spendable income. List all the funds available to         you as spendable income, but do not include interest or other earnings         that were immediately reinvested.         List all your expenses. These could include: mortgage payments, other         debts, utilities, food, income taxes, property taxes, insurance,         transportation, medical and dental not covered by insurance, clothing,         recreation, gifts, holidays, vacations, etc.         Analyze your cash flow. If you are like most homeowners, you will         probably see ways to make more efficient use of your assets. One way         might be to use the equity in your home to generate additional income.                   Make a budget for the next 12 months. Estimate all the income and expenses     you expect over the next year.               Using your cash flow statement, list regular monthly income and         non-monthly income you expect each month for the next year  the         amounts and the sources. Add the monthly and non-monthly amounts         together to get an annual total.         Do the same thing for expenses for the next year.         Compare annual income and expense totals. If your total expected         expenses are more than your total expected income, this indicates the         amount of additional funding required to meet your needs.         Now that you have the numbers, list your financial goals in their         order of importance. Start by thinking about your needs and wants, now         and for the future. This gives you a good starting place, even though         they may change. Now list the estimated cost to meet each of these         goals. To calculate your funding needs as a lump sum, multiply the         annual total by the number of years you plan to remain in your home.                   The next step is to locate a Reverse Mortgage counselor. To be better     informed before you contact the counselor, or to locate one, you may wish to     use the Internet from home or at the local library or senior center. A list     of useful websites, phone numbers and publications is included at the end of     this booklet. For the most up-to-date and detailed information, get     acquainted with the National Center for Home Equity Conversion (NCHEC)     website,  http://www.reverse.org . It     contains a wealth of helpful information and pointers to other useful sites.     Your library may also have books that will help you learn more about Reverse     Mortgages.            Now, about counselors. Some people in the real estate, financial planning     and legal professions often have an incomplete understanding of Reverse     Mortgages. If you do your homework, you may be surprised to find that you     will develop a more complete understanding. Both the U.S. Department of     Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and NCHEC websites provide lists, by     state, of public or nonprofit organizations that do Reverse Mortgage     counseling. Some lists may not be up-to-date. A toll-free number     (800-569-4287) can also be used to locate HUD-approved counselors. NCHEC     Preferred Counselors work for nonprofit or public agencies, not     lenders. They have detailed local information about lenders, program options     and costs, and alternatives to consider. They pledge to:               Disclose all your options.         Be unbiased.         Be independent.         Protect your privacy.                  Any counselor you use should be willing to make a similar pledge to you.        Why meet with the counselor before you contact a lender? There are several   good reasons.           A counselor can help you consider all your options, some of which may       not involve getting a Reverse Mortgage.       A counselor can point you to all the Reverse Mortgage lenders in your       area. (You may be surprised how few there are.)       They can give you a Personal Reverse Mortgage Analysis and a       comparison, in writing, of all the Reverse Mortgage programs available in       your area.       A counselor can point you to other sources of advice you may need.       There is no pressure from a counselor to apply for a Reverse Mortgage.       At the end of the counseling session, the counselor will provide you       with a HUD Certificate of HECM Counseling, which you may need if you apply       for a Reverse Mortgage loan.        If you cannot locate a counselor within driving distance (most of them are   located in urban areas), you can consult with one by phone. Not all Reverse   Mortgage programs require counseling before applying for a loan but it's in   your best interest to get it anyway.        However you do it, get this important information before you discuss specific   programs with a lender and before you apply for a loan. Because of cost   constraints, some independent counseling agencies have a nominal charge for   their services (usually around $75). What you learn can save you much more   than that.  One more note: not all counselors are equally knowledgeable.   It's okay to ask how long they have been doing this type of counseling and how   many clients they have worked with.         Your next step is to locate a lender. Your counselor will have names and     contact information for lenders in your area. You can also find lender     information in the resources listed at the back of this booklet. Applying     for a Reverse Mortgage is similar to applying for a conventional mortgage.     The process is somewhat more complicated because program options have to be     selected and an annuity may be included. There are the usual inspection,     appraisal, title insurance and broker fees. Typically, there are more fees     than with a conventional mortgage. The lender is required by law to disclose     the total cost of the loan. However, you may find this information difficult     to understand. A counselor or senior attorney can help you make sense of it.     If you are confused at any time, always ask to have it explained. After the     lender processes the loan, there is a closing (signing) of the loan. Don't     be surprised at the number of pages you will have to sign or initial. Read     everything before you sign and always be sure you understand what you are     signing.            By law, you have three business days after signing to change your mind and     cancel the loan. After three days, you have access to the money under the     payment option you chose. If there is an existing mortgage, it will be paid     off at this time.               What are the most common Reverse Mortgage programs and options?     This is a relatively new and rapidly growing market, programs change and new ones appear over time, so we will describe representative examples of currently available programs without trying to include them all. All the programs discussed use adjustable mortgage interest rates (ARM). However, the rates and the way they are calculated vary considerably from program to program. If you choose the line of credit option with any of these programs, there is a monthly service fee. Your counselor will have specific information about programs and options in your area.   By far, the most used program is HUD's Home Equity Conversion Mortgage (HECM). Most Reverse Mortgage lenders offer it. This federally insured program might give you more cash than other programs if your home is worth less than, or about as much as, the average home in your county. Here are some of the characteristics of the HECM program:           This is the only federally insured program. This insures the lender in     case the loan amount is more than the value of the home, and it ensures that     your payments will continue no matter what happens to the lender. The     premium is two percent of the loan amount plus one-half of one percent of     the outstanding loan balance annually.     Independent counseling (and a counseling certificate) is required to     obtain this loan.     All the payment options and combinations are available with this program     except lump-sum payment.     You can take out a lump sum from the line of credit option. You can change     your payment option during the life of the loan  for example, from a line     of credit to monthly payments.     This program often has the lowest interest rates over the life of the     loan. It allows you to repay part of the principal and then borrow it again     without restarting the loan and without a penalty.     A unique feature is that if you choose a line of credit, the amount of     credit available to you grows larger each month the loan is in effect. This     means the total amount you can borrow can become much larger over time.     One possible drawback of this program is that the appraised value of your     home is not the only factor in determining how much you can borrow. The     maximum loan amount is also limited by the 203-b-2 limit for your     area. This is a fixed maximum home value, defined by HUD, which varies     depending on the area where you live. In areas where housing is rapidly     appreciating, you may find this limit much lower than the appraised value of     your home.           Fannie Mae's program is called Home Keeper. It may be appropriate if your home is worth slightly more than the average home in the county. Some characteristics of this program are:           The amount you can get from Home Keeper is sometimes higher than from HECM     because Fannie Mae's maximum loan limit is higher than HUD's.     Independent counseling is required to obtain this loan.     The only payment option is monthly payments for as long as you live in the     home (tenure), line of credit or a combination of the two.     If you choose the line of credit option, the maximum amount available does     not grow.     A variation is called Home Keeper for Home Purchase that can help you     downsize to a new home without making monthly mortgage payments.           Financial Freedom, a private lender, has two programs. Borrowers with expensive homes, worth much more than the HUD limit, may consider using them.           Equity Guard is a Reverse Mortgage Annuity program.               You either receive a lump sum of cash, purchase an immediate annuity         or a combination of the two.         The annuity provides payments that continue for life, regardless of         whether you remain in your home.         Counseling is required but does not have to be done by an independent         counselor.         The loan becomes due when the borrower or surviving co-borrower no         longer lives in the home (as his principal residence) or dies.         At maturity, the lender receives the percentage of the home value (up         to 80%) you pledged when the loan was obtained. The remaining value         returns to you or your estate.         If the value of the home when it is sold is less than the pledged         amount, the lender can only claim the sale price of the home.         This program is usually most cost effective if you plan to stay in         your home for a number of years.         There may be income tax considerations in connection with the annuity         option and it may affect your eligibility for need based public         assistance.                   Cash Account is a line of credit program.               An open-ended line of credit with a maximum limit is established for         the borrower. The money can be borrowed, repaid and borrowed again.         The loan ends when the borrower or surviving co-borrower dies or         leaves the home.         It does not include an annuity.         When the loan ends, principal, interest and fees are paid to the         lender, but not more than the sale price of the home.         There is an equity sharing option that increases the amount that         can be borrowed in return for giving the lender a share of the         appreciated value of the home when it is sold.                       The interest rates for both these Financial Freedom programs may be considerably higher than HECM rates.         IV.  Reverse Mortgages  Things to Consider     Things to consider before applying for a Reverse Mortgage.         Scams and frauds         Although most Reverse   Mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical, some scams have been reported. If   you receive an offer from an estate planning service, by phone or mail,   to put you in touch with a Reverse Mortgage lender, the solicitor may want you   to pay a substantial fee for that service. HUD, Fannie Mae and most lenders   will not allow such a fee, since the information is available for little or no   cost from a counselor or an Internet site. Do not sign a service agreement   that includes a fee for this service. Also, be careful of solicitations that   come by phone or mail.                     Alternatives to Reverse     Mortgages         There may be alternative ways   of obtaining financial relief without taking out a Reverse Mortgage. For   example: if there is a problem making property tax payments, the California   State Franchise Tax Board offers a tax postponement service that works much   like a Reverse Mortgage. It is available to homeowners who are 62 years or   older, own their home (there can be a mortgage), and have an annual income of   $24,000 or less. The interest rate is much lower than for a Reverse Mortgage.   The phone number to obtain an application and further information is   1-800-952-5661.     If the home is in need of   repairs that you cannot afford to make, your local Housing and Redevelopment   Agency may have a Senior Loan Program that can help. These loans also do not   require repayment until the home is sold or you move out. Interest rates are   either low or there is no interest charge. Programs for emergency repairs such   as building ramps, widening doorways, etc. may also be available. Check the   white pages of your phone book under your county or city name followed by   Housing.     Assistance programs may be   available for those with special needs  blind, disabled, veterans    through these same agencies. A Reverse Mortgage counselor will have the most   current information about all these programs in your area.     If you decide to take out a   Reverse Mortgage after you have signed up for any of these assistance   programs, ask if they can be subordinated to the new loan. Subordination means   that you do not have to pay off this loan in order to obtain the new one.   Instead, the assistance loan becomes secondary to the Reverse Mortgage. Many   agencies will do this if they think it appropriate.       Things to consider before closing the loan.             Compare loan costs. Federal Truth-in-Lending regulations require the     lender to disclose the Total Annual Loan Cost (TALC) on all Reverse     Mortgages at various points in time. But lenders are not required to make     this disclosure until after you apply for a loan. NCHEC Preferred     Counselors and some lenders have Personal Reverse Mortgage Analysis     software that overcomes such difficulties. This is another good reason to     consult a counselor before you apply for a loan.     Among the most important variables in the total cost of Reverse Mortgages     are the fees that are charged at the beginning and during the loan. These     could include origination fees, points, mortgage insurance premiums, closing     costs, monthly servicing fees, shared equity or appreciation fees. Be sure     you know what you are committing to pay.     Most fees are assessed at the start of the loan and make up a large     portion of the total loan costs in the first few years. Terminating a     Reverse Mortgage after a year or two can be very costly.     Many lenders and brokers listed by HUD and Fannie Mae also sell Reverse     Mortgage products from other sources. Be sure you understand which program     they are suggesting.     Beware of shared appreciation or shared equity fees. These     give the lender a share of any increase in the value of the home between the     time the loan is closed and when it ends (usually in return for a larger     loan amount). They can significantly increase the cost of the loan.     Reverse Mortgage loan documents can be long and confusing. At the closing,     you will be expected to sign or initial many pages. If you find any of the     terms confusing or you are uncertain about what they commit you to do, get     independent advice before you sign. This is particularly important if the     loan you are considering includes an annuity, since an annuity can have     undisclosed income tax and needs based assistance implications     depending on the contract language.           Things to consider during the life of the loan.             Refinancing a Reverse Mortgage can be very costly. HUD and Fannie Mae     programs have some flexibility in the way payments are made, which may make     refinancing unnecessary. Consider the costs carefully before deciding to     refinance.     Be sure to keep your property tax and homeowner insurance premiums     current. Failing to do so may lead to additional charges from the lender or     termination of the loan. If you are having difficulty making payments,     contact your lender. It may be possible to arrange to make payments using     loan funds.         A Reverse Mortgage may be exactly what you need to improve your lifestyle or maintain your financial independence. Other alternatives may work better or be less expensive. The best way to be sure you made the correct choice is to be as well informed as possible before making a decision.

USHIJIMA Commissioner of Securities Telephone: 586-2744 FAX: 586-2733  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  July 30, 2001  COMMISSIONER OF SECURITIES ISSUES ORDER AGAINST WOMEN EMPOWERING WOMEN GIFTING CIRCLE PYRAMID SCHEME The Commissioner of Securities, Ryan S. Ushijima, issued a Cease & Desist Order against WOMEN EMPOWERING WOMEN aka WOMEN'S GIFTING CIRCLE aka TABLE GIFTING CIRCLE aka the GIFTING CIRCLE, and MARLENE VINTERO, who are individuals and/or entities involved in what appears to be an illegal pyramid investment scheme. This particular scheme targets women and has particularly hit the Big Island. The Commissioner warns that if you are continuing to be a part of this scheme you are potentially violating state securities laws and subject to civil sanctions, including civil penalties of up to $100,000 per violation. Gifting clubs are in reality illegal pyramid investment schemes. New club members give cash ""gifts"" to the highest ranking club members. If they get additional members to join the club, new members are promised that they too will rise to the top and receive money  far more than they initially paid to join the club  from newer club ""friends."" The problem is, like most pyramid schemes, illegal gifting clubs must continually recruit ever-increasing numbers of members to survive. When the clubs don't attract enough new members, they collapse. Most members who paid to join the clubs never receive the financial ""gifts"" they expected, and lose everything they paid to join the club. Pyramid investment schemes are illegal under State securities laws because memberships or interests in a pyramid scheme constitute an investment contract, which is defined by statute to be a ""security"". State securities laws require that such investments  as well as the individuals and companies soliciting their sale  be registered with the State. Neither the investments nor the individuals and entities named here are registered with the State. State securities laws also prohibit fraud in connection with the offer or sale of a security. DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE & CONSUMER AFFAIRS BENJAMIN J. CAYETANO, Governor KATHRYN S. MATAYOSHI, Director NOE NOE TOM, Deputy Director   PAGE 2  A pyramid investment program is, by its very nature, a scheme to defraud as participants swindle the public by using the lure of quick and easy profits to pay off eariler investors and recruit new investors into a program which will eventually collapse and fail, causing the loss of their entire investment. WOMEN EMPOWERING WOMEN GIFTING CIRCLE PYRAMID SCHEME 2001 July 30,  The Order issued today by the Commissioner finds that memberships or interests in the gifting circle are securities, prohibits the named parties from making any offers, sales, or solicitations of these securities, or any other securities, in the State of Hawaii, and imposes a civil penalty of $90,000 joint and severally. Commissioner Ushijima warns Hawaii investors that if they are approached about joining a club, but aren't sure if it's an illegal gifting club, they are reminded to: ? ? Consider that a legitimate gift has no strings attached and is not an ""investment."" Avoid being misled into thinking a gifting club is legitimate because the ads say that members consider their payments a gift and expect nothing in return. This is an attempt to make an illegal transaction look legal. Be wary of success stories or testimonials of tremendous payoffs. Very few members of illegal gifting clubs or pyramid schemes ever receive any money. Take your time. Don't buckle under to a high-pressure sales pitch that requires you to join immediately or risk losing out on the opportunity. Remember, solid opportunities  and solid friendships  aren't formed through nerve wracking tactics.  ? ?

They allow older consumers to convert the equity in                            their homes to cash while retaining home ownership.                           With a ""regular"" mortgage,                            you make monthly payments to the lender. But with a                            reverse mortgage, you receive money from the lender                            and generally do not have to repay it for as long as                            you live in your home. In return, the lender holds some                            — if not most or all — of your home's equity.                            Introduced in the late 1980s, reverse                            mortgages can help homeowners who are ""house-rich-but-cash-poor""                            remain in their homes and still meet their financial                            obligations. The proceeds of the loan are tax-free,                            there are no minimum income requirements, and for most                            reverse mortgages, the money can be used for any purpose.                           But, reverse mortgages also tend to                            be more costly than other loans, and there have been                            cases of abuse by unscrupulous lenders.                           If you're considering a reverse mortgage,                            it's important to understand how the loans work and                            what your rights and responsibilities are.                           The Basics                             There are several types of reverse                            mortgages:                                                        the federally insured Home                              Equity Conversion Mortgage (HECM), administered by                              the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD)                              single-purpose reverse mortgages,                              usually offered by state or local government agencies                              for a specific reason                              proprietary reverse mortgages,                              offered by banks, mortgage companies, and other private                              lenders and backed by the companies that develop them.                                                     To qualify for a reverse mortgage,                            you must be at least 62 and have paid off all or most                            of your home mortgage. Income is generally not a factor,                            and no medical tests or medical histories are required.                            If you seek an HECM, you also must undergo free mortgage                            counseling from an independent government-approved ""housing                            agency."" Financial institutions offering proprietary                            reverse mortgages may require similar counseling or                            homeowner education.                           The amount you can borrow depends                            on your age, the equity in your home, the value of your                            home, and the interest rate. If it's an HECM, federal                            law limits the maximum amount that can be paid out.                           You can be paid in a lump sum, in                            monthly advances, through a line of credit, or a combination                            of all three.                           Common Features                            Reverse mortgages offer special appeal to older adults                            because the loan advances, which are not taxable, generally                            do not affect Social Security or Medicare benefits.                            Depending on the plan, reverse mortgages generally allow                            homeowners to retain title to their homes until they                            permanently move, sell their home, die, or reach the                            end of a pre-selected loan term. Generally, a move is                            considered permanent when the homeowner has not lived                            in the home for 12  consecutive  months. So,                            for example, a person could live in a nursing home or                            other medical facility for up to 12 months before the                            reverse mortgage would be due.                           However, be aware that:                                                        Reverse mortgages tend to be more costly than traditional                              loans because they are rising-debt loans. The interest                              is added to the principal loan balance each month.                              So, the total amount of interest owed increases significantly                              with time as the interest compounds.                              Reverse mortgages use up all or some of the equity                              in a home. That leaves fewer assets for the homeowner                              and his or her heirs.                              Lenders generally charge origination fees and closing                              costs; some charge servicing fees. How much is up                              to the lender.                              Interest on reverse mortgages is not deductible                              on income tax returns until the loan is paid off in                              part or whole.                              Because homeowners retain title to their home,                              they remain responsible for taxes, insurance, fuel,                              maintenance, and other housing expenses.                                                     Getting a                            Good Deal                            If you decide to consider a reverse mortgage, shop around                            and compare terms. Look at the:                                                        annual percentage rate (APR), which is the yearly                              cost of credit.                              type of interest rate. Some plans provide for fixed                              rate interest; others involve adjustable rates that                              change over the loan term based on market conditions.                              number of points (fees paid to the lender for the                              loan) and other closing costs. Some lenders may charge                              steep costs, which your lender may offer to finance.                              However, if you agree to this, you'll take out fewer                              proceeds from the loan or you'll borrow an extra amount,                              which will be added to your loan balance and you'll                              owe more interest at the end of the loan.                              total amount loan cost (TALC) rates. The TALC rate                              is the projected annual average cost of a reverse                              mortgage, including all itemized costs. It shows what                              the single all-inclusive interest rate would be if                              the lender could charge only interest and no fees                              or other costs.                              payment terms, including acceleration clauses.                              They state when the lender can declare the entire                              loan due immediately.                                                     Under the federal Truth in Lending                            Act, lenders must disclose these terms and other information                            before you sign the loan. On plans with adjustable rates,                            they must provide specific information about the variable                            rate feature. On plans with credit lines, they must                            inform the applicant about appraisal or credit report                            charges, attorney's fees, or other costs associated                            with opening and using the account. Be sure you understand                            these terms and costs.                           Reverse mortgages come with different                            provisions. For example, with some reverse mortgages,                            the lender may take a share of equity appreciation.                            This could create issues for the homeowner or heirs,                            particularly if the value of the home rises unexpectedly                            during the loan. Carefully read any provision of the                            contract about shared appreciation.                           Also, be cautious about reverse mortgages                            offered by door-to-door and other home solicitation                            lenders. There have been various problems with these                            types of lenders. Some of the problems have involved                            steep points and loans that primarily seek to take the                            owner's equity.                           You generally have at least three                            business days after signing a reverse mortgage contract                            to cancel it. The cancellation must be in writing.                           Reporting                            Possible Fraud                            If you suspect that a lender is violating the law, register                            your concerns with the lender or loan servicer. You                            also may wish to file a complaint with:                                                        your state Attorney General's office or state banking                              regulatory agency                              the Federal Trade Commission (FTC).

Discussions involving replacement of the district's property tax revenue with another source of revenue are going to occur, and a careful review of the districts financing was desired. In addition, we also reviewed issues surrounding the former Spanish Fork-Nephi Irrigation and Drainage System (SFN). In our opinion, management oversight and administrative controls within the Central Utah Water Conservancy District (the district) could be significantly improved.   First, the district's financial management can be more consistent. Second, district policies and procedures lack sufficiency and enforcement. Third, in addition to these managerial issues, the discontinuation of the SFN system affords an opportunity to analyze the district's water efforts.    District Financial Management Is Inconsistent. Some financial decisions made by district management have been beneficial to the taxpayer while others have not. Specifically, we found the following:     Debt Poor Poor Poor $170 pre-payment will save cash management has fund management has taxing decisions could million by 2015 $117 million by 2047 cost taxpayers $ 3.7 to $4.4 million cost taxpayers $7.2 million cost taxpayers $81 million by 2011 and  Central Utah Water Conservancy District, as a taxing entity, has a fiduciary responsibility to properly manage its funds. Management of those funds is a major task of the organization given the enormous size of its projects and the fact that the timing of funding and construction are not congruent. The district must invest its funds and disburse its funds to meet the needs of its projects and to ensure the greatest possible benefit for its constituents. Failing to achieve the greatest possible benefit from financial decisions is unacceptable.   District Policies and Procedures Lack Sufficiency and Enforcement. District management has allowed lapses in administrative controls that have resulted in questionable administrative practices. Disregard for policies and procedures, liberal interpretation of expense policies, and general manager approved violations of policies has resulted in approximately $90,000 of questionable expenses and $185,000 of expenses that violate accepted business practices. Examples of questionable district administrative controls demonstrative of either violated policies or poor controls include:    District board members indirectly receiving at least $110,000 from district contracts, although specifically prohibited by state code and district policy. District management benefits including a $75,000 contracted bonus agreement for future work as well as a $37,000 car for the general manager and inappropriately reported car allowances for another senior manager. Travel expenses at least $35,000 in excess of necessary travel costs; because the district failed to use the lowest available rates or follow its own lodging policy. Vehicle fleet utilization that does not appear adequate to support the number of fleet vehicles. Further, use of district vehicles for commuting purposes is not controlled well. District procurement practices resulting in retention of many services without using a competitive bid process.          Discontinuation of SFN Project Affords Opportunity to Redirect Efforts. In our opinion, district leadership has maintained a historical plan in the SFN water allocations. In particular, district leadership appears to be closely tied to delivering an irrigation project to southern Utah County and eastern Juab County. This focus is primarily defended using two arguments:   commitment to the area growth in the area  With Utah's rapid urbanization, it is possible that the former SFN plan may no longer be the best alternative. In particular, demographic and economic data question the water allocations of the former SFN water project. For example, east Juab County is projected to need 2,506 acre-feet of culinary water by   2050 while Salt Lake County is projected to need 286,133 acre-feet of water and northern Utah County is projected to need 91,566 acre-feet of water. In spite of this need, east Juab was to receive 42,000 acre-feet of water while Salt Lake County was to receive 70,000 acre-feet of water and northern Utah County was to receive 20,000 acre-feet of water. We believe that the Legislature should form a task force or study committee to independently analyze and recommend a position the Legislature could consider adopting regarding allocation of the former SFN water.   This Page Left Blank Intentionally   Chapter I Introduction Management oversight and administrative controls within the Central Utah Water Conservancy District (the district) could be significantly improved. First, the district's financial management can be more consistent. While the district reduced its long-term debt by making advantageous use of the federal government's need for cash, cash management at the district could be revamped. Further, with better financial planning, the district might be able to reduce its tax rate. Second, district policies and procedures lack sufficiency and enforcement. Specifically, lapses in administrative controls occurred which resulted in questionable administrative practices. Third, in addition to these managerial issues, the discontinuation of the Spanish Fork-Nephi (SFN) system affords an opportunity to analyze the district's water efforts. In our opinion, a legislative task force should be formed to independently re-assess the former SFN water allocations. Additionally we received three allegations related to district operations. The first allegation involved transactions between the district and Strawberry Water Users Association. The second allegation involved the activities of a group known as Waterwatch. The third allegation concerned bidding procedures for large district contracts. The first two allegations appeared to have no merit and the third was not addressed for lack of pertinent information.  History of the Central Utah Project The primary objective of the CUP was to help Utah claim its 1.7 million acre-feet a year from the Colorado River by storing and diverting water from the Colorado River Basin to the Bonneville Basin  The Central Utah Project (CUP), which is being completed by the Central Utah Water Conservancy District, has had a long and fairly tumultuous history. In 1922, the Colorado River Compact divided the waters of the Colorado River between the lower basin states (California, Arizona, and Nevada) and the upper basin states (Wyoming, Colorado, Utah, and New Mexico). Each basin was allocated about 7.5 million acre-feet of water annually. It was determined in 1948 that Utah had a 23 percent share of the upper basin water which equaled approximately 1.7 million acre-feet a year. The CUP was first described in a 1951 Bureau of Reclamation report. The CUP was so large that it was divided into two phases: the initial phase and the ultimate phase. Together, these two phases formed the comprehensive plan. 1   Under the CUP comprehensive plan, 800,600 acre-feet of water would be provided to Utah at an estimated total cost of a little over $1 billion. This amount of water would provide a full irrigation supply for 200,000 acres of new land and a supplemental supply to 239,900 under-irrigated acres. In addition, 48,800 acre-feet of municipal and industrial water was to be provided. In 1956, the Colorado River Storage Pact (CRSP) was passed with the CUP as the largest CRSP project. The primary objective of the CUP was to store and divert water from the Colorado River Basin to the Bonneville Basin. Flaming Gorge and Glen Canyon were the first CUP dams completed to aid in this objective. These dams were to function as ""cash register"" dams by generating power for the Intermountain West. The revenue from these power sales would help repay some costs of the CUP and other reclamation projects. The CUP was conceived 50 years ago when Utah was a more agrarian state. Today, Utah is the sixth most urban state in the nation.  Certainly many changes have occurred since the CUP was first described. When the CUP was conceived, the development of the agricultural economies of the states was a national goal. At this time, Utah was a more agrarian state. Today, Utah is the sixth most urban state in the nation. According to census data, 87 percent of Utah's population either lives in an urbanized area (Utah has four: Logan, Ogden, Salt Lake City, and Provo-Orem) or in a city over 2,500 persons. As a result, competition for water resources between urban and agricultural uses has become prominent. In addition to this change, environmental considerations have also become a significant factor today whereas these considerations were negligible fifty years ago. Because of environmental and other factors, it is simply harder and more costly today to construct a large-scale water project. Because of the above factors, the CUP appears to be scaled back in size. Today the plan most closely resembles the initial phase of the comprehensive plan. Under the current plan, 264,360 acre-feet of water are scheduled to be provided; 44,400 acre-feet are designated for fish habitat; 107,360 acre-feet are for M&I use, while 112,600 acre-feet are for irrigation use. This amount of irrigation water provides a full irrigation supply to 10,000 acres of new land and a supplemental supply to 65,570 under-irrigated acres. To date, $1.7 billion has been spent on the CUP. If the project is completed as planned with little time delay, the CUP is estimated to ultimately cost $2.3 billion.  2   The CUP is estimated to ultimately cost $2.3 billion.  In 1964, the Central Utah Water Conservancy District was organized by Utah's Fourth District Court. Seven counties were originally represented within the district: Uintah, Duchesne, Wasatch, Utah, Salt Lake, Summit, and Juab. Later, five more counties joined: Sanpete, Garfield, Piute, Millard and Sevier. Today, with the 1994 exodus of Millard and Sevier Counties, the district represents ten counties.  Central Utah Project Today The CUP is currently made up of six units: the Ute Indian Unit, the Vernal Unit, the Jensen Unit, the Uintah Unit, the Upalco Unit, and the Bonneville Unit. The Vernal and Jensen Units are the only two units which have been fully completed. Both the Uintah and Upalco Units are at an impasse because a long-standing disagreement between the Ute Tribe and the downstream water users over storage rights has never been resolved. Construction on the Ute Indian Unit is also on hold. The Bonneville Unit, the largest CUP unit, is partially completed; however, this unit has recently run into trouble as well. Work on 2 of the 6 units has stalled due to a long-standing storage rights disagreement  The Bonneville Unit has both a municipal and industrial (M&I) component and an irrigation and drainage (I&D) component. M&I is essentially culinary water use while I&D is essentially agricultural water use. The M&I system, of which the Jordanelle Reservoir is a primary component, is finished. However, the M&I component cannot function without the completion of another component- the Diamond Fork System. The proposed I&D system, of which the Strawberry Reservoir is a primary component, has not been completed and has recently run into trouble. The Spanish Fork-Nephi System (SFN), the I&D delivery system, has been a controversial project for some time. In general, the need for and expense of the project have been questioned. Recently, questions have been raised concerning competing water needs. Specifically, the wisdom of sending high quality water to southern Utah County and eastern Juab County as irrigation water was questioned, given the need for additional M&I water in Salt Lake County.  The Bonneville Unit, the largest CUP unit, is partially completed and has also run into trouble.  In spite of these questions, the district was in the process of completing a Draft Environmental Impact Statement (DEIS) for the SFN system. However, in July 1998, the Department of Interior (DOI) instructed the district to discontinue planning on the SFN system since it had become clear from public comments on the SFN DEIS that the former SFN project must be re-analyzed. 3   The district is currently in the process of obtaining a Final Supplemental to the Final Environmental Impact Statement (FS/FEIS) on the Diamond Fork System which was previously included in the SFN DEIS. While the SFN pipeline is an optional system, the Diamond Fork System is not. The Diamond Fork System must be completed in order for Jordanelle Reservoir to make contractual water deliveries to Salt Lake County. The relationship between the Diamond Fork System and the Jordanelle Reservoir revolves around the Jordanelle Exchange which is explained in Appendix A. Once construction begins on Diamond Fork, reanalysis will begin on the former SFN system.  Audit Scope and Objectives This audit follow-up was initiated in response to a request by several legislators. In particular, these legislators were concerned that property tax payments for the CUP might not be the most equitable means of paying for water use. However, before this issue could be analyzed, the legislators requested current information on the district, the chief agency responsible for the CUP. As a result, these legislators requested a follow-up of our 1989 audit on the district. The previous audit had identified a number of financial and administrative concerns, and it was the desire of the requesting legislators to determine how well managed the district is today. While this audit focused primarily on issues identified in the 1989 audit, we also reviewed some additional CUP issues. In 1989, the district was not the agency responsible for administering the CUP; rather, the Bureau of Reclamation was. However, in 1992, the Central Utah Project Completion Act (CUPCA) took the administration of the CUP away from the Bureau of Reclamation and gave that responsibility to the district. As a result, we allowed our scope to extend to some CUPCA issues. Our audit objectives were the following: 1. Determine if the district's financial management is sound. 2. Determine if the district's administrative controls are adequate and functioning well. 3. Identify possible concerns surrounding the re-scoping of the former SFN system. 4   Chapter II District Financial Management Is Inconsistent District application of generally accepted financial management principles has been inconsistent. Some financial decisions made by district management have been beneficial while other decisions have not been well thought out and have cost taxpayers at least $11.1 million. Unchecked, poor district taxing decisions could cost Utah taxpayers tens of millions more. District financial decisions have an effect on Utah's taxpayers; failing to achieve the greatest possible benefit from financial decisions is unacceptable. In part, the success of some district decisions has contributed to the failure of other decisions. Prior to 1998, the district did little long-term financial planning and, as such, had no strong criteria for setting tax rates. The district bases a great deal of its planning on work of the Governor's Task Force in 1993, which indicated that funding shortfalls might occur. However, the district's federal repayment and changing plans have dramatically altered the district's funding needs. The district has not recognized its own changing environment in its planning process and, as of May 1999 continued to incorrectly state that it would need to tax at the highest possible rate. Central Utah Water Conservancy District (the district), as a taxing entity, has a fiduciary responsibility to properly manage its funds. Management of those funds is a major task of the organization given the enormous size of its projects and the fact that the timing of funding and construction are not congruent. The district must invest and disburse its funds to meet the needs of its projects and to ensure the greatest possible benefit for its constituents. The following topics are addressed in this chapter:      Debt pre-payment will save taxpayers $117 million by 2047 Poor cash management has cost taxpayers $3.7 to $4.4 million Poor fund management has cost taxpayers $7.2 million Poor taxing decisions could cost taxpayers $81 million by 2011 and $170 million by 2015 Earlier recommendations have been implemented  5   Federal Debt Pre-Payment Created Major Savings In 1992, federal government balanced-budget initiatives allowed CUWCD to prepay district-owed federal debt at a substantial discount. As a result of this allowance, the district pre-paid most of its federal debt in late 1998. Federal debt covering agricultural water was not pre-paid because this debt accrues no interest. The district calculates that this 1998 prepayment resulted in gross savings of $117 million over the coming years, a savings that they calculate is worth $25.5 million to Utah taxpayers today. Federal Government's movement toward a balanced budget resulted in $117 million in savings to Utah taxpayers by 2047  This savings was made possible primarily because of the federal government's movement toward a balanced-budget which would create needed cash. The incentive presented to the district and other entities owing the federal government was extremely favorable reductions in long-term debt for cash upfront. Specifically, the federal government allowed a pre-payment to reduce not only the interest owed but the principle owed as well. For the district, this meant a decrease not only in gross expenses but also in annual expenses. It also has the added benefit of reducing the district's property tax revenue obligated to paying debt. These unobligated tax revenues could now be used in helping to pay for Utah's share of CUPCA project costs. District Has Significant Federal Debt In 1985, the Utah taxpayers voted to approve $508 million in general obligation bonds to repay the costs of the Jordanelle Dam project to the federal government. In 1992, the district's total federal debt was $467 million. In addition to this debt, the passing of CUPCA in 1992 made the district responsible for 35 percent of the costs to finish the project. The total amount the district will owe for its share of CUPCA was estimated by the district to be approximately $221 million. This amount would have increased the district's debt payment by approximately 47 percent and pushed the district over the voter approved debt ceiling. District Needed Funds to Support Future Obligations Given the district's estimate of possible local CUPCA costs, it became clear that the district did not have the property tax revenue to support its CUPCA 6   local cost share obligation and the entire $467 million already owed. The district's first approach to the problem was to ask the Legislature to raise the district's tax rate from .0004 to .0006; however, this was not supported by the Governor or the Legislature. The district was instructed to find another way to fund their portion of CUPCA. A matching of the district's need for long-term financial funding and the federal government's desire for short-term funds appeared to meet both organization's needs. The federal government was committed to balancing the federal budget and wanted cash immediately. The district had short-term funding available but needed a method of reducing long-term revenue needs in one area which would allow the application of revenue in another area. Specifically, by reducing the revenue necessary to pay off currently owed federal debt, the saved revenue could then be used to pay the anticipated future debt created by the local cost share. As a result, debt pre-payment was viewed by both the district and the federal government as a good solution to their respective problems. Because of two previous pre-payments, by 1997 the district owed the federal government $419 million. In 1998, the district pre-paid $128 million to the federal government by issuing general obligation (limited tax) refunding bonds. Because of the incentives offered by the federal government, the M & I debt now owed by the district has fallen to $292 million. The district believes that this reduction in debt will allow them to meet the local cost share of CUPCA without having to raise taxes. While this debt pre-payment was beneficial to local taxpayers, other district actions have not benefitted local taxpayers.  CUPCA Cash Management Is Poor Even though the district has struggled to meet its debt obligation, it has not fully realized the potential earnings of all its assets. In fact, management of some of its cash reserve accounts has been neglected. The principle example of district management neglect is the CUPCA cash reserve account which has lost at least $3.7 million by accepting an unnecessarily low interest rate. Further, with some effort the district could have earned an additional $700,000 by investing in a number of higher yielding investment funds. Of the $3.7 million, $1.3 million is interest lost on local taxpayer money while $2.4 million is interest lost on federal taxpayer money. 7   The CUPCA cash reserve account has lost approximately $3.7 million through unnecessarily low yield investing.  CUPCA cash reserves, which reached $72.2 million in December 1998, have been kept in a checking account receiving far less interest than higher yielding investment options or even the treasury bill rate (i.e., the risk-free rate). The district does have plans for the use of these funds, but that use is not immediate. If the district continues to neglect these funds in 1999, an additional $1.3 million of interest income could be lost. In a positive action, the district moved its CUPCA funds in the second quarter of 1999 from a checking account to a money market account having a rate approaching the treasury bill rate.  CUPCA Cash Reserves Have Grown Construction on CUPCA's projects, including Diamond Fork, SFN, Uintah/Upalco and the Wasatch County Water Efficiency Project (WCWEP), have not followed the originally planned timetable. As a result, the CUPCA fund balance and cash reserves for that balance have grown significantly. A positive fund balance represents a situation in which revenues received have exceeded expenditures made. In other words, a positive fund balance represents a current surplus of funds. Because revenue growth has exceeded expenditure growth, the fund balance has been steadily rising. Most importantly, the majority of this fund balance has been maintained in the form of cash or liquid assets. This growth is shown in Figure I.  Figure I CUPCA Ending Fund Balances and Liquid Assets 1993 to 1998 (Millions) 1993 Fund Balance Liquid Assets $14.5 12.7 1995 $25.3 24.0 1996 $34.2 35.9 1997 $59.1 35.0 1998 $86.1 55.5  1993 represents a calendar year. 1995 through 1998 represent fiscal years. 1994 was a transitional period between the two accounting methods. As a result, 1994 data was not comparable and so are not reported. In 1996, the liquid assets exceeded the fund balance. This excess is because liabilities, one of the three balance sheet categories, are not shown in the above figure. Instead, only the fund balance (i.e., owner's equity) and assets are shown. Since liabilities plus owner's equity equals assets, sometimes assets shown exceed the fund balance (owner's equity).  8   High CUPCA cash balances are attributed to construction delays.  District officials stated that unanticipated delays in SFN, WCWEP, and Uintah/Upalco project construction have caused CUPCA fund balances to grow. CUPCA money was to have been spent as the projects moved along, and it was thought that federal funds would actually lag behind project completion. Obviously, this projected funding need has not been the case. District Believed Money Had to Be Held in a Checking Account  CUPCA contract does not appear to prevent the district from investing in higher yielding accounts.  District management interpreted the federal contract overseeing CUPCA money as requiring that all CUPCA money be held in a checking account. As a result, the district never analyzed its cash management options. However, the CUPCA Cost-Sharing Agreement does not stipulate fund maintenance in a checking account. Further, even if the money had to be maintained in a checking account, the district always had the power, given the size of the fund, to negotiate a higher checking account interest rate. Article VI, paragraph C of the district's CUPCA Cost-Sharing Agreement states:  CUPCA funds must be maintained in a separate interest bearing account in a federally chartered bank for CUPCA activities only Federal and local cost share money must remain in same account Interest earned is divided proportionally (65% to the federal government, 35% to the district) Interest earned on federal funds reduces the total amount the federal government must pay for CUPCA       It appears that the goal of the agreement was to insure that the state-match is accounted for and that the funds be maintained in a separate, secure account; hence, the federally-chartered bank stipulation. We believe that the contract's investing stipulations are straight forward. We are confused, however, with the varying interpretations of its simple language. Particularly the interpretation of ...a separate interest-bearing account in federally-chartered bank... . The federal CUPCA manager has indicated that this language does not mean the money must be held in a checking account. ""Basically, the bottom line for DOI is that all the money be held in one account,"" but the type of account does not matter. The federal CUPCA manager also indicated that the contract does 9   not preclude investing the CUPCA money in higher yield investments although he admits he has never encouraged the district seek higher yields. It was his belief that the additional interest would create an ""accounting nightmare."" More recently the federal CUPCA manager has reversed his position stating that the fund must be in an interest-bearing checking account because the federal interpretation of the contract calls for the ability to write checks from this account. Conversely, the district originally believed the fund had to be invested in a checking account but has now switched the CUPCA account to a limited access money market account. We don't understand why a money market account or any other type of investment fitting within the contract stipulations would be inappropriate. District Has Not Explored Investment Options The district defends its actions by maintaining that the federal government required the funds be held in a checking account. This district belief does not appear to be correct, nor does it appear that the district ever attempted to investigate other investment options. Assets have basically been stored for five years waiting for projects to get underway. During this period, the district took no action to maximize the use of the CUPCA assets held in its trust. The district did not pursue higher interest rates from its own financial institution nor did the district investigate investment options outside its established financial structure. District has not investigated better investment options in the 5 years it has held the high CUPCA balances.  To analyze the possible investment value of the CUPCA assets, we compared the interest earned by the district in its checking account to the interest earning potential of both treasury bills and the State Treasurer's Public Treasurer's Investment Fund (state pool). We selected the state pool as a representative of higher yielding accounts because its performance is representative of investment funds and the pool's information was readily available. We believe that the state pool meets all the criteria set by the DOI. The state pool is available to the district's financial institution, relatively risk-free (actually three basis points higher, on average, than the treasury rate for essentially the same risk), and highly liquid (two day withdrawal time). Further, the district is aware of the state pool and its benefits. The 1989 legislative audit recommended that the district invest in the state pool to receive additional interest earnings. The audit reported that the district could have obtained over $12,000 additional interest in 1987 and nearly $15,000 in 1988 10   by investing excess checking account balances in the state pool rather than leaving the balances in the checking account. As a result, the district now uses the state pool for money not designated for CUPCA. The district's bank has higher yield investment options but was never asked to use them.  The district maintains that the state pool option is impossible for CUPCA money under the federal contract as written. The investment manager for their bank, however, indicated that the district had never approached him for possible options. Further, he recommended the district have the bank invest with the state pool as it has consistently delivered a higher yield than other investment options offered by the district's bank. A representative of the State Treasurer's Office reported that the district could comply with the federal agreement by having its bank establish a trust account for CUPCA monies. A trust account would honor federal contract requirements that CUPCA funds remain in a federally chartered bank. The district's bank would then write an agreement with the State Treasurer's Office to invest CUPCA money in the state pool. The trust account would function similarly to the district's current checking account except that the funds would generate higher interest.  The district did not use its large CUPCA account balance to negotiate a higher interest rate with the bank.  Even if CUPCA money had to be maintained in a checking account, as the district believed, the district could still have obtained a higher interest rate. The CUPCA account has always been a very large account and, as such, carried a great deal of negotiating power regarding interest rates received and bank service fees charged. A representative of the district's bank confirmed that no attempt to negotiate for a higher interest rate had been made by the district. This lack of negotiation meant that this multi-million dollar account was allowed to receive an interest rate of 3 percent which is 2 percentage points less than a $20,000 checking account can receive (A $20,000 high yield checking account qualifies for an interest rate equal to the 30 day T-Bill rate). In addition, we found no evidence that the district shopped among banks for competitive interest rates. Significant Interest Earnings Have Been Lost  The district's $72.2 million account received a lower interest rate than a $20,000 account.  The district has held the CUPCA cash reserves in a checking account since 1993. Between October 1993 and December 1998, this checking account paid interest between two and three percent, earning the CUPCA funds a total of $5 million in interest. These rates are approximately 2 percentage points below the risk-free rate, yet the risk represented by these checking account rates is the same. By not achieving the treasury bill rate, $3.7 million in interest 11   was lost. Sixty-five percent of this CUPCA money is federal money while 35 percent is local taxpayer money. As a result, $2.4 million is federal interest lost while $1.3 million is state interest lost. During this same time period, higher yielding investment funds were generally 3 basis points above the risk free rate for approximately the same risk. If the district had required its bank to invest the CUPCA cash in such a fund, $9.4 million in interest would have been earned. By not investing CUPCA cash in such a fund, $4.4 million in interest was lost. Again, sixty-five percent of this CUPCA money is federal money while 35 percent is local taxpayer money. Thus, the federal taxpayers lost $2.9 million in interest while the local taxpayers lost $1.5 million. The increasing balance held in CUPCA's checking account means that more interest income is lost each year. In its checking account, the CUPCA cash balance would earn approximately $2.1 million for 1999. In a higher yielding investment account, the CUPCA cash could earn $3.6 million-- yielding the taxpayers an additional $1.5 million for the year. Neither the district nor the DOI was aware of the amount of interest being lost by holding CUPCA funds in a low interest yield checking account. When we presented our analysis of the interest lost, officials from both the district and DOI expressed surprise. In fact, the federal CUPCA manager, who had been previously lukewarm to investment possibilities, appeared convinced by the interest lost that a cash management change should be investigated.  Investment in a higher yielding account would have nearly doubled fund earnings.  District Tax Rate Not Based on Need District records indicate they have collected at least $7.2 million more in property taxes and water sales than necessary. If this trend continues, the district will have unnecessarily collected $81 million by the year 2011.  District revenues have been far greater than district expenditures which has resulted in high district fund balances and indicate that the district has, since 1995, collected at least $7.2 million more in property taxes and water sales than necessary. As of May 1999, the district's plans were to continue taxing at the highest possible rate. At that rate, the district would have unnecessarily collected $81 million by the year 2011. At a discount rate of 5 percent, this gross amount has a present value of $65 million. District staff now agrees that lower taxes are possible given new information added to their planning documents. Excessive tax collections can be eliminated by tighter financial control of district fund balances and an improved planning process. The new district tax reduction plan agrees with our calculations. The 12   resulting gross savings of the two plans are roughly equivalent. However, the district plan maintains higher tax rates in earlier years, which benefit the district. We believe tax rates in earlier years can be lower which benefit the taxpayer. The district's revenue contribution from its high tax rate is best exemplified by the district's increasing fund balances. Annual ending fund balance increases demonstrate greater revenue than expenses. The district's general fund, which is intended to account for the district's daily operating expenses, has an ending balance that increased 30 percent ($3.4 million) between 1995 and 1998 even though district financial statements showed there was no need for the additional funds. A reduction of this fund balance to a more prudent amount would have resulted in a lower tax rate and would not have jeopardized any district planning. District leadership justifies its tax rate and the resulting projected fund balance by stating that its position is allowable by statute. Unnecessary fund growth was noted in 1989.  The growth of district fund balances is not a new concern. Our 1989 audit report noted concerns with the district's fund balances. Specifically, concern was expressed over the fact that total fund balances had grown from $9.1 million in 1980 to $22.7 million in 1988. In addition, the audit noted that these large fund balances had been accumulated without the board clearly establishing a need for the funds. Finally, the audit raised the possibility that the district's fund balances may be too large and that the district's tax rate could be reduced. In our opinion, these concerns still exist and are even stronger today. District fund balances, expected expenditures, and expected tax and water sale revenues do not appear to have received priority treatment by the district's general manager or board. District financial planning and forecasting have been left to the district's controller and CUPCA program manager who are already charged with considerable duties. Much of the district's current thinking is derived from the 1993 Governor's Task Force conclusion that more funding may be needed in the future. The findings of that group became obsolete in 1997 due to the district's debt prepayment. In our opinion, specific financial expertise at the district is lacking. We believe, given the volume and nature of the district's finances, that in-house financial expertise should be sought. District finances should be thoroughly examined by the district's board as a prelude to establishing property tax rates. Further, we believe the Legislature should reconsider the current statute regarding special district fund balances to encourage efficient stewardship of property taxes. Statutory adjustments can be made to increase control of general fund and capital projects fund balances. 13   General Fund Balances Lack Purpose and Appear Excessive A positive fund balance represents reserve money which accumulates when revenues exceed expenditures.  By state standards, the district's general fund ending balance was high, and has increased by 30 percent since fiscal year 1995 for no specific purpose. A positive balance represents reserve money which accumulates when revenues exceed expenditures. Approximately 70 percent of the district's general fund revenues are derived from property tax collections and, as such, we believe it is unacceptable for the district to maintain unnecessarily high reserves in its fund balances. If more prudent fund balance criteria were followed, the general fund's fund balance could be significantly reduced, saving district taxpayers approximately $7.2 million in taxes. Increasing Fund Balance Lacks Purpose. The general fund's ending balance has increased by $3.4 million since 1995. According to the district's accountant, this increase is not based on any need. Rather, he states that the general fund was simply underspent. The district's accountant pointed out that the level of the general fund balance is allowed by state statute and, therefore, the district did not feel a need to further justify the rising balance. Figure II shows the fund balance increases since fiscal year 1995.  Figure II General Fund's Fund Balance Over Time (Millions) FY 95 Ending Balance $ 8.2 FY 96 $ 9.9 FY 97 $11.3 FY 98 $11.6  Since the district's general fund balance is allowed by statute, the district does not feel a need to justify the rising balance.  Currently, Utah Code 17A-1-415(2) allows the general fund's ending balance to be as great as 100 percent of the current year's property taxes ($22.9 million in 1998) but does not call for justification based on need or purpose. The fact that a fund balance is allowed under statute is inadequate justification for setting high reserve levels. These reserves, stated as fund balances, are in effect taxpayer and service user funds; the greatest contribution coming from property tax payers via property tax rates set by the district at the maximum rate allowed by statute.  14   The district's capital projects fund balance has grown 81 percent since 1995.  A review of the district's general fund alone is, however, insufficient. General funds and their balances are closely tied to capital project funds through statute. Capital projects fund revenue comes from the general fund and is allowed by Utah Code 17A-1-415 to be a sweep account for the general fund, meaning that excess revenue accumulated in the general fund can be moved and stored in the capital projects fund. Unlike the general fund, the capital projects fund has no monetary limit on its balance. Rather, its balance is not to exceed the total projected cost of approved capital projects. Figure III shows the increase in the capital projects fund balance. In reporting this balance, we also included the capital projects contingency fund which is an unreserved fund.  Figure III Capital Projects Fund Balance Over Time (Millions) FY 95 Balance $10.3 FY 96 $14.9 FY 97 $18.0 FY 98 $18.6  As can be seen, the capital projects fund has grown 81 percent since 1995. This 1998 amount is statutorily allowed because the value of the board approved project (expansion of the Utah Valley Water Treatment Plant) has an estimated completion cost of $19.2 million. Because of this relationship between the general fund and the capital projects fund, it is possible the district is not particularly motivated to lower their tax rate. In fact, the district's accountant indicated that every year during the budgetary process, he determines how much excess tax revenue is going to be received and then budgets to move those funds into the capital projects fund. He told us that the fact that the balance in the general fund is increasing tells him he has not done a through job of sweeping money into the capital projects account. Certainly the district must be able to save for construction of capital projects. However, there must be a balance between an appropriate saving rate for capital projects and a reasonable tax-rate which does not produce large amounts of excess tax revenue. Even the district's own review of bond 15   obligation identifies that the district will have excess funds in both the general fund and the capital projects fund. District only needs $4.4 million of its $11.2 million general fund balance.  District's General Fund Balance Appears Excessive. The current general fund balance of $11.2 million appears unnecessarily large. If the general fund balance had been dropped to $4.4 million, the district could have taxed at a lower rate and saved the taxpayers $7.2 million. How- ever, the district has done no analysis as to a prudent fund balance to maintain in the general fund. Instead, the general fund balance is acceptable to the district as long as it falls within statutory limits. Utah Code 17A-1-415(1) statutorily defines two primary reasons for general funds:   To save for future asset purchases To provide coverage for unexpected expenditures  In addition, a general fund balance can also be used to cover emergencies. This need does not appear necessary for the district, however, because it maintains a separate emergency reserve account. District personnel and planning documents indicate that the district's rising general fund balance is not the result of saving for future asset purchases or for unexpected emergencies. Thus, the district's general fund balance functions to cover unexpected expenditures. Finance says district could mirror state rainy day fund balance percentage  The State of Utah, nationally recognized as a financially well managed state, maintains a rainy day fund in the general fund which is for the same purposes as allowed general fund balances in special service districts. By statute, the state's rainy day fund balance is allowed to be a maximum of 8 percent of the total general fund appropriations. State Division of Finance personnel believe that a ratio of the district's general fund balance to district expenditures should mirror the state's requirement and would be an appropriate comparison ratio. However, since the district does not have the financial resources of the state, we doubled the state's criteria to 16 percent of total general fund expenditures. Figure IV shows the district's historical ending fund balance to annual expenditure ratios.  16   Figure IV Ratio of All District Expenses to General Fund Balance (Millions) 1995 General Fund Balance Expenditures Ratio $ 8.2 26.0 32% 1996 $ 9.9 19.4 51% 1997 $11.3 24.8 46% 1998 $11.6 27.3 43%  As can be seen, the ratio of general fund balances to district expenditures far exceeds the 16 percent figure which is twice what is deemed adequate by the state. Our review of the district's historic expenses shows that there should not be any unexpected expenditures that exceed 16 percent and unexpected costs should never be 30 to 50 percent of the district's normal annual expenditures. Figure V shows the ending fund balance allowed by maintaining 16 percent of the district's expenditures and the ending fund balance actually held by the district.  Figure V Comparison of Actual Fund Balance to 16 Percent Fund Balance (Millions) 1995 Expenditures 16% Balance Actual Balance Difference $26.0 4.2 8.2 $ 4.0 1996 $19.4 3.1 9.9 $ 6.8 1997 $24.8 4.0 11.3 $ 7.3 1998 $27.3 4.4 11.6 $ 7.2  In essence, the district has taxed district taxpayers an additional $7.2 million to support fund balance growth that has no apparent purpose and is unnecessarily large to cover unanticipated expenditures. While the district wants to hold 17   enough of a fund balance to protect itself from provide itself with a source of working capital, the taxpayers are taxed without cause. District a fund balance percentage equal to 25 percent  unexpected expenditures and it should not hold so much that management now believes that of revenues is adequate.  The following tax rates shown in Figure VI could have met the district's actual expenditures while saving the taxpayers $7.2 million in excess revenue collection. In performing this analysis, we calculated the target fund balance (16 percent of district expenditures) and gradually reduced the actual fund balance to the 1998 target balance of $4.4 million.  Figure VI Potential District Tax Rates and Savings 1995 - 1998 Fiscal Year 1995 1996 1997 1998 Total Potential Savings CUWCD Tax Rate .000396 .000349 .000323 .000400 Revised Tax Rate .000319 .000300 .000284 .000391 Yearly Tax Savings $2,796,555 2,194,008 1,929,379 322,564 $7,242,506  The data in Figure VI is based on the district's actual expenditures. However, it is important to note that many of the expenditures identified in the general fund are actually transfers to other district accounts. Some of these transfer amounts are mandatory (i.e., the transfer of the local cost share into the CUPCA account). However, some of these transfer amounts are more flexible (i.e., the transfer amount into the capital projects account). An expenditure analysis might have provided more room for a decrease in tax rates.  18   District Expenditures Don't Justify Future Tax Rate The excess funding between 1995 and 1998 is a trend the district had planned to continue according to district records. In May 1999, the district's financial plans had not incorporated the then instituted debt pre-payment previously discussed. As a result, district financial forecasts under-estimated revenues and over-stated expenses. The net result of these errors convinced the district that taxing at the maximum rate was justified. This despite the fact that the district's bond obligation report identified that the district's general fund would exceed the maximum allowable ending year balance by the year 2004. The bond report estimated the general fund balance would be approximately $45 million and further projected fund growth to be $6 million per year. This general fund balance growth was due to the lower expenses allowed by the debt prepayment plan. Documents indicate the district planned to tax at the maximum allowable rate of .0004 between 2002 and 2012 even though that funding level is unnecessary.  The district's projections, without the benefit of the debt pre-payment identified in the bond report, show that the district intended to maintain its high tax rates to the year 2012. This projection identified that the district planned to tax at the .0004 percent rate for the years 2002 through 2011, even though the level of funding attained will not be necessary. If the district taxed at the .0004 rate, the district would have a general fund balance of $55 million and a capital projects fund balance of $30 million for a total balance of $85 million. Current district projections estimate a necessary fund balance total of only $15.4 million. With lower fund balance requirements, we estimate that only $13 million would be needed. Using the district's anticipated revenues and expenditures, the district now has preliminary plans to gradually reduce its tax rate from .00039 to as low as .0002 by 2011. This change would reduce annual taxes up to 50 percent and would, for example, on a $200,000 home save $40 per year by 2011. We believe that advancing the tax rate reductions is possible. In fact, given the district's current balances, taxes can immediately be reduced to .00033 (a 17.5 % reduction). Tax rate reductions could continue as low as .00017, which would be an operational maintenance level.  Prior district taxing plans would collect $81 million more than necessary by 2011 and $170 million more than necessary by 2015.  Both scenarios reduce gross taxes between 1999 and 2011 (the year most major building expenses end) by $81 million. They differ in when savings would be realized by the taxpayer and the level of funding maintained in reserve balances. The greater savings to the taxpayer is realized when tax reductions are made sooner. As a result, our plan has a present value of $65 million and the district's plan has a present value of $61 million. Savings for both projection plans are more dramatic for the years 2012 through 2015 where 19   taxes are reduced by $22 million per year. The total gross tax savings to 2015 is projected to be $170 million which has a present value of $120 million. For greater detail please see Appendix B.  Statute Governing Fund Balances Needs Review District can reduce its tax rate 17.5 percent to .00033 and still meet its obligations, resulting in a gross tax savings of $81 million by 2011.  Since the district's fund balance is in effect tax-based, there should be logic and prudence justifying the rate to both the Legislature and the taxpayer. The district's board of directors should have an analysis performed to determine an appropriate and justifiable general fund balance level. From that fund balance level, the board should establish a tax rate which is sufficient for the district's anticipated budgeted expenditures and maintains a sufficient, but reasonable, reserve for unanticipated expenditures. A review by the Legislature may also be called for to possibly modify statutes governing special districts' fund balances. As the statute is currently written, it appears that little control over the district's expenditures and taxing policies exists. According to Utah Code 17A-1-415(2), the accumulation of a fund balance in the general fund may not exceed the greater of:   100 percent of the current year's property taxes, or 25 percent of the total general fund revenues for districts with annual general fund budgets greater than $100,000.  Lack of fund balance control suggests the Legislature should re-examine Utah Code 17A-1-415 and determine if statute changes are appropriate.  While these requirements set the dollar limit that can be maintained in the general fund ending balance, they do not limit the funding available to the district. Statute also allows excess general fund balances to be shifted to the capital projects fund. The capital projects fund has no specific monetary limitation. Rather, it is limited by a formal long-range capital plan adopted by the governing body. As a result of this code language, the district could in 1998 technically maintain $22.9 million in its general fund balance and an amount within its capital projects fund limited only by the monetary scope of the capital projects plan. Because of this fund interrelationship, we believe there is little actual control over fund balances within the district. Given code descriptions of the intent of general fund accounts, it does not seem that the Legislature's intent was to allow large, unchecked general fund balances. As a result, we believe the  20   Legislature should re-examine Utah Code 17A-1-415 and determine if changes to this statute are appropriate. While the majority of our work focused on cash management and tax issues, we also reviewed implementation of the 1989 budget recommendations.  Many Budget Recommendations From 1989 Audit Implemented Most of the budget recommendations made in the 1989 audit, not already discussed in the body of this chapter, have been implemented by the district. The recommendations made in the 1989 audit centered around two basic issues: (1) improving board oversight of the budgetary process; and, (2) providing more information for the budget and financial processes. In 1993, our office conducted an in-depth follow-up of the recommendations made in 1989 and found most of them had been implemented. The follow-up in this audit concurs with most of the findings in the 1993 follow-up audit. Improving Board Oversight of Budget Process The 1989 audit recommended that the board spend as much time as needed to verify the appropriateness of management requests. That audit also recommended that district staff provide the board with any information requested by them. The 1993 follow-up audit indicated that both these recommendations had been implemented. The board members interviewed in 1993 felt that they were given enough time to review the budget and question staff about any additional information they felt was lacking. Further, they believed they had no difficulty in obtaining information from staff. The board members interviewed in this follow-up voiced similar feelings. Providing More Information for Budgetary and Financial Processes Board members reported they have enough time to adequately review the district's budget.  The 1989 audit recommended improvements to the budgetary and financial processes. The staff was asked to prepare additional budget line items and to provide more supporting information to explain requested expenditures. The board was asked to establish the purpose and dollar limits for the various funds 21   held by the district. Also, the audit recommended that the board improve its capital planning and establish a separate capital projects fund. The 1993 audit found that all recommendations related to this area were implemented. This current follow-up found that all but one of these recommendations were implemented. Prepare a Single Budget Line Item for Lobbying Expenses with Detailed Amounts. The 1993 follow-up found this recommendation was implemented because an account entitled ""Consultants-Federal"" was used for federal lobbying and an account called ""Consultants-State/Local"" was used for lobbying on the state level. While these accounts are still in the budget, in this current audit we do not believe the recommendation is still implemented. CUPCA lobbying expenses, averaging $7330 per month, are still not itemized in the district's annual budget.  Specifically, the district's CUPCA lobbying expenses are not itemized in the district's annual budget. Over the past three years, the district has paid over $270,000 for Washington, D.C., lobbying efforts or $7,330 per month. However, this amount is contained in the CUPCA budget under the CUWCD Direct Expense category. The total budgeted funds in this category were $1,072,900 for fiscal year 1999, which the lobbying expense is a part. As a result, we believe the district is not fully complying with this recommendation for a single budget line item identifying lobbying expenses. District Prepare Additional Budget Line Items for Travel and Any Other Areas of Concern. The original audit discovered that there were no line items for travel, but the expenses were dispersed throughout the budget. The 1993 follow-up found that this recommendation had been implemented. The district had created three accounts to which travel expenses are posted: Director Expense, which covers travel for the board; Staff Expense; and, Staff Training, which covers travel for staff. This audit noted the use of two expense accounts to cover the same areas: Director Expense and Staff Expense/Training. Our only concern is the fact that the total cost of trips and training events are not readily available. Many records must be reviewed to discover the total cost of a board training or other staff event.  Board members believe budget requests are accompanied by enough information for the district's board to make informed decisions.  Budget Requests Be Accompanied by Enough Supporting Information to Explain Expenditures and How They Arrived at the Budget Amount. The 1993 follow-up found this recommendation was implemented. Board members that were talked to indicated that the budget has enough information to justify expenditures and to help the board understand how staff prepared the budget requests. In this follow-up, we found descriptions explaining why each budget area is needed and how the funds are to be used. The board members  22   also indicated that they have adequate information available to justify expenditures. Staff Prepare Specific Descriptions for Each Budget Category . The 1993 follow-up indicated this recommendation had been implemented. It was noted that the board is presented with a summary of all accounts and the total amount in each one. As supporting information, the accounts are broken down into specific activities and each one has a quantity, unit cost, and total cost which gives the board a good idea of the type and amount of work being done. The current follow-up found similar information being presented to the board. Further, the board felt that adequate information was presented in the budget. Budget Proposal Should Compare New Budget Requests to the Original Budgeted Amount for the Prior Year. The 1993 follow-up reported this recommendation as implemented. The budget is prepared to give the board a historical view of each budget item. Our follow-up found this practice is still followed. Board Designate Purpose of Debt Service Sinking Fund, Future Construction Reserve Fund, Continency Reserve Fund, and Any Others Where Needed. The 1993 follow-up audit reported this recommendation was implemented. At the time of the 1989 audit, few of the funds had sufficient explanation as to their purpose or how the money was to be spent. The 1993 follow-up found most of the funds now have a written policy. Further, the Debt Service Sinking Fund no longer existed. In addition, the Future Reserve Construction Reserve Fund has been incorporated into the Capital Projects Fund. This current follow-up found the existing reserve funds to have a defined purpose. Board Establish a Maximum Amount for Each Fund. The 1993 follow-up found this recommendation implemented. When the 1989 audit was conducted there was concern that the asset funds held by the district could possibly have unlimited fund balances with no restrictions. The 1993 follow-up found that all reserve funds had maximum dollar limits placed upon them. This current follow-up also found reserve accounts having maximum dollar limits with the exception of the Facility Reserve fund.  23   In our opinion, the district could improve financial management. The district could revamp CUPCA cash management. In addition, we see no justification for the rising general fund balance. The rising fund balance opens the possibility that the district might be able to lower its tax rate with better planning. We did see, however, that the district has implemented all but one of the financial recommendations from the prior audit.  24   Recommendations: 1. We recommend the district invest, through its financial institution, unspent CUPCA monies in a manner whereby interest earnings are maximized at an acceptable risk level. The state pool may be a good candidate. 2. We recommend the district and its board of directors decide on an appropriate general fund balance level and establish a tax rate which will allow the district to meet expenditures while avoiding unnecessary increases in the general fund balance. 3. We recommend the district consider adding a position in-house which incorporates specific financial management skills. 4. We recommend the Legislature review Utah Code 17A-1-415 to determine if changes are necessary to eliminate excessive fund balances. 5. We recommend the district itemize its Washington, D.C. lobbyist expenses in its annual budget.  25   Chapter III District Policies and Procedures Lack Sufficiency and Enforcement Central Utah Water Conservancy District (district) management has allowed lapses in administrative controls that have resulted in questionable administrative practices. Disregard for policies and procedures, liberal interpretation of expense policies, and general manager approved violations of policies have resulted in approximately $90,000 of questionable expenses and $185,000 of expenses that violate accepted business practices. Examples of questionable district administrative controls demonstrative of either violated policies or poor controls include:  District board members indirectly benefitting from district contracts although specifically prohibited by state statute and district policy. District management benefits including a $75,000 contracted bonus agreement for future work; a $37,000 car for the general manager; and, inappropriately reported car allowances for another senior manager. Travel expenses at least $35,000 in excess of necessary travel costs because the district failed to use the lowest available rates or follow its own lodging policy. Vehicle fleet utilization that does not appear adequate to support the number of fleet vehicles. Further, use of district vehicles for commuting purposes is not controlled well. District procurement practices resulting in retention of many services without using a competitive bid process.          District leadership has revised the district's policies and procedures to address past audit criticisms. Human resource and procurement policies have been strengthened. We are, however, concerned that although policies have been reviewed and apparently strengthened, problems seem to persist. Often these revised policies and procedures appear to be overridden by the district's management with the knowledge of some or all of the district's board.  26   District Financial Participation with Board Members Should Be Avoided Two district board members have received at least $110,000 in benefits from district contracts with closely related organizations even though district management is aware that such financial relationships are not allowed. The board chairman has received $89,295 in consulting fees, and a second board member has received $19,300 for management work. We have similar concerns with a district supported contract with its' vice-chairman's company, where that company was awarded a $500,000 contract to do construction work for a district-funded project. Certainly some district board members have indirect relationships with the district which are potential sources for conflict of interest. For example, two board members are employees of water conservancy districts while three are associated with local irrigation companies. It is possible that these indirect relationships are inherent in a board which seeks individuals knowledgeable about water. However, we are concerned with the three board members discussed in this chapter because they received indirect payments from the district. Two board members inappropriately received $110,000 from district contracts.  Financial dealings with board members beyond payments for actual board duties appear to be conflicts of interest and quid pro quo agreements that imply favoritism and are difficult to overcome in the most innocent of cases. For this reason, the Utah Legislature specifically prohibits financial dealings with board members. Utah Code 17A-2-1410(1) states: Each director... shall take and subscribe to an oath...that he...will not be interested directly or indirectly in any contract entered into by the district. The district has also recognized the problem with the appearance of board member conflicts of interest and also prohibits either direct or indirect relationships. District policy, updated in 1996, mirrors the state statute: Directors shall not...(f) receive or agree to receive compensation for assisting any person or business entity in any transaction involving the district; (g) participate in their official capacity or receive compensation in respect to any transaction between the 27   District and any business entity in which the director is also an officer, director, or employee or owns a substantial interest... In spite of recognizing the problem with the appearance of conflicts of interest, the district has allowed and continues to allow indirect payments to board members. The district's legal counsel maintains the district does not directly pay board members for the services they provide to other special districts and that such work performed by district board members is out of district control. District Payments to the Board Chairman May Violate State Statute Board chairman received $89,295 from a questionable district contract.  The district's board chairman has received $89,295 from a district contract with Wasatch County. The contract's performance requirements pertain directly to work done by the district board chairman, intended to advance district projects. The work, which certainly contradicts the spirit of conflict of interest language, appears to contradict state statute as well as the district's own policy. In addition to appearing at odds with the Utah Code 17A-2-1410(1) and district policy, these indirect payments also appear to violate the contractual agreement between the district and Wasatch County which states: No member of Congress, Departmental employee, or District Board member or employee shall be admitted to any share or part of this agreement, or to any benefit that may arise therefrom. As background, the district has contracted with either Wasatch County Special Service Area (WCSSA) or Wasatch County for WCSSA service. WCSSA was created in 1992, with district staff assistance, to coordinate and manage water-related issues in Wasatch County. The primary duty of the WCSSA is to provide assistance to the district with the Wasatch County Water Efficiency Project (WCWEP). The district's board chairman has served as chairman of the WCSSA oversight board, as a consultant for WCSSA, and as general manager of WCSSA. The chairman's work with the WCSSA is contractual through his firm, Royal Solutions. As such, he views himself as a consultant, not as an employee of WCSSA. Funding for this project flows from the district to either the WCSSA or Wasatch County and then in turn to Royal Solutions for its managerial consulting services.  28   The district has had knowledge of this arrangement since its inception and has attempted to clarify and validate the arrangement within the contract. In 1996, the contract was modified to demonstrate a separation between the district and its board member working with Wasatch County and WCSSA. The agreement states: ...Wasatch County's representative will contract directly with the WCSSA and is not considered to be an employee of the district for any purpose. Board chairman has reported some situations as both WCSSA and district business.  We believe that the connection between the district and its board chairman's work for WCSSA is clear and gives an inappropriate appearance, in spite of the above contract wording. We also believe that further questions of possible conflicts of interest are raised by the district's failure to enforce requirements within the contract. The contracts with Wasatch County are specific in calling for:  A clear separation of district board members and any possible conflict of interest. Matching of district and county funds with district participation being limited to 50 percent for contracts dated through January 1997.    Chairman's Dual Roles Are Confusing . It is difficult to determine if the chairman's activities are performed as a representative of the WCSSA or as a representative of the district board. A distinction is important since the WCSSA work is compensated on an hourly basis whereas board work is compensated by a flat monthly payment. In an effort to further review the board chairman's work arrangement, we compared reported WCSSA work hours with district expense reimbursement forms. The comparison found the board chairman reported some situations as both WCSSA and district business. Some examples, indicating the difficulty in separating the work, include:  Hours billed to the WCSSA for a presentation at a water conference in St. George while the district paid for mileage, lodging, meals, and registration Hours billed to the WCSSA to deliver a memorandum of understanding to the district while the district was billed for mileage from Heber City to Orem 29       Hours billed to the WCSSA for telephone discussions on unknown subjects with district staff Hours billed to the WCSSA for interviews with local media regarding the WCWEP project; the WCWEP project is a district project which the WCSSA is facilitating.    Royal Solution's invoices document only a portion of the board chairman's billed hours.  One of the reasons that the chairman's roles are confusing is that the chairman has done an inadequate job of documenting his time. In fact, Royal Solution's invoices document only a portion of the board chairman's billable hours. Specifically, none of Royal Solution's payments from the WCSSA checking account (where district money was deposited) included information identifying and supporting the billed amount. Further, no information was sent to the district documenting how the money was spent. On the other hand, Royal Solution's four bills presented to the county for payment in 1997 were minimally documented. In 1998, only one of Royal Solution's monthly invoices included any information identifying and supporting the billed amount. The district contracts with WCSSA have varied in their requirements for expense documentation. However, according to the CUPCA program manager, the 1998 contract is a cost reimbursement contract. Thus, in order to receive payment from the district, expense documentation will be necessary. A Wasatch County official stated they have asked, to no avail, that documentation of hours be sent with invoices. In our opinion, expenses should be throughly documented when the expense is submitted for payment.  District unnecessarily paid $10,000 because contract was not enforced.  District Did Not Enforce Contract Requirements for a 50 Percent Cost Share Between the District and Wasatch County. As a result, the district paid approximately $10,000 more than necessary in fiscal year 1997. Billing invoices from the WCSSA to the district in 1994 and 1995 show a 50 percent reimbursement requirement stipulated in the contract was followed. However, the district did not enforce the requirement in fiscal year 1997, apparently due to a request by Wasatch County. Wasatch County's request, signed by a county commissioner and the district's board chairman (in his role as Wasatch Water Board Chairman), asked the district to submit monthly payments of $6,250 in lieu of matching county funds. The district accepted the request and paid more in fiscal year 1997 than was contractually required. The request did not mention any repayment from Wasatch County. 30   Not enforcing the contract requirements may be indicative of incapacitated enforcement by the district. The ultimate recipient of the contract's monetary benefits is the district's chairman of the board. It seems reasonable to assume that the district would be reluctant to take action which may unnecessarily antagonize the board chairman. Thus, possible reluctance to antagonize may have led the district to inadequate contractual enforcement. Given WCSSA's limited internal controls, we believe district contract monitoring is particularly important. WCCSA's internal auditors have noted internal control weaknesses including related party transactions and poor segregation of duties  WCSSA's Own Financial Auditors Have Noted Potential Control Issues Within WCSSA. First, WCSSA's external financial auditors have stated concerns with related party transactions. Current and past WCSSA general managers have also been directly involved with other water districts and water user organizations. Second, the WCSSA's internal controls are lacking and do not include proper segregation of duties. WCSSA's own auditors have stated that financial decisions at the WCSSA are dominated by a single person (i.e., the WCSSA manager) having control of both receipt and disbursement of cash. In addition, a review of checks written by the WCSSA in 1997 and 1998 showed $30,346 of IRS-unreported income was paid to Royal Solutions. In essence, the district's board chairman received WCSSA payments without that income reported on Form 1099-MISC for Internal Revenue Service use. The previous manager also received WCSSA payments without reporting the income on Form 1099-MISC for Internal Revenue Service use. A District Contract with Juab County Pays Board Member for Work Related to the District In a situation similar to Wasatch County, a district board member from Juab County has questionably received $19,300, in wages and expenses from a district contract with the East Juab Water Conservancy District. Again, we believe that such payments are contrary to Utah Code 17A-2-1410(1). In addition, the district has exercised insufficient control over the contract by not enforcing the contractual requirement for expense documentation, including hours worked. The East Juab Water Conservancy District (EJWCD) was created to act as an arm of the district; to assist with the East Juab Water Efficiency Project. Prior to 1998, EJWCD received all of its funding from the district. The EJWCD currently has one board member, a part-time general manager, and a part-time secretary. A district board member works part-time as the general manager of 31  $30,346 of board chairman's income was not reported to the IRS by WCSSA.   A second district board member inappropriately received $19,300 in wages from a district contract.  the EJWCD and is paid a monthly salary of $1,000. The district board member provided free management services for EJWCD for six months before receiving a salary. The district and EJWCD have a cost reimbursable agreement in which all expenses including salaries, furniture, supplies, mileage, copying, and phone expenses are submitted to and paid for by the district. The contract between the district and Juab County, although for similar intent, is not the same contract used for Wasatch County. The most interesting difference is the lack of any language declaring that district board members may not benefit from this contract. Work Performed by a Board Member's Company Creates a Questionable Appearance As an example of questionable appearances, we identified one case where a county indirectly contracted with a board member's company for construction services. The district provided funding for the project, creating the net result of paying $500,000 to a firm owned by one of its board members. In the above case, the district provided funds to the Sanpete County Water Conservancy District (SCWCD) for a canal rehabilitation project. The SCWCD hired an engineering firm for project planning which, in turn, requested bids from construction companies for design and construction services. The engineering firm is also widely used by the district. The bids contained both a subjective and objective component with the $500,000 bid award going to the board member's company. Of this amount, $380,000 was paid to the construction firm directly from the district. The remaining amount came through the engineering firm.  Contract award to a board member raises questions.  In this kind of circumstance, the appearance of an improper quid pro quo contract award exists. A quid pro quo arrangement is one in which favorable consideration is given by one entity in exchange for favorable consideration by the other entity. District board members are involved in selecting engineering firms and assigning funding for district projects. If board member-owned companies are sub-contracting for portions of projects, pressure is placed on either the contracted county or the general contractor to deal with the possible conflict of interest. There is a possibility that subjective assessments can be swayed in favor of the board member anticipating favorable consideration by a board member for future work.  32   In conducting our analysis of possible conflicts of interest, we also noted that the CUPCA manager has a tie to an engineering firm which is often used by the district. Specifically, his father-in-law owns the engineering firm, and the CUPCA manager was formerly employed there. We reviewed some of the bids involving this engineering firm and found no evidence that the CUPCA manager exerted improper influence. As a result, we did not pursue the issue further.  General Manager Contracted Bonus Agreement Appears Inappropriate General manager's $75,000 bonus agreement deviates from policies.  The district's general manager, who receives a $96,000 annual salary, will also receive $75,000, over a five year period, as a result of a contract between him and selected members of the district's board. The contract is written to signify the payment is a bonus for work not yet performed or evaluated. We are concerned with the contract because it violates the district's own internal bonus policy and deviates dramatically from state policies. Further concerns arise when some board members note that the contract was created not as a bonus, as stated in the contract, but as salary and retirement benefit and that the contract was never presented to the entire board. Only one board member, besides the chairman and vice chairman, stated he had seen the actual agreement and that board member requested the agreement from legal counsel. The agreement was signed April 1, 1998, by the general manager, the board chairman, and the board vice-chairman and contains the following provisions:  A monthly bonus of $1,250 ($15,000 annually) starting April 15, 1998 and ending December 31, 2001 for a total of $75,000. A death or health-related termination clause that allows for continuation of bonus payments to the general manager's wife if the general manager's termination of employment is due to health problems or death.    Average performance by the general manager is sufficient for bonus receipt.  Bonus Agreement Is Not Linked to Performance Reviews. As a result, the agreement acts as a base salary increase not a bonus. Bonuses, by definition, should be justified by meritorious performance. The agreement 33   contracts for future bonus payments. The bonus may be terminated for a negative performance review; however, average performance is sufficient for the bonus. We were unable to find any recorded performance appraisal of the general manager in the last three years. District policy, however, states that an annual performance review must be conducted on the general manager and that the district will use written performance appraisals to determine employee merit and bonus payments. Agreement Is Outside the District's Own Personnel System. The board requires the district's human resource manager to conduct annual salary surveys and to present a human resource budget inclusive of merit adjustments. The board meets to accept the human resource budget and, in so doing, sets the level of allowable merit increases for the year. The human resource manager was unaware of the general manager's bonus agreement. He feels the general manager's base salary, without the bonus, is appropriate and competitive with comparable positions. General manager's bonus is four times greater than the board approved merit increase and far exceeds the state's bonus limit.  District policy states that the chairman and vice-chairman will annually review the performance of the manager and make recommendations for salary and benefits package adjustments to the board. A majority of board members remember discussing a salary adjustment for the general manager in 1998, but they were not aware of specific bonus amounts or provisions in the agreement. No indications in board meeting minutes or from board members show that the provisions of the agreement were voted on by the entire board. The agreement sets the general manager's earnings at a higher level than validated by the human resource salary study and gives him an annual merit increase (performance bonus) four times greater than that approved by the board. The general manager's bonus is also well outside state policies and procedures concerning bonuses. We use state policies as a reference because many of the district's policies are based on those of the state system. The Utah Department of Human Resource Management rules limit bonuses to $4,000 per year and declare that executive directors cannot receive a bonus that will bring the total salary over their market salary range maximum. The district's general manager bonus grants $15,000 annually without any true performance appraisal and sets his salary far above that of other in-state water district managers' salaries.  34   District Control of Expenditures Needs Tightening Internal control weaknesses have resulted in $40,000 of unnecessary expenses.  Our 1989 audit found that the district did not have sufficient internal controls over travel expenses and thus allowed a number of expenditures to exceed expected limits. Our current audit found that a number of internal control policies have been added or changed to address earlier problems, but they are either not followed or are so liberal as to not be effective. We found internal control lapses still exist and have identified nearly $40,000 of unnecessary expenditures. These excess expenses occurred as a result of:     The district failing to obtain the best transportation rates available Management approval of lodging charges above district policy limits Inappropriate application of district meal reimbursement policy Poor review and control over general manager expenditures  In each case, expenditures were made outside district policy by either general manager approval or as an accepted practice. District Does Not Seek Lower Travel Costs Our current review identified approximately $32,000 of unnecessary travel expenses-- most were incurred because the district did not attempt to seek lower air fares, and a lesser amount occurred due to the high cost of mileage reimbursement paid when air travel was more cost efficient. Both of these areas show improvements since the 1989 audit, but they also demonstrate that problems persist. Over $30,000 in airfare could have been saved by using the State Travel Office.  The District Could Have Saved as Much as $30,000 in Airfare by Using Utah's State Travel Office. The district makes flight reservation through a local travel office, booking primarily with one airline with midweek flights and no weekend stay. Such bookings are higher priced, and with change penalties which occur often as district plans change, can be very expensive. The district can book its airfare through the state travel office. That office negotiates lower 35   airfare contracts with airlines. The tickets are contracted as refundable and changeable without a penalty and do not require a weekend stay. In the last three years, district employees and directors have averaged 70 business flights a year. The majority of flights are taken by four staff members: the general manager, assistant general manager, public relations director, and environmental programs director. Most district flights are to eight cities:         Bosie, ID Buffalo, NY Denver, CO Las Vegas, NV Palm Springs, CA Sacramento, CA Phoenix, AZ Washington, D.C.  A comparison of the state negotiated rates for the above cities to the rate paid by the district showed that, with minimum planning, the district could have saved approximately $30,000 by using state travel services. An excess of $625 was paid for mileage when airfare was less expensive.  Mileage in Lieu of Airfare Is Being Paid When Airfare Is less Expensive. In 1997 (the most current completed year available), the district paid $625 in excess reimbursements for vehicle travel over the cost of airfare to the same destination. Both district and state policy specifically state that if a person chooses to drive a private vehicle in lieu of flying, transportation reimbursement will be mileage, at the current IRS rate, or airfare whichever is less. Lodging Charges Often Exceed Policy Limits  $1,800 in excess lodging was approved by management and paid in 1996 and 1997.  District management approved approximately $1,800 in excess lodging charges in 1996 and 1997. For 1997 district travel, we found 37 cases where lodging rates were approved by the general manager even though each clearly exceeded the district's lodging policy. The findings are exclusive of lodging rates for conference hotels. The total excess for 1997 was $1,275 with rates exceeding policy by as little as $4.00 and as much as $150 per night. A less extensive review (four district travelers) of 1996 travel information identified an additional $460 of excess expenditures. A review of informal travel reservation logs from 1993 to  36   1998, kept by the administrative secretary, showed only four lodging rate reservations within the district's policy limit. The district's lodging budget does not follow district lodging policy rates.  The district policy limits in-state and out-of-state lodging rates for district staff to $60 per night except in Washington, D.C., which is limited to $120 per night. The district policy for directors does not have a dollar limit on lodging but states the charges shall not exceed a reasonable single occupancy rate. In comparison, state travel policy limits in-state lodging to $55-68 per night depending on geographic location and $65 per night out-of-state. Both district and state policies allow stays in conference hotels to be reimbursed at the actual cost. Interestingly, the district's 1998-99 fiscal year budget does not follow the district's own policy. Instead, budgeting is based on in-state lodging rates anticipated at $55 a night, out-of-state rates at $75 a night, and Washington, D.C. rates at $200 a night. The District's Meal Reimbursement Policy Is Liberal The district's meal reimbursement policy is unique in that it allows district employees to choose per diem rates or actual expenses to their advantage. A review of meal reimbursements for the four most traveled staff in 1996 and all staff and directors in 1997 showed direct meal expenses ranged anywhere from $7-50 and that approximately $320 was reimbursed in excess of per diem guidelines. District employees can request actual expense reimbursement if the meal costs more than the per diem rate or per diem if the meal costs less than the per diem rate. It is not uncommon for a district employee to request a combination of per diem and actual expenses while traveling. As an example:  An employee expenses room service breakfast for $7.50 (breakfast per diem is $5.00), but requests per diem reimbursement $7.00 for lunch. An employee accepts per diem payments for low cost breakfast and lunch meals and expenses dinners which cost from $34 to $50.    The district's meal reimbursement policy is generous.  The district policy allows employees to choose between meal per diem and actual expenses for meal reimbursement. The state policy allows only per diem reimbursement with the exception of ""premium"" cities such as New York and Washington, D.C., where the employee can choose per diem or actual expenses limited to $50 per day. 37   The district's meal reimbursement policy, while based on the state's policy, is more generous. Just as with the state, the district's meal per diem for overnight travel is based on the time of day the traveler leaves and returns home. The time parameters are the same as state policy. However, the district's nonovernight travel meal policy is more generous than the state policy, allowing meal reimbursement for non-overnight travel without a distance from homebase mileage criteria. District policy allows for lunch reimbursement during non-overnight travel. The policy reimburses employees $7.00 for lunch when the employee is away from home-base on business between 11:00 a.m. and 2:00 p.m. This policy contains no distance from home-base criteria. The state policy will reimburse lunch for non-overnight travel only if the traveler is 100 miles from home base, left homebase before 10:00am and returned after 2:00pm. Some General Manager Expenses Are Questionable There are no guidelines for price or replacement parameters of the general manager's vehicle.  The district board has allowed some expenditures by the district's general manager that we believe are questionable. First, the general manager has been given a personal use vehicle as part of his compensation. We believe that, given the price of the vehicle he selected ($37,000), board oversight of his purchases needs to be exercised. Second, inaccurate expense documentation of a Delta Crown Room membership leaves us with a concern for the degree of control over the general manager's expenses. The district does not have a policy or guideline defining the price parameter or replacement period of the general manager's car. As a result, the general manager's vehicle purchase has gone unchecked. The general manager replaced his three-year old vehicle in October, 1998 with a $37,342 Ford Expedition. We believe this purchase was at least $5,000 beyond the price range set, using comparable and reasonable criteria. According to state fleet operations, the price parameter for state positions comparable to the district's general manager allow cars priced between $28,000-32,000. Our survey of vehicles driven by other water district's managers showed vehicle prices ranging from $17,000 to $33,000. State fleet operation policies allow executives to replace vehicles at the beginning of each elected term or appointment period, approximately every four years, while other state divisions replace directors' cars, according to state replacement guidelines, every five to six years or 75,000-80,000 miles. In our opinion, the  38   district's board needs to establish parameters for the general manager's vehicle compensation and usage. The general manager's expenses may not be well controlled.  In a related incident, district records inaccurately identified payment of a Delta Crown Room membership for the general manager's wife. Specifically, the documentation in the file specified her as the recipient of the membership. It is against district policy that expenses are incurred on behalf of a spouse. Later, documentation was provided to us which demonstrated that the membership was for the general manager. However, accounting had processed and paid for the expense without ever receiving proper documentation of the expense. This leaves us with a concern for the degree of control over the general manager's expenses. Additionally, the state does not allow the purchase of such memberships by state employees.  District Motor Vehicle Controls Need Improvement The district's policies and guidelines for district-owned vehicle usage are poor because they allow too many vehicles and inappropriate use of vehicles. Better control of vehicle fleet size based on utilization for business purposes could result in a vehicle fleet reduction at head-quarters of 20 percent; a savings of approximately $52,000. Further reduction in fleet size and vehicle operating costs would be achieved with the elimination of inappropriate vehicle use for staff commuting. The district currently maintains 36 trucks and sedans for its 62 employees. Fifteen of these sedans, trucks and sport utility vehicles are maintained at headquarters. We analyzed usage of the vehicles at headquarters and found that 20 percent did not appear necessary. In addition, we reviewed mileage and available commute records for all the districts' vehicles and found that more than 50 percent of district vehicles are driven less than 12,000 miles per year. The mileage figure of 12,000 miles per year is a common criterion for justifying the ownership of a vehicle. Additionally, some of the vehicle miles are derived from employees commuting to and from work in district vehicles. The district does not have a commute policy and allows eight employees to consistently use district vehicles for commuting. Use of district vehicles for commuting is a problem accentuated by  Control of fleet size appears poor.  39   some employees' failure to meet federal Internal Revenue Service (IRS) requirements. District Vehicle Fleet Can Be Reduced Usage data suggest the district can decrease fleet size by two sedans and one truck, for a savings of $52,000. To determine vehicle usage need, we divided the district fleet into two categories:   District fleet size can be reduced for a savings of $52,000.  Headquarter trucks and sport utility vehicles Headquarter sedans  We then identified the maximum number of vehicles in each category used on any given day. These figures were then used as the criteria for the essential number of vehicles. Any vehicles in the fleet above the maximum usage were considered excess. The district, as a whole, does not track or record the demand or use of its vehicles; therefore, we relied on daily vehicle monitoring during the course of our audit. Actual daily use was based on observations made over a 19-day period during the summer, a busy work period for the district. Figure VII shows vehicle usage for the headquarter's trucks, sport utility vehicles (SUV's) and sedans.  Figure VII Headquarter Trucks and SUV'S Percent of time all 7 Vehicles Used 0% Percent of Percent of Time Time 6 5 Vehicles Used Vehicles Used 26% 26%  Total Number of Vehicles 7  Headquarter Sedans Total Number of Sedans 8 40 Percent of time all 8 Sedans Used 0% Percent of Time 7 Sedans Used 0% Percent of Time 6 Sedans Used 5%   Based on our analysis, we believe that one truck and two sedans can be eliminated from the fleet. Further, we believe our estimate is conservative. The district needs to do an in-depth analysis of how and when the fleet is in use. As part of this analysis, the district needs to weigh the cost a sedan or truck needed only five percent of the time with paying personal mileage for those five percent use times. An in-depth analysis of vehicle usage is needed.  Usage data was not available for all district vehicles; therefore we reviewed gas card mileage data. Given the mileages shown on the gas cards (50 percent of district vehicles average less than 12,000 miles per year), we believe that a vehicle usage analysis is warranted at the other district sites as well. District Does Not Have a Commute Policy The district does not have a commute policy stating when a commute is justified (i.e., 24-hour call-out or vehicle as virtual office). Commute privileges are at the discretion of department managers. The state, on the other hand, has specific criteria which must be met to justify a commute (e.g., 24-hour call-out, virtual office and alternate work site). District management allows eight district employees to regularly use district vehicles to travel to and from work. Using each of the eight employees, an estimate of stated commute mileage and submitted IRS commute forms shows commute miles account for 7-92 percent of total mileage on these vehicles. The high commute mileage indicates that without the commute mileage some of these vehicles may not be needed for day-to-day operations. The district's vehicle fleet size could be reduced even further.  Commute miles account for 7-92 percent of total miles on selected vehicles.  As a comparison, Utah State, by policy, would not permit the use of some of these vehicles for commuting. The state fleet operations commute policy grants commuting under the following conditions: 1. Law enforcement duties 2. 24-hour ""on-call""  it must be demonstrated that the commute is for a potential emergency and a complete list of call-outs must be recorded. 3. Virtual office  the employee must require a vehicle to perform work duties and work out of his/her home or vehicle most of the time. 4. Alternate work site  it must be more practical for the employee to go directly to an alternate work site than report to the office and pick up a car. 5. Provided as compensation by state statute  41   6. Extreme emergencies  determined on a case-by-case basis provided the commute is in the state's best interest. 7. Limited Commute  authorized on a limited basis, not to exceed five days per month. Some commute privileges may not be justified.  Using the state's criteria, it is difficult to justify the use of some district vehicles for commuting. Those that may be justified are not supported by call-out records demonstrating the need. Four managers and supervisors, assigned vehicles for emergency purposes, take vehicles home nightly. Other employees take a vehicle home periodically when they are assigned on-call duties. In either case, no call-out records are kept to determine need, frequency, or timely and appropriate response to after-hours emergencies. The public relations director's commute is not justified according to state policy. The public relations director commutes in a district car daily. He uses a district car to travel from his home in Sandy to district headquarters in Orem. Occasionally he does work in the Salt Lake Valley and will go directly from his home in Sandy to meetings in Salt Lake. We were unable to establish how often this occurs. Employee Vehicle Benefits May Be Under Reported  The general manager and the public relations director do not complete IRS commute forms.  Employee fringe benefits may also be under reported to the IRS because some district employees are not completing IRS commute benefit logs. Of the eight employees who commute regularly, two --the general manager and public relations director -- do not complete IRS commute forms and others do not complete forms on a monthly basis. These forms require information regarding the vehicle involved and the number of days commuted. When the public relations director was asked why he didn't complete commute forms, he stated he didn't think he had to and that he would fill out commute forms only if it was discussed in this report. The IRS requires employees using business-owned vehicles for commuting to report commuting as a taxable fringe benefit. The district fleet management guidelines require employees who commute to complete a vehicle fringe benefit computation form monthly. Further deviation from federal IRS requirements exist in the district's reporting of car allowances. The CUPCA manager receives a $375 a month car allowance, which is paid separately from payroll and reported on an IRS Form 1099-MISC. IRS instructions specifically state that auto allowances cannot be  42   reported on Form 1099-MISC and should be reported on Form W-2 to prevent any underpayment of social security and medicare taxes.  District Has Some Questionable Procurement Practices Procurement practices appear to avert competitive processes.  Some district procurement practices appear to avert a competitive process. New procurement policies and procedures have been written since our 1989 audit; however, there appear to be some liberal interpretation of the exception for procurement without competition. The policies allow the district to procure services without competition for the specific areas of sole sourcing, no advantage (instances where a competitive process is impractical or impossible and would not result in an advantage to the district), emergencies, and small purchases (less than $15,000 for supplies or $25,000 for engineering services). Examples of procurement processes by the district used to negate competitive bidding include:  Requiring one engineering firm to subcontract with another engineering firm for a $470,000 task, implying an immediate need in order to meet water delivery obligations. Failing to use a competitive process to retain the services of attorneys, lobbyists, environmentalists, and other specialists deemed sole-source providers.    Contracted FS/FEIS Work Raises Concerns Over District Protocol A district contract required the contractor to sub-contract $470,000 for a final supplement to the final environmental impact statement (FS/FEIS) with another engineering firm. In effect, the requirement resulted in a non-competitive contracting process that benefitted a firm with a long history of working with district employees. It appears that other firms were capable of completing the FS/FEIS but were not considered because the manager making the decision for the district was happy with prior work by the selected firm. It is unknown whether these other firms could have performed the work less expensively. A district required $470,000 subcontract resulted in a non-competitive process.  The circumstances of the contract are similar to a problem identified in our 1989 audit. In that prior case, an engineering agreement was signed, without using a competitive process, based on an emergency need for the contracted service. However, the contract was clearly not for an emergency as it extended 43   over four years. Our current audit found a similar deflecting of a competitive process, stating a time factor need for engineering services to meet water delivery obligations. However, current progress indicates construction on the project has been delayed and the district maintains that water deliveries can still be met, thus raising doubt as to the emergency status. The district maintains had they bid the project, they would be even further delayed. Whether or not the delay would ultimately be critical to the project is unknown. Contractually Requiring the Use of a Specific Firm by Another Firm Appears Inappropriate. In August 1998, a task order to prepare the final supplement to the Diamond Fork FEIS was written as part of a general program management contract. The task order specified that the general contractor use a district selected subcontractor to complete the FS/FEIS. The general contractor was allocated $22,000 for administrative costs, and $470,000 was allocated to pay the subcontractor. The district defends its selection stating that using a competitive process would delay the project and make the district unable to meet obligated water delivery needs in 2003. However, even though current work on the FS/FEIS has already delayed construction by one year, the district maintains it can meet water deliveries in 2003. The district has an obligation to send 50,000 acrefeet per year of water to Salt Lake County in 2003. The current CUP system can only deliver 38,800 acre- feet of water; therefore, completion of the Diamond Fork system is necessary to meet this obligation. The task order implied that completion of the Diamond Fork system by 2003 required the FS/FEIS be completed by late 1998; federal acceptance of the FS/FEIS by early 1999; and, construction to begin by summer 1999. The declared emergency implied that any delay would prevent the district from being able to meet its water delivery obligations in 2003. No formal analysis was completed to determine the qualifications of the engineering firm or opponents.  As of March 1999, the FS/FEIS was not yet complete, federal acceptance is not anticipated until fall 1999, and construction will not begin until summer 2000. District management states that even with construction beginning a year later than planned, the Diamond Fork system can be operational and deliver the obligated water to Salt Lake County by 2003. Other Engineering Firms Were Qualified to Prepare the FS/FEIS. The district's environmental compliance manager requested the specific subcontractor be used because of previous work they had done for the district. The selection was made even though other engineering firms, including the firm that completed the EIS on another phase of the same project, appeared 44   qualified. No formal analysis was conducted to determine either the qualifications of the selected contractor or possible opponents. It is unknown whether another firm could have performed the task less expensively. Some District Support Services Are Procured Without Competition Selected providers with longtime district service are considered solesource providers.  A number of district support services are procured without competition even though they do not fall under the small purchase exception nor appear to be sole-source providers. Rather, district management and employees consider selected providers with long-time district service as sole-source providers. The result is some district contracts, although called for by district policies and procedures, are not competitively bid. Examples of services retained without competition include: 1. Lobbyist  retained by the district in 1985. The names of a number of federal lobbyists were obtained by the district. The current federal lobbyist was selected after an interview by the general manager and the board chairman. He was retained in 1985 and has worked for the district since mid-1996 without a contract. 2. Legal Counsel  the district's current legal counsel has been retained for years. Staff at the district are unsure when the legal counsel first contracted with the district. No open competition for attorneys has been conducted since the current attorneys were retained. We could not find any support that any contract has existed since 1989. 3. Financial advisor  the current financial advisor was originally retained when the district had their first bond issue on the Jordan Aqueduct in the early 1990's. The financial advisor has an open-ended contract, dated July 1, 1996, with payment to be negotiated yearly. 4. Fish biologist  was originally contracted by the district, in the early 1980's, to assist in public relations efforts surrounding the June Sucker. District staff consider the fish biologist a sole-source even though the district was contracting with another fish biologist on the June Sucker issue, and more recently a fish biologist was hired by the district as a full-time employee. The most recent contract, valid until June 30, 1999, is for $45,000. 5. Contract and agreement writer  justified by a statement within the contract stating that the specific contract writer is the sole- source of 45   the services contemplated by the agreement. We question the likelihood that there is only one contract/agreement writer available in the state. Weak control over sole-source providers may result in contractor favoritism.  As can be seen, the district retains a number of sole-source providers, thus bypassing the competitive bidding process. As a result, the district cannot be assured of getting the best service for the most reasonable price. State and district code both allow contracts to be awarded without competition but only after it has been determined, in good faith, that there is only one source for the service. A record of all sole-source procurement should be maintained as a public record. This record is maintained so that possible competitors can challenge the sole-source justification. The district has not maintained a record of all sole-source contracts. Rather, the district has allowed district employees to sole-source contract without documentation. Such loose control can result in problems, such as contractor favoritism. The state Purchasing Director recommended that for some of these services (lobbyist, legal counsel, financial advisor), the contract should be rebid every five years. This rebid allows continuity of service but also insures that the best service is obtained for a reasonable cost. Recommendations: 1. We recommend that the district enforce state code and district policy regarding board members receiving direct and indirect benefits from district projects and contracts. 2. We recommend that the district's board members conduct an annual performance review on the general manager and the full board vote on salary and benefit changes. 3. We recommend the district utilize the State Travel Office to make flight arrangements. 4. We recommend the district comply with lodging and meal reimbursement policies. 5. We recommend the district improve vehicle controls by tracking vehicle usage to make informed decisions on fleet size, develop a commute policy, and enforce IRS commute reporting.  46   6. We recommend the district improve documentation for sole-source procurement and implement a competitive procurement process for support services (i.e., every five years complete a competitive process for financial, legal, lobbyist, etc).  47   This Page Left Blank Intentionally  48   Chapter IV Discontinuation of SFN Project Affords Opportunity to Redirect Efforts The Department of Interior's (DOI) instruction to the district to discontinue planning of the Spanish Fork-Nephi (SFN) project has created a need to revisit district plans. We believe the district now has an excellent opportunity to rethink its operational plans and its proposed water allocations. Planning appears limited by federal funding require- ments and federal water use controls but, we believe that alternatives do exist. However, we also believe that district leadership wishes to maintain much of its now discontinued SFN plan. In particular, district leadership appears to be closely tied to delivering an irrigation project to southern Utah County and eastern Juab County. This focus is primarily defended using two arguments:   commitment to the area growth in the area.  With Utah's rapid urbanization, it is possible that this plan may no longer be the best use of water resources. In particular, demographic and economic data question the allocations of the former SFN project. We believe that the Legislature should independently analyze and form a legislative position on how the former SFN water should be allocated. 800,600 acre-feet were originally proposed to be developed under CUP. Today 264,360 is proposed for development.  The Central Utah Project (CUP), of which the SFN is a part, was conceived over fifty years ago as a federally supported agricultural project which would allow Utah to claim its portion of the Colorado River water. According to district personnel, the government's goal in the 1940's was to develop the agricultural economies of the states. Based on the Bureau of Reclamation's 1951 CUP report, the purpose of the CUP project was to supply enough irrigation water to protect agriculture from urban encroachment. In fact, of the 800,600 acre-feet proposed to be developed under the comprehensive CUP plan, only 48,800 acre-feet was to be developed for municipal and industrial (M&I) use. Today, of the 264,360 acre-feet proposed to be developed, 107,360 acre-feet are for M&I, 112,600 acre-feet are for agriculture, and 44,400 acre-feet are left in the streams for fish habitat. The CUP project was to be carried out in two phases: the initial phase and the ultimate phase. In the initial phase, development was to be limited to areas between Salt Lake City and Nephi. The ultimate phase extended the areas 49   served to include Levan, Richfield, Delta and Fillmore. In 1992, the district proposed a plan in the federal Central Utah Project Completion Act (CUPCA) which would have essentially served the areas described in the ultimate phase of the CUP. As an alternative, the district also proposed a general plan in the CUPCA statute which would serve the areas described in the initial phase of the CUP. When Millard and Sevier Counties withdrew from the district in 1994, the district moved to the alternative plan outlined in CUPCA. This project became known as the SFN project.  District Leadership Has Maintained Historical Plan Some key district employees, as well as many board members, appear committed to building an irrigation project which will serve southern Utah County and eastern Juab County. In other words, these individuals appear committed to carrying out the historical initial phase of the CUP. This preference for an irrigation project going south is justified by the district using two arguments. First, district leadership maintains that a commitment was made to southern Utah County and eastern Juab County many years ago and that commitment must be honored. This commitment was codified in the 1992 CUPCA statute which the district helped draft. Second, some district employees and board members argue that bringing water into these areas will encourage growth. It is up to the Legislature to decide the legitimacy of either argument. District and Board Appear Closely Tied to an Irrigation Project in the South We believe that some key district employees and many board members prefer an irrigation project in the south. Further, we believe that it would be difficult for some board members to objectively consider sending the SFN water north to Salt Lake County or northern Utah County if these alternatives were presented during the district's upcoming scoping process on the SFN replacement project. The board's preference may result from the predominately rural irrigation representation on the board. 62 percent of the board members interviewed supported the water going south.  In 1997, a district board member stated to the Salt Lake County Council of Governments that the district board strongly favors the SFN project and it is very unlikely that it would ask for a change in legislation to redirect whatever water would be available north to Salt Lake County. Today, many of the board members appear to feel similarly--that the water should stay south. We 50   interviewed 13 of the 18 board members. We were unable to make contact with the remaining five board members. Eight of the board members interviewed (62 percent) indicated that the water should go south as originally planned. Two reasons were given in support of the original plan: (1) the district made and should honor past commitments to southern Utah County and eastern Juab County, and (2) water placement in rural areas would encourage growth there. In fact, it is the board members and district employees who primarily make these two arguments against possible water reallocation. Only two of the board members cited the CUPCA legislation as a reason for sending the water south. The following are examples of board member comments: Completing SFN is a matter of integrity because those agreements were made 25 years ago and you don't enter a project and then say ""Sorry, we lied to you guys; we can't deliver water to you after all."" The district's chief responsibility is to complete the SFN as it was originally intended. This re-scoping process is going to open a whole can of worms by having Salt Lake County and other counties vying for SFN water. ""This re-scoping process is going to open a whole can of worms.""  If the water can't go south, it should be left in the Uintah Basin. The district hasn't really looked at alternatives to sending the water north because they made commitments to the rural or southern part of the state and they ought to honor those commitments. The CUPCA legislation authorized the district to develop a plan wherein they could study taking the water south or north, and while there wasn't an in-depth study, it was common knowledge that the water was more beneficial going south.  ""If the water can't go south, it should be left in the Uintah Basin.""  Given these comments, we have concerns whether the board can objectively analyze alternatives outside the original SFN plan. For example, the Central Utah Project Completion Act (CUPCA) legislation, referred to above, required that the district conduct a feasibility study of direct delivery of Colorado River Basin water from the Strawberry Reservoir or elsewhere in the Strawberry Collection System to the Provo River Basin. Moving the water to the Provo River Basin would allow the water to be moved into Salt Lake County or northern Utah County, if desired. District management maintains that this was 51   not the purpose of the study. Other individuals who negotiated the CUPCA legislation maintain that it was. In our opinion, the CUPCA legislation appears to open the door for an analysis of a water delivery alternative, possibly into Salt Lake County or northern Utah County, for which money had not yet been authorized. District spent at least $500,000 analyzing various alternatives to move essentially non-existent water into the Provo River Basin.  In doing this study, district personnel decided not to consider the direct delivery of Colorado River Basin water to the Provo River Basin as an alternative to the proposed SFN System. Because district personnel made this assumption, little water was available to consider delivering into the Provo River Basin (only 3,000 acre-feet under one alternative). Thus, if the purpose of the study was to analyze a water delivery alternative to the Provo River Basin, that purpose was rendered moot. However, the district probably spent between $500,000 to $1 million of federal money analyzing various alternatives to move essentially nonexistent water into the Provo River Basin. The district's CUPCA manager acknowledged that this study was a limited analysis. The methodology of this study could indicate a resistance on the part of the district to objectively consider a water allocation other than the original plan. It is possible that the sentiment to keep the water south is a result of the makeup of the board. Potential board members are approved by county commissioners, then by the Governor, and finally by the Senate. However, some of the board members have sat on this board for a very long time. For example, the board member representing east Juab County has been a board member for 35 years while six other board members have served between 10 and 16 years. In our opinion, these time periods are too long. The board is supposed to function as an objective watchdog of the district's activities. Lengthy board membership can negatively impact the ability to objectively analyze the district's operations.  The board member representing east Juab County has been on the district's board for 35 years.  In addition, twelve of the eighteen board members (67 percent) represent a rural irrigation perspective. Given that the CUP was originally conceived of as an irrigation project, this representation makes sense. However, with the states' population, primarily in urban areas now, this weighting toward rural irrigation makes less sense today. While the rural irrigation viewpoint is an important perspective, we believe it should be appropriately balanced with the urban viewpoint.  52   In our 1989 audit, we also commented that a substantial number of board members were involved in irrigated agriculture. Further, the 1989 audit noted that a majority of the board members were directly connected with the water industry whose interests may not necessarily represent the public interest. As a result, that audit recommended the Legislature consider changing the makeup of the board-- but this was not done. Given the shift to urbanization, the Legislature might want to take another look at changing the makeup of the district's board. District Defends Its Focus with Two Arguments The district defends taking the water south using two arguments. First, the district maintains that a commitment was made to southern Utah County and eastern Juab County which should be honored. Second, the district indicates that water placement in these areas could encourage growth. Was a Binding Commitment Made? Board members and district personnel maintain that because of promises to the people of southern Utah County and eastern Juab County, a reallocation of SFN water would be unfair. The people in these counties have been paying taxes to the district for over 34 years, and it would be wrong for these two counties to receive no water. Eastern Juab County has paid $1.7 million in property taxes to the district and received a $3.2 million water project.  We are unclear as to the nature of any promise. We could not locate any contracts with either county which guarantees a specific amount of water to the two counties. However, one board member indicated that the informal board commitment was made in 1965 when a construction choice between the Jordanelle Reservoir and an irrigation project was made by the board. In addition, it has been planned for many years that these two counties would receive water. In the 1951 Bureau of Reclamation report on the Central Utah Project, the initial phase of the CUP was to serve the area from Salt Lake to Nephi. The comprehensive plan of the CUP extended the area served to include Levan, Fillmore, Richfield and Delta. The latter three cities were eliminated from the CUP when Millard and Sevier Counties pulled out of the district. Levan, in eastern Juab County, was eliminated from the project because it was not in the Utah Lake Drainage Basin. In addition, it was possibly considered too expensive to pump water into the Levan area. It would be unfair to keep county taxes and then not provide any benefit from those taxes. However, the CUPCA legislation anticipated this issue. Section 206 provides two options for counties who elect not to  53   participate in the project anymore. While east Juab County has the option to withdraw, Utah County does not. Counties which leave the district can receive a tax rebate or a grant for a local development project.  The first option is a tax rebate. All taxes paid to the district by the county would be reimbursed plus interest minus the value of any benefits received by the county. Eastern Juab County has paid approximately $1.7 million to the district. However, the district will pay at least $3.2 million for the East Juab Water Conservation Project which is projected to conserve 6,700 acre-feet of water within eastern Juab County through more efficient water delivery. A second option would be a grant provided to the county for local development. These grants could be used for water distribution and treatment, agricultural water management, and other public infrastructure improvements. As a result of CUPCA section 206, we believe that avenues exist to compensate counties who do not receive project benefits. Does Water Placement Encourage Growth? Many district board members argue that placing water in southern Utah County and eastern Juab County will encourage migration of Utah's population into these counties. Thus, placing water in these areas will cause the population to spread out and relieve some of the population pressures in the Salt Lake and Provo areas. This argument may have some merit; however, the Department of Interior (DOI) has argued against it in the past. In the 1973 Final Environmental Statement on the Bonneville Unit, the DOI makes the following statements: According to a study prepared for the National Water Commission, water development and regional economic growth are not necessarily connected. Ample water supplies for agriculture and/or municipal-industrial use, the existence of waterbased recreational resources, the availability of low cost hydroelectric power, etc., do not provide in and of themselves a sufficient condition for economic growth. Furthermore, in some situations they may not even be necessary conditions for such growth to occur. ...Accessibility to major markets, availability of quality labor supply, transportation costs and alternatives, and climate all play a role in establishing conditions favorable for growth. ...The fact that an ample water supply may not, under certain conditions, be necessary for growth is indicated by the rapid rate of economic 54   growth in certain so called ""water short"" areas of the west and southwest. Federal study says water development and regional economic growth are not necessarily connected.  This statement appears to support the position that the DOI believes people do not follow water; rather, water tends to follow people. Interestingly, the district also appears to adhere to this philosophy in district reports. Specifically, population changes (i.e., growth) are not assumed by the district when allocating water. Thus, it would appear more prudent to place water where the population is projected to be instead of placing water in an area and assuming the population will move there. While the Legislature may find either of these arguments compelling, there is other information which indicates that the former SFN plan may need to be reconsidered.  Former SFN Plan May No Longer Be the Best Alternative Sending irrigation water to southern Utah County and eastern Juab County may be questionable. First, the SFN Draft Environmental Impact Statement ( DEIS) was found to have serious problems requiring a new scoping process. Second, demographic and economic indicators question the historical placement of the water. Third, the political argument of equity questions the historical placement of the water. SFN Environmental Impact Statement Had Serious Problems Because of serious problems, the Department of Interior (DOI) requested the district cease all planning efforts on the SFN DEIS. Two problems were primarily responsible for the cessation of the SFN DEIS planning efforts. The first problem concerns the purpose and need of the SFN irrigation system, and the second concerns the increased salinity in Utah Lake caused by the SFN irrigation system. The Diamond Fork System is necessary. Jordanelle Dam project relies on its water.  Before any federal dollars could be obligated or expended on the SFN system, the Central Utah Project Completion Act (CUPCA) required compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). As part of meeting the NEPA requirements, the district issued (for public comment) in March 1998, a draft environmental impact statement (DEIS) on the SFN system. By July 1998, it was clear that the DEIS had failed to meet NEPA requirements and in that 55   same month the district was asked by the Department of Interior (DOI) to cease planning efforts on the SFN system. The SFN irrigation system is optional with no prior commitments upon its operation.  The original SFN DEIS included two elements. The first element was the Diamond Fork System. This system is not optional because another project relies upon its operation. Specifically, Diamond Fork is necessary for the Jordanelle exchange and must be completed if Jordanelle Reservoir is to make its contractual water deliveries to Salt Lake County by 2003. For more information on the Jordanelle exchange see Appendix A. The district is currently in the process of trying to complete a Final Supplemental on the Final Environmental Impact Statement (FS/FEIS) on the Diamond Fork System. The second element was the SFN irrigation system, which is an optional system since no other system relies upon its operation. The purpose of the SFN irrigation system is to provide irrigation water to southern Utah County and eastern Juab County. Once the Diamond Fork FS/FEIS is completed (hopefully by August 1999), scoping work can begin on the former SFN system (now renamed the Utah Lake Drainage Basin Water Delivery System). For the former SFN system to remain as planned, the potentially fatal comments received in the SFN DEIS must somehow be overcome. Project Purpose Is Problematic. Specifically, the purpose and need of the project was compromised primarily by the Strawberry Water Users Association's (SWUA) response to the DEIS and by information in the DEIS itself. In their DEIS response, SWUA, a large irrigation company in southern Utah County, reinforced their intention to convert some or all of their water from irrigation to M&I. In fact, some SWUA irrigation water has already been converted to M&I use, possibly in violation of its DOI agreement. SWUA's intention to convert, raised questions as to the need for supplemental irrigation water in the area served by the SFN.  The EPA declared the DEIS fundamentally flawed because the project's purpose was stated as irrigation, yet the true purpose appeared to be M&I.  The district's general manager noted that SWUA's written comments struck at the heart of the SFN's purpose and need. SWUA's response opened the door for the following question: If SWUA is going to convert its irrigation water to M&I, then why is the SFN sending down supplemental irrigation water? The EPA echoed these sentiments. In their DEIS response, the EPA reiterated that the stated purpose of the SFN project was to supply supplemental irrigation water, yet information in the DEIS proposed to reduce or even eliminate the irrigation aspect of the SFN project. Based on this information, the EPA declared the DEIS fundamentally flawed. Thus, if an irrigation project is going to be built in this area, the public comments impacting the purpose and need of the SFN are going to have to be overcome. 56   Increased Salinity in Utah Lake Is Also a Concern. SFN runoff from irrigated lands is predicted to cause the salinity of Utah Lake to exceed state standards. Specifically, Utah Lake's salinity is predicted to rise to 1400 parts per million (ppm) while the State water quality standard for irrigation is 1200 ppm. The water quality in Utah Lake was one of the significant issues raised by both the EPA and the State Division of Water Quality in their SFN DEIS review. The EPA, in its DEIS response, noted that the water quality of Utah Lake and its tributaries has been degraded for many years and the SFN project is projected to exacerbate this condition. The EPA does not believe that project-related, adverse water quality impacts should be allowed. This is especially important as the cost for treatment of the poor water quality in Utah Lake is passed on to non-project beneficiaries. Utah Lake salinity problem has been known for years, yet was not included in the DEIS.  According to an EPA representative, the EPA has been telling the district about this salinity problem for over 10 years. In spite of this, an analysis of the salinity problem was not included in the DEIS. The EPA representative indicated that the district has two choices regarding the salinity problem: (1) either comply with the state standard or, (2) change the state water quality standard. The Division of Water Quality has indicated that this latter option might be possible. However, the Salt Lake County Water Conservancy District, which uses Utah Lake water, has indicated that they might oppose any increase in the standard since it would increase their costs to clean the water. In addition to the EPA's questioning the historical purpose and placement of the water, demographic and economic indicators also appear to question the historical placement of the water. Historically, the SFN system was to deliver 11,200 acre-feet of M&I water to southern Utah County and 73,100 acre-feet of irrigation water to southern Utah County and eastern Juab County. An acre-foot is the amount of water which will cover an acre of land to a depth of one foot. Figure VIII shows the acres served and the acre-feet of irrigation water going to each county under the former SFN system.  57   Figure VIII Irrigation Acre-feet Received and Acres Served by County (SFN Water Only) Location Southern Utah County Eastern Juab County TOTAL Acres Served 52,210 23,360 75,570 Acre-feet Received 31,100 42,000 73,100  The 23,360 acres served in eastern Juab County includes approximately 10,000 acres of land which have never received any irrigation water. These lands are being given a full water allotment (3 acre-feet per acre or 30,000 acre-feet). The remaining eastern Juab acres are under-irrigated and are receiving water to bring them up to a full water allotment. Southern Utah County is only adding additional water to under-irrigated acres to provide a full water allotment. As a result, eastern Juab County is receiving more water per acre served than southern Utah County.  SFN project allowed eastern Juab County to irrigate 10,000 new acres but does not allow any new irrigation in southern Utah County.  In 1998, the cost of bringing the above water into these two counties was estimated to be $251,000,000. The district taxpayers' portion of this cost is estimated to be $87,850,000. Figure IX shows the costs to run the pipeline to each county.  Figure IX Total and Local Costs to Extend the Pipeline by County Location Southern Utah County Eastern Juab County TOTAL Total Cost (1998 Dollars) $163,150,000 87,850,000 $251,000,000 Local Portion of Total Cost $ 57,730,000 30,120,000 $87,850,000  The federal portion of the SFN system is capped at $125,000,000 (This amount is stated in 1991 dollars and there is an inflation adjustment.) Local taxpayers are required to pay, at a minimum, 35 percent of the project's cost. 58   This local cost-share requirement is very unusual for an irrigation project which, in the past, was subsidized almost 100 percent by the federal government. As a result of the federal spending cap, any project cost overruns will be borne by district taxpayers. In addition, these costs do not include the costs of the distribution systems which must be built within the two counties. Theoretically, these distribution costs are to be borne by the counties; however, the Strawberry Water Users Association (SWUA) has recently requested that the Salem Low Pressure System be funded by the district. Thus, it appears possible that some of the distribution costs may be paid for by the district. If this is the case, the local taxpayer portion of the SFN system would increase. Demographic and Economic Indicators Question Former SFN Water Allocation Utah is the sixth most urban state in the nation.  Current county population projections question the allocation of the SFN's water. While the population is expected to grow substantially in Salt Lake and Utah Counties, far less growth is expected in Juab County. As a result, this population growth does not appear to support the allocation to Juab County. In addition, from an agricultural perspective, county agricultural production statistics also question the former allocation. Agriculture in Utah County yields a greater dollar value per acre-foot than does agriculture in Juab County. This agricultural production does not appear to support the allocation to Juab County. As noted earlier, the CUP was planned from an agricultural preservation perspective. Now, however, most of Utah's population is clustered in the urbanized areas (Salt Lake, Provo-Orem, Ogden, and Logan). As a result, Utah ranks as the sixth most urban state in the nation. District management noted that given the long CUP planning time (50 years), needs have changed and now urban water uses are becoming more pressing than agricultural water uses. As a result, district management now realizes that any irrigation project is merely holding the water until the M&I need is there. Thus, because of population growth, this irrigation use is, ultimately, going to convert to an M&I use. Population Projections Question the Original Allocation. Given that this water appears to have an ultimate M&I use, population projections become important. It makes sense from this perspective that water would be placed where the population is expected to go. Figure X shows population projections for Salt Lake County, northern Utah County, southern Utah County and Juab 59  Irrigation water is ultimately going to be converted to an M&I use.  Salt Lake and Utah Counties are projected to gain the most in population while Juab is projected to gain the least.   County. Data for eastern Juab County was not available. While Salt Lake County was not scheduled to receive water from the SFN (Salt Lake will receive 70,000 acre-feet from Jordanelle), Salt Lake County is included in this analysis because the county is a possible candidate to receive reallocated water and has unmet needs.  Figure X Population Projections for Selected Counties 1997 - 2050 Projected Population 2020 Projected Population 2050 Net Population Change 1997 to 2050  County  Population 1997  Salt Lake Northern Utah Southern Utah Juab  830,627 264,827 65,976 7,702  1,301,094 407,535 127,515 11,847  1,975,160 631,092 318,006 17,727  +1,144,533 +366,265 +252,030 +10,025  As can be seen, Salt Lake and Utah Counties are projected to gain the most in population while Juab is projected to gain the least. Further, southern Utah County has a significantly higher projected population increase than does Juab County. This comparison becomes clearer when looked at from a water needs perspective. One general rule is that a family of four will consume approximately one acrefoot of water a year. Figure XI shows the projected change in the number of families and the resulting amount of water needed to meet the requirements of these additional families.  60   Figure XI Projected Additional M&I Water Needs by County Projected Additional Population 2050 Projected Additional Families of Four 2050 Projected Additional Water Needs 2050  County  Salt Lake Northern Utah Southern Utah Juab  1,144,533 366,265 252,030 10,025  286,133 91,566 63,008 2,506  286,133 acre-feet 91,566 acre-feet 63,008 acre-feet 2,506 acre-feet  M&I water need is low in Juab County.  Again, based on population, Salt Lake and Utah Counties are projected to need significantly more water than Juab County. However, although Juab County is projected to need a small additional amount of M&I water, the county was scheduled to receive a large water allocation. Figure XII shows a comparison of projected additional water needs and the water allocation by county. The water allocations reported in this figure are Bonneville Unit water allocations, not just SFN water allocations. These water allocations include both M&I and irrigation water.  Figure XII Bonneville Water Allocations Compared to Water Needs County Salt Lake Northern Utah Southern Utah Juab Projected Additional Water Needs in 2050 286,133 acre-feet 91,566 acre-feet 63,008 acre-feet 2,506 acre-feet Bonneville Unit Water Allocation 70,000 acre-feet 20,000 acre-feet 42,300 acre-feet 42,000 acre-feet  61   Juab County is projected to save 6,700 acre-feet of water through the East Juab Water Conservation Project. This saved water will be available for county use.  Based on the projected M&I needs, which the district indicated is the ultimate use of this water, it is not clear to us why these water allocations were made. For example, it appears that Juab County is receiving far more water than it needs in the next 50 years while Utah and Salt Lake Counties are receiving less. (In addition to this additional water, Juab County is also projected to save 6,700 acre-feet of water a year as a result of the East Juab Water Conservation Project.) Further, according to the 1997 Utah Water Data Book, Salt Lake County is expected to exceed its culinary water supply by 2016 while Utah County is expected to exceed its culinary water supply by 2025. Salt Lake County is planning on meeting some of its M&I needs through importation of Bear River water, which is a lower quality water than Bonneville Unit water. The Bear River project is currently estimated to cost between $350 and $700 million, depending on when construction begins. In 1995, the district estimated costs between $14 and $230 million to send water to the Provo River Basin from which Salt Lake County could access the water (These costs are only for the delivery system. Sending M&I water to Salt Lake County might result in an additional $500 million cost as explained later). Additional water to meet Salt Lake and Utah County M&I needs will come from irrigation conversion, conservation, desalting Utah Lake, and reuse of wastewater.  Salt Lake County is planning on meeting some of its M&I needs with the $350 to $700 million Bear River Project, desalting Utah Lake, and reusing wastewater.  While population projections appear to support a reallocation of the SFN water, we believe that agricultural production statistics question the allocation as well. Agricultural Indicators Question the Original Allocation. The agricultural revenue produced per acre of farmland is greater for Utah Counties' 1,790 farms than for Juab Counties' 228 farms. Since irrigation is holding the water until an M&I need arises, we reasoned that it might be wise to place irrigation water: first, where there is a projected M&I need; and, second, where the economic benefit to the state is the greatest. Figure XIII shows the market value of the crops and livestock produced per acre of crop land by county as reported in the 1997 Agricultural Census. In this analysis we did not consider Salt Lake County since relatively few acres are irrigated in this county.  62   Figure XIII Comparison of Per-acre Value of Crops and Livestock by County 1997 Total Crop Land 149,920 acres 66,400 acres Market Value of Crops & Livestock (1997) $97,009,000 8,353,000 Per-acre Value of Crops (1997) $647.07/acre 125.80/acre  County Utah Juab  Juab farmers probably won't change their crop patterns as a result of the new water.  While it is possible that Juab County could produce a greater market value per acre with additional water, it is not clear to us that this market value will significantly increase relative to Utah County. Further, according to statements made in a 1995 district study on water pricing, it appears unlikely that Juab County farmers will shift production to a higher value crop unless net income significantly increases. Net income equals the market value of crops and livestock minus expenses incurred. Farmers have an economic incentive to grow crops that provide the greatest net income. Low cost water allows farmers to earn a greater net income than otherwise would have been the case from crops like alfalfa (Juab County's primary crop). Further, alternative crops require alternative markets, alternative production methods, and alternative risks. Given this comparison, it would appear reasonable to focus irrigation water on Utah County since the crop value per acre is significantly higher than in Juab County. In other words, it might make more sense to encourage Utah County to open up new acres to irrigation. However, under the former SFN system, Utah County was not provided with water to irrigate new acreage. Eastern Juab County, on the other hand, was provided with enough water to open up 10,000 acres of new land to irrigation. According to the General Manager of SWUA, southern Utah County has a great deal of acreage which could possibly be opened up to irrigation. This contention is supported by an analysis of arable acreage. The Secretary of Interior has certified 101,771 acres in southern Utah County and eastern Juab County as arable. Arable land is land that has sufficient income potential to warrant consideration for irrigation development. Southern Utah County has 70 percent of these identified arable acres or 70,901 acres. The General 63  Southern Utah County has 70,901 identified arable acres that are not addressed by the project.   Manager of SWUA could give no reason why southern Utah County was not given the option to open new acreage to irrigation. In fact, this issue is a concern of SWUA. In our opinion, both the demographic and economic indicators support a reanalysis of the former SFN water allocation. In addition, there is a political argument which also supports a re-analysis of the SFN water as well. Funding and Benefits Are Not Equitable Some in Salt Lake County argue the water allocations within the Bonneville Unit are inequitable. In addition, some Salt Lake County legislators are also beginning to raise this issue. The argument is based on a comparison of the project funding each county has provided to the water allocation each county will receive. Juab has paid less than one percent of the total taxes and is receiving 19 percent of the water.  The district was formed and began collecting taxes in 1965. Figure XIV shows the total amount of taxes that have been collected through 1997 and each county's dollar and percent contribution to the total. Figure XIV also shows the acre-feet and the percent of total water allocated to each county. Since Millard and Sevier Counties left the district, their tax contributions ($6,379,125 and $2,196,888 respectively) were excluded from the analysis.  64   Figure XIV Comparison of Funding Contributed and Benefits Received by County Total Amount Paid $167,222,507 41,701,716 10,787,171 7,339,935 2,969,074 2,619,286 1,694,239 683,693 298,823 175,551 $235,491,995 Percentage of Total Acre-Feet Paid Allocated 71.0% 17.7 4.6 3.1 1.3 1.1 .7 .3 .1 .1 100% 70,000 62,300 3,000 24,900 17,760 -042,000 -0-0-0219,960 Percentage of Total Allocation 31.82% 28.32 1.36 11.32 8.08 -019.10 -0-0-0100%  County Salt Lake Utah Uintah Duchesne Wasatch Sanpete Juab Garfield Piute Summit Total  Additional water is not the only benefit of participation. For example, Piute, Sanpete, and Garfield Counties will benefit if the Hatchtown Dam is constructed.  Salt Lake County is projected to exceed its culinary water supply by 2016 while Juab County does not appear to need additional culinary water.  Proponents of the equity argument use Salt Lake County and Juab County as examples of inequity. As Figure XIV shows, Salt Lake County has contributed 71 percent of the total taxes collected by the district yet is scheduled to receive only 31.82 percent of the project water and is projected to exceed its culinary water supply by 2016. Juab County, on the other hand, has contributed less than one percent of the total taxes collected by the district yet is scheduled to receive 19.1 percent of the project water. Based on population projections, Juab County does not appear to need additional M&I water. Based on these comparisons, some see the water allocations as inequitable. On the other hand, urban areas often subsidize  65   governmental services in rural areas. Whether this subsidization is appropriate in this case is a matter for legislative consideration. It should be noted that benefits other than additional water are provided by CUPCA. For example, Piute, Garfield, and Sanpete Counties are hopeful that the Hatchtown Dam will be constructed. While this project may not bring these counties additional water, it will allow for better regulation of existing water. In addition, Wasatch County is benefitting from the Wasatch County Water Conservation Project, estimated to conserve 23,000 acre-feet of water within the county. The demographic and economic indicators support a re-analysis of the former SFN's water allocation. Further, we believe this re-analysis should be performed by the state.  An Open Independent Analysis Is Needed Possible water allocations should be analyzed in an open fashion by an independent committee. As noted earlier, the district and its board appear closely tied to an irrigation project in southern Utah County and eastern Juab County. As a result, we believe the Legislature should form a task force or study committee to independently analyze possible water allocation alternatives and determine what alternative would be best for the state as a whole. According to the district's general manager, it would be helpful if the state would adopt a water allocation position. In making this analysis, the task force will have to carefully weigh a number of difficult issues. District's general manager believes it would be beneficial for the state to take a position on where the SFN water should go.  As noted earlier in this chapter, some district employees and board members appear to prefer an irrigation project in the south. Many board members believe that a promise made to send water south should be kept. Further, it appears that some of the board members would not be able to objectively consider sending the water north if that alternative were presented. Some board members appear to believe that the water should either go south or it should stay where it is. This re-analysis of the former SFN water allocation is a critical, political decision which should be made with the benefit of the overall state's interest in mind. Thus, we believe that the water allocation alternatives merit an open, independent review by the state. Currently there is an internal task force within the Department of Natural Resources which is analyzing some of the issues surrounding certain water allocation 66   alternatives. However, according to statements made at the February 1999 task force meeting, we do not believe that this task force will recommend any particular alternative. In our opinion, the Legislature should study the SFN water allocations and make a recommendation on a legislative position regarding the water. This study might be able to use some of the work generated by the internal task force. The district's general manager believes it would be beneficial for the state to take a water position. He believes that the federal government would not oppose whatever allocation the state determined to be in its best interests. In making this analysis, there are several difficult issues that the task force will have to weigh. Several Issues Will Impact Analysis of Water Allocation Alternatives All three of the likely water allocation alternatives have difficult issues surrounding them. One alternative is to allocate the water to southern Utah County and eastern Juab County as originally conceived in the SFN plan. This alternative is estimated to cost $251 million and has the following issues: (1) a questionable purpose and need; (2) the increasing salinity of Utah Lake; (3) the possible lack of SWUA participation; and, (4) unknown irrigation to M&I conversion costs. A second alternative is to allocate irrigation water to Utah County only. This alternative is estimated to cost $163 million and has the same issues as the original SFN alternative. A third alternative is to reallocate the SFN water to Salt Lake County as M&I water. This alternative was estimated in 1995 to cost between $14 million and $230 million for the delivery system (An additional $500 million in cost could be added as a result of the conversion to M&I.) This will be explained below and has the following issues: (1) code constraints; (2) unknown costs; and, (3) reduced water availability. While these are not the only possible alternatives, they are alternatives which have been raised in the past. SWUA has stated its intention to convert some or all of its water to M&I use.  Irrigation Water Could Be Supplied as Originally Planned. The plan serving southern Utah County and eastern Juab County is estimated to cost $251 million and is impacted by the following issues: A Questionable Purpose and Need. The need for an irrigation project in southern Utah and eastern Juab Counties was compromised by SWUA's stated intentions to convert some or all of their water from irrigation to M&I. This intention resulted in the EPA questioning the need for the project. If SWUA is going to convert its irrigation water 67   to M&I, then why is the SFN furnishing supplemental irrigation water? The EPA declared that the DEIS was fundamentally flawed, given the stated project purpose of providing supplemental irrigation water and comments in the DEIS which indicated a possible reduction or elimination of the irrigation aspect of the project. An Increase in Utah Lake Salinity. SFN water percolating through irrigated lands coupled with a decreased flow from the Provo River is predicted to cause the salinity of Utah Lake to exceed acceptable standards. Specifically, Utah Lake's salinity is predicted to rise to 1,400 parts per million (ppm) while the State water quality for irrigation is 1,200 ppm. The water quality in Utah Lake was one of the significant issues raised by both the EPA and the State Division of Water Quality in their SFN DEIS review. An EPA representative indicated that the district has two choices regarding the salinity problem: (1) either comply with the state standard, or (2) change the state water quality standard which would affect other users of Utah Lake. The district's general manager has informally offered to pay SWUA's project cost of $40 million in an effort to get SWUA's needed participation.  SWUA May Not Participate. SWUA's participation is important to the SFN project for two reasons. First, the SFN system assumed use of SWUA's Highline Canal as part of the SFN distribution system. Without SWUA's participation, the canal would not be available for use. Second, SWUA is the largest irrigator in southern Utah County and facilitates the federally required user commitment for 90 percent of the SFN water delivery. Without 90 percent of the water under contract, no federal money can be spent on construction. In addition to these two issues, another SWUA issue which impacts the district, regardless of SWUA's participation, is a contractual water delivery commitment made to SWUA by the district. If this contractual obligation is binding, then SWUA water could potentially utilize the full capacity of the Diamond Fork System leaving no room for SFN water. As a result, SFN water would become an unreliable source of water, most likely during critical periods (hot, dry spells). Toward obtaining SWUA's willing participation, the district's general manager has made an informal offer. This offer states that the district will pay SWUA's cost of project participation (estimated to be $40 million) and will deliver water to SWUA as long as it is used for irrigation. However, upon conversion to M&I, the water reverts to management by the district and the district gets the money from the  68   M&I sales. It is unknown what release from the SWUA delivery obligation will cost the district and the district's taxpayers. Federal government heavily subsidizes irrigation projects while M&I projects are paid for by the system users.  Conversion Costs Are Unknown. Irrigation projects are heavily subsidized by western power users. M&I projects are not subsidized and M&I users are expected to pay the full cost of the system. Upon conversion from irrigation to M&I, the costs that local users might be expected to pay are unknown. It is possible that some of Strawberry Reservoir's construction costs (approximately $500 million) could be transferred for payment to M&I users. While Section 211 in the CUPCA was written to protect the state from additional CUP costs, it is debatable whether it will actually do that. Irrigation Water Could Be Supplied to Utah County Only. The cost of this alternative is estimated at $163 million. This alternative is impacted by the same issues as the irrigation alternative to southern Utah County and eastern Juab County. Again, these issues are: (1) questionable purpose and need, (2) increased salinity in Utah Lake, (3) possible lack of SWUA participation, and (4) unknown irrigation to M&I conversion costs. Because these issues were discussed above, we will not discuss them further here. M&I Water Could Be Supplied to Salt Lake County. The cost of this alternative was estimated by the district in 1995 to range between $14 and $230 million depending on the delivery alternative selected. It should be noted that this cost is for construction of the delivery system only. Other costs (approximately $500 million) could also be realized as discussed below. Code constraints, unknown costs, and limited water availability are three issues which must be considered under this alternative. Code Constraints - It appears that CUPCA does not authorize any money for a feature to carry water into Salt Lake County. According to the district's general manager, the CUPCA statute was deliberately written this way to fulfill the commitment to deliver water south. Thus, any feature needed to deliver M&I water to Salt Lake County would appear to require a change in the federal CUPCA statute. While CUPCA appears to preclude any new features to move water to Salt Lake County, it may not preclude moving water into Salt Lake County by trading water shares with other water users. Cost Issues - The financial risk of an M&I conversion is unclear. Currently this project is defined as an irrigation project. Irrigation projects are heavily subsidized by the federal government. M&I 69  Upon conversion from irrigation to M&I, the costs local users might be expected to pay are unknown.  Strawberry Reservoir costs (approximately $500 million) could be transferred to M&I users for payment.   projects, on the other hand, are paid for in full by the M&I users. DOI management has indicated that if the SFN irrigation water is converted to M&I use, then the M&I users could be required to repay as much as an additional $500 million to the federal government. Whether or not this is the case depends on the protection that CUPCA Section 211 actually provides. However, if the federal CUPCA statute is changed to authorize an M&I project, Section 211 and any protection it offers may be lost. Because of the Jordanelle exchange, approximately 35,000 to 43,000 acre-feet can be delivered to Salt Lake County as opposed to 84,300 to southern Utah and eastern Juab Counties.  Water Availability - Approximately 35,000 to 43,000 acre-feet could be available for delivery to Salt Lake County for M&I water. This acre-footage is made up of 14,700 acre-feet of Bonneville Unit water with the remainder coming from conversion of the district's water rights in Utah Lake. (The district owns water rights which yield approximately 50,000 acre-feet of water a year). The acre-footage which could be delivered to Salt Lake County is less than could be delivered to southern Utah County and eastern Juab County (84,300 acre-feet of water). This reduced acre-footage to Salt Lake County is because of the required Jordanelle exchange. (See Appendix A for information about the Jordanelle exchange.) As can be seen, the analysis of these alternatives is not going to be easy. While demographic and economic indicators may support one alternative, other issues coupled with that option may negatively impact the alternative. We do believe, however, that an open, independent analysis of the alternatives and their surrounding issues will result in a decision that is best for the state as a whole. Recommendations: 1. We recommend that the Legislature review the district's board makeup and length of service and consider making a statutory change to board composition to improve representation of overall state interests. 2. We recommend that the Legislature form a task force or study committee to re-analyze former SFN project water allocations. This task force or study committee should recommend a water allocation position that the Legislature could consider adopting.  70   Appendices  71   This Page Left Blank Intentionally  72   Appendix A The Jordanelle Exchange The Jordanelle Exchange must be made if the Jordanelle Reservoir is to meet future contractual water deliveries. The Jordanelle Reservoir was constructed, in part, to supply M&I water to Salt Lake County. In fact, the district has a contractual obligation to deliver 70,000 acre-feet of M&I water from the Jordanelle Reservoir to Salt Lake County by 2002. The Jordanelle Reservoir obtains its storage water by withholding water which would normally flow down the Provo River and into Utah Lake. However, all the water in the Provo River is committed to various water users. In addition, a 1987 environmental decision stated that Utah Lake must be maintained at a minimum level. Thus, in order for the Salt Lake County contractual obligation of 70,000 acre-feet a year to be met, the Jordanelle Reservoir must maintain a certain minimum Provo River flow and the Utah Lake must be maintained at a certain minimum level. The process which will allow the Jordanelle Reservoir to meet the contractual obligations is called the Jordanelle Exchange. The key to the Jordanelle Exchange rests with the Strawberry Reservoir and the Diamond Fork System. Essentially, water from the Strawberry Reservoir will be transported through the Diamond Fork System to Utah Lake as a replacement for water being withheld in Jordanelle Reservoir. If this water is not replaced in Utah Lake, then the Salt Lake contract cannot be honored. Under the former SFN system, most of the Utah Lake replacement water was coming in the form of drainage from the 73,100 acre-feet of irrigation water supplied to southern Utah and eastern Juab counties. Only a small amount of water was going to be delivered directly to Utah Lake through the Diamond Fork System. If the irrigation portion of this project is not done, then 86,100 acre-feet of water will have to be delivered directly through the Diamond Fork System to maintain Utah Lake's minimum level.  73   Appendix B CUWCD Tax Revenue Comparison (millions) Total Tax Year 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 Reduction  Original Taxing Plan  19.9 20.4 21.1 22.9  24 25.1 26.3 27.5 28.7 30.1 30.5 32.9 34.5 36.1 37.8 39.5 41.4  District Proposed Tax Plan Reduction from Original  19.9 20.4 21.1 21.8 22.5 23.2 0 0 0 1.1 1.5 1.9  24 24.7 21.6 2.3 2.7 7.2  15 15.7 16.5 17.2 15.8 16.5 17.3 18.1 15 15.7 16.5 17.2 20.3 21.2 22.2 23.3 168.1  Auditor Proposed Tax Plan Reduction from Original  16.4 16.9 17.4 18.9 19.8 20.7 21.7 22.7 23.7 22.6 23.6 24.7 14.7 15.3 16.1 16.8 17.6 3.5 3.6 3.7 4 4.2 4.4 4.6 4.8 5 7.5 7.9 8.2 19.8 20.7 21.7 22.7 23.8 170.1  Note: Reductions are based on the most current revenue and expenditure data provided by CUWCD and its bonding consultants.

The district plan maintains higher fund balances and greater flexibility as more funding is available in the earlier years. The auditor plan maintains fund balances sufficient for the district's needs (twice as high as the state's rainy day fund balance) and, in doing so, requires the district maintain discipline in its cost control measures.  74   Agency Response  75   TABLE OF CONTENTS Chapter I Introduction ............................................ 4 Chapter II District Financial Management ................................ 6 CUP Funding History .................................... 6 Federal Debt Pre-payment Created Major Savings .............. 8 CUPCA Cash Management ............................... 9 CUPCA Cash Reserves Have Grown ...................... 15 Tax Rate Not Based on Need ............................ 15 The General Fund Balances Lack Purpose and Appear Excessive .. 18 The Increasing Fund Balance Lacks Purpose ................. 19 The District's Fund Balance Appears Excessive ............... 19 The District's Expenditures Don't Justify Future Tax Rate ........ 19 Statute Governing Fund Balances Needs Review .............. 19 The 1989 Budget Recommendations ....................... 20 Recommendations ..................................... 23 Chapter III District Policies and Procedures .............................. 25 Board Members' Independent Business Activities Do Not Violate State Law ........................................... 25 District Payments to Board Chairman ................. 27 The District Contract with Juab County Pays Board Member For Work Related to the District. .................... 32 Work performed by a Board Member's Company Creates a Questionable Appearance ......................... 34 The General Manager's Bonus Agreement . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 36 The District's Control of Expenditures . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 39 Vehicle Expenses . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 41 Procurement Practices . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 42 Chapter IV Discontinuation of SFN Project Affords Opportunity to Redirect Efforts Current Board Selection Process Protects Interests of all Utahns ...

This document is the response from the District which has been unanimously approved by the District's Board of Directors. The Audit's Criticisms of the District are Unfounded The Audit suggests three fundamental criticisms of the District. The District's financial plan will save taxpayer's $117 million.  The Auditor claims; First, the District's financial management can be more consistent. The District responds as follows:  The District's financial plan has been dictated by Governor Leavitt's 1993 CUP Cost Sharing Task Force and the CUP Cost Sharing Agreement with Department of the Interior. The District's financial plan will save taxpayer's $117 million. Implementation of the Auditor's financial recommendations could cost Utah the federal contribution towards completing CUP. The District is maximizing its financial capabilities to enable it to pay the local cost sharing for CUP without a tax increase.  Implementation of the Auditor's financial recommendations would cost Utah the 65% federal contribution towards completing CUP.  C C  C  In accusing Board leadership of code violations, the Auditor chooses to ignore the Utah Public Officers' and Employees' Ethics Act,  Second, District policies and procedures lack sufficiency and enforcement. The District responds as follows:  After the 1989 and 1993 Audits, the District revised its policies and procedures to address audit criticisms. Human Resource and procurement policies have been strengthened.  2     The District takes strong exception to the Auditor's statement that policies and procedures appear to be overridden by management with the knowledge of the board. In accusing Board leadership of code violations, the Auditor chooses to ignore the Utah Public Officers' and Employees' Ethics Act, Utah Code Ann. 67-16-1 et. seq. (1969), 67-16-2 of the Act explains its purpose. It reads: For the purpose of establishing a standard of acceptable conduct for all state officers, employees and those of all political subdivision of the state where there are actual or potential conflicts of interest between their public duties and their private interests. . . It does not intend to deny any public officer or employee the opportunities available to all other citizens of the state to acquire private economic or other interests so long as this does not interfere with his full and faithful discharge of his public duties.   Board member involvement with other water districts is reviewed by legal counsel to insure compliance with federal and state law and District  Every water district board in the state (including the State Board of Water Resources) has board members who are also affiliated with local water users or districts which according to the Auditor creates an ""indirect"" conflict of interest.    Board member involvement with other water districts is reviewed by legal counsel to insure compliance with federal and state law and District policy. Every water district board in the state (including the State Board of Water Resources) has board members who are also affiliated with local water users or districts which according to the Auditor creates an ""indirect"" conflict of interest.    Third, in addition to these managerial issues, the discontinuation of the SFN system affords an opportunity to analyze the District's water efforts. The District responds as follows:  The Auditor advocates delivery of SFN water to Salt Lake County as an alternative to the Bear River Project. By making this recommendation, the Auditors have substantially expanded the original scope of the audit to advocate sweeping changes in the existing federal and state water policies affecting regional water allocations. The District is required by federal law to build a system to deliver SFN water to the Utah and Juab counties (Utah Lake Drainage Basin) . 3     Elimination of the irrigation features of CUP may cost local taxpayers $575 million in reallocated federal costs.    The State Water Engineer requires that SFN water be deposited into Utah Lake so that water from Jordanelle Reservoir can be delivered to Salt Lake county. Elimination of the irrigation features of CUP may cost local taxpayers $525 million in reallocated federal costs.    4   Chapter I Introduction the Auditor has overlooked the significance of one key factor; the CUP is a federal water project.  The Audit is basically correct about most of the history of the Central Utah Project (""CUP""); however, the Auditor has overlooked the significance of one key factor; the CUP is a federal water project.    The facilities are owned by the federal government. The project's water rights are in the name of the federal government. The Bonneville Unit trans-basin diversion of water was planned by the federal Bureau of Reclamation. From 1964 until 1993, the project was constructed by the federal government with money which came 100 percent from the federal Congress. The project is still governed predominantly by federal reclamation law and other environmental statutes.      no federal funds could be spent ""until the District enters into a binding agreement with the Secretary to be considered a `federal agency'  The Central Utah Project Completion Act In 1992, when Congress passed the billion dollar Central Utah Project Completion Act (Public Law 102-575), (""CUPCA"") to finish the CUP, it agreed to let Central Utah Water Conservancy District assume the role of the Bureau of Reclamation as construction manager to finish the CUP. CUPCA stipulated that no federal funds could be spent ""until the District enters into a binding agreement with the Secretary to be considered a `federal agency' for purposes of compliance with all Federal fish, wildlife, recreation, and environmental laws with respect to the use of such funds, and to comply with this Act."" The District and the federal government entered into three comprehensive written agreements which dictate to the District how to carry out its responsibilities under CUPCA. Should the District violate the terms of any of these agreements, federal funding for CUP would be lost. Many of the criticisms of the District in the audit are based upon actions which have been taken to comply with these federal laws and agreements. While this has been pointed out to the audit team, they have either not understood the complexity of these requirements or they have selectively chosen to minimize or ignore them. The report fails to fully explain the federal nature of the CUP and the limited role the CUWCD and its Board played prior to the enactment of CUPCA.  Many of the criticisms of the District in the audit are based upon actions which have been taken to comply with these federal laws and agreements.  5   The Audit recites factual statistical information borrowed largely from District and Bureau documents however, the Audit reveals a fundamental lack of understanding about how CUP works. For example, the Auditor incorrectly identified Glen Canyon dam and Flaming Gorge Reservoir as the first CUP dams built. In reality, these dams are not part of CUP at all but regulating reservoirs which supply water to the lower basin states of Arizona, California and Nevada. The audit states that it was initiated in response to a request by several legislators. ""In particular, these legislators were concerned that property tax payments for the CUP might not be the most equitable means of paying for water use"". Governor's Task Force on CUP Cost Sharing the District's tax policy is based upon the recommendations of Governor Leavitt's 1993 Blue Ribbon Task Force for funding the state share of the CUP  The introduction fails to mention that the District's tax policy is based upon the recommendations of Governor Leavitt's 1993 Blue Ribbon Task Force for funding the state share of the CUP which included many distinguished members of the legislature and the public. The draft audit omitted this critical part of the history relating to the District's 1993 approach to the Legislature for an increase in taxing rate in order to provide the local cost share required by the Central Utah Project Completion Act of 1992 (""CUPCA""). The recommendations of the Task Force were presented to the Auditor during the audit as the policy direction upon which the Boards' taxing rate was based but it was not mentioned anywhere in the original draft. The District has summarized the findings of the1993 task force in its Chapter II responses. The Auditor's objectives for the current audit are summarized in the following tables: Auditor's Objectives 1. Determine if the District's financial management is sound. 2. Determine if the District's administrative controls are adequate and functioning well. District's Response 1. Agree and support. 2. Agree and support.  Rescoping provides an opportunity for new input into the Utah Lake Drainage Basin Water Delivery System.  3. Identify possible concerns surrounding the rescoping of the former SFN system.  3. Rescoping provides an opportunity for new input into the Utah Lake Drainage Basin Water Delivery System.  6   Auditor's Objectives 4. Determine if allegations concerning District employees have merit.  District's Response 4. Agree and support  Chapter II District Financial Management The Auditor claims that some of the decisions have cost federal and local taxpayers at least $11.1 million. The District strongly disputes this amount.  The Auditor claims that the financial management of the District is inconsistent. The Auditor claims that some of the decisions have cost federal and local taxpayers at least $11.1 million. The District strongly disputes this amount. This figure is based largely on the Auditor's speculative assumption that the District could have earned a higher interest rate on its CUPCA account balances. Because of limitations in the contractual agreements with the federal government concerning account management, the District disputes that it could have earned the amount suggested by the Auditor. It is somewhat academic that the Auditor's interpretation of the federal agreements would allow the District to invest in the State Pool since the federal government's interpretation is to the contrary. However, it is clear that the centerpiece of the District's financial management decisions, the federal debt prepayment, has saved the local taxpayers many times this amount. Each item raised by the Auditor will be discussed in our response. CUP Funding History  Prior to 1992, the federal government funded 100 percent of CUP  When CUPCA was passed in 1992, the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation (""Bureau"") was replaced by the District as construction agent for the CUP. With this responsibility came the requirement for the District to fund between 35 and 50 percent of the various unfinished features of the project. Prior to 1992, the federal government funded 100 percent of CUP. The District was able to use its property tax revenues collected into the general fund each year to pay operating costs and transfer the remainder into its capital account for the construction of much needed water treatment plants, pipelines, canals and other infrastructure needs within the District's service area. The District's tax levy was set by the Board of Directors at levels based upon annual operating needs and planned capital projects. The Department of the Interior (""DOI"") informed the District that as a component of the cost sharing agreement with the U.S. government, the District 7   must demonstrate that it had the present financial ability to fully fund all of the project's local cost sharing requirements for the entire project. Based upon Bureau of Reclamation estimates, the local cost sharing requirement exceeded $321 million. The District did not have that financial ability, so the District approached the Governor and the 1993 General Session of the legislature requesting an increase in its authorized rate of 0.0004 . the Cost Sharing Agreement provided that the District must show its cost sharing capability on a project feature by project feature basis  Through a series of negotiations with DOI, the District and the Governor were able to persuade the federal government to abandon the requirement for the District to demonstrate it could raise the local funds for the entire project. Instead, the Cost Sharing Agreement provided that the District must show its cost sharing capability on a project feature by project feature basis after several years of planning and environmental compliance work. With this change of DOI policy, the immediate need for a tax rate increase was eliminated and the tax rate increase bill was pulled. After the 1993 General Session, a special task force was created by the Governor to develop a funding plan consistent with these federal requirements. Members of the CUP Funding Task Force included; Governor Michael O. Leavitt Speaker Glen Brown Representative Christine Fox Representative Tim Moran Senator Howard Stephenson Senator Eldon A. Money Senator Craig Peterson Dr. Kelly Mathews, Chief Economist, First Security Corporation D. Kent Michie, Vice President, Smith Capital Markets Dallin W. Jensen, Water Attorney, Parsons, Behle and Latimer Pamela Hendrickson, Sevier County Assessor Orval C. Harrison, former legislator Don Olsen, Senior Vice President, Huntsman Chemical Corporation James Barker, Staff Director and General Counsel, Senator Robert Bennett Chuck Peterson, former Senator Ted Stewart, Executive Director, Department of Natural Resources Larry Anderson, Director, Division of Water Resources Following numerous public meetings and months of analysis, the task force recommended to the Governor and the Legislature that the District pursue several creative financing alternatives which had been presented at its hearings. In addition, the Task Force recommended that the District should, to the 8  After the 1993 General Session, a special task force was created by the Governor to develop a funding plan consistent with these federal requirements  Central to this was a recommendation that the District proceed immediately to raise its tax levy to maximum statutory rate and to maintain that maximum rate as the principal funding source of cost sharing funds through the CUP construction period   maximum extent possible, develop a plan to self fund the local share contribution year by year. Central to this was a recommendation that the District proceed immediately to raise its tax levy to maximum statutory rate and to maintain that maximum rate as the principal funding source of cost sharing funds through the CUP construction period. The Task Force recommended that the District spend its then current capital reserves to cover the immediate costs of the newly authorized project feasibility studies. The Task Force further recommended that the District borrow from the State Board of Water Resources revolving fund to the extent its annual tax revenues were not sufficient to meet its non-CUPCA capital projects needs. The District did indeed borrow from the Board of Water Resources for the projects which the capital reserves had been dedicated. The District was to levy its maximum tax rate of 0.004, build up reserves for the future cost share requirements, while the demands of construction were not yet activated, then bond for the unfunded balance when needed. Even with the implementation of these recommendations, the task force determined that additional revenue would be needed to fully fund the completion of the CUP and that by 1997, the District would have to approach the legislature for additional revenue such as a surcharge on project water or an increase in property tax. After the task force made its recommendations, the District used its capital reserves to fund feasibility studies and the District, applied for and received funding for the reserved capital projects which have now been completed. The savings generated by the federal debt prepayment plan and the accumulation of cash reserves have provided the District with the additional bonding capability needed for the local cost share  Prior to the 1998 and 1999 legislative sessions, the District was able to inform the Governor and the Legislature that the anticipated future reliance upon either State General Fund revenues or a property tax rate increase would not be necessary to complete the remaining features of the project. This important goal was accomplished not only through creative but prudent financial planning but by reducing the cost of several project features below what the Bureau of Reclamation had planned. The balances being generated in the general fund are to be transferred each year to fund the next year's cost sharing reserve requirement. If, when construction is fully underway, the 0.0004 rate does not produce sufficient revenue to provide the local cost sharing required, the District will be able to bond because of the federal debt prepayment plan. Federal Debt Pre-payment Created Major Savings The District's General Manager and Washington, D.C. based attorney devised a creative financing plan to allow the District to prepay its debt to the 9  the District's federal debt prepayment plan will save the local taxpayers $117 million   federal government on a heavily discounted basis. The plan was approved by the Governor and taken to the Utah Congressional delegation for introduction. This prepayment decision will save $117 million. The present value of this savings is worth $25.5 million to the District taxpayers today. The Audit says ""this savings was made possible primarily because of the federal government's movement toward a balanced-budget which would create needed cash.""  Actually, the Clinton Administration opposed the plan in testimony before Congress and vetoed the legislation the first time it was passed. Ultimately, in 1996, the District enacted special Congressional legislation which required the Secretary of the Interior to accept the District's prepayment . The District in late 1998 and March 1999 issued revenue bonds and prepaid most of the federal debt. The federal debt prepayment plan is the integral component of the District's financial management planning has been recognized as a groundbreaking, innovative financial tool which is now being copied by other water districts around the West. Auditor's Comments The Auditor says that ""in 1992, federal government balanced-budget initiatives allowed CUWCD to prepay District-owed federal debt at a substantial discount"" District's Response The District developed this federal prepayment plan and in 1996 obtained special legislation from Congress to implement it. The $117 million savings generated by prepayment will enable the District to meet its local cost share requirement for the completion of the CUP without raising the District's tax rate. The District retains the ability to prepay additional debt and obtain further significant savings.  the District's debt prepayment plan is now being copied by other water districts around the west    .    The $117 million savings generated by prepayment combined with the accumulation of annual property taxes revenues will enable the District to meet its local cost share requirement for the completion of the CUP without raising the District's tax rate    .  10   CUPCA Cash Management To do as the Auditor suggests would jeopardize millions in federal funding for CUP  The Audit accuses the District of financial mismanagement by failing to earn an extra $3.7 million for federal and local taxpayers by investing CUPCA funds in the State Treasurer's Pool.  In fact, in 1993 the District sought permission from the Federal government to do so and was told it could not. On June 30, 1999, the District supplied the Auditor with a written letter from the Department of the Interior which reiterates this position. To do as the Auditor suggests would jeopardize millions in federal funding for CUP.     the District was given a policy directive in 1993 by the Governor's Blue Ribbon CUP Cost Sharing Task Force to maximize it's local tax revenues to pay the 35 % local cost sharing during construction of the project.  The Audit accuses the CUWCD Board of overtaxing Utahns $7.2 million for maintaining its statutory maximum property tax levy.  To avoid a tax increase, the District was given a policy directive in 1993 by the Governor's Blue Ribbon CUP Cost Sharing Task Force to maximize it's local tax revenues to pay the 35 % local cost sharing during construction of the project. The District's Board annually reviews the needs of the District to determine the appropriate tax rate. After CUP is completed, leftover taxes will be used to pay off debt.      The Auditor claims that the management of the CUPCA cash is poor and that it could have earned an additional $3.7 million for federal as well as local taxpayers had its funds been invested in the State Treasurer's Pool. Under CUPCA, the Congress appropriates to the District cash to fund the federally authorized work program each year. The District must match federally appropriated funds at the ratio for most of the projects on a 65% to 35% basis.  The federal cost sharing agreement between the District and the Department of the Interior requires that both the federal 65% and the local 35% contributions must be deposited in a federally chartered banking institution. Interest earned on the federal 65% will be credited to the federal government and not to the local taxpayers. The federal interest is recaptured by 11   a equal reduction in future federal funding. Future federal appropriations are indexed to adjust for inflation and then offset by any interest earned on the federal portion of the CUPCA account. The District has provided the Auditor with a letter from the CUP federal program director which supports the District's version of the facts and reiterates the federal position that the District cannot invest CUPCA funds in the State Treasurer's Pool or similar instrument.  Before the CUPCA account was established, the District asked the CUP federal program manager if it could utilize the State Treasurer's Pool as the CUPCA account. The answer was negative since the Treasurer's Pool is not a federally chartered bank account. The District has recently resubmitted the same request and the answer from the federal program director remains the same. It is somewhat academic that the Auditor's interpretation of the federal agreements would allow investment in the State Pool since the federal government's interpretation is to the contrary. The Audit quotes the CUP federal program director as indicating that the District has not attempted to obtain permission to invest in the State Treasurer's Pool. The District has provided the Auditor with a letter from the CUP federal program director which supports the District's version of the facts and reiterates the federal position that the District cannot invest CUPCA funds in the State Treasurer's Pool or similar instrument. See Exhibit ""A"". It was not anticipated that there would be a substantial accrual of funds in this account as it was contemplated that funds would be withdrawn throughout the year to pay for planning and construction of project features. Due principally to opposition to construction of certain features of the Diamond Fork System, construction approvals have lagged and on December 31, 1998, the CUPCA fund was up to $72.2 million. However, the District expects to receive Interior's approval to proceed with final construction of the Diamond Fork System within 90 days and the balance in the account will be substantially depleted as construction proceeds.  The District expects to receive Interior's approval to proceed with final construction of the Diamond Fork System within 90 days  12   Auditor's Comments 1. Pursuant to the cost share agreement, the CUPCA funds were deposited in a federally chartered bank and received an interest payment approximately 2% less than the rate paid by the State Treasures's pool for similar municipal investments.  District's Response 1. The District is prevented from depositing CUPCA funds into the Treasurer's pool by the terms of the cost sharing agreement with the federal government. In an effort to enhance interest revenues, the District has taken steps to invest all CUPCA funds and other funds at in rates consistent with both federal law and the State's Money Management Act. 2. The District's management has instituted a fund management system that enables reserve balances to earn a higher interest rate and satisfies the federal requirements. In addition to the change noted by the Auditor, effective May 1, 1999, the District's federally chartered bank will provide for an interest payment in the amount the Federal 90-day Treasury Bill rate. This will only be a temporary rate while the District explores additional investment opportunities consistent with State and Federal requirements.  The District's management has instituted a fund management system that enables reserve balances to earn a higher interest rate and satisfies the federal requirements.  2. The money slightly quarter  funds were transferred to a market account which paid a higher interest rate in the 2nd of 1999.  13   Auditor's Comments 65 percent of all interest earned is on the federal CUPCA funds and does not accrue to local taxpayers. This interest is used to offset future federal contributions.  District's Response  3. This decision cost the taxpayers 3. The District disagrees with the $3.7 million if the funds had been amount claimed by the Auditor. invested in the State Treasurer's pool for a similar period of time. 65 percent of all interest earned is on the federal CUPCA funds and does not accrue to local taxpayers. This interest is used to offset future federal contributions. The District intends to explore additional investment opportunities consistent with state and federal requirements.  the federal and local contributions had to be deposited in a federally chartered bank account in order to comply the cost sharing agreement  4. The District felt that it had no choice but to invest in the federal chartered bank checking accounts.  4. The District was told by Interior Department personnel in Washington, D.C. and Utah that because the majority of CUPCA funds came from Congressional appropriations, both the federal and local contributions had to be deposited in a federally chartered bank account in order to comply with the cost sharing agreement. The District's ability to invest pursuant to the State Money Management Act is subject to federal approval. The District will work to achieve the highest investment rates consistent with State and Federal requirements. The federal CUPCA program director has provided a letter stating that CUPCA funds cannot be invested in the State Treasurer's pool either directly or through a trust arrangement as suggested by the Audit. See Exhibit ""A"".  14   Auditor's Comments 5. The Auditor contacted the ""investment manager"" for the District's bank and claims that this bank officer indicated that ""the District had never approached him for possible options."" He further recommended that the District should invest in the State Pool because of its higher interest rate. This person also told the Auditor about a $20,000 high-yield checking account that would also earn interest at a higher rate. The revised Audit has reduced the amount that could have been earned from $4.4 million to $3.7 million to more closely track the rate.  District's Response 5. The Vice-President referred to by the Auditor is assigned to the Capital Markets group for the bank. At Capital Markets, this individual works with the State Treasurer's Pool and is a commissioned sales person deriving his income from the sale of investments. The District's bank stated that this individual has no authority to speak for the bank about regular banking matters. Additionally, he was not assigned any responsibility for the District's account. The bank further notes that this individual is not qualified to issue any opinion on whether the Federal CUPCA Agreement allows the District to invest in the State Treasurer's Pool. The bank has further indicated that the high-yield checking account recommended as a standard to judge the District's performance against is a banking product only available to individuals and is not available for either corporations or governmental entities like the District.  15   CUPCA Cash Reserves Have Grown Auditors Comments these CUPCA funds are likely to be expended or obligated within several months  District's Response The District agrees that the high CUPCA cash balances are attributed to construction delays on a variety of federally approved projects. When federal appropriations are received by the District for authorized projects, the federal money, plus the District's 35% local cost share, is deposited as required into this fund. As stated above, these CUPCA funds are likely to be expended or obligated within several months. The new investment practice mentioned above will however insure appropriate stewardship of the account until the authorized federal projects are constructed.  The Auditor has documented the increase in CUPCA cash reserves. The amount has grown from $14.5 million in 1993 to $86.1 million in 1998. The high CUPCA cash balances are attributed to construction delays.  Tax Rate Not Based on Need The District strongly disagrees with the Audit's assumptions with respect to future water infrastructure needs and the appropriate tax levy to meet them  The Audit claims that the District's annual tax revenues have exceeded expenditures resulting in high fund balances and that since 1995, the District has collected at least $7.2 million more in property taxes and water sales than necessary. The Audit suggests that if this trend continues, the District will have collected $81 million in unneeded funds by the year 2011. The District strongly disagrees with the Audit's assumptions with respect to future water infrastructure needs and the appropriate tax levy to meet them. As revealed in Chapter IV, the Audit adopts a biased posture against the need for water systems for irrigated agriculture. The Audit fails to acknowledge that the District's immediate plan to maintain collections near the existing statutory maximum rate is based upon the policy recommendations of Governor's CUP Funding Task Force which the Auditor now believes has somehow become ""obsolete"". Until the CUP is completed, the District's Board will review annually the needs for revenue and the appropriate tax levy. The Audit's projections of 16  Until the CUP is completed, the District's Board will review annually the needs for revenue and the appropriate tax levy   unneeded future revenues based upon speculation that the District will maintain a maximum tax levy beyond completion of CUP for decades into the future is both irresponsible and inflammatory. The amount of surplus funds maintained by the District is in full compliance with State law which allows for a fund balance equal to 100% of the District's annual tax revenue. The Auditor's recommendation that the Legislature change the law to reduce this amount would significantly impair the District's ability to raise local cost sharing monies required to construct needed water features throughout its ten county service area, particularly to finish the CUP and provide for other additional water infrastructure. Auditor's Comments 1. The District's general fund has increased from $8.2 million in 1995 to $11.6 in 1998. The Auditor stated that the District's accountant pointed out that the State law allows a general financial balance of up to 100% of the current year's property taxes without justification, UCA 17A-1-415(2). In 1998 this would allow $22.9 million, therefore no justification was needed. The Auditor also stated that the accountant also claimed that the increase was not based on need. District's Response 1. The District strongly disagrees that monies collected into the general fund are unnecessary. The District further disagrees with the Auditor's speculation that by 2011 the District will have unnecessarily collected $81 million. While the general fund balance is well within the limit allowed by law, the District has a clear financial policy that the Auditor was given and ignored. The Auditor also ignored in its original draft most of the history behind the current CUP funding plan. The District has acted consistent the Governors Task Force recommendations and with its financial plan and the amount of taxes levied has been appropriate and based on significant need.  17   Auditor's Comments The District has determined based on its experience that the year-end general fund balance should be approximately 25% of an annual tax collection  District's Response 2. The District disagrees with the Audit. The District does have a funding plan. It was reviewed with the Auditor and has been mentioned here again. The taxes being collected are consistent with CUP Funding Task Force recommendations. The District's cost sharing plan is based upon the needs identified through years of planning and feasibility studies. The timing of the end of the fiscal year has also made a difference in the amount of money needed in the general fund. A higher balance was needed when the District's fiscal year ended in December, immediately after collecting all of the tax revenue. The District has now switched to a June 30th fiscal yearend. The District unlike the state receives its funding in lump sum payment once a year from local property tax and from congressional appropriations. The District has recently reviewed its working capital needs to make sure that an appropriate amount is available in the general fund. The District finds that the amounts suggested of 8% or 16% are not adequate. The District has determined based on its experience that the year-end general fund balance should be approximately 25% of an annual tax collection. As a part of its year-end closing, any part of the general fund in excess of 25% will be transferred to approved projects.  2. The Auditor initially suggested that the appropriate amount for the general fund year-end balance is 8% of District expenditures or an amount of $2.2 million and then suggested that the difference between the ending balance of $11.6 million and their 8% ($2.2 million) is excessive and that taxes should be reduced by $9.4 million. The Auditor now recommends a 16% general fund balance and thus reduced his excessive tax claim to $7.2 million.  18   Auditor's Comments The large numbers created by the Auditors incorrectly assume that the District's Board will maintain its maximum allowable tax levy beyond completion of CUP  District's Response 3. The District disagrees. The amounts suggested by the Auditor as potential excess funds are pure fiction. The large numbers created by the Auditors incorrectly assume that the District's Board will maintain its maximum allowable tax levy beyond completion of CUP (see funding history above). In fact, as shown by the Audit, out of the last five years (1995-1999), the District has only once taxed at its maximum rate of .0004. Reserves for authorized CUPCA projects will be identified, as well as reserves for anticipated CUPCA cost share requirements. Each year the Board will take all of these factors into consideration and develop its budgets and set its tax rate as required by law. The District is following the example of the State on the I-15 project by paying for as much of the construction costs with cash and only bonding when cash reserves are not sufficient. In the event that anticipated CUPCA features are not approved for construction, the collected funds will then be utilized by the District to reduce bonded indebtedness further saving the taxpayers additional costs.  3. The Auditor states that the excess funding between 1995 and 1998 is a trend that will continue and that by 2011, the balance will be $81 million and that the tax rate of the District should be lowered by 21%. The revised audit reduction recommendation is now 17.5% instead of 21%.  The District is following the example of the State on the I-15 project by paying for as much of the construction costs with cash and only bonding when cash reserves are not sufficient. In the event that anticipated CUPCA features are not approved for construction, the collected funds will then be utilized by the District to reduce bonded indebtedness further saving the taxpayers additional costs.  The General Fund Balances Lack Purpose and Appear Excessive See the discussion for above.  19   The Increasing Fund Balance Lacks Purpose See the discussion for above. The District's Fund Balance Appears Excessive See the discussion for above. The District's Expenditures Don't Justify Future Tax Rate See the discussion for above. Statute Governing Fund Balances Needs Review Auditor's Comments By appropriately reserving cash while construction needs are minimal, savings will be generated by the elimination of unnecessary bonded debt when full funding cost sharing requirements are presented  District's Response 1. The District does and will continue to determine the appropriate justifiable general fund year end balance. It will function as a working capital fund. The District will continue to reserve for the local cost share requirement for project which obtain federal approval and which are likely to be federally approved. By appropriately reserving cash while construction needs are minimal, savings will be generated by the elimination of unnecessary bonded debt when full funding cost share requirements are presented. 2. The District is in compliance with the State's policy for general and capital reserve funds. When the total local cost share requirement is considered, the District policy for cash management is wise and prudent and will save the taxpayers of the District significant funds.  1. The District's board should perform an analysis to determine an appropriate and justifiable general fund balance level. From that fund balance level, the board should establish a tax rate which is sufficient for the District's anticipated budgeted expenditures and maintain a sufficient, but reasonable reserve for unanticipated expenditures.  The District is in compliance with the State's policy for general and capital reserve funds.  2. The Auditor is recommending a legislative review over the policy that governs general and capital reserve funds, suggesting that the Legislature may want more control over the District's expenditures and taxing polices.  20   The 1989 Budget Recommendations Auditor's Comments 1. The 1989 Audit recommended that the Board spend as much time as needed to verify the appropriateness of management requests. The 1993 Audit indicated that these recommendations were being complied with. The 1998 Audit indicated that Board members felt that this was being complied with. The District feels that it is in compliance with the 1989 recommendations  District's Response 1. Agree and support.  2. The 1989 Audit recommended improvements to the budgetary and financial processes. The Board was asked to establish the purpose and dollar limits for the various funds and to establish a separate capital projects fund. The 1993 Audit found that all recommendations related to this area were implemented. The 1998 Audit found that all but one of these recommendations were still being implemented, but didn't specify which recommendation was not being followed.  2. The District feels that it is in compliance with the 1989 recommendations. It has a purpose for each fund. The District's financial management practices have saved local taxpayers $117 million.  21   Auditor's Comments The District believes that this approach is sound because the services are clearly a CUPCA related expenditure and should be reported as such.  District's Response 3. The District has placed its Washington D. C. based attorney expense in the CUPCA account because it is directly related to CUPCA activities. The Washington, D.C. counsel has worked with the Congressional delegation to achieve the highest level of federal appropriations annually. The costs for these professional services are funded principally from these appropriations. The District believes that this approach is sound because the services are clearly a CUPCA related expenditure and should be reported as such. 4. The District has adopted a practice of identifying the travel expenses in three main areas of operation: Director Expense, Staff Expense and Staff Training. The District's board and management find that planning and budgeting needs of the District require this additional detail. Total travel expenses are readily available, just as other common expenses shared by each division. 5. Agree and support.  3. The 1989 Audit recommended that a single line item be prepared to identify lobbying expenses. The 1993 found two accounts, one for federal activity and one for state activity. The 1998 Audit found that the District's Washington DC lobbying account is now included in the CUPCA budget under CUWCD Direct Expense. The other information was there, but not in one account.  Total travel expenses are readily available, just as other common expenses shared by each division.  4. The 1989 Audit found no line item for travel, but did find that travel expenses were dispersed throughout the budget. The 1993 Audit found that this recommendation had been followed. The 1998 Audit found that three accounts were now used to track travel expenses. The Auditor was concerned that it may be difficult to see what the total costs of travel expenses were. 5. The 1989 Audit recommended that sufficient information be made available to the Board to justify the respective budget amounts. The 1993 Audit found that this had been implemented. The 1998 Audit found that Board members felt sufficient information was made available to justify proposed budget recommendations. 22   Auditor's Comments 6. The 1989 Audit recommended that the new budget requests be compared to the original budgeted amount for the prior year. The 1993 Audit reported this recommendation as implemented. The 1998 audit found this recommendation was still being followed . 7. The 1989 Audit found that few of the Districts funds had little explanation as to their purpose or how the money was to be spent. The 1993 Audit found most of the funds having a written policy. The 1998 audit found the existing reserve funds to have a defined purpose. 8. The 1989 Audit recommended that the Board establish a maximum amount for each Fund. The 1993 Audit found this recommendation implemented. The 1998 Audit also found reserve accounts having maximum dollar limits.  District's Response 6. Agree and support.  7. Agree and support.  8. Agree and support.  23   Recommendations Auditor's Comments The District has already increased its investment rate to the 90-day federal treasury rate  District's Response 1. The District has already increased its investment rate to the 90-day federal treasury rate, while exploring the ability to obtain a rate comparable to the State Pool rate. The District will take all necessary steps to invest all CUPCA funds and other funds at the highest rates consistent with both federal law and the State's Money management Act. 2. The District already has a policy that is consistent with the Auditor's recommendations. By taxing at its authorized rate the District is following the recommendation of the Governor's CUP Funding Task Force. Reserves for anticipated local cost share will continued to be budgeted for. The funding of the local cost share by saving cash now will save substantial interest costs if these have to be borrowed to match federal appropriations. Any reserves found to not be needed for capital projects will be used to reduce current debt of the project, creating additional savings for the tax payers of the District.  1. Recommend fund balances be invested where interest earnings are maximized at an acceptable risk level. The state pool is recommended as an example.  The District already has a policy that is consistent with the Auditor's recommendations  2. Recommend the Board establish an appropriate general fund balance and establish a tax rate to meet expenditures while avoiding unnecessary increases in the general fund balance.  24   Auditor's Comments The District's practice is consistent with federal accounting guidelines for the CUP.  District's Response 3. The District does itemize all of its lobbying expenses in its annual budget. The expenses of the Washington DC based attorney are included in the CUPCA account where those activities are directly related to CUPCA. His activities unrelated to CUPCA are included in the budget, but not under CUPCA. The District's practice is consistent with federal accounting guidelines for the CUP. 4. The District's staff have complied with Federal requirements and have successfully completed favorable audits each year.  3. Recommend the District itemize its Washington DC lobbyist expense in its annual budget.  The District's staff have complied with Federal requirements and have successfully completed favorable audits each year  4. Recommend the District consider adding position with incorporates specific financial management skills.  The District disagrees with the audit that it has excessive funds  .  5. Recommend that the legislature 5. The District disagrees with the review UCA 17A-1-415 to audit that it has excessive funds in its determine if changes are necessary to general fund. The District is in eliminate excess fund balances. compliance with state law and the recommendations of this Governor's CUP Funding Task Force.  25   Chapter III District Policies and Procedures The Auditor finds that the District's management has allowed lapses in administrative controls resulting in questionable administrative practices that either violated policy or indicate poor control. According to the Auditor, these include: 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. The District takes strong exception to each of these findings.  Board members benefitting from indirect District contracts, the evaluation and bonus compensation of the general manager, travel expenses in excess of necessary travel costs, inadequate vehicle fleet utilization, and the retention of services without competitive bidding.  After the 1989 and 1993 Audits, the District revised its policies and procedures to address audit criticisms. Human Resource and procurement policies have been strengthened. Notwithstanding this, the Auditor states that he is still concerned that policies and procedures appear to be overridden by management with the knowledge of the board. The District takes strong exception to each of these findings. Board Members' Independent Business Activities Do Not Violate State Law  State Ethics laws were not violated. The Ethics Act allows the pursuit of economic activity provided that public duties are not compromised and that full disclosure is made.  The Auditor chooses to ignore the Utah Public Officers' and Employees' Ethics Act, Utah Code Ann. 67-16-1 et. seq. (1969). 67-16-2 of the Act explains its purpose. It was adopted: For the purpose of establishing a standard of acceptable conduct for all state officers, employees and those of all political subdivision of the state where there are actual or potential conflicts of interest between their public duties and their private interests. . . It does not intend to deny any public officer or employee the opportunities available to all other citizens of the state to acquire private economic or other interests so long as this does not interfere with his full and faithful discharge of his public duties.1  1  Utah Code Ann. 67-16-2. 26   This Act embraces all public officers, employees, lay board members of all state agencies and political subdivisions.2 It has tightly defined standards of conduct and expressly prescribes the procedures necessary for disclosure of any actual or potential conflict of interest. Once disclosure has been made as required by 67-16-7, the public officer, employee or board member may continue to participate fully in his or her capacity and to pursue his or her business activities.3 Conflicts of interest are prohibited by the Act, and ""no public officer or public employee shall have personal investments in any business entity which will create a substantial conflict between his private interests and his public duties.""4 An intentional and knowing violation of the Act is a felony. In addition, the offending officer or employee may be dismissed and any contracts entered into may be rescinded or voided.5 The Auditor does not allege that these three board members violated the provisions of the Ethics Act. Instead, the Auditor relies on an obscure 1941 code provision containing no definition of what is impermissible conduct, in arriving at his subjective conclusion that the financial relationships were inappropriate.  It is important to note that the Auditor does not allege that any of these three board members has violated the provisions of this act. In fact, the Auditor fails to even cite the Act. Instead, the Auditor cites an obscure provision of the Water Conservancy Act,6 containing an oath of office each appointed director is required to take upon appointment to the board. The Conservancy District Act oath provides that a director: ""will support the Constitution of the United States and the state of Utah, will honestly, faithfully, and impartially perform the duties of his office, and will not be interested directly or indirectly in any contract entered into by the District.""7 This section was adopted in 1941. It does not define what conduct would rise to the level of an impermissible indirect interest in a contract of the District, and we have no interpretive case law from the Utah Supreme Court to guide us. Yet the Auditor relies on this very imprecise and subjective standard of conduct to label the business activities of these three board members as ""inappropriate,"" and states that ""such financial relationships are not allowed"" by law.  2 3 4 5 6 7  Utah Code Ann. 67-16-11. Utah Code Ann. 67-16-8. Utah Code Ann. 67-16-9. Utah Code Ann. 67-16-12, 67-16-14. Utah Code Ann. 17A-2-1402. Utah Code Ann. 17A-2-Utah 1410(1). 27   This characterization of these directors' business activities by the Auditor ignores the existence of the more recent and supervening Utah Public Officers' and Employees' Ethics Act , which permits ordinary business relationships to exist so long as they do not require or induce the officer or employee to (1) disclose controlled information gained by reason of his official position; (2) improperly disclose such information for his or other's private gain; (3) use his official position to secure special privileges; (4) accept employment that would impair his independence of judgment in the performance of his public duties; and (5) accept other employment that would interfere with the ethical performance of his public duties.8 None of these business activities would be prohibited under the Ethics Act. So long as the required disclosures are made if a conflict arises, no public officer or employee is prohibited from availing themselves of the ""opportunities available to all other citizens of the state to acquire private economic or other interests, so long as this does not interfere with his full and faithful discharge of his public duties.""9 None of the conduct condemned by the Auditor has interfered with the performance of any of these three directors' public duties, nor has the Auditor so alleged. There are also no allegations of fraud, self-dealing, or any other incidents of malfeasance or misfeasance in the performance of their public duties. All the Auditor has claimed is that when weighed against this vague and undefined standard of ""indirect interests in contracts"" contained in a 1941 code provision, that the conduct of these three board members looks bad. The District agrees that its board members should not engage in activities that create either direct or indirect conflicts of interest with the District. It has promoted this legal requirement through the adoption of this standard in its own policies. It is the District's position however, that none of the relationships complained of by the Auditor violate either state law or District policy. The Wasatch County Commission nominated this individual for appointment to the District's Board, and later hired him as an independent consultant to facilitate water development in the county.  District Payments to Board Chairman The District contracts with Wasatch County to coordinate and manage water-related issues in Wasatch County that are primarily connected with the Wasatch County Water Efficiency Project (""WCWEP""). Wasatch County in turn has contracted with the Wasatch County Special Service Area (""SSA"") which was created in 1992 to serve as the Wasatch County Representative providing the services being contracted for by the District. The primary duty of the SSA is to provide assistance to the District with WCWEP. Starting  8 9  Utah Code Ann. 67-16-4. Utah Code Ann. 67-16-2. 28   January 1, 1997, the SSA contracted with Royal Solutions, a limited liability company (""LLC""), owned by the District's board chairman, to provide consulting services in connection with water development in the county. There is no water district board anywhere in the state (including the State Board of Water Resources) where a significant number of board members are not also affiliated with local water users or districts in some fashion. According to our understanding of the Auditor's definition of ""indirect"" conflict, all of these people would be in violation of the state ethics law.  Auditor's Comments There is no water district board anywhere in the state where most board members are not also affiliated with local water users or districts. Under the Auditor's definition of ""indirect"" conflict all would be in violation of state ethics laws.  District's Response 1. The District disagrees with this finding of the Audit. The independent consulting agreement in question is sufficiently attenuated from the District to not violate either state law or District policy. No conflict is alleged by the Auditor to have existed and in fact none did. All parties involved had the common goal of constructing the WCWEP. Commencing in 1993, before its current Chairman was even on the board, the District began contracting on a year to year basis, initially with Wasatch County and later with the Wasatch County Special Service Area (""SSA"") and the county, to facilitate WCWEP. Additionally, the interim funds were used to provide a portion of the SSA's operating funds until the SSA was able to fund its own operations and expenditures. It was not until January 1, 1997 that Wasatch County contracted with the Chairman's limited liability company (""LLC"") to provide consulting services to the County. The LLC's primary responsibility was to facilitate the WCWEP. 29  1. The Auditor finds that this contract with the Chairman's company violates the indirect prohibition contained in both the state law and District policy mentioned above, and a provision in the contract between the District and the County.  The funding arrangements with Wasatch County began in 1993, before this director was even on the board. He did not enter into a contract with the county until 1997 to provide consulting services.   Auditor's Comments  District's Response Some of the interim operating funds provided to the SSA by the District and Wasatch County were used to pay the salary of its general manager, the fees of its legal counsel, expenses of its governing board, and the consulting fees of the LLC. All of the LLC's invoices were reviewed by the general manager of the SSA, LeeRoy Farrell, and/or by the chairman of the county commission before payment. Wasatch County received fair value in services for its payments to the LLC. Although the opportunity for conflicts existed, the consulting agreement expressly provides that: Consultant is required to disclose any outside activities or interests that conflict with the best interests of the County. Prompt disclosure is required under this paragraph if the activity or interest is related, directly or indirectly, to any activity that Consultant may be involved with on behalf of the County. Consultant agrees to comply with the Utah Public Officers and Employees Ethics Act . . . including any necessary disclosures as required by the Act. Consultant agrees that if a potential or real conflict of interest arises, that he will take necessary action to eliminate the conflict including disclosure or recusal.  30   Auditor's Comments The Director received the advice of District legal counsel before accepting the employment to insure compliance with state and federal laws. The reality is that no conflict existed as all concerned had the common goal of constructing WCWEP.  District's Response Since the Wasatch County Commission nominated the Chairman for the District's Board, they had knowledge of his ""potential conflict"" and still decided to retain his consulting services to provide the work product contracted for by the District. The Chairman requested advice from the District's legal counsel before entering into the consulting agreement with the SSA. He was reminded of his oath of office, advised of the disclosure requirements of the Utah Public Officers and Employees Ethics Act, and of the necessity to make the required disclosure if a conflict arose requiring disclosure and/or to recuse himself where disclosure alone was not adequate. The Auditor has not pointed to any such conflict that arose during the period of the Audit. The reality is that no conflict existed as all concerned had the common goal of constructing the WCWEP. At most, the Auditor says the Chairman's various roles were confusing. No District funds were paid directly to the LLC. All District funds were paid to Wasatch County and/or the SSA. The SSA used these funds and those provided by Wasatch County to pay its operating expenses including the salaries of its employees and the fees of its consultants and advisors.  No District funds were paid directly to the director. The District's funds went to the County and/or SSA, who in turn paid its operating expenses, including consulting fees.  31   Auditor's Comments  District's Response The contract clause in the funding agreement that provides that ""no member of Congress"" etc., is to benefit was drawn from the federal agreements. Agreements are drafted by many different staff members of the District, and this clause has been included in some agreements and not others. The District believes it would be desirable to included this clause as a standard clause in all District funding agreements and will implement this change.  Although the Director's services and responsibilities at time overlapped, the Auditor makes no allegations of improper conduct, fraud, self-dealing, over billing or double billing. Instead, the Auditor says the Chairman's roles were confusing.  2. The Auditor finds that it is difficult to determine if the Chairman's activities are performed as a representative of the SSA or as a representative of the District's board.  2. Any work performed by the Chairman under Royal Solutions' consulting agreement with Wasatch County was performed in his capacity as a consultant and independent contractor. He has accounted for his time expended and has been compensated pursuant to his consulting agreement. At times his duties with the County as a consultant and the District as board chairman would overlap as certain meetings he attended were of benefit to both the District and to the County and/or the SSA. In those instances, he fairly and equitably divided his time and expenses between the two entities. There is nothing improper about what he did nor has the Auditor pointed out any instance where he over billed or double billed for his time and/or expenses.  32   Auditor's Comments 3. The Auditor finds that the District has not enforced contract requirements for expense documentation.  District's Response 3. The District did require the submittal of documentation, although some payments were made in advance of receiving such documentation, due to the financial needs of the SSA and critical stage of the NEPA review and scoping of the WCWEP. The District will tighten its procedures to insure this does not happen in the future. 4. The District amended the funding arrangement at the request of Wasatch County, and changed the manner in which it advanced funds to the SSA to a flat monthly payment of $6,250. At that point, the 50% match from the county was eliminated and the District's funding commitment was independent from the funding commitment of Wasatch County. The District has no reluctance to enforce its agreement but no breach occurred requiring enforcement. The fact that its Chairman has an independent consulting agreement with Wasatch County has played no role whatsoever in the District's relationship with the SSA or Wasatch County. 5. The District has no knowledge of any concerns the SSA's outside financial auditors may have had.  4. The Auditor finds that the District did not enforce the contract requirement for a 50% cost share between the District and Wasatch County.  The board member was employed as general manager of the local water District many months after the District's funding agreement was entered into. Legal counsel reviewed the arrangement and advised him of the necessity of avoiding conflicts of interest and to make disclosure if a conflict arose in the future. No conflict exists because all had the common goal of completing the EJWEP. The board member's employment by EJCWCD is not the type of  5. WCSSA's own financial auditors have noted potential control issues within WCSSA.  The District Contract with Juab County Pays Board Member For Work Related to the District. Pursuant to a petition from residents of Juab County, the District Court has recently created the East Juab County Water Conservancy 33   District (""EJCWCD"") to develop water for eastern Juab County. The project is known as the East Juab Water Efficiency Project (""EJWEP""). The District has entered into a contract with the EJCWCD to provide planning services for water to be allocated to eastern Juab County. The Board of the EJCWCD has hired a part time general manager, who is a member of the District's Board. The part-time general manager worked for his local District for six months without pay and then started receiving a monthly payment of $1,000, for a total amount of $19,300. At the time of the Audit, the only source of revenue for the East Juab Water Conservancy District was its contract with the District. The legislative freeze on property tax prevented the newly formed District from levying taxes in 1998. In 1999, the District will be able to have independent revenue. Auditor's Comments The Auditor notes that this arrangement violates both the state law and Board policy mentioned above. The Auditor also notes that this contract does not contain the same prohibition against Board members conflicts included in the contract with Wasatch County. District's Response The District disagrees with this Audit finding. Although the District did contract with EJCWCD to provide funding for the EJWEP, it did not make any payments to the board member, nor has the board member entered into a contract with District. The funds provided by the District were used by EJCWCD to pay the salaries of its employees and other operating expenses. Many months after the District entered into this agreement, EJCWCD hired the board member to work as its parttime general manager. He served as an employee for almost 6 months without any compensation at all, and was paid a monthly salary of $1,000 thereafter. Before accepting employment as the part time manager, the Board Member asked the District's legal counsel if this would be a prohibited conflict  34   Auditor's Comments  District's Response of interest. After review the District's counsel concluded that there was no prohibited conflict and similarly advised about the necessity of avoiding conflicts of interest and the need to disclose is any arise later. No actual conflict exists because the District and EJCWCD have a common goal of successfully completing the EJWEP. The board member's employment by EJCWCD is not a violation of state law or of District policy and is not the type of relationship state law seeks to prohibit.  Work performed by a Board Member's Company Creates a Questionable Appearance The construction contracts were entered into by two irrigation companies and were four steps removed from the District's rebate of property taxes to Sanpete County under 206.  The Auditor has identified a Board member whose company constructed a canal rehabilitation project that was paid in part with District funds. Together with Sanpete County (the ""County""), Sanpete County Water Conservancy District (the ""Sanpete District"") identified at least two local canal rehabilitation projects with two different canal companies. The County then applied for and received a federal CUPCA, Section 206, grant for a water conservation project from the District. The County then contracted with the Sanpete District to build the water conservation projects. The Sanpete District in conjunction with the two project sponsors, then requested bids for design build projects to rehabilitate the canals. The Board member's construction company teamed up with an engineering firm and submitted their proposal for each design build project in a sealed bid which contained notification of his District board membership. The engineering firm that joint ventured this project with the District director has also done engineering work for the District. Their bid was the low bid on each project, and the two canal companies each awarded the canal rehabilitation design build contracts to the bidding Board member's construction company. The combined contract amount was approximately $500,000. These projects were funded in part by a general grant transferred to the District from the federal government for 65% of the project. The balance was paid for by a rebate of ad valorem tax dollars 35   collected by the District from the residents of Sanpete County. Since all of the funds for the project were held by the District, both local tax and federal grant, the District reimbursed the Sanpete District pursuant to its contract with the County for costs incurred on these projects, who in turn then paid the contractors or the District directly paid contractor or subs on invoices approved for payment by the Sanpete District.  Auditor's Comments This contract was awarded through the competitive seal bid process which eliminates any suggestion of improper conduct or favoritism. The board member's construction company was the lowest responsive and responsible bidder. The Board member disclosed his board membership in his bid documents, as per advice of counsel.  District's Response Although the District has tried repeatedly to provide the Auditor with available information, the Audit still contain inaccuracies and incorrect statements. For example, in a design built contract, the engineers are part of bidding entity. Therefore, the District disagrees with the Audit's finding of ""the appearance of improper conduct"" comments. The Audit ignores that this construction contract was awarded through a sealed, competitive bidding process and that the board member's construction company was the successful low bidder. Prior to bidding, the Board member asked the District's counsel if bidding on these projects would violate District policy. The District's counsel advised that it was not a direct conflict and further recommended that notice of Board membership should be given with the bid, fully disclosing any indirect conflict possibility as required by the state ethics law. The District provided funding through the County and the Sanpete District to the canal  The Auditor finds that this type of contract with a board member's company creates the appearance of an improper quid pro quo arrangement.  36   Auditor's Comments  District's Response companies under the provisions of Section 206 of CUPCA for the construction of two water conservation projects. The Sanpete District served as the local sponsor and supervised the projects which involved the reconstruction of diversion facilities owned and operated by two mutual irrigation companies. The actual construction contracts were entered into by the two mutual irrigation companies and the general contractor. Neither the District, the County nor the Sanpete District were parties to the construction contracts. The contracts were between the canal companies and the contractor. The fact that this contract was awarded through the competitive seal bid process eliminates any suggestion of improper conduct or favoritism in the awarding of this contract or in the award of any future contract by the District to others. The board member's construction company was the lowest responsive and responsible bidder and therefore was awarded the contract. The consulting engineers involved in this project provide consulting services to many irrigation companies, municipalities, water districts and have also performed work for the District.  The General Manager's Bonus Agreement. The General Manager received a bonus agreement that provided $75,000 over a five year period, not $93,750 as mentioned by the original draft of the audit. The agreement was signed on April 1, 1998 and provided $18,750 as a 37   This agreement is clearly justified by the General Manager's performance as evidenced by the $117 million savings  retroactive bonus payment back to January 1, 1997, which is part of the five year $75,000 bonus. The agreement provides that the general manager will receive the balance of the $75,000 with a monthly payment of $1,250 per month starting April 15, 1998 and ending December 31, 2001. The District's Board believes that this agreement is clearly justified by the General Manager's performance as evidenced by the $25 million savings associated with the District's federal debt prepayment plan which was conceived and implemented by the General Manager and the District's Washington, D.C. counsel.  38   Auditor's Comments To characterize the bonus as other than Board approved is false. The Auditor finds that the bonus agreement is not linked to performance reviews and is outside of the District's own personnel system. The Auditor also questions whether the bonus agreement was authorized by the Board. The Auditor also criticizes the amount of the General Manager's compensation.  District's Response The District disagrees with the Auditor's findings. The Board discussed the General Manager's performance in various Board meetings in executive session as a personnel-related matter. The Board authorized the Chairman and Vice Chairman to enter into the current bonus agreement with the General Manager. To characterize the bonus as other than Board approved is false. The Board will continue to conduct formal annual evaluations of the General Manager, including the appropriateness of the current Bonus Agreement. An unsatisfactory performance could cancel or modify the current bonus agreement. When the total amount of the General Manager's compensation was established, the Board reviewed comparable districts on the Colorado River system for the compensation of their general managers. The amount selected by the Board Chairman and the Vice Chairman and approved by the Board is less than similar Colorado River water districts and has been included in each year's budget. The District will continue to evaluate the performance of the General Manager on a regularly scheduled annual review.  39   Auditor's Comments  District's Response The Auditor refused to include in his Audit the appropriate comparisons of compensation. The Auditor utilizes a state compensation standard against which the General Manager compensation appears excessive. Attached, as Exhibit B, is a table showing comparisons to the current salaries of comparable general manager positions. It should be noted that this information does not include bonuses, but most entities indicated that bonuses were also given to each general manager. This information indicates that the General Manager's compensation is less than his comparable positions and even with a $15,000 annual bonus, he is paid less than the Regional Director of the Bureau of Reclamation, his federal counterpart.  The District's Control of Expenditures. The Auditor alleges that the District does not exercise sufficient control over expenses. The District disagrees. Travel Expenses Auditor's Comments 1. The District does not seek lower travel options, and referred to the state's travel contract as a good example, claiming that the District could have saved $31,792.00 by using the State's office. District's Responses 1. The District was not aware of the availability of the state travel contract. All future air fares will be purchased through the State travel office, unless necessitated by emergency travel or unavailable from the state office. (Tickets at the state's rate are often unavailable.)  40   Auditor's Comments 2. The District does not pay air fare when lower than mileage reimbursement. The Audit identified a $625 difference in three years.  District's Responses 2. The District does require the lower reimbursement of air fare compared to mileage reimbursement. Additional direction has been given to staff to comply with the District's reimbursement policy. 3. The District does require lodging to be compensated pursuant to its existing policy. Additional direction has been given to staff to comply with the District's lodging reimbursement policy and to evaluate whether the current lodging policy is consistent with the now existing lodging market. 4. The District believes that its policy more accurately reflects the current costs of meals. Additional direction has been given to staff to make sure that reimbursement complies with the District's policy. Mixing and matching per diem with actual cost is not allowed for reimbursement. 5. The District did not pay for the General Manager's wife Crown Room membership. It would be against the policy of the District. The District did pay for the General Manager's Crown Room membership. His wife does not have a Crown Room membership. Evidence of this was provided to the Auditor.  3. The District's lodging charges often exceed policy limits. In three years these amounted to $2,260.  4. The District's meal reimbursement policy is liberal. Apparently the District has paid $324 more than per diem guidelines.  5. In the first Audit draft, the Auditor claimed that the District paid for a Crown Room membership for the General Manager's wife. When presented evidence that the Crown Room was not for his wife, but for the General Manager, the Auditor now complains that the District staff should not have paid for the General Manager's Crown Room membership based on the existing documentation.  41   Vehicle Expenses. Auditor's Comments 1. The General Manager drives a Ford Expedition. The Auditor recommended that the General Manager should drive a vehicle that cost $5,000 less. District's Response 1. The District disagrees. The District was aware that a number of general managers and local government officials are currently driving vehicles with 4-wheel drive, including Ford Expeditions. A 4wheel drive vehicle with expanded seating was selected to provide access to the District's construction projects which are located in mountainous terrain. The budget contained authorization and sufficient funds to purchase the General Manager's car and the District will benefit from the higher value when the Expedition is traded in or sold. The District will review its commuting policy and ensure that the appropriate IRS reporting requirements are implemented. 2. The employees who drove these vehicles were out with health related problems. One has retired and will be replaced. The other will return to work when his health permits. At that time both vehicles will be back in use. 3. See above. 4. See above.  2. The Auditor suggested that the District's vehicle fleet could be reduced by 2 sedans and 1 truck.  3. The District does not have a commute policy. 4. The District may be under reporting employee vehicle fringe benefits.  42   Procurement Practices. Auditor's Comments 1. The Auditor felt that the direction to an engineering firm to sub-out the completion of the FEIS to a specific firm for a specified $470,000 under a general contract in the amount of $22,000 was a procurement abuse. District's Response 1. When the District discontinued the SFN planning process, the FEIS portion of the Diamond Fork Project was impacted. The District needed to have this work completed in order to deliver water to Salt Lake County. With the complete concurrence of the CUPCA program director, an existing contract with an engineering firm was used for review purposes. This firm, subcontracted with another engineering firm that had completed the FEIS work on other CUPCA projects, to do the necessary FEIS work on the Diamond Fork project. The environmental information necessary for the FEIS had to be collected during the 1998 summer, and the District determined that this was the fastest way to get qualified engineers working on a time sensitive project. As required by procurement laws, engineers are selected first, based on their qualifications, and then the fee is negotiated to achieve a reasonable cost arrangement. This practice was followed in this case. The work was done timely, and the FEIS is now filed. 2. The District will review its selection of support services and in the future utilize an RFP process for selection.  2. The Auditor found that some support services (not construction) were procured without competition even though they were not emergency or sole source providers.  43   THIS PAGE INTENTIONALLY BLANK  44   Auditor's Recommendation. Auditor's Recommendations 1. Recommend the Board enforce state code and District policy prohibiting board members receiving direct or indirect benefits from District contracts. District's Response 1. The District agrees that its board members should not engage in activities that create direct or indirect conflicts of interest with the District. The District disagrees with the Audit that the activities noted in the Audit create a conflict prohibited by state law or District policy. 2. Concur. The Board has conducted an annual review of the General Manager's performance in closed executive sessions. It has not, however, reduced its discussions to a formal written performance evaluation. The full board does vote and approve of compensation for all employees, including the General Manager. 3. Concur. 4. Concur.  2. Recommend that the District board members conduct annual performance evaluation of the General Manager and that the full board vote on General Manager compensation.  3. Recommend the District utilize the state travel office. 4. Recommend that the District comply with lodging and meal reimbursement polices. 5. Recommend the District improve vehicle controls. 6. Recommend the District improve documentation for sole source procurement and implement competitive procurement process for support services.  5. Concur. Plan discussed above. 6. Concur. The District will utilize the RFP process where appropriate. In other areas, where more appropriate, a more formal sole source process will be utilized.  45   Chapter IV Discontinuation of SFN Project Affords Opportunity to Redirect Efforts The Auditor advocates delivery of irrigation water to Salt Lake County as an alternative to the Bear Bear River Project  This Chapter of the Audit echos attacks on the Central Utah Project which had heretofore been voiced only by opponents of the project. In doing so, the Auditor has substantially expanded the scope of this Audit beyond its originally announced purpose to review the financial management of the District and to insure that the District was in compliance with state law and procedure. Chapter IV reveals that the Auditor advocates sweeping changes in the existing State water policies affecting CUP regional water allocations. The Auditor suggests that irrigation water developed for delivery to southern Utah and Juab Counties should be reallocated to Salt Lake County as an alternative to the Bear River Project. The Auditor has minimized or excluded altogether federal and state law, federal cost reallocations and other important policy arguments which run counter this perspective.  The Auditor has minimized or excluded altogether federal and state law, federal cost reallocations and other important policy arguments which run counter this perspective.  The Audit suggests the water allocations of the SFN system should be reexamined by the Legislature to evaluate taking water from irrigation in south Utah and Juab Counties and deliver the water to Salt Lake County because of its population projections. The Auditor further suggests that the board members of the District could not make objective decisions with respect to this alternative because 67 percent of the board represents an irrigation perspective. The Auditor's claim that because a majority of board members were directly connected with the water industry, these board members interests may not necessarily represent the public interest. For example, the audit singles out the board member from Juab County for having served 35 years. The Auditor believes that longevity of service on the board can negatively impact Board members objectivity. Finally, the Auditor suggests that the Legislature should consider changing the makeup of the board to reflect a more urban perspective and that the Legislature should itself establish a task force to analyze the efficacy of redistributing the SFN water to Salt Lake County.  Current Board Selection Process Protects Interests of all Utahns  The current selection process established by the legislature for Board appointments to the Central Utah Water Conservancy District requires that a Board member obtain the approval of three independently elected public bodies.  46     First, the County Commission must nominate individuals to serve on the board. Second, the Governor proposes the appointment of the board member and third, the appointment must be confirmed by the Senate. The Board makeup insures that both urban and rural perspectives are heard. While a majority of the board comes from outside Utah and Salt Lake Counties, the board's decisions have not been driven by an urban versus rural split. In fact, in an overwhelming majority cases, board votes are unanimous. Recent history indicates that CUP board members have favored ""urban"" needs over rural ones. For example, the board's decision to prioritize the completion of Jordanelle reservoir to secure the Salt Lake County water supply was contrary to the recommendations of the Bureau of Reclamation which planned to use remaining federally authorized funds to begin construction of the irrigation and drainage system.    Recent history indicates that CUP board members have favored ""urban"" needs over rural ones    Board Experience With Local Water Users Is a Significant Benefit  Not surprisingly, County Commissions nominate individuals who are involved with the water users of their counties. Board members are nominated to advocate for the water needs of their areas. The water-related expertise of board members is a significant asset to the District in planning and constructing water features throughout the state. There is nothing more important and hard fought than western water rights and the local knowledge which board members possess provides important insights and assistance as the District works with local water users. It is because of this ""institutional knowledge"" that many board members have been reappointed by the Governor and confirmed by the Senate for several terms in office. The water expertise and tenure of service of the District's board members has proven to be a significant factor in the successes of building a water project which benefits the public. 47    There is nothing more important and hard fought than western water rights and the local knowledge which board members possess provides important insights as the District works with local water users.         48   Board Members Work Together To Benefit the Entire District  Board members take very seriously their duty to oversee the District's administration in an objective and sound manner. Further, with respect to the SFN preferred alternative, the board increased the M&I water supply from 1,590 acre feet to 11,200 acre feet for the cities in south Utah County. As the District begins public hearings on the Utah Lake Drainage project, the District board will maintain an objective and unbiased perspective of all alternatives. In selecting a new preferred alternative, the District's board will follow federal and state law as well as important policy considerations received during the scoping process.  As the District begins public hearings on the Utah Lake Drainage project, the District board will maintain an objective and unbiased perspective of all alternatives.      the District's board will follow federal and state law as well as important policy considerations received during the scoping process.  Legal and Policy Arguments Support Board Actions on SFN The Auditor's report that the District defends sending the water south with the ""political arguments"" that a commitment was made to do so and that doing so would encourage growth in these areas. The Auditors present a series of arguments which advocate the redistribution of SFN water to Salt Lake County, including their own financial analysis showing a favorable comparison of the costs of bringing SFN water to Salt Lake County in lieu of building the Bear River Project. From the earliest drafts the Auditor has revealed a bias in favor of a reallocation of SFN water to Salt Lake County as an alternative to defeat the Bear River Project. The board believes the Auditor's bias colors the audit's own objectivity. The Auditors have repeatedly excluded important factors which have guided the board's planning decisions (which are discussed below), crediting the board with making only two ""political"" arguments in support of these decisions. The Board of Directors strenuously disagrees with the conclusions and recommendations of this Chapter and offers the following background with respect to the District's work in planning a water delivery system. Federal Law Limits the Project to the Utah and Juab Counties The last paragraph of Section 202(B) of the CUPCA (Public Law 102575) says; 49  Federal law restricts the District to the ""construction of alternative features to deliver irrigation water to lands in the Utah Lake drainage basin,""   ""Provided, however, That in the event that construction is not initiated on the features provided for in subparagraph (A), $125,000,000 shall remain authorized pursuant to the provisions of this Act applicable to subparagraph (A) for the construction of alternative features to deliver irrigation water to lands in the Utah Lake drainage basin,"" Congress would have to pass a new law to re-authorize the use of this $125 million of federal money before additional project water could be delivered to Salt Lake County.  The District and its board are planning a water delivery system which complies with the limitations of this federal statute. The SFN DEIS did review the alternative of sending water to Salt Lake County and eliminated this alternative because it did not meet the project's purposes as determined by Congress. Congress would have to pass a new law to re-authorize the use of this $125 million of federal money before additional project water could be delivered to Salt Lake County. State Water Law Mandates the Return of Most SFN Water to Utah Lake The Bonneville Unit (of which the SFN system was to be a part) is an interconnected series of tunnels, pipelines and dams designed to work in coordinated fashion to develop municipal and industrial (M&I) water for Salt Lake and Utah Counties as well as supply supplemental irrigation water to Utah and Juab Counties. The heart of the M&I water system is Jordanelle Reservoir which captures high quality Provo River water which would otherwise flow into Utah Lake and diverts it through underground pipelines north through Utah County up into Salt Lake County. This water system is already complete. The Utah State Water Engineer has ruled however that the project must replace the Jordanelle water which is being prevented from reaching Utah Lake. A majority of the trans-basin diversion water coming from Strawberry Reservoir through Diamond Fork and into south Utah County will satisfy this requirement. The SFN project as well as whatever is designed to replace it, must provide enough return flow water into Utah Lake to replace the M&I water being delivered to Salt Lake and Utah Counties from Jordanelle reservoir.  According to the State Engineer, SFN irrigation water must flow into Utah Lake to replace the M&I water being delivered to Salt Lake County from Jordanelle reservoir.  The fundamental operation of the Bonneville Unit was explained to the Auditor and not until the final draft was recognition given to the requirement of the project to supply water to Utah Lake to secure the water in Jordanelle. Even though the Auditor attempts to explain the Jordanelle exchange (see Appendix A), the Audit contains a significant internal inconsistency which demonstrates the Auditor's failure to understand how the CUP works.  50   In short, the Auditor's recommendation would jeopardize full delivery of Salt Lake County's 70,000 acre feet of CUP water from Jordanelle.  Figure VIII from the Audit correctly shows the proposed total SFN irrigation water deliveries to be 73,100 acre-feet (42,000 for Juab and 31,100 for southern Utah County). Appendix A begins; ""The Jordanelle Exchange must be made if the Jordanelle Reservoir is to meet future contractual water deliveries...to Salt Lake County."" The last paragraph of Appendix A concludes; ""If the irrigation portion of this project is not done, then 86,100 acre-feet of water will have to be delivered directly through the Diamond Fork System to maintain Utah Lake's minimum level."" Since the Auditor acknowledges that the amount of water which must be delivered to Utah Lake exceeds the entire SFN irrigation supply, the District wonders where the Auditor suggests the District find enough water needed to replace the amount of SFN water diverted north. In short, the Auditor's recommendation would jeopardize full delivery of Salt Lake County's 70,000 acre feet of CUP water from Jordanelle. Repayment Considerations Currently, all costs allocated to irrigation above the irrigator's ability to repay, are repaid to the federal government from the sales of hydroelectricity generated at federal dams along the Colorado river. Under the terms of the Colorado River Storage Project Act of 1956, Utah is entitled to 21 percent of federal hydroelectric revenues to repay the construction costs of irrigation features of the CUP. When the CUP is completed, the General Accounting Office will conduct a cost allocation audit for the entire project. All project costs will be allocated to one of several categories. They are; irrigation, M&I, fish and wildlife, recreation, and flood control. Local taxpayers are obligated to repay only those costs allocated to M&I uses. These costs will be paid for by the District when it completes prepaying its federal repayment debt as part of its financial management/cost sharing plan (described above). The Audit appears to misunderstand what the suggested SFN re-allocation would cost Salt Lake County. By bringing that agricultural water north to Salt Lake and converting it to M&I water, Salt Lake County users would then have to assume all of the sunk federal costs which had been previously allocated to irrigation for repayment from Colorado River Storage Project power revenues. This could triple the current M&I rates being paid in Salt Lake County for CUP water at the present time. 51  If irrigation features are not completed, $575 million of sunk costs in the Strawberry Collection and Diamond Fork systems which have been allocated to irrigation may be reallocated to M&I water users in Salt Lake County   It must be clearly understood that if the water which is currently allocated to irrigation is reallocated to M&I uses in Salt Lake County (as suggested by the Auditor), not only will the federal government's authorized direct contribution of $125 million be unavailable (as explained above), $575 million of sunk costs in the Strawberry Collection and Diamond Fork systems which have been allocated to irrigation may be reallocated to M&I water users in Salt Lake County. Utah Lake Water Quality Issues The audit identified concerns which have been raised consistently by EPA and the Utah Division of Water Quality about the SFN project's possible impacts on salinity in Utah Lake. This is a complex issue. CUPCA provided $1 million for the District to conduct, with public involvement, a feasibility study to reduce the salinity of Utah Lake. While the proposed SFN system may have added salinity content from irrigation return flows into Utah Lake, the District is prepared to mitigate these impacts with several measures. One suggested by EPA is to deliver more fresh water directly from the trans-basin diversion through the Spanish Fork river into the Lake to dilute salinity. The diversion of SFN water north to Salt Lake County as suggested by the Auditor will itself have salinity concentration impacts on Utah Lake which would"

Government Passenger Transportation Handbook  June 7, 2000   FOREWARD This handbook sets forth regulations and procedures governing procurement, billing, and payment of passenger transportation services for the account of the United States Government. In accordance with Public Law 105-264, October 19, 1998, and the Travel and Transportation Reform Act of 1998, the U.S. Government travel charge card is the required method used by the Government to procure passenger transportation and related services from commercial transportation service providers (TSPs). However, the U.S. Government Transportation Request (GTR), Optional Form 1169 may only be used in certain travel situations. This guide replaces the 1994 edition entitled, ""GTRs How to Prepare and Process U.S. Government Transportation Requests."" It was developed in conjunction with the revision of 41 CFR 10141.2 (now 41 CFR 102-118) and the Federal Travel Regulations. It was developed to assist administrative and fiscal personnel who prepare and process travel documents as well as individual Government travelers. Careful application of the principles and instructions in this guide will result in greater efficiency in the procurement of transportation services for the Government, improved TSP services, and conservation of travel funds.

INTRODUCTION Passenger Transportation Services Furnished for the Account of the United States Government in accordance with 41 CFR 102-118.200(b) Selection of the method of transportation Federal Travel Regulation (FTR), 41 CFR 301-10.4 requires agencies to select the transportation most advantageous to the Government, when cost and other f considered. Under 5 U.S.C. 5733, travel must be by the most expeditious transportation practicable and commensurate with the nature and purpose of official method of actors are means of duties.  Methods of common TSP transportation an agency may authorize       Airline Train Ship Bus  Methods of procuring passenger transportation services The required method of payment for authorized official travel is the Government Travel Card. In accordance with Public Law 105-264, Section 2, Government Transportation Requests (GTRs) should only be used when a waiver has been granted (see Chapter 3). Cash should be used only to pay for those expenses which, as a general rule, cannot be charged in accordance with FTR, 301-51.100, 51.101, and 72.200. Such services, regardless of the procurement method specified by the agency, must be 1 procured directly from either a Travel Management Center (TMC) or a travel agent. A travel agent may be used only as prescribed in the FTR or applicable regulations of the Department of Defense (DOD). Government agencies should encourage travelers to use TMCs for all common TSP arrangements.  NOTE: Effective January 1, 2001, Government travelers are required to use TMCs selected by their agency.  1  For the purposes of this handbook the term ""Travel Management Center"" refers to both TMCs and Commercial Travel Offices (CTOs). 6   REQUIRED METHODS: (1) Government Contractor-issued Travel Card (GCTC) a. Individually billed b. Centrally billed account (2) Government Transportation Request (use only when waiver has been granted)  ALTERNATIVE METHODS:       Government contractor-issued travelers check Cash obtained from an advance Frequent traveler credits Personal funds, including cash or a personal charge card  Agency heads or their designees may specify which of these Government-provided methods of payment, or combination thereof, travelers will use to procure official passenger transportation services.  Use of Contract City-Pair Fares Contract City-Pair fares must always be used if such fares are available, except as stated in 41 CFR 301-10.107. NOTE: City-pair contractors are not required to accept payment other than by methods (1) and (2) above (41 CFR 301-51.1).  Restrictions    Issuing officers and travelers must adhere to the regulations requiring the use of U.S. flag TSPs, when available, for travel on official business. The Comptroller General of the United States prescribes guidelines (4 CFR 52) for the use of U.S. flag vessels and certificated U.S. flag air TSPs. Expenditures for service furnished by a foreign flag TSP generally will be allowed only when service by a U.S. flag certificated TSP is ""unavailable"". See Chapter 7 for details. It is the policy of the Government that lowest cost coach accommodations will be used for all modes of passenger transportation. Special train accommodations i.e., sleeping car, club car, reserved coach, and extra-fare trains, steam ship travel, and other than lowest cost air coach travel may only be used if authorized and approved due to special circumstances. See 41 CFR 301-10.4 and 301-72.1. 7     Mandatory Terms and Conditions governing the use of U. S. Government passenger transportation documents The U.S. Government will not be responsible for charges exceeding those applicable to the transportation or accommodations of the type, class, or character authorized in passenger transportation documents. The issuing official, by his signature, certifies that the requested transportation is for official business. TSP shall not honor requests showing erasures or alterations not validated by initials of the issuing official. TSP shall insert date on which travel commenced, if known. Interest shall accrue from the voucher payment date on overcharges made hereunder and shall be paid at the same rate in effect on that date as published by the Secretary of the Treasury pursuant to the Debt Collection Act of 1982. Government travel must be via the lowest cost available which meets travel requirements; e.g. Government contract fare, through, group, excursion, or reduced one-way or round-trip fare. This should be done by entering the term ""lowest coach"" on the U.S. Government travel document if the specific fare basis is not known. U.S. Government passenger transportation documents must be use as method of payment for all official travel expenses. U.S. Government passenger transportation documents should be in accordance with FTR Chapter 300 and 301, FMR 102-117 (40 CFR 102-117), and the ""U.S. Government Passenger Transportation"" handbook.

GOVERNMENT CONTRACTOR-ISSUED TRAVEL CARD (GCTC) On November 30, 1998, the United States Government implemented a new charge card program, which replaced the American Express travel card. This new program is called ""GSA SmartPay."" This new program issues Government Travel Cards (GTCs) as VISA or MasterCard cards. These Government contractor-issued travel cards (GCTC) when authorized should be used to the maximum extent possible for official travel expenses (41 CFR 301-51.100). GTCs are issued SmartPay logo in and ""For Official purchased using t with unique prefixes and account numbers. Each card displays the GSA the upper right corner and includes the phrases, ""United States of America"" Government Use Only CPP"" centered at the top. Official travel can be he Travel Card or the Integrated Card as shown below:  TRAVEL CARD  INTEGRATED CARD  For additional information on the SmartPay program visit the SmartPay website at: http://www.fss.gsa.gov/services/gsa-smartpay or contact the General Services Administration, Federal Supply Service, Services Acquisition Center (FCX), 1941 Jefferson Davis Highway, Arlington, VA 22202, (703) 305-6658.  9   CHAPTER 3. U.S. GOVERNMENT TRANSPORTATION REQUEST (GTR) When to Use Optional Form 1169 Optional Form 1169, U.S. Government Transportation Request (GTR) is used to procure passenger transportation services for the account of the United States only when an exemption has been granted by (see 41 CFR 301-51.100): General Services Administration Office of Governmentwide Policy Office of Transportation and Personal Property (MT) 1800 F Street, NW Washington, DC 20405 http://policyworks.gov/org/main/mt/homepage/mtt/trans/  Purpose of the GTR The GTR is designed to meet the requirements of the Government and the transportation industry and serves as:           Control - a standard accountable document. Certification - official travel only. Procurement authorization - listing of transportation services requested. Contract of carriage - between the Government and the TSP upon which it is drawn. Notice of conditions - governing the transaction. Billing support document - provides evidence of actual services furnished. Accounting and fiscal document - for obligation and liquidation of funds payable to TSPs. Audit document - records passenger transportation services requested and furnished.  10   Description The GTR is available in bound books of 10 sets. Each set consists of OF 1169 (Original) and OF 1169-A (Memorandum Copy) on punched card stock, or in 4-part carbon-interleaved snapout assemblies consisting of an original, memorandum card copy, and two paper copies, OF 1169-B (Duplicate) and OF 1169-C (Triplicate). Each form measures 7 3/8 by 3 1/4 inches. The optional form number, title, and color of each form are listed in figure 1:  BOOKS OF 10 SETS FORM NO.

Overprinting Deviations from the standard GTR forms are not permitted. However, when it is economical and advantageous to do so, an agency may order preprinted on its GTRs the name of the department, bureau, or office, and the complete address to which charges are to be billed. No other overprinting is permitted unless specifically approved in writing by the: Director, Audit Division (FBA) General Services Administration 1800 F Street NW Washington, DC 20405 To order overprinting on GTRs, the requesting agency may use commercial printing facilities or submit a printing requisition (GPO Form 1026-A) to the United States Government Printing Office.  12   Obtaining GTRs Government agencies and activities should order supplies of GTRs by submitting a requisition in FEDSTRIP/MILSTRIP format to the GSA, Federal Supply Service, General Products Commodity Center (7FXM-W S), 819 Taylor Street, Room 6A24, Fort W orth, TX 76102. Agencies may also use their Government Purchase Card or an Activity Address Code and order by telephone at 1(800) 488-3111 or online at http://www.gsaadvantage.gov. The National Stock Numbers for the OF 1169 sets are as follows: GTR, OF 1169 Ten two-part sets per book Four-part snapout NATIONAL STOCK NUMBERS 7540-00-634-4363 7540-00-985-7038  Distribution and use The individual GTR forms are distributed as follows:    OF 1169, the original GTR (blue) confirms the services or accommodation is given to the traveler for presentation to the ticket agent of the TSP. contains conditions and instructions for the contract of transportation; a services authorized; and the signature, which is the certification, of the issui OF 1169 is used as the document to support the TSP's bill for transportation  requested and The OF 1169 description of ng officer. The charges.    OF 1169-A, the memorandum copy (buff), and OF 1169-B and OF 1169-C, the duplicate and triplicate copies (white), are used for internal fiscal accounting purposes and are distributed as directed by the regulations of the user agency.  The GTR may be used for Government travel:       Via air, rail, or bus. Via inland water and ocean TSPs only if special circumstances justify. Between points within the U.S. and any other country. Between points outside the United States.  13   The GTR may be used to purchase:        Tickets and/or transportation for individual or group travel. Quantities of tickets or tokens under the bulk purchase plan. Tickets issued under blanket arrangements covering definite periods of time. Charter, contract, tender, or quotation services. Excess baggage service only.  Quantity (bulk) ticket purchases At the discretion of an agency head or his designee, an issuing officer may issue a single GTR, identified as ""Bulk Purchase"" (see figure 2, block 8) to procure quantities of transportation tickets, as well as tickets or tokens for intracity transportation involving local or short-haul transit service. These bulk purchases are restricted to the following situations:      A continuing substantial volume of individual travel via the same mode and class of transportation is required between one origin and one destination; and Each one-way single fare for such transportation does not exceed $250 for the round-trip, exclusive of Federal transportation tax; and Each group of tickets or tokens is to be used within any one 60-day period of a fiscal year.  Tickets so procured must be annotated: ""GOVERNMENT"" and ""NOT REDEEMABLE FOR CASH EXCEPT BY THE U.S. GOVERNMENT."" All stocks of tickets and tokens must be subjected to specific accountability controls.  Agency responsibility Each agency adopting the quantity-ticket-purchase method shall issue internal instructions clearly defining the particular circumstances and conditions under which transportation tickets may be purchased in quantity. Further, each agency shall establish specific accountability controls for stocks of tickets and tokens and for periodically reviewing its regulations to ensure maintenance of a reasonable and objective quantity purchase program.  Multiple ticket purchases under single (blanket) GTRs 14   Federal agencies must sign agreements with TMCs (see NOTE below) in order to use blanket GTRs. Under the provisions of these agreements, a blanket GTR is issued at the beginning of each calendar week or other payment period, mutually agreed upon by the agency and the TMC, to cover all tickets issued during the period, not to exceed one month. A listing must be maintained to show the number and value of each ticket issued under the blanket GTR, as well as other information essential to agency and TSP fiscal requirements. TMCs, being agents of the TSPs, must follow TSP ticket issuing and billing procedures (see Chapter 9). Completely unused tickets procured on a previously paid blanket GTR and all partially unused tickets shall be redeemed under the procedures utilizing SF 1170 (see Chapter 5). NOTE: GSA, National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), and DOD have entered into contracts with certain travel agencies for the issuance of TSP tickets for Government travel and for other transportation services. Travel agencies that have contracts with GSA (on behalf of all civilian Government agencies except NASA) and NASA are referred to as Travel Management Centers (TMCs), and those having contracts with DOD are referred to as Commercial Travel Offices (CTOs).  Prohibitions The GTR shall NOT be issued:        To procure individual passenger transportation services costing $10 or less, exclusive of transportation tax (unless justified by special circumstances). To procure air excess baggage service costing $15 or less for each leg of a trip (unless justified by special circumstances). To procure individual taxicab, airport limousine, intracity transit, rental vehicle, or other for-hire vehicle service. To pay for toll road or toll bridge charges. To obtain transportation services or privileges desired but not required for official business, including extra-fare trains or planes, stopovers, and indirect routings. The GTR shall be issued only for the portion of the transportation expenses properly chargeable to the Government. Charges for services other than those authorized must be borne by the traveler and collected from him/her by the TSP or TMC.  THE ISSUANCE OF A GTR AFTER A SERVICE HAS BEEN PERFORMED OR THE ISSUANCE OF A DUPLICATE GTR IS PROHIBITED.  15   Control and accountability Agencies shall maintain accountability records and physical control of GTR stock. Effective physical control should include storage of GTR stock in a locked container or locked storage room. Employees responsible for the issuance and use of GTR forms shall be held accountable for their disposition. Travelers or those who are accountable are responsible for the custody of TSP tickets and other transportation documents received in exchange for GTRs or other procuring instruments. Failure to safeguard such documents may result in personal liability; of the traveler or those who are accountable, if unauthorized persons use tickets or documents.  Lost or stolen GTRs The person that is accountable must report a lost or stolen GTR promptly, in writing, to the appropriate agency office. If the lost or stolen GTR shows the TSP or agent tendered to, service desired, and point of origin, then the named TSP or agent and other local TSPs must also be notified promptly in writing. A GTR reported as lost or stolen but subsequently recovered must not be used under any circumstances. The word ""CANCELLED"" should be marked on the face of the GTR and it should be forwarded immediately through the issuing office to the office maintaining accountability records.  Cancelled GTRs A GTR that is spoiled during preparation, cancelled, or prepared for issuance but not used should be marked ""CANCELLED"" across the face and forwarded at once through the issuing office to the office maintaining accountability records.  Disposing of obsolete, spoiled, cancelled, or unused GTRs Obsolete GTRs, as well as GTRs spoiled in preparation, cancelled, or otherwise unused, should be returned to the office in each agency that maintains accountability of those forms. The accountable office must provide a list of the GTR numbers which are obsolete, spoiled, cancelled, or otherwise unused to the GSA Federal Supply Service, General Products Commodity Center (7FXM-W S), 819 Taylor Street, Room 6A24, Fort W orth, TX. 76102. After the General Products Commodity Center has notified the sender that the GTR numbers have been received, the GTRs may be destroyed in accordance with applicable regulations. The National Archives and Records Administration provides instructions for the retention and disposal of GTRs in General Records Schedule 9 and 36 CFR 1228. These instructions can be viewed online under Resources at http://www.nara.gov/records/.  16   TSP validation of GTRs TSPs or their agents (TMCs) must:       Not honor a GTR that is incomplete, unsigned, or shows erasures or alterations that have not been initialed by the issuing officer. Require that the GTRs be completely filled out and properly signed by the issuing officer so as to be valid for presentation to obtain transportation services and/or accommodations. Require the person presenting a valid GTR to establish his identity as the traveler or the party authorized to receive the ticket, exchange order, refund slip, or other transportation document. In the absence of satisfactory identification, the TSP will not honor the GTR. Not accept the memorandum card copy (OF 1169-A) of the GTR in lieu of the original (OF 1169).  GTR identification on tickets and coupons TSPs shall stamp or endorse each coupon of the ticket, exchange order or other transportation document with the words ""U.S. GOVERNMENT"" and the serial number of the GTR authorizing the service. Each Government Excess Baggage Authorization/Ticket (GEBAT) shall show the GTR number, the complete name and address of the agency to which charges applicable to the excess baggage services shall be billed, and the name of the traveler, as shown on the authorizing GTR.  17   PREPARING THE GTR Issuing office responsibilities    A GTR must be completely and properly filled out and signed by the issuing officer because: a) TSPs or their agents will not honor a GTR which is incomplete, unsigned, or shows erasures or alterations that are not initialed by the issuing officer. b) An improperly executed GTR compromises an agency's ability to perform a technical audit of the paid GTR and pursue any overcharge claims on behalf of the Government. Entries other than signatures should be typed whenever possible or printed in ink. It is essential that the carbon impressions of entries be clear and easily readable on all copies.    A GTR must be prepared and given to the TSP/TMC in exchange for each ticket. If a blanket GTR is used to purchase multiple tickets issued during a designated payment period, the GTR must be given to the TSP/TMC prior to issuance of the first ticket. Since the GTR is both a procurement document and a contract document, issuing officers are prohibited from giving only a GTR number to the TSP/TMC in lieu of an actual GTR. The memorandum card copy (OF 1169-A) must be prepared simultaneously with the original (OF 1169) and must clearly show all information other than signatures that appear on the original at the time of surrender for service. Government travel must be via the lowest cost fare available, which meets travel requirements; e.g., Government contract fare, through, group, excursion, or reduced oneway or round-trip fare. The lowest cost fare available is the one for which the traveler meets all conditions. The issuing officer must assure that a request is conveyed to the TSP or its agent; for the lowest cost, fully refundable coach fare available, by entering the term ""lowest coach"" in ""CARRIER (TSP) AND CLASS OF SERVICE"" (block 12) on the GTR. If the specific fare basis is known, it should also be entered in the ""CARRIER (TSP) AND CLASS OF SERVICE"" block of the GTR.    18   Figure 2.

In these instances, the issuing officer or the traveler must cross-reference the original or memorandum card copy of each GTR, whichever is available, to the other by serial number; such as, ""In connection with GTR (insert serial number)"" (block 8).  30   Honoring of GTRs by bus driver (a) W hen a GTR is presented direct to a bus driver: (1) At a bus station not supplied with the proper ticket forms; (2) At a nonagent station or flag stop; or (3) At a station at which the ticket office is not open for the sale of tickets, the bus driver shall honor the GTR to destination or arrange for its exchange for a ticket at some intermediate point. (b) W hen the GTR is exchanged at an intermediate ticket office it must be endorsed on the back in ""SERVICE REOUIRED, Continued"" (block 8A) to show clearly that, transportation was furnished from the point of origin of travel, not from the intermediate point at which the GTR was exchanged for a ticket. The bus driver and the traveler normally will sign this endorsement.  Where to get help Question concerning preparation and processing of GTRs may be directed to GSA's Program Support & Business Division (FBC), Program Promotion & Education Branch, W ashington, DC at (703) 305-7211 or to the following field representatives:     Southern and Southeastern States and Texas  regional representative, Atlanta, GA, (404) 331-0559 Western States, Alaska, and Hawaii - regional representative, Denver, CO, (303) 236-7071  Department of Defense (DOD) transportation officers and travelers should direct questions to Headquarters, Military Traffic Management Command, or to the cognizant area command having jurisdiction.  31   Examples of GTRs Covering Specific Travel Situations  Figure 4.

ALTERNATIVE METHODS OF PROCURING PASSENGER TRANSPORTATION Use of cash Travelers must comply with the rules in 41 CFR 301-72, Subpart C that limit the use of cash. One of the following payment methods to procure common TSP transportation is considered the equivalent of cash (41 CFR 301-51.101): (a) (b) Personal credit cards; Cash withdrawals obtained from an ATM using a Government contractor-issued individually billed travel; card Checks, both personal and travelers (including those obtained through a travel payment system services program).  (c)  For passenger transportation services costing: (a) (b) $10 or less, and air excess baggage charge of $15 or less for each leg of a trip more than $10, but not more $100  Travelers are required to use a Government contractor-issued travel card (GCTC) or GTR to procure common TSP transportation services. Cash may only be used under emergency circumstances or when use of GCTCs or GTRs is impracticable or not accepted. Also, cash may only be used when the travelers' agency authorizes the use of group, charter, or excursion arrangements. (See 41 CFR 301-51.100 and 41 CFR 301-51.101).  Unauthorized Cash Purchase of Common TSP Transportation If you are a new employee or an invitational or infrequent traveler who procedures for purchasing common TSP transportation, your reimbursement for the full cost of the transportation. In all ot reimbursement will be limited to the cost of such transportation using the payment (41 CFR 301-51.102). is unaware of proper agency may allow her instances, your authorized method of  41   CHAPTER 5. REFUNDS General The following circumstances result in unused passenger transportation documents: (a) (b) (c) (d) Tickets are purchased for Government travel but are never used; Travel is terminated short of the authorized destination; The return portion of a round-trip ticket is not used; or Services actually furnished are different or of a lesser value than those authorized and the GTR cannot be so endorsed.  All adjustments in connection with official passenger transportation must be promptly processed to prevent losses to the Government. Therefore, as soon as possible, the Government traveler must submit all unused tickets, including portions thereof, Miscellaneous Charge Orders (MCOs), Ticket Refund Applications, notices of fare adjustments, etc., and a full report of the circumstances to your agency in accordance with your agency's procedures for recovery of refunds due the Government. (See NOTE below.) That office is usually the one that paid the TSP or Travel Management Center (TMC) for the tickets issued to the traveler, the office that processes the traveler's travel reimbursement voucher, or the office that issued the GTR. If a traveler is uncertain as to where to submit unused tickets, either the traveler's ordering issuing authority, or GSA's Program Support and Business Division should be consulted (see page 30).  UNUSED TICKETS HAVE MONETARY VALUE GOVERNMENT TRAVELERS SHOULD ALWAYS BE INSTRUCTED TO RETURN ALL UNUSED OR PARTIALLY UNUSED TICKETS TO THEIR AGENCY FOR PROCESSING AS A REFUND DUE THE GOVERNMENT. UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES SHOULD UNUSED OR PARTIALLY UNUSED TICKTS BE FILED, DESTROYED, OR THROWN AWAY!  NOTE: Excess baggage coupons do not have a redemption value. If a traveler does not use all of the excess baggage coupons prepared by the issuing TSP, the traveler must surrender them with his travel reimbursement voucher for cancellation.  42   Time Limitation Time limitations for redemption of unused tickets is controlled by specific legislation enacted by Congress. In American Airlines Inc. v. the United States, Court of Appeals for Federal Circuit (CAFC) docket No. 95-1218, (1/24/96), the Court found that unused tickets (or portions of unused tickets) paid for by the Government can be recovered up to ten years from the date of purchase, based upon existing law. This preempts any time limitations indicated on issued tickets. Application of interest on the amount above, is calculated from thirty (30) days after the original mailing of the SF 1170 ""Notice of Indebtedness.""  Unused Tickets or Coupons Unavailable Lacking unused tickets or coupons as evidence of the unfurnished services, the traveler or person in charge of the group of travelers shall obtain written acknowledgement of the situation from the TSP's representative for submission with their report. If transportation and/or accommodations are furnished for a lesser number of persons than specified on a party ticket, the TSP's conductor or ticket collector shall note on the ticket or coupon the number of persons actually transported and the number and type of accommodations furnished.  Agency Responsibility An agency must establish administrative procedures for collecting unused, partially used, and exchange tickets. The procedures must provide: (a) W ritten instructions explaining traveler liability for the value of tickets issued until all ticket coupons are used or properly accounted for on the travel voucher; Instructions for submitting payments received from TSPs for failure to provide confirmed reserved space; The traveler with a ""bill charges to"" address, so that the traveler can provide this information to the TSP for returned or exchange tickets. Procedures for promptly identifying any unused tickets, coupons, or other evidence of refund due the Government.  (b)  (c)  (d)  43   Refund or credit for unused transportation on an individually billed Government charge card Any charges billed directly to an individually billed Government charge card should be credited back to that account (41 CFR 301-10.115). (a) If a traveler purchases a ticket against an individual charge card, any airline ticket refund due will be the traveler's responsibility. In this case, a traveler should return the unused or partially unused ticket to the issuer and obtain a credit card refund notice (CCRN) receipt. The amount will be subsequently credited to the cardholder's account. The traveler should then deduct the amount of the charge from the amount claimed on the travel voucher. A note should be placed on the face of the travel voucher explaining that the ticket, or portion of it, was unused and a refund has been requested. The traveler should inform the finance of notice will enable the finance office to transportation charge. In this instance, the voucher for the ticket because the refund account. fice when a trip has been cancelled. This cancel any obligation established for the traveler must not submit a claim on a travel will be subsequently credited to his or her  (b)  (c)  (d)  W hen accepting exchanged or returned tickets purchased with an individual charge card, the TSP or TMC must issue a CCRN receipt to the traveler showing the credit is due the traveler. The traveler should keep the CCRN receipt until the credit appears on his charge card.  (e)  44   Agency processing of refunds for unused tickets purchased with Centrally Billed Account (Government travel accounts (GTAs)) (a) Downgraded/exchanged ticket coupons (1) Obtain TSP receipt from traveler showing credit is due agency. (2) Confirm that unused portion of downgraded/exchanged ticket coupon has been credited to agency GTA. (b) Partially unused tickets (1) Obtain partially unused ticket from traveler and return it to the TMC that furnished the TSP ticket. (2) Obtain a receipt from the TMC showing a credit is due the agency. (3) Confirm that the value of the partially unused ticket has been credited to agency GTA. (c) Unused tickets (1) Obtain unused ticket from traveler and return it to the Federal agency office or TMC that furnished the TSP ticket. (2) Obtain a receipt from the TMC showing a credit is due the agency. (3) Confirm that the value of the unused ticket has been credited to the agency GTA. (4) If the TMC has failed to credit the agency GTA or offer a satisfactory explanation within 30 days, take action against the TMC to collect the debt under the Federal Claims Collection Standards including administrative offset, if necessary.  45   Agency processing of refunds for unused tickets purchased with GTRs    Downgraded/exchanged ticket coupons (Ticket coupons in a TSP's possession for which the TSP has issued a lesser valued ticket, receipt, or refund application.) (1) Obtain TSP refund applications or receipts from traveler. (2) Maintain a suspense file to monitor receipt of refund. (3) Record and deposit refund upon receipt. (4) If refund is not received within 90 days, forward TSP refund applications or receipts to General Services Administration, Audit Division (FBAA), 1800 F Street, NW , W ashington, DC 20405.    Partially unused tickets (Tickets in which some, but not all, coupons have been used.) (1) Obtain partially unused ticket from traveler. (2) Issue an SF 1170 to the TSP or TMC that issued the ticket. (3) Maintain a suspense file to monitor receipt of refund. (4) Record and deposit refund upon receipt. (5) If TSP has failed to refund or offer a satisfactory explanation within 90 days, send triplicate copy of the SF 1170 and all related correspondence to General Services Administration, Audit Division (FBAA), 1800 F Street, NW , W ashington, DC 20405. (6) Remove debts referred to GSA from active account (7) If a refund or response is received from the TSP after referral to GSA, within 30 days forward original SF 1170 with any advice from the TSP regarding the refund to GSA.    Unused tickets (Tickets in which no coupons have been used) (1) Obtain unused ticket from traveler. (2) Issue an SF 1170 to the TSP or TMC that issued the ticket. (3) Maintain a suspense file to monitor receipt of refund. (4) Record and deposit TSP or TMC refund upon receipt. (5) If the TSP or TMC has failed to refund or offer a satisfactory explanation within 30 days, take action against the TSP or TMC to collect the debt under the Federal Claims Collection Standards including administrative offset, if necessary.  46   Prepaid Tickets/PTAs A prepaid ticket, commonly referred to as prepaid ticket advice (PTA), is a ticket that is purchased in one location for a traveler to pick up at another location. A prepaid ticket is usually ordered by telephone from a Travel Management Center (TMC) or air TSP. The ticket itself is actually issued by the originating TSP at the airport in the city where the travel commences. W hen prepaid tickets are issued the tariffs of certain scheduled air TSPs require the payment of a nonrefundable service charge, which is automatically added to the price of the ticket. The provisions contained in some TSP's tariffs waive the service charge for official travel. If a prepaid ticket is ordered and subsequently not used, the following procedures apply: (a) As soon as it is known that the ticket was not claimed, immediately notify the airline or TMC, which arranged the transaction that the ticket was not claimed, and will not be used. If the ticket was prepaid through a TMC, the TMC must obtain authority f to process a refund. Once that authority is received (usually within a few or refund will be issued according to the original form of payment. If penalty applies to the fare, both the nonrefundable service charge and penalty will be deducted from the refund. rom the airline days), a credit a cancellation the applicable  (b)  (c)  If the ticket was purchased directly from the airline, authority to refund will be made immediately. Either a credit card refund notice or a check will be sent, depending on the original form of payment. Prepaid tickets, regardless of whether they were purchased through a TMC or an airline, are refundable only to the ""billed to"" office, never the Government traveler. W hile awaiting the refund or credit, agencies should keep a record of the unclaimed ticket in their suspense file to ensure that they are correctly billed for the ticket. If a refund or credit is not received within a reasonable time (2 weeks), agencies should contact the airline or TMC. If a prepaid ticket is claimed by the traveler but is unused or partially unused, the unused coupons must be returned to the ""billed charges to"" office and processed the same as any other unused ticket.  (d)  (e)  NOTE ** TMCs are not automatically notified by the airline when a prepaid ticket has not been claimed. The traveler or appropriate agency official must notify the TMC.  47   Miscellaneous Charges Order (MCOs) TSPs should not issue MCOs for exchanged, downgraded, or unused tickets purchased with GTRs. Some TSPs occasionally issue MCOs erroneously. The following procedures apply if an airline inadvertently issues an MCO to a Government traveler on official business: (a) An MCO issued against an original ticket purchased with a GTR should be returned to the fiscal office or designated agency official responsible for handling unused tickets. MCOs submitted with travel vouchers should be attached to the front of the vouchers. The traveler should annotate on the voucher that an MCO is attached. Agencies shall issue a SF 1170 for an MCO and process it in the same manner that the SF 1170 is processed for an unused ticket purchased with a GTR (see instructions on page 50). If an MCO employee should be same way is issued for a cash purchase or for a ticket purchased with a Government charge card, the traveler is responsible for obtaining the refund. The MCO returned to the issuer of the original ticket and processed for refund in the that an unused ticket is processed for a refund.  (b)  (c)  (d)  48   Refunds From Foreign Flag TSPs (a) Standard Form 1170 and related procedures do not apply when unused passenger transportation services billed by foreign flag TSPs are involved except for: (1) Canadian or Mexican TSPs; or (2) Foreign flag TSPs maintaining billing offices in the United States. (b) Agencies shall institute procedures to effect recoveries for such unused services by deduction or setoff from the foreign flag TSP's unpaid bills. Both agencies and travelers in foreign areas shall be kept informed of local regulations and requirements to ensure that the interests of the United States will be protected. Adjustments for unfurnished transportation services not reported on the SF 1170 but made by deduction or setoff shall be noted on the deduction voucher with a full description of each unused ticket or portion thereof. In addition, the deduction voucher shall be annotated with the GTR number, the disbursing office (D.O.) voucher number, the D.O. symbol number, and the date of payment of the voucher on which the GTR was paid if other than the deduction voucher. The unused ticket or portion thereof shall be forwarded to the TSP and a copy of the transmittal letter shall be attached to the deduction voucher involved.  (c)  (d)  (e)  Unused Coupons For a Flight Between Two Common Rated Cities A common rated fare is a fare that applies from either of two geographically close or adjacent cities to a single destination. W hen the fare is the same from two different points of origin, a coupon for a flight between these cities has no refundable value. For example, a fare from San Francisco to Honolulu may be the same as the fare from Los Angeles to Honolulu. Because of scheduling, some airlines will allow passengers to fly between San Francisco and Los Angeles at no extra cost when enroute to Honolulu. Thus the fare from San Francisco to Los Angeles to Honolulu is the same as Los Angeles to Honolulu. W hen this circumstance occurs, the flight segment between San Francisco and Los Angeles is good for passage, but has no refundable value. Another example is Colorado Springs to Chicago and Denver to Chicago. In some instances, the fares are the same, and because of scheduling, a routing through Denver is sometimes allowed. W hen such routing happens, the flight coupon between Colorado Springs and Denver has no refundable value. (See illustrations below)  49   Tickets That Are Only Partially Refundable Tickets Carrying Cancellation Penalties Certain types of fares carry penalties for change or cancellation, once the t penalties apply, an indication that the tickets are subject to penalties: must endorsements box at the top of each ticket.

If be written in the (those requiring penalties ranging penalties will be  Round Trip Excursion Fare Tickets Used Only One Way If unrestricted round trip fare tickets are used only one way, the unused portion of the ticket should be refunded in an amount equal to one half of the round trip fare. However, this refund equation may not always be true for unused round trip excursion fare tickets. The refund amount due for these tickets is governed by each TSP's tariff rules concerning voluntary and involuntary refunds, denied boarding compensation, TSP penalties, and surcharges. The refund amount due on unused excursion fare coupons must be calculated on a case-by-case basis. Unused ticket coupon pricing assistance is available from the General Services Administration, Audit Division (FBA), 1800 F Street, NW , W ashington, DC 20405.  50   SF 1170, Redemption of Unused Tickets SF 1170 and SF 1170 EDP (computer-generated) consist of an original and three copies which is carbon interleaved for simultaneous preparation.  Procurement of SF 1170 by agencies Agencies may obtain supplies of SF 1170 assemblies from GSA by submitting a requisition in Fedstrip/Milstrip format to GSA's Federal Supply Service, Federal Commodities Center (FCNI), W ashington, DC 20406. W here feasible, agencies should request that the name and address of the office to receive the refund be preprinted on each SF 1170. No other overprinting on SF 1170 is permitted unless specifically approved in writing by the General Services Administration, Director, Audit Division (FBA), 1800 F Street, NW , W ashington DC 20405. Redemption of Unused Tickets, SF 1170 Agencies shall not revise TSP bills or require TSPs to rebill items. Agencies shall demand the refund value of unused tickets from TSPs through the use of a SF 1170, Redemption of Unused Tickets. A separate SF 1170 must be prepared for each GTR, though more than one ticket or adjustment transaction may be related to that GTR. Each ticket must be listed on the SF 1170. Agency processing of SF 1170 Claims Timely processing of SF 1170 is essential to facilitate prompt refunds from TSPs. Agencies processing SF 1170 shall ensure that: (a) (b) All copies clearly show the required details; The original and the duplicate copy, together with pertinent unused tickets, are promptly forwarded to the TSP; and All other copies are retained by the agency for accounting control.

COMPENSATION FOR DENIED BOARDING AND VACATING SEAT VOLUNTARILY Denied boarding The U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) requires that, with a few exceptions, airline passengers ""bumped"" against their will (involuntary denied boarding) be compensated by the airline. The amount depends on the price of the ticket and the length of the delay: Substitute scheduled compared scheduled transportation arrival time to original arrival time  Amount of compensation 1/ No compensation 100% of one way fare to final destination (not to exceed $200) 200% of one way fare to final destination (not to exceed $400)  W ithin 1 hour More than 1 hour later, but less than 2 hours later (4 hours on international flights) More than 2 hours later (4 hours later for international), or no substitute travel arrangements  In addition to the above compensation, travelers always get to keep their original ticket and Government travelers or their agency can use it for official travel on another flight or have it refunded. _______________  1/ Subject to confirmed reservation and check-in requirements; does not apply to charter flights or scheduled flights with 60 passenger or less airplanes, or when ""bumping"" occurs because the airline substituted a smaller plane for the one it originally planned to use, or between foreign cities, and may not apply to international flights inbound to the U.S. Airlines may offer free transportation on future flights in place of a check, but travelers have the right to insist on a check if that is the choice of the Government agency paying for the travel.  55   Service delays and cancellations If requested by the traveler, many airlines will, under certain circumstances, provide a free telephone call, free overnight lodging, and/or free ground transportation to and from a local hotel when their flights are delayed or cancelled (see applicable TSP Tariff Rule 240). DOT requires that airlines make sure passengers receive an explanation of their contract of carriage, and airline agents must answer questions about information in the airline's tariffs and must help travelers locate specific tariff rules, if necessary. Travelers needing assistance or wishing to put a complaint about an airline on record with the DOT may call the Aviation Consumer Protection Division at (202) 366-2220 or write: Aviation Consumer Protection Division C-75 U.S. Department of Transportation 400 7th Street, SW Washington, DC 20590 Regulations governing airline overbooking, notice of terms of contract of carriage, baggage liability, and airline computer reservation systems are contained in 14 CFR 254, and 255 respectively.

This may also be viewed on line at: http://www.dot.gov/airconsumer/flyrights.htm. domestic 250, 253, available pamphlet  Since the individual's travel on official business is for the account of the United States, the Government would be damaged by involuntary denied boarding, or other delay or failure as defined by DOT regulations or the TSP's tariff, and is entitled to reimbursement. The Government traveler who has been denied confirmed reserved space must ensure that the TSP shows ""Treasurer of the United States"" as the payee on the compensation check (and any ticket refund check). Government travelers must give the TSP a receipt for the check(s), retain a copy of the receipt, and forward the check(s), the copy of the receipt, and any unused ticket to the agency for deposit or reuse.

USE OF FOREIGN-FLAG AIR OR FOREIGNFLAG OCEAN TSPs Background Travelers are required by 49 U.S.C 40118 (Fly America Act), to use U.S. flag air TSP service for all air travel funded by the U.S. Government. The Comptroller General of the United States prescribes guidelines (4 CFR 52) for the use of U.S. flag vessels for travel on official business and of U.S. flag air TSPs holding certificates under section 401 of the Federal Aviation Act of 1958, 49 U.S.C. 1371(1970), for Government-financed passenger transportation (including but not limited to Government dependents, consultants, grantees, contractors, and subcontractors), when such vessels and air TSPs are available. Such use is required by 46 U.S.C. 1241 and 49 U.S.C. 40118 whether the United States pays the transportation charges to the TSP or reimburses the traveler or other entity for that expense. The use of foreign-flag air TSPs may be authorized or approved only when U.S. flag air TSP service is unavailable as determined by the Comptroller General of the United States. Each voucher covering expenditures involving foreign-flag ocean or foreign-flag air passenger transportation in whole or in part, whether payable to the TSP or to the traveler or other entity, must be supported by a certificate or memorandum (figure 22) as to the unavailability of U.S. flag service, signed by a responsible official of the agency that authorized the travel or transportation or by the traveler who has knowledge of the facts concerning usage.  U.S. flag certificated service - ""available""/ ""unavailable"" Generally, passenger service by a U.S. flag air TSP is ""available"" if the TSP can perform the commercial foreign air transportation needed by the agency and if the service will accomplish the agency's mission. Expenditures for service furnished by a foreign-flag air TSP generally will be allowed only when service by an U.S. flag air TSP is considered ""unavailable"".

PAYMENT AND SUBMISSION OF TRANSPORTATION BILLS FOR AUDIT Payment of transportation bills All transportation bills are subject to the provisions of the Prompt Payment Act (31 U.S.C. 3901-3907 (OMB Circular A-125)). All agencies must establish a prepayment audit program, unless the Administrator of General Services Administration has granted a waiver. All correct and properly documented bills must be paid upon completion of transportation service. Prior to payment, agencies must examine TSP's bills to ensure that:       The Standard Carrier Alpha Code (SCAC) and the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) is entered on each SF 1113 and SF 1113-A. If the SCAC and TIN is omitted, the forms and all supporting papers shall be returned to the TSP unpaid with a request that the SCAC and TIN be added to the forms. The transportation services for which payment is claimed were duly authorized, that such services represent a legal obligation under the appropriation or fund involved, that the TSP's bill is complete and supported with required documentation, and that all extensions and computation of charges are correct. No duplicate payments are made. (Procedures and controls must be established to prevent duplicate payments, to recover any duplicate payments that may be made, and to perform an annual review of effectiveness of those procedures.) The TSP is provided with notice of an apparent error, defect, or impropriety within 7 days of receipt of an invoice.  Submission of paid transportation bills for Postpayment audit Agencies must forward their original paid transportation bills and all supporting documents to the General Services Administration's Audit Division each month for postpayment audit (41 CFR 102-118). The following forms are used: SF 1186 (Transmittal for Transportation Schedules and Related Basic Documents) SF 1166 OCR (Voucher and Schedule of Payments (Optical Character Recognition)) SF 1113 (Public Voucher for Transportation Charges) OF 1169 (Government Transportation Request) Submissions should be made in the following manner: 61      Assemble complete packages - include SF 1186, SF 1166 OCR, SF 1113, and OF 1169. Attach copies of ticket coupons (or a complete ticket itinerary for any ticket coupon(s) not provided), GEBAT's, and other supporting documents to each OF 1169. Ensure that original documents and not copies are submitted. Mail to GSA - Send assembled packages to: General Services Administration Sheltered Occupational Center (SOC) Paid Document Receiving Unit 13882 Redskin Drive Herndon, VA 20171    Submit paid bills at the end of each account month: avoid multiple account month submissions - Paid bills should be submitted to GSA at the end of each account month. If, due to an administrative oversight, this is not done, and it becomes necessary to submit multiple account months at the same time, a) b) the most recent account month should be forwarded in a separate package, all prior account months should be bundled by month, each with an accompanying SF 1186 and SF 1166-OCR, and should be forwarded in one package clearly marked as to its contents.  Ensure that each SF 1113 contains the paid date and schedule number stated on the respective SF 1166 OCR.      Identify delayed/withheld vouchers - Any transportation vouchers that have not been paid because they are doubtful claims must be identified on a separate SF 1186 and forwarded to Audit Division (FBA). Submit negative reports - If no SF 1113s are paid during the month, check the block in the lower left corner of the SF 1186 and submit to Audit Division, FBA. Report new or discontinued certifying offices - W hen a new or existing station is authorized to prepare SF 1166-OCRs, or when authorization has been discontinued at a station, notify the following office in writing: General Services Administration Audit Division (FBA) Attn: Document Submission Control Clerk 1800 F Street, NW W ashington, DC 20405  (NOTE: The Audit Division issues computerized letters of receipt each month for paid transportation bill submissions that it receives.)  62   CHAPTER 9. TSP BILLING PROCEDURES AND INSTRUCTIONS FOR PREPARATION OF SF 1113 Form for billing transportation charges GSA has prescribed Standard Form 1113, Public Voucher for Transportation Charges (Appendix A), and Standard Form 1113A, Memorandum Copy, (Appendix B) for use by TSPs or TSP agents (TMCs) in billing charges for passenger transportation services furnished for the account of the U.S. Government. Departments or agencies may not require TSPs to furnish more than one memorandum copy (SF 1113A) with each voucher unless so authorized by the General Services Administration.  Obtaining Standard Form 1113 TSPs may purchase SF 1113 and SF 1113A from the Superintendent of Documents, U.S. Government Printing Office, W ashington, DC 20402, or have them printed commercially. W hen printing these forms commercially, TSPs must ensure that the forms conform to the exact size, wording, and arrangement of the approved standard forms and, while no minimum grade of paper is set, TSPs must provide a reasonable grade of paperstock. TSPs may have SF 1113 and SF 1113A printed also in continuous-feed format for machine billing by adding pin-feed strips on the margins. The tear-off slip may be moved from the bottom to the right edge of SF 1113, to aid in machine use of the form, but it must be perforated on all edges to measure 8 1/2 by 3 3/16 inches when detached from the body of the SF 1113 and from the pin-feed strips. The forms must conform in all other respects to the exact size, wording, color, and arrangement of the approved standard forms. Any deviation must be approved in writing by the Director, Audit Division (FBA), General Services Administration.  Preparation of billing form The billing TSP or TMC must list on SF 1113 the serial number of the GTRs being billed, the charges applicable to each GTR, and the total amount claimed. W hen billing numerous charges to the same Government paying office, the TSP or TMC should include on each voucher as many GTRs as may be listed in a single column, not to exceed 25. Attach ticket coupon(s) (or a complete ticket itinerary for any ticket coupon(s) not provided). In completing the ""Payee Certificate"" portion of the SF 1113, the TSP or TMC may use a facsimile signature of its certifying official or, for mechanically prepared bills, a machine-typed name of the official. A duly authorized person must, however, initial the facsimile signature or machine-typed name. The TSP or TMC must also complete the tear-off portion of the SF 1113. The SF 1113-A must not be substituted for the tear-off portion.  Billing for GEBAT'S 63   The TSP furnishing air excess baggage service must remove or ""lift"" the applicable GOVERNMENT EXCESS BAGGAGE AUTHORIZATION/TICKETS (GEBAT) flight coupon for use as a supporting document for the charges billed on the SF 1113. The ""lifting"" TSP generally will bill the Government direct; however, if that is not possible or if the TSP cannot bill in the currency required, the ""lifting"" TSP may invoice the issuing TSP who should bill the coupons to the Government office and make appropriate interline settlement of charges. It is essential to the payment process that the GTR number, the name of the traveler, as shown on the GTR and the name of the office to be billed for the services furnished be completely and accurately entered on the GEBAT. Vouchers pertaining to air excess baggage charges should cover services authorized by no more than three GTRs.  64   9 1 3 2 5 4 10  7  6 12  11  8  Figure 23.

If another TSP is used, the issuing officer or GTR to that TSP in ""SERVICE FURNISHED, IF OTHER THAN the GTR (block 5).  Different or lesser value services received than requested W hen the service furnished is different or of a lesser value than that authorized, the GTR must be annotated by the traveler (or person in charge of a group of travelers) on the back in the ""SERVICE FURNISHED, IF OTHER THAN REQUESTED"" block to indicate the type of service furnished, the name of the TSP providing the service, if other than the TSP honoring the GTR, and the reason for the change. This notation must be signed and dated by the TSP representative and countersigned by the traveler. If transportation and/or accommodations are furnished far a lesser number of persons than specified on a group ticket, the TSP's conductor or ticket collector shall note on the pertinent ticket or coupon the number of persons actually transported and the number and type of accommodations furnished. In these situations, the traveler or person in charge must similarly endorse the back of the memorandum card copy of the GTR in the corresponding block (17). Lacking the original and memorandum card copy, the traveler or person in charge must promptly forward written notification of such change to the office that issued the GTR. Air excess baggage The TSP honoring a GTR that authorizes the carriage of air excess baggage will issue a Government Excess Baggage Authorization/Ticket (GEBAT) to the traveler.

Defaulted air TSP Protection All Air Traffic Conference of America (ATC) TSPs (except United Airlines) and all Regional Airline Association (RAA) TSPs have entered into a defaulted air TSP agreement with the General Services Administration (GSA) which assures that no Government traveler need be stranded en route because of the bankruptcy of an airline. Airline ticket coupons issued by a defaulted TSP on its own ticket stock for air transportation on that defaulted TSP will be honored by participating TSPs. The agreement applies to GTR purchased tickets validated on or before the TSP's default date and is effective for 90 days from ticket validation date. Honoring TSPs are not required to provide different service than specified on the defaulted TSP ticket coupon. Any additional service requested by the traveler must be purchased by the traveler. The honoring TSP is compensated at the lower of either the fare for the service performed or 71   the stated fare on the defaulted TSP ticket coupon. Honoring TSPs submit bills to GSA, Audit Division (FBA), W ashington, DC 20405 supported by priced copies of the defaulted TSP ticket coupons ""lifted"" by the honoring TSP for forwarding to the proper ""bill charges to"" office. Government travelers who have not commenced travel but who hold GTR purchased for travel on a defaulted TSP should return them for replacement tickets if purchased Government Travel Management Center.

Rail service accommodation charges W hen rail transportation and sleeping or club car accommodations are authorized, a single GTR should be issued for both services. However, if the accommodations are authorized after the rail transportation GTR has been issued, a separate GTR may be issued to the TSP furnishing the sleeping or club car ticket.

GX235-63-9542927	"Pyramid schemes defraud 90 percent of those who invest                                                          Contact: Wendy Raney                                                              Single ""gifting"" program scams $1.4 million from Montana investors                            State Auditor John Morrison is warning consumers of the dangers of pyramid schemes that promise investors a way to ""get rich quick,"" if they first recruit additional investors.         ""These programs quickly collapse under their own weight with the first 10 percent of investors making great profits at the expense of the last 90 percent who participate and lose everything,"" said Morrison, Montana's Securities Commissioner.         Pyramid schemes are fraudulent because nothing of value is purchased or sold when a person joins the program. The person's money is ""recycled"" and given to people who joined the program at an earlier time. Continuation of the program is dependent upon the recruitment of new participants. Eventually the pool of people available for recruitment disappears and the pyramid collapses. People on the pyramid's lower tiers lose all their money.         ""The people organizing these programs expect to make a profit,"" Morrison said. ""If you profit primarily through the recruitment of others into the program, you are in violation of state law, which explicitly outlaws pyramid schemes.""         The Auditor's Office has investigated a number of pyramid schemes and has pending cases involving a type of pyramid scheme known as a  ""gifting"" program.         It also has identified nearly 60 individuals and groups in Montana with more than $1.4 million invested in a ""gifting"" program called Greater Ministries International Church.         The program is receiving national attention because it sold unregistered securities throughout the United States and in foreign countries since 1988.          The organization and its affiliates primarily have sold a double-your-money-back investment program. Court documents allege that the program is an illegal investment contract that targets and preys upon fundamentalist Christians, promising that the funds invested in the plan will double as a result of the blessings of God. Court records indicate there may be as many as 15,000 to 20,000 victims worldwide.         Morrison announced Feb. 28 that individuals or groups involved in the program must file claims against the organization with the United States Bankruptcy Court by March 30, 2001.         ""It is important to identify the victims quickly so they can recover their losses,"" Morrison said. ""Innocent people trusted this organization and planned to use their profits to pay medical bills, college tuition and home mortgages.""         The Greater Ministries program evolved and is known by several names including ""Double-Your-Blessings,"" the ""Greater Trust Gift Exchange"" and the ""Faith Promise."" The various versions of the programs were administered by entities including Greater Trust, 1 John 4:4, Greater Ministries International of Grand Cayman and Ultimate Pension Fund.         Program representatives generally claimed that the funds invested by a prospective investor would double at a predetermined date if the investor successfully solicited two additional investors to invest the same amount of money or more in the program.         Representatives said the plan was a form of Christian social security, which would provide participants with a good living, according to court documents.         Greater Ministries claimed and touted investment activities including a gold and platinum mine in Nevada, thrift stores, real estate, precious metals, bank notes and debentures. It also told prospective investors in the Faith Promise Plan that their money would be used to conduct offshore trades of precious metals and foreign currency.         Anyone involved in the ""gifting"" program who has not received a letter from the State Auditor's Office, should contact the Securities Department at (800) 332-6148.         Individuals with questions or concerns about pyramid schemes should contact the office at the same number."

GX237-51-11599793	NEWS RELEASE  Office of Maryland Attorney General J. Joseph Curran, Jr.                   April 18, 2001   Media Inquiries: Sean Caine 410-576-6357            PRINCE GEORGES COUPLE CHARGED WITH          OPERATING FRAUDULENT INVESTMENT SCHEME          Baltimore  - Attorney General J Joseph Curran, Jr., announced          today that his offices Securities Division has obtained a preliminary          injunction against a Prince Georges couple and their Bowie-based company,          charging them with violating Marylands securities laws by operating a          fraudulent investment scheme involving millions of dollars.         According to the order issued by Circuit Court Judge Thomas P. Smith          with the consent of the parties, all assets of Samuel W. Butler, Jr. and          Nancy J. Ford-Butler and their company, S.W. Butler & Associates of 919          Cypress Point Circle, Bowie, and 8877 Spiral Cut, Columbia, are temporarily          frozen and a temporary receiver has been appointed to take control of          the company and its assets.         Currans Securities Division alleges that the Butlers violated Marylands          securities laws by offering and selling unregistered investments and acting          as unregistered securities agents and investment advisers. Allegedly more          than 50 investors participated in the Butlers and S.W. Butler & Associates          investment program and the Butlers offered unregistered securities for          at least three years. The complaint also alleges that investors thought          their monies were being pooled by S.W. Butler & Associates to invest in          commercial notes issued by corporate entities, with the Butlers guaranteeing          investors returns from as much as 10 percent within 90 days and rising          up to 24 percent within 180 days. Investors were told that their investments          were backed by collateral and protected by insurance coverage. The complaint,          however, alleges that there is neither evidence that investors monies          were invested in an investment program that generated the promised returns          nor that the purported investments were backed by collateral or covered          by insurance. Instead, the pleadings allege facts indicating that the          investment program operated like a Ponzi scheme in that most of the money          coming into the program was used to pay other investors who wanted to          withdraw funds.         Curran emphasized that his Securities Divisions investigation of this          matter is continuing and urges anyone who invested funds with S.W. Butler          & Associates or Samuel and Nancy Butler, or who has information concerning          that investment program, to call the Securities Division of his office          at 410-576-7783.         Curran reminded investors to call the Securities Division at 410-576-6360          before they invest to find out whether their investment adviser, broker          and securities are registered. Even when an investment program looks reasonable,          and friends and family trust the promoter, its better to take a few minutes          to verify the status of the promoters.         ###

Earn thousand of dollars a month -           from your home - Processing Medical Billing Claims.                                          Y ou       can find ads like this everywhere - from the street light and telephone pole on       your corner to your newspaper and PC. While you may find these ads appealing,       especially if you can't work outside your home, proceed with caution. Not all       work-at-home opportunities deliver on their promises.          Many ads omit the fact that you may have to       work many hours without pay. Or they don't disclose all the costs you will have       to pay. Countless work-at-home schemes require you to spend your own money to       place newspaper ads; make photocopies; or buy the envelopes, paper, stamps, and       other supplies or equipment you need to do the job. The companies sponsoring       the ads also may demand that you pay for instructions or ""tutorial"" software.       Consumers deceived by these ads have lost thousands of dollars, in addition to       their time and energy.           Classic       Work-at-Home Schemes  Several types of offers are       classic work-at-home schemes.                  Medical billing.  Ads for       pre-packaged businesses - known as billing centers - are in newspapers, on       television and on the Internet. If you respond, you'll get a sales pitch that       may sound something like this: There's ""a crisis"" in the health care system,       due partly to the overwhelming task of processing paper claims. The solution is       electronic claim processing. Because only a small percentage of claims are       transmitted electronically, the market for billing centers is wide       open.         The promoter also may tell you that many       doctors who process claims electronically want to ""outsource"" or contract out       their billing services to save money. Promoters will promise that you can earn       a substantial income working full or part time, providing services like       billing, accounts receivable, electronic insurance claim processing and       practice management to doctors and dentists. They also may assure you that no       experience is required, that they will provide clients eager to buy your       services or that their qualified salespeople will find clients for       you.         The reality: you will have to sell. These       promoters rarely provide experienced sales staff or contacts within the medical       community.         The promoter will follow up by sending       you materials that typically include a brochure, application, sample diskettes,       a contract (licensing agreement), disclosure document, and in some cases,       testimonial letters, videocassettes and reference lists. For your investment of       $2,000 to $8,000, a promoter will promise software, training and technical       support. And the company will encourage you to call its references. Make sure       you get many names from which to chose. If only one or two names are given,       they may be ""shills"" - people hired to give favorable testimonials. It's best       to interview people in person, preferably where the business operates, to       reduce your risk of being mislead by shills and also to get a better sense of       how the business works.         Few consumers who purchase a medical       billing business opportunity are able to find clients, start a business and       generate revenues - let alone recover their investment and earn a substantial       income. Competition in the medical billing market is fierce and revolves around       a number of large and well-established firms.                  Envelope stuffing.        Promoters usually advertise that, for a ""small"" fee, they will tell you how to       earn money stuffing envelopes at home. Later - when it's too late - you find       out that the promoter never had any employment to offer. Instead, for your fee,       you're likely to get a letter telling you to place the same ""envelope-stuffing""       ad in newspapers or magazines, or to send the ad to friends and relatives. The       only way you'll earn money is if people respond to your work-at-home       ad.                  Assembly or craft work.        These programs often require you to invest hundreds of dollars in equipment or       supplies. Or they require you to spend many hours producing goods for a company       that has promised to buy them. For example, you might have to buy a sewing or       sign-making machine from the company, or materials to make items like aprons,       baby shoes or plastic signs. However, after you've purchased the supplies or       equipment and performed the work, fraudulent operators don't pay you. In fact,       many consumers have had companies refuse to pay for their work because it       didn't meet ""quality standards.""         Unfortunately, no work is ever ""up to       standard,"" leaving workers with relatively expensive equipment and supplies -       and no income. To sell their goods, these workers must find their own       customers.           Questions to       Ask   Legitimate work-at-home program sponsors       should tell you - in writing - what's involved in the program they are selling.       Here are some questions you might ask a promoter:                  What tasks will I have to perform? (Ask       the program sponsor to list every step of the job.)          Will I be paid a salary or will my pay       be based on commission?          Who will pay me?          When will I get my first       paycheck?          What is the total cost of the       work-at-home program, including supplies, equipment and membership fees? What       will I get for my money?                   The answers to these questions may help you       determine whether a work-at-home program is appropriate for your circumstances,       and whether it is legitimate.          You also might want to check out the       company with your local consumer protection agency, state Attorney General and       the Better Business Bureau, not only where the company is located, but also       where you live. These organizations can tell you whether they have received       complaints about the work-at-home program that interests you. But be wary: the       absence of complaints doesn't necessarily mean the company is legitimate.       Unscrupulous companies may settle complaints, change their names or move to       avoid detection.           Where to       Complain   If you have spent money and time on a       work-at-home program and now believe the program may not be legitimate, contact       the company and ask for a refund. Let company representatives know that you       plan to notify officials about your experience. If you can't resolve the       dispute with the company, file a complaint with these organizations:                  The Federal Trade Commission works for       the consumer to prevent fraud and deception.

Lazio announced his legislation today at a Capitol Hill press conference with Senator Alfonse D'Amato (R-NY), Chairman of the Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee, who has introduced a similar bill in the Senate.         U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development Secretary Andrew Cuomo attended today's press conference and endorsed Chairman Lazio's bill - The Senior Homeowner Reverse Mortgage Protection Act. Lazio's initiative would reinforce HUD's existing authority to prevent seniors from being charged excessive fees for reverse mortgage information available from HUD.         ""This legislation will help weed out these third-party companies that are preying upon our nation's seniors,"" Lazio said. ""We should be helping those who want to stay in their homes and in the neighborhoods they care about, while at the same time protecting and preserving such an important program for seniors. Our seniors deserve no less.""         Chairman Lazio introduced his bill after receiving reports that companies related to the reverse mortgage industry are allegedly charging seniors up to 10% of the mortgage amount, sometimes as much as $10,000, to provide them with information about reverse mortgages. Lazio initially expressed his outrage concerning these charges in a letter to Secretary Cuomo last month.         ""Our work together over the past few weeks is a shining example of what can be accomplished through such partnership when an issue of such critical importance confronts us,"" Lazio said. ""And make no mistake, a threat to the most vulnerable of Americans is indeed a threat to us all.""        ""We will not tolerate white-collar muggings of our parents and grandparents. We will not allow elderly homeowners who've made mortgage payments for decades to be robbed of thousands of dollars in an instant by smooth-talking con artists,"" Secretary Cuomo said.   According to media reports, senior citizens were charged as much as 10% of the reverse mortgage loan's value to receive information on these loans from a brokerage house. Recent media reports indicate that seniors were then encouraged to put the equity from their home into risky annuities.        ""By law, participants in the program are required to attend counseling sessions, provided by HUD at no cost,"" Lazio said. ""We do not accept as legitimate costs for services, fees in excess of 8% of the mortgage amount for what may amount to little more than guiding seniors through these counseling discussions. The very idea that seniors who were considering a reverse mortgage out of their desperate financial needs were then charged as much as $10,000 for *consulting' fees is repugnant.""         Reverse mortgages allow seniors aged 62 and more who are house-rich but cash-poor to borrow against the equity in their homes to help pay for living and medical expenses or crucial home repairs. Chairman Lazio was able to reauthorize the Federal Housing Administration's reverse mortgage program that allows lenders to offer Home Equity Conversion Mortgages (HECM) until the year 2000, expand the number of available reverse mortgages from 25,000 to 50,000, and make one- to four-family residences eligible.         To illustrate how well the HECM program works, Chairman Lazio met in 1995 with sisters Bessie and Estelle Gwynn of Amityville, Long Island who were approved for a HECM loan. Utilizing the reverse mortgage program, the Gwynns were able to make substantive improvements to their home.        The seniors that participate in the reverse mortgage program often have nowhere else to turn for financial support. ""This program in the simplest terms ensures the quality of life for older Americans who have paid their dues and deserve peace and security in their retirement,"" Lazio said.   In addition to working with Secretary Cuomo, Chairman Lazio has been working with Senator D'Amato on legislation to weed out predators who are working against the spirit of the reverse mortgage program. ""Senator D'Amato's commitment to build this coalition of support for such an important program to seniors is indispensable,"" Lazio said.        ""The days of ripping off seniors by charging them outrageous reverse mortgage fees are over. Excessive reverse mortgage servicing fees are gouging low-income seniors, who are usually on fixed incomes. I want to thank Representative Lazio and Secretary Cuomo for their leadership in this effort,"" Senator D'Amato said.   Chairman Lazio expects to bring his bill to the House Floor within the next several weeks. The Lazio bill will either be attached to the more comprehensive public housing bill in the House, or will be considered under suspension of the House rules in the near future.   The bills introduced by Chairman Lazio and Senator D'Amato have received strong support from the reverse mortgage industry, including Wendover of North Carolina -- the nation's largest administrator of HUD-insured reverse mortgages. The measures also are supported by the American Association of Retired Persons (AARP) and its thousands of members across the country. Fannie Mae, a partner in the FHA reverse mortgage program, as well as a provider of their own reverse mortgage program -- Home Keeper -- supports the legislation.   ""With the support of Secretary Cuomo, the legislation I have introduced today will help rid these despicable practices and maintain a valuable instrument of security for our nation's senior homeowners,"" Lazio said. ""I look forward to working with Senator D'Amato to make the American dream of homeownership a continued reality for thousands of seniors across America who otherwise would not have a home to call their own.""      ###"

Attorney          General's Office Issues Warning: Avoid Illegal Pyramid         The        Consumer Protection Division of the Iowa Attorney General's Office issued        the following statement today in response to numerous inquiries about a        pyramid program that is operating in certain areas of Iowa:                We are receiving numerous inquiries about a financial recruitment program        purportedly based on a ""private gifting"" concept. The operation invites        people to join by making a ""gift"" of from $500 to $2,000 and then recruiting        others to make similar ""gifts"" and recruit still more participants. The        pay-out to early participants after a few rounds of recruitment is supposed        to be as much as $16,000.           The Attorney General's          Office believes such schemes are illegal pyramids, and that they pose          a danger to persons who join later and will lose their money.         Promoters may claim          that the ""gift"" angle makes it legal, but we believe everyone knows these          are not true gifts. The payments are nothing more than investments in          a money-making scheme, made for the sole purpose of generating a big cash          pay-out to participants.          Illegal pyramids          are outlawed for good reason: by definition, any program that relies entirely          on constantly multiplying the number of participants is doomed to failure.          Pyramids may make quick money for a relatively small group of early promoters,          but a far larger group of later participants end up losing their money          as the pool of potential recruits dries up. Iowans need to be forewarned          that people inevitably lose money in pyramid operations.         We believe the pyramids          likely run afoul of several state and federal laws. One illegal aspect          is the false claim that the payments are considered to be gifts by the          IRS, and that cash pay-outs do not have to be declared as income at tax          time. The IRS has indicated that failure to declare such payments could          constitute felony tax evasion.          Representations made          in promoting participation in the pyramid also may constitute violation          of the Iowa Consumer Fraud law and theft-by-deception statute. It appears          that promotional materials make false claims about the initial payment          being a gift rather than an investment, about the speed with which a large          pay-out will be generated (especially for latecomers who have no hope          of achieving a pay-out), and about the legality of the scheme itself.         Such pyramids can          cause a lot of harm. People would like to believe that there is a legal          way to make so much money quickly and easily, and so they recruit relatives,          friends, neighbors and co-workers to invest. Then, when the pyramid collapses          -- as pyramids always do -- there is a lot of anger as people deal with          the losses they suffered and caused others to suffer.         One of the current          gifting pyramids is referred to as ""The Winners' Team"" and another as          ""Life Changes."" Such ""gifting"" schemes are not new. Earlier versions of          similar schemes were called ""Friends Helping Friends"" and ""The Gifting          Board,"" among others. Such operations have been prosecuted criminally          under anti-pyramid, theft, lottery, and securities laws. A person who          recruits others also may be committing a consumer fraud violation with          potential civil penalties up to $40,000.         The Attorney General's          Office is cooperating and consulting with other state and U.S. officials          on the matter, including Iowa county attorneys, the State Securities Bureau,          the Federal Trade Commission and the Internal Revenue Service.         The Attorney General's          Office cautions Iowans not to participate in illegal pyramids. People          who participate are risking their money, and they also risk violating          the law or being sued.                   #          # #"

Joseph Curran, Jr.       July 11, 2000   Media Inquiries: Sean Caine 410-576-6357      Baltimore City Stock Swindler Charged    Unlicenced Investment Advisor Defrauded Over 400 People    Baltimore  - Attorney General J. Joseph Curran, Jr. announced today the filing of criminal fraud charges against E. Robins Rich, a 79-year-old unlicenced investment advisor, for swindling over 400 people out of 1.5 million dollars in a complicated investment scam he operated for at least seven years.  In September, 1999, the Maryland Securities Division shut him down and a judge placed his investment company, Starboard Associates, into receivership.  Mr. Rich, who currently resides in Temple Terrace, Florida, has been charged in Baltimore City Circuit Court with investment advisor fraud, securities fraud and felony theft, charges which carry a maximum penalty of 21 years incarceration and fines of over $100,000.  Arraignment is set for September 1, 2000.   The charges against Rich allege that from 1992 until 1999, when the State put him out of business, he stole a total of $1.49 million from his investors.   According to court records, during that period of time, Rich offered investors a pooled investment in monthly ""programs"", where 80 percent of investors funds was supposed to be invested in a money market account and 20 percent invested in stock options. Each ""program"" was to mature in three to 12 months, depending on the program.  At maturity, Rich would offer to roll over an investors supposed profits into a new ""program"".     Throughout the time covered by the criminal charges, Rich published fraudulent investment statements to his investors, misrepresented the investments made and inflated and exaggerated their profits.  These misrepresentations encouraged many investors to continue investing with him rather than liquidate their investments.  Investigation has shown that rather than making a profit, Rich was steadily losing money on his investments, and that he was using new investor money to fund withdrawals made by earlier investors.   According to Attorney General Curran, ""Rich was running a classic Ponzi scheme, encouraging new investors to give him money which he then used to pay off old investors rather than make the investments as promised"".   All defendants are innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt    ###"

They allow older consumers to convert the equity in their homes to cash while retaining home ownership.  With a ""regular"" mortgage, you make monthly payments to the lender. But with a reverse mortgage, you receive money from the lender and generally do not have to repay it for as long as you live in your home. In return, the lender holds some -- if not most or all -- of your home's equity.  Introduced in the late 1980s, reverse mortgages can help homeowners who are ""house-rich-but-cash-poor"" remain in their homes and still meet their financial obligations. The proceeds of the loan are tax-free, there are no minimum income requirements, and for most reverse mortgages, the money can be used for any purpose.   Facts for Consumers But, reverse mortgages also tend to be more costly than other loans, and there have been cases of abuse by unscrupulous lenders. If you're considering a reverse mortgage, it's important to understand how the loans work and what your rights and responsibilities are.  COMMON F  EATURES  THE B   ASICS  There are several types of reverse mortgages: the federally insured Home Equity Conversion Mortgage (HECM), administered by the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) single-purpose reverse mortgages, usually offered by state or local government agencies for a specific reason proprietary reverse mortgages, offered by banks, mortgage companies, and other private lenders and backed by the companies that develop them.    Reverse mortgages offer special appeal to older adults because the loan advances, which are not taxable, generally do not affect Social Security or Medicare benefits. Depending on the plan, reverse mortgages generally allow homeowners to retain title to their homes until they permanently move, sell their home, die, or reach the end of a pre-selected loan term. Generally, a move is considered permanent when the homeowner has not lived in the home for 12 consecutive months. So, for example, a person could live in a nursing home or other medical facility for up to 12 months before the reverse mortgage would be due. However, be aware that:     To qualify for a reverse mortgage, you must be at least 62 and have paid off all or most of your home mortgage. Income is generally not a factor, and no medical tests or medical histories are required. If you seek an HECM, you also must undergo free mortgage counseling from an independent government-approved ""housing agency."" Financial institutions offering proprietary reverse mortgages may require similar counseling or homeowner education. The amount you can borrow depends on your age, the equity in your home, the value of your home, and the interest rate. If it's an HECM, federal law limits the maximum amount that can be paid out. You can be paid in a lump sum, in monthly advances, through a line of credit, or a combination of all three.  Reverse mortgages tend to be more costly than traditional loans because they are rising-debt loans. The interest is added to the principal loan balance each month. So, the total amount of interest owed increases significantly with time as the interest compounds. Reverse mortgages use up all or some of the equity in a home. That leaves fewer assets for the homeowner and his or her heirs. Lenders generally charge origination fees and closing costs; some charge servicing fees. How much is up to the lender. Interest on reverse mortgages is not deductible on income tax returns until the loan is paid off in part or whole. Because homeowners retain title to their home, they remain responsible for taxes, insurance, fuel, maintenance, and other housing expenses. A          GETTING  GOOD D  EAL  If you decide to consider a reverse mortgage, shop around and compare terms. Look at the:   annual percentage rate (APR), which is the yearly cost of credit.   Facts for Consumers   type of interest rate. Some plans provide for fixed rate interest; others involve adjustable rates that change over the loan term based on market conditions. number of points (fees paid to the lender for the loan) and other closing costs. Some lenders may charge steep costs, which your lender may offer to finance. However, if you agree to this, you'll take out fewer proceeds from the loan or you'll borrow an extra amount, which will be added to your loan balance and you'll owe more interest at the end of the loan. total amount loan cost (TALC) rates. The TALC rate is the projected annual average cost of a reverse mortgage, including all itemized costs. It shows what the single allinclusive interest rate would be if the lender could charge only interest and no fees or other costs. payment terms, including acceleration clauses. They state when the lender can declare the entire loan due immediately.    Also, be cautious about reverse mortgages offered by door-to-door and other home solicitation lenders. There have been various problems with these types of lenders. Some of the problems have involved steep points and loans that primarily seek to take the owner's equity. You generally have at least three business days after signing a reverse mortgage contract to cancel it. The cancellation must be in writing.  REPORTING POSSIBLE F  RAUD    If you suspect that a lender is violating the law, register your concerns with the lender or loan servicer. You also may wish to file a complaint with:   your state Attorney General's office or state banking regulatory agency the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). File a complaint online at www.ftc.gov or call toll-free 1-877-FTC-HELP (1-877-3824357).      Under the federal Truth in Lending Act, lenders must disclose these terms and other information before you sign the loan. On plans with adjustable rates, they must provide specific information about the variable rate feature. On plans with credit lines, they must inform the applicant about appraisal or credit report charges, attorney's fees, or other costs associated with opening and using the account. Be sure you understand these terms and costs. Reverse mortgages come with different provisions. For example, with some reverse mortgages, the lender may take a share of equity appreciation. This could create issues for the homeowner or heirs, particularly if the value of the home rises unexpectedly during the loan. Carefully read any provision of the contract about shared appreciation.

Chairman Lazio’s bill -- The Housing Programs Extension Act of 1997 -- includes legislative language authorizing the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) to issue regulations protecting senior homeowners from being charged excessive or unnecessary fees in the reverse mortgage application process. The legislative language initially was part of the managers amendment to Lazio’s sweeping housing reform bill, H.R. 2 -- The Housing Opportunity and Responsibility Act of 1997 -- which passed the House in May by a vote of 293 to 132.     ""This bill will provide security and peace of mind for senior citizens who want a reverse mortgage, and will help prevent seniors from being scammed by third-party companies,"" said Lazio, who managed the bill on the House Floor. ""We must no longer tolerate white-collar muggings of America’s seniors who want to stay in their homes and in the neighborhoods they care about, and this bill does that.""    Chairman Lazio introduced his bill after receiving reports that seniors applying for reverse mortgages were being charged up to 10% of the total loan amount for ""estate-planning services"" from third-party service providers. In some cases, this amounted to as much as $10,000 for simply driving homeowners to the bank and sitting with applicants during discussions with the lender. Lazio initially expressed his outrage concerning these charges in a letter to HUD Secretary Andrew Cuomo and a subsequent HUD investigation confirmed these charges.    ""By law, participants in the program are required to attend counseling sessions provided by HUD at no cost,"" Lazio said. ""I do not accept as legitimate costs for services, fees in excess of 8% of the mortgage amount for what may amount to little more than guiding seniors through these counseling discussions.

Reverse mortgages allow seniors aged 62 and more who are ""house-rich"" but ""cash-poor"" to borrow against the equity in their homes to help pay for living and medical expenses or crucial home repairs. For many, the reverse mortgage program provides seniors with the opportunity to remain in their own neighborhoods, close to family and friends, instead of being forced to live in nursing homes.     Last year, Chairman Lazio was able to reauthorize the Federal Housing Administration’s reverse mortgage program that allows lenders to offer Home Equity Conversion Mortgages (HECM) until the year 2000, expand the number of available reverse mortgages from 25,000 to 50,000, and make one- to four-family residences eligible. The program has helped make the American dream of homeownership a continued reality for more than 20,000 eligible seniors.

Utilizing the reverse mortgage program, the Gwynns were able to make substantive improvements to their home.     Chairman Lazio was commended by the American Associations of Retired Persons for ""moving so promptly to put a stop to the exploitive behavior of those who would prey upon our vulnerable elderly,"" and by the National Association of Mortgage Brokers for ""taking steps to protect senior citizens from excessive and unnecessary costs in obtaining reverse mortgages.""     The Housing Programs Extension Act of 1997 also extends certain non-controversial public and assisted housing reform measures for 12 months. The reforms were initially extended for six months but were extended for a full year at the request of House Banking Committee members.    ""The reverse mortgage program in the simplest of terms ensures the quality of life for older Americans who are usually on fixed incomes,"" Lazio said.

You pay participants who got into the scheme before you and then try to recoup your investment and make a profit through the recruitment of other participants after you.  Such schemes are illegal under both state and federal law.     They also happen to be a bad idea.  First, as a pyramid scheme, the program is bound to die out.  People who are just getting into the scheme when this happens lose the monies they invested to get in.   It is a gamble, and that is one reason the law prohibiting chain and pyramid schemes is found in the gambling section of the North Carolina Criminal Code.   Chain letters are a bad idea for another reason.  Most people who participate in them do not declare their earnings for tax purposes.  Nevertheless, their participation in the scheme is easy to spot due to the fact that they have put their names and addresses on hundreds of mailings which are circulating around the country and, in some cases, finding their way to government agencies.  The resulting audits, taxes and penalties can easily wipe out the fun and the profit of participating in the scheme.     As you read the chain letter reprinted below, note the concerted effort to convince readers the scheme is legal.  The ""attorney"" says that providing a service (putting someone on a supposed mailing list) makes the scheme legal. This is not necessarily so.  North Carolina's pyramid and chain scheme statute, NC Gen. Stat. Sect. 14-291.2, states that providing a service or product is immaterial if the main purpose of the scheme is getting participants to pay money so they can make money through the recruitment of other participants.      TEXT OF LETTER    GET OUT OF DEBT FAST!                            This program is completely legal                                                            Refer to Title 18, Sections 1302 & 1342                                                        US Postal Service and Lottery Laws   Dear Friend,   Greetings!  I hope that you will take this opportunity to earn money instead of throwing money away on lottery tickets.   I am a retired attorney, and about two years ago a man came to me with a letter.  It was basically the same letter you have in your hands.  He asked me to verify that this letter was legal to do.  I told him I would review it and get back to him.  When I first read it, I thought it was some off-the-wall idea to make money.  A week and a half later, we met to discuss the issue.  I told him the letter he originally brought me was not 100% legal.  I advised him to make a small change and it would be all right.   I was still curious about the letter, so he told me how it works.  I thought it was a long shot (like the lottery), and decided against participating, but I asked my client to keep me updated as to his results.  Two months later he called to tell me he received over $800,000.00 cash!  I didn't believe him so he asked me to try his idea and find out for myself.  I thought I didn't really have anything to lose, so I asked for a copy of the letter.  I followed the instructions exactly, mailed out 200 copies, and sure enough, the money started arriving!  It came slowly at first, but after three weeks I was getting more mail than I could open in a day!  After about three months, the money finally stopped coming.  I kept a precise record of my earning and, at the end, it totaled $968,493.00 in cash!   I was making a good living as a lawyer, but as anyone in the legal profession will tell you, there is a lot of stress that comes with this job.  I told myself that if things worked out, I would retire from my practice and play golf.  I decided to try the letter again, but this time sent out 500 letters.  Three months later I had $2,344,178.00!  I just couldn't believe it.   I met with my old client again to find out how it worked.  He told me that there are six names on the letter, not four or five like most others.  That fact alone results in your name being on far more returns.  The other was the help I gave him in making sure that the whole thing was legal, since nobody want to risk doing something illegal.  I bet by now you are curious to know what little change I told him to make.  Well, to be legal in sending a letter out, you must actually sell something in return, so when you send a dollar to each of the six people on your list, you must include a slip of paper with the words, ""Please put me on your mailing list,"" and include your mailing address.  You do not need to include your name.  This is the key to the program!   When only a small percentage of people follow the simple instruction exactly, in less than three months, you should receive over $800,000.00 GUARANTEED!       Immediately send $1.00 cash to each of the six people on the list below.  Wrap a dollar  bill in  in a note saying, ""Please add me to your mailing list"" and include your address.  Put each  person's corresponding number in the lower left corner of the envelope (the person in the #6  position should have a number 6 on the envelope).  As the cash comes in, the participants can  track their success.  Remove the name that is the first on the list (#1) and move the rest of the names up one  position.  Then place  your name in the #6 space.  This is done best by typing a new list, and  taping or gluing it over the old one.  Important!  Double check ot make sure you get all the  names, addresses and zip codes correct when you retype.  When you have completed the above instructions, make 200 copies of this page.  The more  you send out, the better the results.  Please do not change this letter, except for adding your  name and moving the other names up.    Order 200 (or more) names from the S. E. Ring Mailing List, PO Box 15081, Ft. Lauderdale,  FL 33318 or call (954)742-9519 and use your credit card ($16.00 for 100/$70 for 500  gummed labels).  While waiting for your list to arrive, place your copies in envelopes, stamp and seal them.  do not put your return address on the envelopes.  This will pique the curiosity of the  receiver.  When your mailing list arrives, place a gummed label on each of the envelopes and drop them  the mailbox.  Within 90 days you should receive over $800,000.00 in CASH! This is a  legal transaction. Keep a copy of this letter so you can use it a second time.  Mail it out again in about six  months, but mail it to the addresses received for each dollar.  It will work again, only much  better.     Here is how the system works:   Assume, for example, you get a 7.5% return rate, which is conservative (my first attempt was about 9.5% and my wife's was 11%).     When you send out 200 letters, 15 people will send you  $1.00...................................$15.00   Those 15 mail out 200 letters each, and 225 people send you  $1.00.........................$225.00  Those 225 mail out 200 letters each, and 3,375 people send you  $1.00.................$3,375.00  Those 3,375 mail out 200 letters each, and 50,625 people send you  $1.00..........$50,625.00  Those 50,625 mail out 200 letters each, and 759,375 people send you  $1.00...$759,375.00  At this point your name will drop from the list, but you will have  received......$813,615.00     It works every time, but how well depends on how many letters you send out.  In the above example you send out 200 letters.  If you had mailed out 500 letters, in this example, you would receive $2,006.917.00.  This is over 2 million dollars.  Check the math yourself.  With this kind of return, you'v got to do it.  Just be sure to send a dollar to each of the 6 names on the list with a note asking to be added to their mailing list.  This is a legal way of earning money without trying to sell something that no one needs.  It's easy and requires very little time, effort, or money.  Think of it as an investment in your future and family's security.   Be sure to mail $1.00 each of the names on the list below:      S. Ackerman (address deleted)    W. Garner (address deleted)    H. Williams (address deleted)    L. Nance (address deleted)    B. Bredding (address deleted)     J. Meers (address deleted)   (End of text of letter)"
GX236-76-2574492	"NEWS RELEASE  Office of Maryland Attorney General J. Joseph Curran, Jr.       September 1, 2000   Media Inquiries: Sean Caine 410-576-6357      BALTIMORE CITY STOCK SWINDLER SENTENCED   Unlicensed Investment Advisor Defrauded Over 400 People    Baltimore  - Attorney General J. Joseph Curran, Jr. announced today the conviction of an unlicensed Baltimore City investment advisor on criminal fraud charges. E. Robins Rich, 79, entered a guilty plea today before the Honorable Joseph McCurdy in Baltimore City Circuit Court in which he admitted swindling over 400 people out of over a million dollars in a complicated investment scam he operated for at least seven years.  In light of his advanced age, the judge sentenced Mr. Rich, who currently resides in Temple Terrace, Florida, to a term of ten years, with all but three years suspended, to be served in a home detention program. He also ordered Rich to not give investment advice to others or handle the money or investments of others.   In September 1999, the Maryland Securities Division shut down Rich's investment company, Starboard Associates, of 516 N. Charles Street, and a judge placed Starboard into receivership. A Receiver appointed by the Court is continuing to marshal the company's remaining assets for eventual distribution to victims whose claims are validated.    The charges to which Rich pleaded guilty are that from 1992 until 1999 he operated a fraudulent investment scam in which he offered investors a pooled investment in monthly ""programs.""  The ""programs"" were described as relatively risk free, because of the supposed ""hedge"" of investing 80% in a money market account and 20%  in stock options. Each program was to mature in three to 12 months.  At maturity, Rich would offer to roll over an investor's supposed profits into a new program. The investigation disclosed, however, that of $13.96 million in investor funds taken in, only $1.18 million was actually invested. The rest was used to pay off earlier investors, and to finance a failing T-shirt company owned by Rich's son. Over $1.4 million of investor funds were diverted to that company, which eventually went under. Moreover, the investments Rich did make lost money in the market.    Throughout the time covered by the criminal charges, Rich published fraudulent investment statements to his investors, misrepresenting the investments made and exaggerating their profits.  These misrepresentations encouraged many investors to continue investing with him rather than liquidate their investments.  Investigation has shown that Rich was steadily losing money on his investments and was using money from new investors to pay off earlier investors seeking to cash out. However, by mid-1999, there wasn't enough money to keep ahead of the withdrawal requests. Complaints were filed with the Securities Division, which began an investigation.           According to Attorney General Curran, ""Mr. Rich was running a classic Ponzi scheme, encouraging new investors to give him money which he then used to pay off old investors rather than make the investments as promised."" Curran said that despite Rich's advanced age, it was important to proceed with the prosecution on behalf of the victims; since Rich turns 80 this month, however, the State agreed that home detention was the most appropriate form of punishment.   Rich was not registered with the Maryland Securities Division as an investment advisor nor did he register any of the investments he was offering the public, as required by law. Curran recommended that investors call the Securities Division at 410-576-6360 before they invest to find out whether their investment advisor, broker and securities are registered.   ###"

Gifting programs are pyramid schemes that are specifically outlawed by state law, Morrison said.         ""We need to stop these programs and the people promoting them before any more Montanans lose their hard-earned money,"" Morrison said. ""Many Montanans have been deceived into believing these are legitimate, legal programs, but they aren't and people stand to lose their money if they participate.""         The order alleges the women held a recruitment meeting in Heidi Wadsworth's home with 80 to 100 women in attendance. Some individuals gave money to the program and later asked that it be returned, but their funds were not returned as requested. The order notes that because the people being recruited by the women were expecting compensation as a result of joining and that no products or services had been exchanged, the program is a pyramid scheme, which is inherently fraudulent and illegal.          Morrison, Montana's Securities Commissioner, said his office has learned that Montanans are being solicited to pay $3,000 to join this and similar pyramid schemes. He said promises are made to recruits that they will receive $24,000 if they recruit additional members. Morrison said his office has received information that organizers of the program recruit new members by mischaracterizing their investments as a gift or a legal investment, saying they can avoid paying taxes on profits and that it is legal under the Montana Securities Act.         Morrison encourages people participating in the programs to stop, request their original payment be returned, and if they have been given money, to return it to those who paid them. Participants also should contact the State Auditor's Office at 1-800-332-6148 if they have information about a pyramid scheme.         ""Our objective is not to prevent consumers from getting ahead financially in these difficult economic times,"" Morrison said. ""In fact, we often make financial literacy presentations and work to educate Montanans about the importance of informed saving and investing. But regardless of how these programs are pitched, the bottom line is that they are illegal.""         People found in violation of the law prohibiting pyramid promotional schemes could face penalties of up to $10,000 per violation and/or 10 years in prison.         ""We do not plan to prosecute every single pyramid scheme participant,"" Morrison said. ""But we do intend to stop individuals who promote and lead recruitment efforts.""          Pyramid schemes are fraudulent because nothing of value is purchased or sold when a person joins the program. Rather, the money is ""recycled"" to existing program participants. Continuation of the program is dependent upon new recruits. Eventually, the pool of people available for recruitment dries up and the pyramid collapses so the people on the lower pyramid tiers never get their money back, let alone make a profit.         The women have 15 days to request a hearing. If they fail to request a hearing, the order shall become permanent and the allegation contained in the order will be declared conclusions of law.         Anyone with information about the gifting program or questions about other investment opportunities should call the State Auditor's Office at 1-800-332-6148.                                                                                          ###                  -MORE-"

K.C. Smith,  Civil Action No. 2:03-CV-173 (E.D. Tenn.)    SEC Sues Spammer Who Created Fictitious Government Entity, Used SEC Seal in Internet Investment Scam    The United States Securities and Exchange Commission today filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Tennessee charging 20-year-old Oak Grove, Kentucky resident K.C. Smith with fraudulently raising $102,554 by falsely guaranteeing double-digit monthly returns on two websites and in approximately nine million spam e-mail messages.  Without admitting or denying the allegations made by the Commission, Smith consented to an order requiring him to pay $107,510 in disgorgement and pre-judgment interest and enjoining him from violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.    The complaint alleges that between May 2002 and February 2003 Smith created websites for two fictitious investment opportunities, including a site for Kryer Financial, a fictitious investment company offering double-digit monthly returns on investments purportedly insured by the ""United States Deposit Insurance Corporation"" or ""USDIC,"" another entity invented by Smith.  Smith is also alleged to have created a website for the USDIC featuring the Commission's official seal and claiming that investments through Kryer Financial were fully insured against loss.  According to the complaint, none of the money Smith raised through the sites was invested and none of it was insured; Smith used the money he raised to pay his personal living expenses.    The complaint further alleges that Smith promoted the fictitious investment opportunities in nine million spam e-mail messages and that he took careful steps to conceal his identity, including calling potential investors on disposable cellular telephones, using stolen service provider accounts to access the internet, and collecting investor funds through online payment services that maintain payee confidentiality.    The Commission acknowledges the assistance of the Texas State Securities Board in the investigation of this matter.

Under the Agency's program no repayment is required until the homeowner          no longer occupies the home as their principal residence. The loan plus          all accrued interest can be prepaid, but generally is repaid from the          proceeds from the sale of the home. Any funds remaining after repayment          of the loan are paid to the borrower or their estate.                              PURPOSE:  To            provide eligible homeowners a monthly income, a line of credit, or a            combination thereof from the equity in their homes.                            ELIGIBLE BORROWERS:             Persons 62 years of age or older who own their home. Any existing lien            must be paid at time of closing.                            ELIGIBLE PROPERTIES:             One unit dwelling, 2- to 4-family dwellings (borrower must reside            in one of the units), and HUD approved condominiums. Property must be            borrowers' principal residence and remain their primary residence for            the life of the loan.                            APPLICATION            FEE:  $300 (covers partial cost of appraisal) credited toward closing            cost.                          ORIGINATION            FEE:  $1,800 paid at the time of closing or the option to pay fee            from proceeds of loan.                            MORTGAGE INSURANCE:             HMFA offers the Home Equity Conversion Mortgage (HECM). The HECM            Program requires a MIP of 2% of the principal limit amount and annual            premiums of 1/2% per year on the outstanding mortgage loan balance.                                       CLOSING COSTS:             May be included in the loan. Costs include title search and insurance,            survey, recording fees, legal fees, the HECM 2% mortgage insurance premium,            and other normal and reasonable closing expenses.                           SERVICING            FEE:  A fee in the amount of $25 will be charged monthly to service            the account.                            INTEREST RATE:             Rate for the basic annual adjustable FHA Home Equity Conversion            Mortgage is tied to the 1-year US Treasury Security rate plus the FHA            margin. The rate cannot increase more than 5% over the life of the loan            and cannot increase by more than 2% in any year. Other terms apply if            the borrower chooses a monthly adjustable rate plan.                            PRINCIPAL            LIMIT:  The principal limit at origination is based on the age of            the youngest borrower, the expected average mortgage interest rate and            the maximum claim amount. The maximum claim amount is set at the lesser            of the appraised value or the maximum principal amount allowed by county.            The limit is based on a one family dwelling that can be insured by FHA.                                                                                 TENURE:                 The borrower will receive equal monthly payments from the lender                for as long as the borrower occupies the property as a principal                residence.                                   TERM:                 The borrower will receive equal monthly payments for a fixed                period selected by the borrower.                                    LINE OF                CREDIT:  The borrower will receive the mortgage proceeds in unscheduled                payments or installments, at the times and in the amount of the                borrower's choosing, until the line of credit is exhausted.                                    MODIFIED                TERM OR TENURE:  The borrower may combine a line of credit with                monthly payments. In exchange for reduced monthly payments, the                borrower will set aside a specified amount at closing for a line                of credit, on which he or she can draw until the line of credit                is exhausted.                                                           The borrower              may change the above type of payment plan throughout the life of the              loan. A fee of $20 will be incurred for a change. (A draw under an              existing line of credit does not result in a new payment plan.) Examples              of changes to a payment plan may include the borrower receiving an              unscheduled payment, suspending payments or receiving the entire net              principal limit remaining in a lump sum payment.               Figure sheets              can be done upon request for the plans available.               If either of              the term plans are selected the borrower may remain in the home without              starting repayment. Borrowers cannot be forced to sell or vacate the              home as long as it is their principal residence.                           REQUIRED INFORMATION            MEETING:  The borrower will be required to attend an information            meeting as required by a  HUD approved Housing            Information Agency  before the loan application is taken for the            HECM Program. These sessions will focus on the different types of home            equity conversion mortgages available, the suitability of a home equity            conversion mortgage, and the alternatives to a home equity conversion            mortgage.                                                  MORTGAGE              DUE AND PAYABLE:  A mortgage becomes due and payable when:               A. The borrower              no longer occupies the property as his or her principal residence;              B. The borrower does not occupy the property for 12 months for health              reasons;              C. The borrower is deceased; and              D. The borrower violates the mortgage covenants.

GX236-01-1201846	"NEWS RELEASE  Office of Maryland Attorney General J. Joseph Curran, Jr.                   January 25, 2001   Media Inquiries: Sean Caine 410-576-6357            CURRAN ORDERS INTERNET SHOPPING MALL          TO CEASE BUSINESS, ALLEGES ""ECB4U"" IS PYRAMID SCHEME          Baltimore  - Attorney General J. Joseph Curran, Jr. announced          today that his offices Securities Division has taken action against the          owner and top promoters of an ""Internet shopping mall"" that the Securities          Division alleges to be an unlawful pyramid scheme. The Securities Commissioner          issued a Summary Order to Cease and Desist against Powercard International,          Inc. of Daphne, Alabama, doing business as ECB4U, its founder, Stewart          ""Bubba"" Giardina, and eight individuals who actively promoted ECB4U from          an office called E Commerce Solutions, located on Green Meadow Drive in          Timonium, Maryland.        ECB4U operates what it represents to be a network marketing program that          allows representatives to earn commissions from transactions through ECB4Us          Internet shopping mall. According to the Division, ECB4U promoters recruit          new representatives to become ""E Commerce Trainers,"" by paying $450 for          an ECB4U shopping website and the opportunity to earn commissions in ECB4Us          marketing plan. The Securities Division alleges, however, that ECB4Us          operation and commission system is based primarily on the recruitment          of new participants through high-energy sales pitches and that earnings          have little to do with the Internet shopping mall, which is simply a collection          of hyperlinks to the websites of unaffiliated retail merchants. The Order          states that ECB4Us top promoters represent that new participants can          earn substantial amounts of money and it quotes one promoter saying that          ""the money can be absolutely ridiculous."" ECB4U, formerly called KM.Net,          began operations in Maryland in September 2000 and has recruited more          than one hundred Maryland participants to date.        In the Order, the Securities Division alleged that ECB4U and eight top          promoters in Maryland violated the anti-fraud and registration provisions          of the Maryland securities laws by soliciting Maryland residents to participate          in an unlawful pyramid scheme. Among those named in the action is Edward          Lamont of Emporium, Pennsylvania, described in the Order as being at the          top of the ECB4U pyramid and the role model for new representatives. Those          named in the action have 15 days in which to answer the allegations in          the Order and to request a hearing.        ""The Internet offers unlimited opportunities,"" said Curran. ""Unfortunately,          the Internet also offers scam artists new ways to seek to defraud people.          Unlike legitimate multilevel marketing, pyramid schemes offer no product,          or a product of dubious value. We issued the Summary Order in this case          to prevent ECB4U from luring more Maryland participants.""        Last year, Currans office, along with the Federal Trade Commission and          seven other states, sued Equinox International Inc. of Las Vegas, Nevada          alleging it to be an unlawful pyramid scheme. Equinox enlisted several          hundred thousand of distributors in the United States before the lawsuit          ended its operation. A court appointed receiver is liquidating Equinox          assets as part of a settlement estimated to net approximately $35 million          to claimants.        Curran reminded investors to call the Securities Division at 410-576-6360          before they invest to find out if a program complies with the law. Even          when an investment program looks reasonable, and friends and family trust          the promoter, it is better to take a few minutes to verify the status          of the promoters.         ###"

Joseph Curran, Jr.       June 13, 2000   Media Inquiries: Sean Caine 410-576-6357      Curran Obtains Injunction Against Prince George's Investment Company Charged with Securities Violations and Investment Fraud    Baltimore  - Attorney General J. Joseph Curran, Jr., announced today that the Securities Division of his office has obtained a permanent injunction order against Capital Concepts, Inc., of Prince George's County  and its president Rachel Reed Chittams, charged with violating Maryland's securities laws by operating a fraudulent investment scheme involving millions of dollars.    The order, issued by Circuit Court Judge Michele D. Hotten, also maintains a freeze of the defendants' assets and continues the work of the receiver in gathering and accounting for investor funds.  Capital and Chittams consented to the order, without admitting or denying violation of the Securities Act. ""This relief by the Court will not only halt the unlawful solicitation of investors and the loss of their money,"" Curran stated, ""but eventually may lead to the return of some funds to investors and other creditors.""                         Curran's office began its investigation following an inquiry from a potential investor. That investigation revealed that neither the company, its investments, or its promoters were registered with the Securities Division as required by Maryland law. ""That inquiry by an investor before committing her money not only prevented her loss,"" Curran emphasized, ""but also was the catalyst for an action that prevented the loss of countless other investors' funds.""   Curran says the Securities Division filed suit not only to halt the registration violations, but also because the Capital investment program had the indications of a ""ponzi scheme;"" there was no business or investment to generate the profits promised to investors, but rather the money invested was used to repay previous investors, and so on.  The accountant's analysis showed that over 400 investors had placed over $5 million with the defendants, upon the promise of rates of return as high as 1000%.  At the time suit was filed and Capital's assets were frozen, there was only about $175,000 in the bank, with over $3 million due investors.   ""It appears that investors will not get back all of their investment,"" Curran explained, ""because their money was not used to generate income with which to repay them.  This case emphasizes the need to verify with the Securities Division - before you invest - that any investment opportunity is registered and has no complaints against it.""    Curran reminded investors that they can contact the Securities Division at 410-576-6494 if they have questions concerning the status of investment promoters or the securities in which they plan to invest.    ###"

Joseph Curran, Jr., announced today that his offices Securities Division obtained a temporary restraining order against a 22-year-old Potomac man and his Bethesda-based company, charging them with operating a Ponzi scheme and using investor money for personal expenses, gifts to friends and payments to family members.   According to the order, issued by Montgomery County Circuit Court Judge Nelson W. Rupp, Jr., all assets of John St. Augustine McDonald and his two companies, Thornapple Capital and bringmefoodnow.com of 4835 Del Ray Ave., Bethesda, are temporarily frozen and a temporary receiver has been appointed to take control of the companies and assets.   Currans securities division alleges that McDonald violated Marylands securities laws by offering and selling unregistered investments to approximately 100 investors and by acting as an unregistered securities agent and investment adviser.  The complaint alleges that investors thought they were putting money into limited partnerships so that McDonald could trade in stocks and options on their account.  McDonald was to share in any profits, but investors would bear the losses.   According to the complaint, McDonald allegedly created fraudulent statements showing high rates of return to induce investors to keep their money in the program and to solicit more money for the program, when in fact, no profits were generated.  When McDonald closed out the partnerships last fall, he induced investors to roll their investments into his start-up internet food delivery service and into publicly traded companies that he offered at below-market prices.  It appears that most of the investment money was used for personal expenses, such as limousines, trips and gifts for friends and family.   ""We had to bring a receivership action quickly in this case to protect investors monies,"" said General Curran.  ""By placing the companies and McDonald into receivership, we can trace the funds in this scheme and preserve the remaining assets for investors.""   Curran emphasized that the Securities Division is continuing its investigation and urges anyone who invested funds with McDonald and his companies, or who has information concerning the investment program, to call the Securities Division of his office at (410) 576-6360.   Curran reminded investors to call the Securities Division before they invest to find out whether their investment adviser, broker and securities are registered.  Even when an investment program looks reasonable, and friends and family trust the promoter, its better to take a few minutes to verify the status of the promoters.

GX267-19-9678131	"For Informational Purposes Only  Home Equity Conversion Mortgages (HECM) (aka: Reverse Mortgages) FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS  W  HAT IS IT?  A Home Equity Conversion Mortgage (HECM), frequently called a ""reverse mortgage,"" was created as a way for senior citizens, over the age of 62, to convert the equity in their home to cash utilizing flexible programs that meet their personal financial needs. W HAT OCCURS?  A HECM mortgage is designed to produce one of the following options: regular monthly income for life; income for a specific number of years; a line of credit; or, lump sum payment. The senior citizen continues to enjoy homeownership, and no repayment of the loan is required as long as the senior continues to reside in the property. I S THE INCOME TAX FREE?  Yes, income derived from the loan is tax-free. W ILL I BE ABLE TO SELL MY HOME  ?  Yes, the senior remains the owner of the home and may sell it and move at any time, keeping the sales proceeds that exceed the mortgage balance. Likewise, the borrower may not be forced to sell to pay off the mortgage, even if the mortgage balance grows to exceed the value of the property. W HEN IS THE LOAN REPAID?  A the loan will owe balance W  HECM loan need not be repaid until the borrower moves, sells, or dies. When is paid, should it exceed the value of the property, the borrower (or their heirs) no more than the value of the property itself. FHA insurance will cover any due the lender.  HAT ARE SOME OF THE FEES?  Two mortgage insurance premiums are collected to pay for the HECM mortgage: an up-front premium (2% of the home's value), which may be financed by the lender; and, a monthly premium (equal to 0.50% per year of the mortgage balance). Seniors interested in this program should also inquire as to any loan origination charges a lender will be charging. Normal fees for inspections or appraisals would also apply, but may be financed.  For Informational Purposes Only   For Informational Purposes Only  W  HAT ARE SOME OF THE GENERAL REQUIREMENTS?  All borrowers must be over the age of 62. To be eligible the home can be a single-family residence, a one-to-four unit building with one unit occupied by the borrower, a manufactured home (mobile home), a unit in an FHA approved condominium, or a unit in a planned unit development. The property must meet FHA standards, but the senior can pay for any required repairs using the reverse mortgage itself. Due to concerns of fraudulent lending practices, the program requires seniors receive FREE counseling from a HUD approved mortgage counseling agency, prior to application. For more information on this counseling, HUD may be reached at 888-4663487. HOW DO I QUALIFY  ?  Unlike conventional mortgages, the HECM mortgage does not require you to ""qualify"" in the traditional manner. Credit history is generally not a factor. Existing home mortgages, deferred taxes or any federal debt must be paid in full, but can also be paid from the proceeds of the loan itself. W HERE DO I APPLY OR GET MORE INFORMATION?  Senior homeowners who meet the eligibility requirements above can apply through an FHA approved lending institution, which in turns submits the application to the local HUD field office for approval. To obtain a current listing of lenders who participate in this program, please visit HUD's website at: http://www.hud.gov/progdesc/hecm--df.cfm and click ""searchable listing"" under the application section. HUD may be reached by phone at 888-466-3487. CAN I APPLY FOR A ""HECM"" MORTGAGE WITH AHFC?  Alaska Housing Finance Corporation does not offer HECM mortgages. The program is only offered through HUD and approved local lenders.  For Informational Purposes Only"

No lender shall           accept telephone applications, provided, however,  that                      this shall not limit  a           lender's ability to solicit and accept inquiries about its  products from potential borrowers.                       No lender shall           request or accept a confession of judgment from  an applicant or            mortgagor(s).

All lenders must           comply with all applicable Federal laws and regulations, including           but  not limited to the           applicable sections of the Truth in Lending Act,  the Equal Credit Opportunity            Act and the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act.                       Prior to the closing           of a reverse mortgage loan, the only charge  a lender may           collect from  an applicant(s) is an application fee which must be designated           as  such and which may not be a  percentage of the principal amount of the loan           or           amount financed.  The fee           shall be reasonably  related           to the services to be performed.                       The maximum loan to           value ratio for any loan projected at the  time of loan closing           shall  not exceed 80           percent of the anticipated value of the property at anticipated loan           maturity or at  any time           prior thereto. The loan to value ratio           shall be calculated  by           dividing the numerator, as  defined           in paragraph (1) of this           subdivision, by the denominator,  as defined in paragraph (2) of this subdivision.                                       The numerator of the           ratio shall include all principal, all accrued  loan interest,           all fees,  costs and           payments incurred in connection with the origination of  the loan including but not            limited to charges for the purchase of           annuities, the payment of  real           estate taxes and insurance  to           the extent that an escrow           account is established to fund real  estate tax and insurance obligations           or the lender has committed to advance funds to pay for  such taxes           and insurance on  the property securing the reverse mortgage and any shared           appreciation  assuming:                                       no           early prepayment of the reverse mortgage loan;                                              any loan amounts,           such as credit lines and reserve accounts, which  may be drawn           at  the discretion of the           mortgagor(s) or by the lender are drawn fully at           the earliest opportunity;                       the current interest           rate if fixed or, if variable, the yearly  average of           the base index  and margin           chosen by the lender for the eight-year period preceding  the loan closing; and                       if applicable, a           projected appreciation or depreciation rate for  home prices           which is  determined by           the same factor as is used in the denominator set forth  in paragraph (2) of this            subdivision.                                       The denominator of           the ratio shall be determined by increasing  or decreasing           the  appraised value of           the real property (as determined at loan closing  by an independent certified            or licensed appraiser as provided for in article           6-E of the Executive  Law)           by a factor that the  creditor           reasonably believes will be the           average annual increase  or           decrease in the value of the real           property securing the reverse mortgage loan from the loan closing            until the anticipated loan  maturity; provided, however, that this factor shall in no           event           exceed  the average of the           yearly  changes in the           Consumer Price Index for Shelter for either           the Buffalo  Area or New           York- Northern New Jersey-Long Island-Connecticut           Area for the eight years  preceding           the year in  which the loan is made without           the superintendent's prior written  approval. In determining            which of the two areas to use, the lender shall use either the           area  in           which the real property is  located           or the area which is closest to the real property. 1                       For a term loan, the           anticipated loan maturity shall be the date  of maturity of the loan.                       For a tenure loan,           the superintendent may, in his or her discretion, review           and approve  the data and           assumptions used to establish the anticipated loan           maturity  for each reverse  mortgage loan.                                       As an alternative to           subdivision (d) of this section, the parties  may agree           that the total  obligation           of the mortgagor(s) to the lender arising from the reverse  mortgage loan shall be no            greater than 80 percent of the actual value           of the property at maturity.  The           80 percent cap shall be  exclusive           of any actual losses           incurred by the lender as a direct  result of a breach of a loan            covenant by the mortgagor(s). The difference between the           principal  and accrued interest and           80  percent of the actual           value of the property at maturity shall be  known as ""equity participation"".                       The           mortgagor(s) may           prepay any loan without penalty at any time.  The payment           of any  fees or charges,           such as a termination fee, that otherwise would be due at maturity           without  prepayment shall           not be deemed a penalty for these or any other           purposes.                       All lenders shall be           prohibited from using or attaching any property  or asset           of the  mortgagor except           the real property securing the reverse mortgage loan           in satisfaction of a reverse  mortgage           obligation.                       In the event that a           lender fails to make or remit to the mortgagor(s)  any payment           required  under any loan           within 15 days of its due date, the lender shall forfeit  twice the interest that would            have been earned on the outstanding           loan principal for the entire  period           during which payments  were suspended,           ceased or made late.                       All lenders must           deliver to all applicants a statement, if available, prepared           by the local or  county           office for the aging on the advisability and availability  of independent counseling and            information services. In addition, no           reverse mortgage loan commitment  or approval shall be  issued           by a lender until the applicant           presents a written statement  that           the terms of the reverse mortgage           loan have been explained by an attorney, a housing and urban development certified            counselor or any other counseling service as indicated on the           statement  supplied by the           county or  local office           for the aging or a signed affidavit indicating           that  the applicant,           although made aware  of           the importance of           counseling and its local availability through  the provision of such           information by the           lender, chooses not to utilize any of the aforementioned available services.                       At the end of the           term for all 280 and 280-a term loans, the mortgagor(s) may           request that  the real           property securing the loan be reappraised to increase the  payments made to the            mortgagor(s)           or to extend the loan term. Except for term           loans insured  by any           agency of the State of New  York,           such reappraisal may be performed at           the lender's sole  discretion.           In all cases, the lender  may require           the mortgagor(s) to pay the cost of such reappraisal  in advance. In the           event the value  of the property has increased, the lender may increase the loan           payments  or extend the loan term  (and,           for term loans insured by any agency of the State of New           York,  must increase the           loan  payment(s) or extend           the loan term), subject to the           following:                                       The loan-to-value           ratio limitations, as determined pursuant to  this Part as           of the date on  which the           increase or extension would begin, shall not be exceeded.                       Any existing           insurance coverage shall be increased to insure the additional amounts to            be due.                       The           mortgagor(s)           shall execute all documents reasonably requested  by the lender           and  pay all reasonable           fees and costs associated with the increase in payments or the           extension of  the loan           term provided that such fees and costs have been previously  disclosed in writing to the            mortgagor(s).                                       The lender and the           mortgagor(s) may agree to establish a reserve  account which           may be  drawn upon by the           mortgagor(s) or the mortgagee to maintain the structural  integrity of the real            property           subject to section 79.8 of this Part,           to pay real estate  taxes           or the premium on any  required           insurance subject to section           79.14 of this Part or for any  personal           expenses of the mortgagor(s).           The reserve account may bear interest at a rate that  is different           from the interest           rate  on other advances           made pursuant to the terms of the reverse           mortgage.  A lender may           only charge  interest on           advances actually made from           the reserve account and not  on           the entire balance in the  reserve           account.                       The           security agreement must include the following:                                                              a           list of termination events;                                              the lender's           obligation to notify the mortgagor(s) in writing  of any event that           could lead  to termination           pursuant to section 79.9(4) and (6) of this Part;  and                       the name of a           third-party, if any, chosen by the mortgagor(s)  to whom the lender           is  obligated to send           written notice of any event that could lead to termination           pursuant to section 79.9 (4) and (6) of this Part.                                       The lender shall also           provide a copy of all foreclosure documents  served on           the  mortgagor(s) to such           third party designated in the security agreement simultaneously  with service on the            mortgagor(s)           or notify the local or county office           for the aging of  its           intent to commence  foreclosure           proceedings if the mortgagor           has not named a third-party.                       Interest shall only           accrue from the time monies are advanced to  or on behalf           of the  mortgagor(s).           Accrued interest may be added to the loan principal.                       A reverse mortgage           loan which provides for the purchase of an  annuity shall comply with            the following conditions as applicable:                                       the company that           issues the annuity must have a rating of excellent  or superior           from  A.M. Best Company           and must be licensed by the State of New York; and                       if a trustee holds           the annuity in trust during the life of the mortgagor(s), then:                                       the trustee must be a           banking organization or an insurance company  which is  incorporated, chartered, organized or licensed under the laws           of  this State or           any other state  or the           United States;                       any out-of-state           trustee must appoint the superintendent as agent  for service           of  process for any matter           arising from a reverse mortgage loan made  to a           New York resident;                         the           trust agreement must provide that it is governed by New York  law;                                              payments derived from           the annuity must be paid by the trustee  directly to the            mortgagor(s) irrespective of whether the payment is made on           behalf  of the lender           or investor;  and                       the           mortgagor(s) must           have a beneficial interest in the trust  irrespective of whether            the lender or investor also has a beneficial interest in the           trust.

For           purposes of this section, repairs necessary  to maintain the structural            integrity shall be limited to repairing structural problems threatening            the continued viability of the  structure as a residential unit and           those           matters which, without  repair,           will threaten to materially  damage           the property           or its market value.                       If the mortgagor(s)           fails to make a repair required to maintain  the structural           integrity of  the real           property in a timely manner, the lender may arrange           for  such repair and pay           for it in the  following           ways:                                       by           deducting necessary amounts from a reserve fund;                                              by withholding from           one or more monthly payments otherwise due  to the mortgagor(s)            no more than 25 percent of each such monthly payment; or                       by adding the amount           to the loan principal. If a reserve fund has been established,           then, to the extent possible,  the           lender must deduct the  cost           of the repair from such           fund before choosing option (2) or (3)  of this subdivision.           If a reserve  fund has not           been established, then the lender may choose whether  to proceed according to option            (2) or (3) of this subdivision or a combination           thereof.                                       Prior to making or           charging the mortgagor(s) for a repair necessary  to maintain           the  structural integrity           of the real property, the lender shall notify the mortgagor(s) of the           problem  and, unless a           threat of imminent danger to life           or property exists,  provide           the mortgagor(s) 90  days           to make the repairs. If the repairs are           not completed by the  mortgagor(s)           in a satisfactory  manner prior           to the end of the appropriate period, the lender may  take such steps as           it views  reasonably necessary to maintain the structural integrity of           the  real property           and charge the  mortgagor(s)           for all reasonable expenses. If an imminent danger to  life or property exists, the            lender may proceed to remedy the           structural integrity of the real  property on as little as 48 hours            notice to           the mortgagor(s).                       The lender shall have           the right to inspect the real property securing  the loan           on 72 hours  notice but           not more often than is reasonably necessary to assure  the continued structural integrity            of the real property.

The           lender's  consent to the arrangements           made pursuant to this paragraph shall  not be unreasonably withheld;                       the           mortgagor(s)           ceases to use the real property as his or her  principal place           of  residence defined as           living and sleeping quarters in excess of 180 days           in any 365 day period;  and                       the           mortgagor(s)           fails to pay real estate taxes or maintain all  insurance required            pursuant to the security agreement.                                       If the mortgagor(s)           fails to pay taxes or maintain all required  insurance, then           the  lender must within 10           business days of learning of such event, give written notice of           such  failure to the           mortgagor(s) and the third-party, if any, designated  by the mortgagor(s) to            receive           notice of any event that could lead to termination. The           lender  must give the  mortgagor(s) 30 calendar days to cure           such           failure. In addition,  the           notice to the  mortgagor(s)           and the third party must           advise the mortgagor(s) of his or  her right to cure.                       The failure to pay           taxes or maintain all required insurance shall  not be construed           to  be a termination event           unless the lender has complied with the provisions  set forth in            subparagraph (i) of this paragraph.                                       the           mortgagor(s)':                                                              filing a voluntary           petition in bankruptcy or effecting a plan  or other arrangement with            creditors under court supervision;                       having an involuntary           petition in bankruptcy filed against the  mortgagor that is not            discharged within 90 days after it is filed; or                       applying for or           permitting the appointment of a receiver, trustee  or custodian           for the  real property           securing the loan which is not discharged within 90  days after the date of            appointment;           provided, however, that the appointment           of a conservator,  guardian,           committee  or other           fiduciary of the person to act on the mortgagor(s)'  behalf in           connection with a  determination by a court that the           mortgagor(s) is incompetent will  not terminate the loan.                                       the           mortgagor(s)           fails to maintain the structural integrity of  the real property, as that            term is defined in section 79.8 of this Part.

In addition, the  lender           shall provide both a  narrative explanation and an           example of the application of its methodology.  This example must            use as its projected real estate appreciation or depreciation           rate  for home prices the           average of  the yearly           changes in the Consumer Price Index for Shelter           for either  the Buffalo           area or the  New           York-Northern New Jersey-Long Island-Connecticut           area for the  eight years           preceding  the year in           which the loan is made.                       Interest accrues from           the time monies are advanced to or on behalf  of the mortgagor(s)            and whether accrued interest is added to the loan principal.                       The only asset of the           mortgagor(s) which may be used by the lender  to satisfy           the loan  is the real           property securing the loan and any limitation thereon  as may be provided for in            section 79.5(e) of this Part.                       The loan may be           prepaid at any time without penalty. The lender  must specify           how the  value of the home           at the time of prepayment will be determined and  the method by which the            then           outstanding loan balance will be prepaid.                       All fees, costs and           payments to be paid by the mortgagor(s) and  whetherthe application            fee is non-refundable.                       The           mortgagor(s)'           right to designate a third party whom the  lender would notify           in  writing of any event           that could lead to termination of the loan and to           whom the lender must  furnish           a copy of any foreclosure documents.                       A description of any           conditions or limitations in connection with  the refinancing           or extension of any loan,           and if applicable, the mortgagor(s)' right           to refinance or extend the loan.                       The interest rate(s)           to be charged on the outstanding principal  under any loan           and  whether the rate(s)           are fixed, variable or both. In addition, in  a term loan with a           fixed rate of  interest,           the lender shall disclose the total interest           payable on  the loan           principal, assuming  maturity           of the loan at expiration of the           term. In a term loan with  a           variable rate of interest, the lender           shall disclose the estimated total interest payable on the  loan principal using the           yearly  average of the           base index and margin chosen by the lender           for the  eight-year period           preceding  the loan           closing and assuming the maturity of the loan           at expiration  of the           term. For tenure  reverse           mortgage loans,           the same disclosures shall be made, except  that maturity shall be           assumed at the           actuarial life expectancy of the mortgagor, or, if  there is more           than one  mortgagor, the younger of the mortgagors.                       If the lender is an           entity identified in section 79.3 of this  Part, the following           notice, or  a notice to           like effect: THE LENDER MAKING THIS REVERSE MORTGAGE LOAN IS IN           COMPLIANCE  WITH THE           CRITERIA ESTABLISHED BY THE NEW YORK SUPERINTENDENT OF  BANKS FOR THE MAKING OF SUCH LOANS.

If applicable, that           the loan provides for the lender to receive  ""equity participation"",           the  maximum total           percentage obligation of the mortgagor(s) to the lender  arising from the reverse            mortgage           loan, what is included in this maximum           and what is excluded  from           it. In addition, the  lender           shall provide both a narrative           explanation and an example  demonstrating           equity participation.

Items (1) through (3) (paragraphs [a][1]-[3] of this section) must       be       furnished       to the  mortgagor(s) on a       separate sheet.

Prior to an applicant's receiving counseling pursuant to            section 79.5(i)       of       this Part, if  available, the       lender shall furnish for term loans, a schedule       of  estimated payments to the  mortgagor(s)       and the total payment in dollars       over       the term of the  loan. For       tenure loans, a  schedule of       estimated payments       to       the mortgagor(s) shall be furnished.  The lender shall label such            schedules       as       ""estimates"". If counseling is not available,  the lender shall make the       foregoing  disclosure prior to or simultaneously with the approval of the       application.                                                Six months prior to the end of a term loan, the lender shall       disclose,  in       writing,       if  applicable:                                                          that the mortgagor(s) will be responsible to make real estate            tax and       insurance  payments; and                                          that the mortgagor(s) will have to vacate his or her home upon            the       expiration       of the  term and the exact       date that such move-out is required.

However, a lender need not do       so       to the extent that it  determines       that there are no or insufficient       applications       for 280-a  loans, the       individuals who apply  for       280-a loans do not       qualify       for such loans, or mortgage insurance  for the principal and any       accrued       but unpaid interest for 280-a loans is not available for  the type of       reverse       mortgage loan  made by the       lender through the private market or any       agency       of the  State of New York.       Such  determination shall be       subject to review       by       the superintendent at  his or       her discretion.                                          A lender shall:                                                          advertise its 280-a loan programs to the same extent as it       advertises  its       280       loan  programs in all the       counties in which the lender makes 280 loans;  and                                         ensure that all advertising materials, including brochures, for            any       reverse       mortgage  loans designed       specifically for New York residents mention       both       the  lender's 280-a and 280  loans and prominently display or state the       lender's       name; and                                          make its promotional materials on its 280-a loans available to            the local       and       county  offices for the aging       and the New York State Office for the Aging,       to       the extent reasonably  requested       by them, in all counties in which the lender       makes       280  loans; and                                          require its loan officers to inform applicants for 280 loans of            the       lender's       280-a loan  programs.                                                          All lenders shall maintain copies of all advertising and       promotional       materials       for all  reverse mortgage       loans for a period of three years commencing       from  the first date that the  material       was used to solicit reverse mortgage       loans.                                                All lenders must maintain an application log for all applications.            In       addition,       the lender  must maintain       rejected mortgage application files for a       minimum       of  three years.                                          Any lender may, at its option, offer only one reverse mortgage            loan       program       provided  such program meets       the requirements of a 280-a loan.                                          Loans made pursuant to 12 USC § 1715z-20 do not fulfill            the requirement       that       a lender  shall make at least       as many 280-a loans as it makes 280 loans       unless  the loan would otherwise  qualify       in all respects as a 280-a loan.

GX233-61-16688120	"Consumer     Services       Informational Brochures       Reverse Mortgage Loans         Introduction       If you, or both you and any person with whom you own real property jointly (such as     your spouse), are over 60 years of age, you may be ""sitting on"" additional     income and you don't even realize it. If you own your own home, you may be able to use it     as a source of income without taking out an ordinary second mortgage or home equity loan.     You may qualify for a ""reverse mortgage loan"".       A reverse mortgage loan is a loan by which older people, whose principal asset is often     a home which might have to be sold in order to provide money for other living expenses,     may borrow on the value (equity) in that home. The loan proceeds are paid by the lender to     the home owner in equal installments (usually monthly), or as needed under a line of     credit, or in one or more lump sum payments or in any combination of these features. This     is the opposite of obtaining and then paying off a conventional mortgage. That is why it     is called a ""reverse mortgage"". Moreover, the home owner does not have to repay     the reverse mortgage loan until the loan ""terminates"" or ends. But, be very     CAREFUL! Not only are these loans complicated, but they can also be inappropriate in     certain situations, especially if you do not have the ability to live independently or you     wish to leave your home to your children after your death. For this reason, the law     provides the opportunity for counseling to borrowers before they take a reverse mortgage     loan, and the Banking Department strongly recommends that borrowers obtain such     counseling.        The New York State Banking Law and the Real Property Law authorize reverse mortgage     loans and set forth the terms and conditions under which such loans may be offered. These     terms and conditions are summarized here. But please remember, this information does not     describe every feature or every reverse mortgage loan product available to you. For     example, two other Reverse Mortgage Loan products are the HUD/HECM reverse mortgage loan     program and the Home Keeper Mortgage program offered by the Federal National Mortgage     Association.             General Provisions       There are several general provisions of a reverse mortgage loan with which you should     be familiar:       (a) You, or both you and any person with whom you own the property jointly such as your     spouse, are considered to be the borrower(s) or the mortgagor(s) on the reverse mortgage     loan.       (b) For certain reverse mortgage loans, you, or both you and any person with whom you     own the property jointly such as your spouse, must be at least 60 years of age. For     certain other reverse mortgage loans, you, or both you and any person with whom you own     the property jointly such as your spouse, must be at least 70 years of age and have a low     income.        (c) The loan is secured by a first mortgage on your home provided that it is a     one-to-four family residence or a condominium. It may not be secured by a lien on a     cooperative apartment.       (d) The loan may be for a fixed number of years which is known as a ""term""     loan, or may be for an undetermined length of time which is known as a ""tenure""     loan. A tenure loan matures solely upon the happening of certain ""termination     events"" including, but not limited to, your death or your ceasing to live in your     home. These termination events are described more fully later.        (e) The loan proceeds are paid to you in equal installments (usually monthly), or as     needed under a line of credit, or in one or more lump sum payments or in any combination     of these features. In some cases, some or all of the loan proceeds may be used to purchase     an annuity which is a type of financial investment that may pay you an income in the     future for a period of years which period is usually measured by your life. The purchase     of an annuity may enable you to have lifetime income irrespective of the term of the loan     or where you later reside.       (f) You or your estate must repay the loan, but the only asset which may be used by the     lender to satisfy the loan is the real property securing the reverse mortgage loan.       (g) There is no financial penalty if you choose to prepay the loan.             Lenders' Responsibilities       Lenders must comply with the laws and regulations governing reverse mortgage loans.     Here are just a few of the lender's obligations of which you should be aware.       (a) The lender must deliver to you, the applicant, at the time of application a     statement prepared by the local or county office for the aging on the advisability and     availability to the borrower of independent counseling and information services, if such a     statement is available.        (b) The lender must disclose to you as the applicant a description of the relevant     features of the reverse mortgage being offered. This should include but is not limited to:         The interest rate to be charged and whether the rate is fixed, variable or both; that         interest accrues from the time monies are advanced to or on behalf of you; and that         interest is compounded;         All fees, costs and payments to be paid by you;         Where applicable, a description of any refinancing features;         The particular events which can terminate the reverse mortgage loan such as death or         moving from the residence; and         Where applicable, a description of any shared appreciation or equity participation         features.                         (c) The lender must provide a toll-free telephone number and the name of a person to     whom applicants and mortgagors may address questions, comments or complaints. If there is     no toll-free telephone number, then the lender must accept collect calls.        (d) Prior to the closing of a reverse mortgage loan, the only charge a lender may     collect from an applicant(s) is an application fee. This fee must be called an application     fee and may not be figured as a percentage of the principal amount of the loan or amount     financed. The amount of the fee should be reasonably related to the services to be     performed.       (e) The maximum ratio of the loan to the anticipated future value of the property, as     projected at the time of loan closing, (i.e., the loan-to-value ratio) should not exceed     80% of the anticipated value of the property at loan maturity.       (f) In the event a lender fails to make or remit to you any payment required under the     loan agreement within fifteen (15) days of the due date, the lender must forfeit twice the     interest that would have been earned on the outstanding loan principal for the entire     period during which payments were suspended, ceased or made late.       (g) The lender must inform you that written complaints can be submitted to the New York     State Banking Department, Mortgage Banking Division, 1 State Street, New York, New York     10004-1417. Telephone number: 1-800-334-3360 (New York State only).             Mortgagor's Responsibilities       Under the regulations, there are also certain things required of you as the     mortgagor(s). IF YOU DO NOT ADHERE TO CERTAIN REQUIREMENTS, THE LENDER MAY HAVE THE RIGHT     TO FORECLOSE ON YOUR PROPERTY AND TAKE IT FROM YOU. It is, therefore, extremely important     to have a complete understanding of all aspects of a reverse mortgage loan.       These are a few of the requirements of which you should be aware:       (a) You are required to maintain the structural integrity (soundness) of the real     property securing the reverse mortgage loan in the same condition as the property is in at     the time of closing, or after repairs have been made for which funds have been disbursed     or set aside at closing.        (b) If there is no escrow account established by the lender, you are required to pay     the real estate taxes and insurance premiums on the property directly.       (c) You must execute all documents reasonably requested by the lender and pay all     permissible fees and costs associated with the increase in payments or the extension of     the loan term, provided that such fees and costs have been previously disclosed in writing     to you.       (d) You and the lender may agree to establish a ""reserve account"". This     account may be drawn upon by you or the lender to maintain the structural integrity of the     real property, to pay real estate taxes or the premium on any required insurance, or for     any personal expenses which you may incur. A lender may only charge interest on advances     of funds actually made from the reserve account and not on the entire balance in the     reserve account.       (e) You have the right to choose a property insurer, but your choice must be acceptable     to the lender. The lender may not unreasonably withhold its consent. However, if you fail     to choose a property insurer in a timely manner or if the insurer is not acceptable to the     lender, then the lender may insure the property with a carrier of its choice.             Termination       Remember to keep in mind that the lender will hold a mortgage on your home. At the end     of the term or upon the occurrence of any one of the termination events described below,     the lender may ""foreclose"" on that mortgage. That is to say, when a termination     event happens, the lender is either repaid from some other asset of yours or the lender     sells the home, takes what is due to it and returns any excess to you or your estate. If     you were planning to leave your home to your children after your death, most likely you     will not be able to do so if you get a reverse mortgage loan. However, remember that the     loan may be prepaid at any time without penalty if you have the funds to do so.       Under the law, the lender is required to inform you of the events which would terminate     the loan and give you an explicit warning, if you have taken out a term loan, that you may     be compelled to move out of your home at the expiration of the term loan.        In addition to the expiration of a term loan, reverse mortgage loans may be terminated     by the lender, but only in the event of any of the following:       (1) the sale, conveyance, transfer or assignment, whether voluntary or involuntary, of     any part of the real property securing the loan or of your rights in the real property;       (2) your death, or if there is more than one mortgagor, then the death of the last     living mortgagor;       (3) you and your joint owner, if any, cease to use the real property as your principal     place of residence, i.e, as your living and sleeping quarters, for 90 consecutive days in     any 365 day period without notifying the lender and making arrangements satisfactory to     the lender for the maintenance of the real property. For example, you could spend up to 90     consecutive days taking a vacation in Florida during the winter months;       (4) you and your joint owner, if any, cease to use the real property as your principal     place of residence, i.e., as your living and sleeping quarters, in excess of 180 days in     any 365 day period. The 180 days do not have to be consecutive and are intended to cover     shorter vacations or stays at rehabilitation centers or nursing homes. Remember, once you     are away from the home for 90 consecutive days, you must notify the lender and seek to     make arrangements satisfactory to the lender, or the lender can foreclose on the reverse     mortgage loan;       (5) you fail to pay real estate taxes or maintain all insurance required pursuant to     the agreement. However, before terminating the loan for this reason, the lender must give     you an opportunity to pay the past-due real estate taxes or insurance premiums;       (6) various legal actions such as you or another person filing a petition for your     bankruptcy;        (7) you fail to maintain the structural integrity of the real property.       Prior to making or charging you for a repair which is deemed necessary to maintain the     structural integrity of the real property, the lender must notify you of the problem and,     unless a threat of imminent danger to life or property exists, the lender must give you 90     days to make the repairs. If an imminent danger to life or property exists, the lender,     with as little as 48 hours notice, may proceed to remedy the problem.              FEES, COSTS AND PAYMENTS AT ORIGINATION       Although we have mentioned an application fee, there are many other fees, costs and     payments that the lender may charge you. The following list contains the ONLY fees, costs     and payments which a lender may charge in connection with the origination of reverse     mortgage loans, other than principal, interest, shared appreciation and equity     participation:       * an application fee;       * a loan origination fee;       * the cost of document preparation;        * the cost of appraising or surveying the property;       * the cost of a title examination, an abstract of title or title insurance;       * the cost of a tax search for tax liens existing at the time of closing if such search     is not included in the title examination;       * the payment to discharge any existing liens on the real property securing the loan;       * the cost of recording the reverse mortgage loan;       * the cost of actual attorney's fees charged to the lender in connection with the     closing of the loan;       * the cost of a credit report;       * the cost of a flood zone search;       * the cost of an inspection to be paid in connection with the origination of the loan     but not subsequent to the loan closing;       * the payment to purchase an annuity;       * the payment for any repairs contracted for, at or before the loan closing,     irrespective of whether such repairs are completed at time of closing and/or whether the     funds are held in escrow;       * a one-time payment for a tax reporting service;       * the cost of purchasing mortgage insurance;       * the payment of real estate taxes and property insurance;       * the cost of mortgage brokerage services (not to exceed three points based on the     value of the real property securing the reverse mortgage loan at the time of loan     closing).       Lenders are not authorized to impose any fee which is not contained in this list. This     is unlike a traditional mortgage loan in which the nature and amount of fees is not     limited, provided that they are disclosed.             FEES, COSTS AND PAYMENTS WHILE THE LOAN IS OUTSTANDING       You must also be aware that during the life of the reverse mortgage loan there are     additional fees, costs and payments that the lender has the right to charge you or require     you to pay directly or add to your loan balance. The following list contains the ONLY     fees, costs and payments which a lender may charge during the loan:       * the cost of purchasing additional mortgage insurance;       * the costs to maintain the structural integrity of the real property securing the     loan;       * the costs of any appraisal for the refinancing or extension of the loan;       * the payment of real estate taxes and property insurance;       * a monthly servicing fee of not more than $30.00.       At the termination of the loan, there may be additional fees, costs or payments. The     lender may charge a termination or maturity fee. This fee would be the actual cost of     arranging for the sale or foreclosure of the real property securing the loan. It may     include the actual broker's fees, advertising costs, moving and/or storage costs and legal     and other fees representing actual fees or costs incurred by the lender. It may not be a     flat percentage fee. All of the above fees may be financed as part of the loan except for     the application fee.             SHARED APPRECIATION AND EQUITY PARTICIPATION       Another consideration to take into account is the possible future appreciation on your     home. The lender and the borrower may agree at the outset to ""shared     appreciation"" or ""equity participation"". Under shared appreciation, the     lender receives an agreed-to percentage of the appreciated value of the loan when the loan     is terminated in addition to the repayment of the principal, accrued interest and any     financed fees. Under equity participation, the lender receives an agreed-to percentage of     the amount the residence is worth at the end of the loan irrespective of whether that     amount is more than or less than the amount borrowed plus accrued interest and any     financed fees.        Under shared appreciation, if the residence increases in value while the reverse     mortgage is outstanding, the lender will receive an agreed-to percentage of the amount of     the increase in the value of the residence. For example, assume that the home is worth     $200,000 when the loan is first made and the lender and borrower agree that the lender     will receive 50% of any appreciation in the value of the home that occurs while the loan     is outstanding. At the end of the loan, assume that the home is worth $300,000. The     appreciation in value is $100,000. The agreement gives to the lender $50,000 or in other     words, the agreed-to 50%. This is in addition to any other money which may be owed to the     lender.       Under equity participation, the lender and the borrower agree to a maximum percentage     of the home value which a lender may collect at the end of the loan. The lender collects     this percentage of the home value  irrespective  of whether that percentage gives to     the lender an amount which is more than or less than the amount borrowed plus accrued     interest and any financed fees. For example, assume that the property is worth $200,000 at     the end of the loan. The amount loaned plus accrued interest and fees is $125,000. The     agreed-to percentage is 75%. The lender would be entitled to receive $150,000. Or, as     another example, assume that the property is worth $100,000 at the end of the loan. The     amount loaned plus accrued interest and fees is $125,000. The agreed to percentage is 75%     and therefore, the lender is only entitled to receive $75,000. Sometimes, the agreement     may state that as a minimum, the lender is entitled to receive the amount loaned without     any interest or fees.              Interest       The interest on a reverse mortgage loan is compounded. This means that you are paying     interest on both the principal and the interest which has already accrued each month.     Compounded interest has a major effect on the amount of your loan balance since it causes     the amount outstanding to grow at an increasing rate. As an example, Table A shows the     impact of compounded interest on a $500.00 monthly payment at an interest rate of 12% per     annum (or 1% per month) for the first year.

The interest rate used in Tables A and B is merely an example of a reverse mortgage     loan with a fixed rate of interest of 12% per annum. The actual interest rate on your loan     may be higher or lower or may be a variable rate of interest.       Perhaps you do not need to borrow this much to supplement your income each month. As     another example, if you only borrow $200.00 per month at 12% per annum, the accrued     interest at the end of the first year would be $162, and at the end of the 10-year period     would be $22,468. Your total loan balance for interest and principal at the end of 10     years would be $46,468.       Be sure to know exactly how much you will need to supplement your income in advance in     order that you are not accruing large amounts of interest on money that you may really not     need.             Conclusion       Reverse mortgages can be of substantial benefit to those senior citizens who are     reasonably healthy, desire to remain in their homes and are ""house-rich"" but     ""cash-poor"". Nonetheless, as stated earlier, it is extremely important to have a     complete understanding of a reverse mortgage loan. Therefore, it is advisable to have     either an attorney, an accountant, a housing and urban development certified counselor, or     other counseling service review the reverse mortgage loan product with you before you make     any decisions.

GX267-93-1281754	Moving Forward With A Reverse Mortgage? No one plans to go broke during retirement. Most seniors fill up their retirement's gas tank and get ready to cruise. But with today's longer life spans, seniors often need more cash to help them motor through their golden years. No one can predict the financial roadblocks that may arise, such as the need for expensive prescriptions or medical procedures. Just one major setback could drain more of those hard-earned retirement dollars than anyone expects. Fortunately, seniors have some options to keep the financial engine running during retirement. One option is the reverse mortgage. This loan allows senior Texans to liquidate the equity in their homes for cash without selling the home or incurring a monthly loan payment. The money can be used to supplement an income, make a purchase, or cover upcoming expenses. How does a reverse mortgage work? The borrower typically chooses from three payment options: 1) one lump sum in cash, 2) equal monthly payments for as long as both borrowers live in the home, or 3) equal monthly payments over time. Repayment is not required until both borrowers move, sell their home, or are deceased. At that time, the lender takes the house as payment for the loan. Sometimes families or heirs arrange to pay off the loan in order to keep the home. Naturally, heirs may object to a reverse mortgage for that reason. Like any other loan, a reverse mortgage accrues interest charges, beginning when the first payment is made to the borrower. Usually a reverse mortgage is an Adjustable Rate Mortgage (ARM), with interest compounded monthly. Are you eligible? To be eligible for a reverse mortgage, a borrower must be 62 or older, own the home outright (or have a low loan balance), and have no other liens against the home. A borrower continues to be responsible for property taxes, homeowners insurance, and upkeep of the home; failure to do so can result in foreclosure. Borrowers are also required to attend financial counseling before closing--a crucial step that helps a borrower avoid paperwork  potholes and learn more about the loan. You can view a list of local credit counseling agencies at www.hud.cc.org/agencies/texas.txt.

SUMMARY                     1. For at least three years, from       approximately April 1997 through the present (the ""relevant       time""), Defendants Pension America, Inc. (""PAI""), Futures       Profit Making, LLC (""FPM""), Selective Futures Management, LLC       (""SFM""), Specialized Commodity Timing, LLC (""SCT""),       Commodity Timing Specialists (""CTS""), Edward Stevenson Kirris,       III (""Kirris""), Leonard G. Nauman d/b/a Nauman Advisory       Services (""Nauman""), and William J. Relf (""Relf"")       (collectively, the ""Defendants"") have solicited, accepted and       pooled more than $600,000 from approximately 36 commodity pool       participants (""investors""), mostly in the Minneapolis and       Brainerd, Minnesota areas, for the purported purpose of trading commodity       futures.                     2. During the relevant time, PAI, FPM, SFM,       SCT, CTS, Kirris, Nauman and Relf, without the benefit of registration       with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (""Commission""),       committed fraud by misappropriating investors' funds intended for       futures trading to their personal use, misappropriating some of the newer       investors' funds to make returns of principal and purported profits       to earlier investors, in a manner akin to a Ponzi scheme, making       misrepresentations of material facts to investors and prospective       investors and issuing false commodity statements to investors, in       connection with the Defendants' operation of four commodity pools,       the FPM, SFM, SCT and CTS pools. Defendants also commingled investor       funds and failed to provide required disclosure documents and to obtain       signed acknowledgements of receipt of disclosure documents from       investors. Thus, Defendants have engaged, are engaging, and are about to       engage in acts and practices which constitute violations of Sections       4b(a)(i) and (iii), 4b(a)(ii), 4m(1), 4n(4) and 4 o (1) of the       Commodity Exchange Act, as amended (""Act""), 7U.S.C.       6b(a)(i) and (iii), 6b(a)(ii), 6m(1), 6n(4) and       6 o (1) (1994), and Regulations 4.20(c), 4.21 and 4.22 promulgated       thereunder, 17 C.F.R.  4.20(c), 4.21 and 4.22 (2000).                     3. During the relevant time, Nauman owned       and operated a company called Kidz First International, Inc.       (""KFI""), which purportedly manufactures, markets and sells       bicycle seats for children. At various times during the past three years,       Nauman transferred pool investor funds, without their knowledge or       consent, to bank and futures trading accounts in KFI's name.                     4. Accordingly, pursuant to Section 6c of       the Act, 7 U.S.C. 13a-1 (1994), the plaintiff, Commission,       brings this action to enjoin such acts and practices, and to compel       compliance with the provisions of the Act and Regulations. In addition,       the Commission seeks an accounting, disgorgement, rescission,       restitution, civil monetary penalties, the appointment of an equity       receiver and such other equitable relief as the Court may deem necessary       or appropriate under the circumstances.                     5. Unless restrained and enjoined by this       Court, the Defendants are likely to continue to engage in the acts and       practices alleged in this Complaint and in similar acts and practices, as       more fully described below.                     II.                     JURISDICTION AND       VENUE                     6. This Court has jurisdiction over this       action pursuant to Section 6c of the Act, 7U.S.C.       13a-1, which authorizes the Commission to seek injunctive       relief against any person whenever it shall appear to the Commission that       such person has engaged, is engaging, or is about to engage in any act or       practice constituting a violation of any provision of the Act or any       rule, regulation or order thereunder.                     7. Venue properly lies with this Court       pursuant to Section 6c of the Act, 7 U.S.C. 13a-1(e), in that       the Defendants are found in, inhabit, or transact business in this       district, and the acts and practices in violation of the Act have       occurred, are occurring, or are about to occur within this       district.                     III.                     THE PARTIES                     8.

It       allegedly manufactures and markets bicycle seats for children. Nauman is       the president and CEO of KFI. KFI has never been registered with the       Commission in any capacity.                     IV.                     FACTS                     Pension America, Inc.       (PAI)                     18. Nauman started PAI in 1989 and at all       relevant times served as its president and CEO. In 1992, Nauman hired       Kirris as the vice president of the company, supervised and coordinated       Kirris' activities with respect to PAI, FPM, SFM, SCT and CTS, and       eventually fired him in January 2000. Nauman also hired Relf in January       1999, and supervised, directed and controlled him with respect to his       involvement in PAI and the four pools from January 1999 through November       1999.                     19. In 1997, Nauman and Kirris began       operating the FPM and SFM commodity pools out of the PAI office and in       1999, Nauman, Kirris and Relf began operating the SCT and CTS pools out       of the PAI office. They prepared and signed correspondence and statements       on PAI letterhead, which they sent to investors regarding their accounts       from PAI's office.                     20. Until November 1999, all statements from       the FCMs where trading accounts were maintained for the four commodity       pools were mailed to PAI's office. In November 1999, Kirris and Relf       took over operation of the SFM, SCT and CTS pools and began to operate       the pools out of their homes.                     The Futures Profit Making Pool       (FPM)                     21. During the relevant time, Kirris and       Nauman, in person and through the mail, solicited, accepted and pooled       approximately $90,000 from at least 9 investors for investment in the FPM       pool. Kirris solicited the investors and Nauman made all trading       decisions and placed all trades for the FPM pool.                     22. Kirris and Nauman received personal       checks and wire transfers in person and through the mail, intended for       investment in the FPM pool. Kirris and Nauman commingled these funds with       funds of other entities they owned and operated.                     23. Kirris and Nauman falsely represented to       FPM investors that they were successful commodity traders who regularly       made profitable returns of up to 30% annually, and promised prospective       investors such profitable returns. In fact, Kirris and Nauman were not       successful commodity traders, had little experience trading commodity       futures and lost or misappropriated the funds they invested in the FPM       trading accounts.                     24. Kirris and Nauman downplayed the risks       of futures trading to FPM investors, falsely representing that they could       limit risks by their method of trading. At no time did Kirris or Nauman       deliver or cause to be delivered to FPM pool investors or prospective       investors a Risk Disclosure or other written document discussing the       risks of commodity futures trading, as required by Commission Regulation       4.21.                     25. Kirris and Nauman represented to FPM       pool investors that all of their funds would be used to trade commodity       futures and that they would receive no fees or commissions for trading       the FPM pool. They told some investors that they would split any profits       the FPM pool earned with investors on a fifty-fifty basis. They told       other investors that the first 25% return that the FPM pool earned in a       year would go to the FPM investors. Kirris and Nauman would split the       next 25% of the profits that the FPM pool earned for the year with       investors and would take all of the profits after the FPM pool earned a       50% return for the year.                     26. Nauman opened up two trading accounts in       the name of FPM at an FCM in March 1997 and May 1998, respectively. He       deposited $6,000 in one account, lost $5,847 trading and withdrew the       remaining balance, $152.97 in March 1999. He deposited approximately       $50,100 into the other account, earned a net profit of approximately       $5,900 from trading and withdrew a total of approximately $56,000 from       the account in three installments in September and October 1998 and       January 1999.                     27. By March 1999, both of FPM's trading       accounts had a $0 balance. Nauman and Kirris did not provide investors       with copies of the account statements they received from the FCM and did       not inform investors that there was no money in FPM's trading       accounts as of March 1999.                     28. From January 1999 through at least       January 2000, Nauman periodically prepared, signed and mailed account       statements to FPM investors purporting to show the status of their       investments. These account statements falsely stated that profits, in the       range of at least 25% to 30% annually, had been generated from futures       trading and that the FPM account never had a losing month. The claims of       profitable trading were false and Nauman knew them to be false at the       time he made them.                     29. Nauman intended the false       representations of profits he made to investors for the FPM pool to       solicit new funds and to discourage withdrawals by current       investors.                     30. Nauman misappropriated some of the FPM       pool investors' funds for his own personal use. Of the approximately       $90,000 Kirris and Nauman received for the FPM pool, they deposited       approximately $56,000 in commodity trading accounts, earned a total net       profit of approximately $50 trading and withdrew a total of approximately       $56,000 from the trading accounts from September 1998 through January       1999. Nauman used funds in FPM's name to purchase a tract of land       near Ladysmith, Wisconsin in 1998, valued at approximately $30,000 -       $40,000, and two automobiles, valued at approximately $20,000, for his       personal use. Although Nauman purchased the tract of land and the two       automobiles in FPM's name, none of the FPM investors authorized or       consented to use of their investment in FPM for these purposes.                     The Selective Futures Management       Pool (SFM)                     31. During the relevant time, Kirris       solicited, accepted and pooled at least $221,000 from at least 12 pool       investors for the purpose of trading commodity futures in the SFM       pool.                     32. Kirris and Nauman received personal       checks and wire transfers in person and through the mail, intended for       investment in the SFM pool. Kirris and Nauman commingled investor funds       with funds of other entities they owned and operated.                     33. Kirris solicited all the investors for       the SFM pool. He falsely represented to investors that he was a       successful commodity trader who regularly made profitable returns of up       to 30% annually, and promised prospective investors such profitable       returns. Kirris was not a successful commodity trader, had little futures       trading experience and lost the funds invested in the SFM trading       accounts.                     34. Kirris downplayed the risks of futures       trading to SFM investors, falsely representing that Kirris and Nauman       could limit risks by their method of trading. At no time did Kirris       deliver or cause to be delivered to SFM investors or prospective       investors a Risk Disclosure Document or other written document discussing       the risks of commodity futures trading, as required by Commission       Regulation 4.21.                     35. During the relevant time, Kirris       represented to prospective and current SFM investors that all of their       funds would be and were used to trade commodity futures and that if they       invested with him they would not lose any money. Kirris represented to       SFM investors that he received no fees or commissions for trading the SFM       pool. He told investors that the first 25% return that the SFM pool       earned in a year would go to the SFM investors. Kirris would split the       next 25% of the profits that the SFM pool earned for the year with       investors and would take all of the profits after the SFM pool earned a       50% return for the year. Kirris did not adhere to this. Kirris and Nauman       withdrew funds from the SFM trading accounts for personal and company       operating expenses regardless of trading profits.                     36. Kirris opened up two accounts in the       name of SFM at a registered FCM in April 1997 and April 1998,       respectively. In the summer of 1997, Nauman took over making the trading       decisions and placing all trades for the SFM pool and continued to do so       until November 1999. At the time Nauman took over trading for SFM,       neither Kirris nor Nauman disclosed that fact to SFM investors.                     37. Kirris and Nauman misappropriated some       of the SFM investors' funds. Of the $221,000 received for the SFM       pool, Kirris and Nauman deposited $216,908 in two trading accounts at       FCMs, lost $37,578 trading, and withdrew $179,330. They deposited       $154,800 of the funds they withdrew in a checking account in the name of       SFM at a bank in Red Wing, Minnesota and paid it to Nauman, purportedly       as a loan, for his personal use through a series of checks signed by       Kirris drawn on this account in 1998 and 1999. Nauman and Kirris knew       that the funds provided to Nauman for his personal use were those of SFM       pool investors. Nauman deposited some of these funds into a bank account       in the name of PAI, then deposited them into a bank account in the name       of KFI and subsequently transferred them into trading accounts at several       FCMs in the name of KFI. He eventually lost all but $746.16 of the       $154,800 through futures trading. SFM investors were not made aware of       the ""loans"" until the beginning of the year 2000, and did not       consent to or authorize the loan of the SFM pool funds to Nauman. To       date, Nauman has not repaid the money.                     38. Kirris misappropriated some of the funds       from more recent SFM investors to make returns of principal and purported       profits to some of the earlier investors, in a manner akin to a Ponzi       scheme. Kirris informed SFM investors who requested their money back that       he could not pay them until he solicited new individuals to invest in the       pool.                     39. From July 1999 through January 2000,       Kirris periodically prepared and mailed account statements to some SFM       investors who requested them. These account statements falsely reported       that SFM had generated profits from futures trading in the range of 13% -       27% annually. The account statements also overstated the value of each       investor's share of the pool. Kirris also orally confirmed to several       SFM investors the purported profitability of the futures trading       reflected in the written statements. Kirris knew that his written and       oral representations were false at the time he made them.                     40. Kirris did not provide SFM investors       with the profit and loss statements that he received from the FCMs       carrying the SFM pool accounts, and he did not inform investors that       there was no money in SFM's trading accounts as of May 31,       1999.                     41. Kirris intended the false       representations of profits he made to investors in the SFM pool to       solicit new funds from prospective investors and current investors and to       discourage withdrawals by current investors.                     Specialized Commodity Timing       (SCT) and Commodity Timing Specialist (CTS) Pools                     42. During the relevant time, Kirris and       Relf solicited, accepted and pooled at least $200,000 from at least seven       investors for the SCT pool and approximately $113,500 from at least eight       investors for the CTS pool.                     43. Kirris, Nauman and Relf received       personal checks and wire transfers in person and through the mail,       intended for investment in the SCT and CTS pools. Kirris and Nauman       commingled these funds with funds of other entities they owned and       operated.                     44. Kirris and Relf falsely represented to       SCT and CTS investors that they and Nauman were successful commodity       traders who regularly made profitable returns of up to 40% annually.       Kirris and Relf also promised prospective investors such profitable       returns. Kirris, Nauman and Relf were not successful commodity traders.       At the time they made these misrepresentations, they had already lost or       misappropriated all funds deposited in the FPM and SFM pools' trading       accounts. They eventually lost most of the funds invested in the SCT and       CTS pools' trading accounts through their futures trading. As with       the other pools, Kirris and Relf downplayed the risks of futures trading       to SCT and CTS pool investors, representing that they and Nauman could       limit risks by their method of trading. Kirris and Relf did not provide       investors with a Risk Disclosure Document or any other writing that       discussed the risks of commodity futures trading, although such was       required by Commission Regulation 4.21.                     45. Kirris and Relf represented to SCT and       CTS investors that all of their funds would be used to trade commodity       futures, and that neither they nor Nauman would receive any fees or       commissions for trading the pools. Rather, they described to investors       the same arrangement that existed for the other pools whereby profits       would be shared. Kirris, Nauman and Relf did not adhere to this. Instead,       Kirris, Nauman and Relf withdrew funds from the SCT and CTS trading       accounts for personal and company operating expenses regardless of       trading profits.                     46. Kirris represented to some SCT and CTS       pool investors that he made all the trading decisions and placed all       trades for the SCT and CTS pools when, in fact, he did not. Nauman made       the trading decisions and placed all trades for the SCT and CTS pools       from January 1999, when the SCT pool started, through November 1999. In       November 1999, Kirris and Relf took over operation of the SCT and CTS       pools, and since that time Kirris has made the trading decisions and       placed all trades for the SCT and CTS pools.                     47. Kirris, Nauman and Relf periodically       prepared and mailed account statements to SCT and CTS investors       purporting to show the status of their investments. These statements did       not uniformly report the same trading results to all investors. Some of       these account statements falsely stated that profits, in the range of 25%       - 27% annually, had been generated from futures trading and overstated       the value of each investor's share of the pool. Other statements       showed trading losses, but did not accurately reflect the losses that SCT       and CTS had suffered. All of these statements were false and Kirris,       Nauman and Relf knew them to be false at the time they made them. Kirris,       Nauman and Relf did not provide SCT and CTS investors with profit and       loss statements they received from the FCM carrying the SCT and CTS       trading accounts.                     48. Kirris, Nauman and Relf intended the       false representations of profits they made to investors for the SCT and       CTS pools to solicit new funds and to discourage withdrawals by current       investors.                     Defendants' Claims Of       Exemption From Registration With The Commission                     49. On or about March 26, 1997, Nauman       drafted and signed a letter for the FPM pool stating that FPM was not       required to register with the Commission as a CPO because, pursuant to       Commission Regulation 4.13(a)(2), the total gross capital contributions       it received for all of the pools it operated did not exceed $200,000 and       none of the pools it operated had more than fifteen participants. Nauman       provided the letter to the Commission and FPM pool investors.                     50. On or about April 15, 1997, Nauman       drafted and Kirris signed a letter for the SFM pool stating that SFM was       not required to register with the Commission as a CPO, similar to the       letter filed for the FPM pool. Nauman and Kirris provided the letter to       the Commission and SFM pool investors.                     51. On or about December 21, 1998, Nauman       drafted and Relf signed a letter for the SCT pool and on or about       February 2, 1999, Nauman drafted a letter for the CTS pool. The letters       claimed exemption from the Commission's CPO registration requirement.       Nauman and Relf provided the letters to the Commission and SCT and CTS       pool investors.                     52. None of the pools were exempt from       registration with the Commission because PAI, Nauman, Kirris and Relf       operated the FPM, SFM, SCT and CTS pools at the same time, and the pools       had total gross capital contributions of over $600,000 and a total of 36       investors. The SFM pool itself had total gross capital contributions of       over $200,000.                     Relief Defendant Kidz First       International, Inc. (KFI)                     53. In 1989, Nauman started KFI, which he       incorporated in 1993.                     54. From 1997 through the present, Nauman       transferred at least $18,000 directly from pool bank accounts into       trading and bank accounts under the name of KFI. During this time period,       Nauman transferred at least another $150,000 indirectly from the pools to       KFI, mostly through PAI.                     55. KFI has not repaid the pools.                     Recent       Activity                     56. In March and April 2000, Nauman       solicited investors to invest in KFI. Kirris and Relf informed SCT and       CTS investors that in August 2000 they solicited an investor who invested       $95,000 in the SCT and CTS pools. Kirris and Relf have also recently       asked investors if they know of anyone else who would be interested in       investing in SCT and CTS.                     57. Earlier this year, SCT and CTS investors       requested their money back. Relf and Kirris asked them not to withdraw       their money and promised them that they would earn a significant return       on their investment through Kirris' commodity futures trading. In       fact, since May 2000, the SCT and CTS accounts have consistently lost       money.                     V.                     VIOLATIONS OF THE COMMODITY       EXCHANGE          ACT AND REGULATIONS THEREUNDER                     COUNT I                     VIOLATIONS OF SECTION 4b(a)(i) and       (iii) OF THE ACT:          FRAUD BY MISAPPROPRIATION AND MISREPRESENTATIONS                     58. Paragraphs 1 through 57 are realleged       and incorporated herein.                     59. During the relevant time, Kirris, Nauman       and Relf violated Section 4b(a)(i) and (iii) of the Act, 7U.S.C.       6b(a)(i) and (iii) (1994), in that they cheated or       defrauded or attempted to cheat or defraud investors or prospective       investors in the pools and willfully deceived or attempted to deceive the       investors or prospective investors in the pools by: misappropriating       funds received from investors for personal expenses, to make       ""loans"" to Nauman and to use to pay earlier investors, as in a       Ponzi scheme; misrepresenting to investors that all their funds were       going to be used to trade commodity futures when they were not;       misrepresenting their prior trading success to potential investors and       promising them profitable trading while claiming to be able to limit       risks; misrepresenting to investors the profits and the value of each       investor's share of the pools; and sending letters to investors and       the Commission misrepresenting that they were exempt from registration       with the Commission as CPOs when they were not.                     60. Kirris, Nauman and Relf, engaged in this       conduct in or in connection with orders to make, or the making of,       contracts of sale of commodities for future delivery, made, or to be       made, for or on behalf of other persons where such contracts for future       delivery were or may have been used for (a) hedging any transaction in       interstate commerce in such commodity, or the products or byproducts       thereof, or (b) determining the price basis of any transaction in       interstate commerce in such commodity, or (c) delivering any such       commodity sold, shipped, or received in interstate commerce for the       fulfillment thereof.                     61. The actions and omissions of Kirris,       Nauman and Relf described in this Count were done within the scope of       their employment with PAI, FPM, SFM, SCT and CTS and, therefore, PAI,       FPM, SFM, SCT and CTS are also liable for their violations of Section       4b(a)(i) and (iii) of the Act, 7 U.S.C.  6b(a)(i) and (iii)       (1994), pursuant to Section 2a(1)(A)(iii) of the Act, 7 U.S.C.  4       (1994).                     62. Nauman, directly or indirectly,       controlled Kirris and Relf and did not act in good faith or knowingly       induced, directly or indirectly, the acts constituting the violations of       Kirris and Relf alleged in this count, and thereby is also liable for       Kirris and Relf's violations of Section 4b(a)(i) and (iii) of the       Act, 7 U.S.C.  6b(a)(i) and (iii) (1994), pursuant to Section       13(b) of the Act, 7 U.S.C.  13c(b) (1994).                     63. Each material misrepresentation or       omission, each false report or statement, and each willful deception made       during the relevant time period, including but not limited to those       specifically alleged herein, is alleged as a separate and distinct       violation of Section 4b(a)(i) and (iii).                     COUNT II                     VIOLATIONS OF SECTION 4b(a)(ii) OF       THE ACT:          FRAUD BY FALSE REPORTS                     64. Paragraphs 1 through 57 are realleged       and incorporated herein.                     65. During the relevant time, Kirris, Nauman       and Relf violated Section 4b(a)(ii) of the Act, 7 U.S.C.       6b(a)(ii) (1994), in that Nauman willfully made or caused to       be made to the investors in the FPM, SCT and CTS pools, Kirris willfully       made or caused to be made to the investors in the SFM, SCT and CTS pools       and Relf willfully made or caused to be made to the investors in the SCT       pool, written reports or statements which falsely represented the       profits, losses and the value of each investor's share of the pools.       Kirris, Nauman and Relf also sent letters to investors and the Commission       misrepresenting that they were exempt from registration with the       Commission as CPOs when they were not. These false reports or statements       were made in or in connection with orders to make, or the making of,       contracts of sale of commodities for future delivery, made, or to be       made, for or on behalf of other persons where such contracts for future       delivery were or may have been used for (a) hedging any transaction in       interstate commerce in such commodity, or the products or byproducts       thereof, or (b) determining the price basis of any transaction in       interstate commerce in such commodity, or (c) delivering any such       commodity sold, shipped, or received in interstate commerce for the       fulfillment thereof.                     66. The actions and omissions of Kirris,       Nauman and Relf described in this Count were done within the scope of       their employment with PAI, FPM, SFM, SCT and CTS and, therefore, PAI,       FPM, SFM, SCT and CTS are also liable for their violations of Section       4b(a)(ii) of the Act, 7 U.S.C.  6b(a)(ii) (1994), pursuant to       Section 2a(1)(A)(iii) of the Act, 7 U.S.C.  4 (1994).                     67. Nauman, directly or indirectly,       controlled Kirris and Relf and did not act in good faith or knowingly       induced, directly or indirectly, the acts constituting the violations of       Kirris and Relf alleged in this count, and thereby is also liable for       Kirris and Relf's violations of Section 4b(a)(ii) of the Act, 7       U.S.C.  6b(a)(ii) (1994), pursuant to Section 13(b) of the Act, 7       U.S.C.  13c(b) (1994).                     68. Each false report or statement made       during the relevant time period, including but not limited to those       specifically alleged herein, is alleged as a separate and distinct       violation of Section 4b(a)(ii).                     COUNT III                     VIOLATIONS OF SECTION 4m(1) OF THE       ACT:          ACTING AS AN UNREGISTERED CPO AND CTA                     69. Paragraphs 1 through paragraph 57 are       realleged and incorporated herein.                     70. A commodity pool operator       (""CPO"") is any firm or individual engaged in a business which       is of the nature of an investment trust, syndicate, or similar form of       enterprise, and that, in connection therewith, solicits, accepts, or       receives from others funds, securities, or property, either directly       through capital contributions, the sale of stock or other forms of       securities, or otherwise, for the purpose of trading in any commodity for       future delivery on or subject to the rules of any contract market.       Section 1a(4) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. (4) (1994). With certain specified       exceptions and exemptions, not applicable here, all CPOs are required to       be registered with the Commission, pursuant to Section 4m(1) of the Act,       7 U.S.C. 6m(1) (1994).                     71. A commodity trading advisor       (""CTA"") is any person who for compensation or profit                     engages in the business of advising others,       either directly or through publications, writings, or electronic media,       as to the value of or advisability of trading in any contract of sale of       a commodity future for future delivery made or to be made on or subject       to the rules of any contract market; any commodity option or any leverage       transaction for compensation or profit, and as part of a regular       business, issues or promulgates analysis or reports concerning any of the       activities referred to above. Section 1a(5) of the Act, 7 U.S.C.        1a(5) (1994). A CTA is exempt from registering if, during a twelve month       period, he has not furnished trading advice to more than fifteen persons       and does not hold himself out generally to the public as a CTA. Section       4m(1) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. 6m(1) (1994).                     72. During the relevant time, Nauman acted       as a CTA and Nauman and Kirris acted as CPOs for the FPM pool; Nauman and       Kirris acted as CTAs and CPOs for the SFM pool; and Nauman and Kirris       acted as CTAs and Nauman, Kirris and Relf acted as CPOs for the SCT and       CTS pools.

GX019-43-9435374	Release: #3946-96 (CIV 96-74525)        For Release: October 1, 1996        CFTC FILES CIVIL ANTI-FRAUD CHARGES IN MICHIGAN DISTRICT COURT     AGAINST GARY BERUS INDIVIDUALLY AND D/B/A PROFIT MASTERS GROUP, MECA     INTERNATIONAL, AND PATRICIA GALE        Complaint Alleges That Defendants Cheated and Defrauded        Approximately 50 Michigan Customers Out of Approximately $1     Million        Washington -- The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) today     announced the filing on September 30, 1996, of a seven-count civil     complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan     against  Gary Berus  of Warren, Michigan (individually and doing     business as  Profit Masters Group ),  Meca International, Inc. ,     a Michigan corporation controlled by Berus and located in Warren, and       Patricia Gale  of Gaylord, Michigan, a tax return preparer and financial     planner.        The complaint alleges that from October 1992 to the present, the     defendants violated the anti-fraud provisions of the  Commodity Exchange     Act (CEA)  and CFTC regulations in that Berus, Meca International, and     Gale fraudulently solicited approximately 50 elderly and retired Michigan     residents to invest approximately        $1 million in two pools to trade, among other things, commodity futures     contracts. The CFTC also charges that the defendants violated disclosure,     reporting, and recordkeeping provisions of federal commodities law and CFTC     regulations applicable to commodity pool operators.        In addition, the CFTC complaint alleges that Berus and Meca     International fraudulently solicited approximately $376,000 from 10     individuals to trade commodity futures contracts in accounts managed by     Berus, by, among other things, falsely representing their track record in     trading such accounts and falsely stating that any losses could and would     be limited to a specific amount.        As to the pools, the defendants are charged with cheating and defrauding     customers by, among other things:        --        misrepresenting that pool investors had achieved and would continue to     achieve significant profits ranging from 12 to 24 percent annually with     little or no risk;        --        misrepresenting or failing to disclose the risks associated with     commodity futures trading;        --        misrepresenting the track record of Berus' previous trading; and        --        misrepresenting the performances of the two commodity pools in written     and oral statements, by reporting large profits when, in fact, neither of     the pools was ever profitable.        Complaint Alleges that Berus and Meca Misappropriated Pool Funds, and     Operated the Pools in a Manner Akin to a  Ponzi  Scheme        The complaint further alleges that Berus and Meca International     misappropriated investors' funds in the pools and converted the funds to     their own use for personal and unrelated business expenses, and to pay     purported profits to other investors in a manner akin to a  Ponzi      scheme.        The CFTC complaint also charges that Berus and Meca International     violated the CFTC registration requirements by acting in an unregistered     capacity as commodity trading advisors in connection with the individual     managed accounts and as unregistered commodity pool operators. Gale is     charged with acting as an unregistered associated person of the commodity     pool operators.        Finally, Berus and Meca International are charged with acting as     unregistered commodity trading advisors by soliciting customers to purchase     a computer software commodity trading system.        The CFTC is seeking preliminary and permanent civil injunctions against     the defendants, restitution to customers, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains,     and a civil monetary penalty against each defendant of up to $100,000, or     triple the monetary gain, whichever is greater for each violation, among     other remedial sanctions.        Simultaneous with the filing of the CFTC's action, the Securities and     Exchange Commission filed a separate action, also in the U.S. District     Court for the Eastern District of Michigan, alleging federal securities     violations against Berus, Gale, and others in connection with several     investment schemes related to the CFTC charges.        # # #              Updated February 1, 2001
