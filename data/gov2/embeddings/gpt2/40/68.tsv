The order permanently enjoins Bell and his entities from further       violations of certain provisions of federal commodity law and CFTC       regulations, bars them from any activity in the futures industry for       themselves or on behalf of others, and requires restitution payments to       customers totaling approximately $3.4 million, plus pre- and       post-judgement interest. The court's order stems from a six-count       civil injunctive action filed by the CFTC in November 1993 (see CFTC News       Release #3719-93, November 22, 1993).                   The court's order finds that, between 1990 and November 1993, Bell       and BBIC defrauded approximately 110 investors of approximately $8       million in a commodity pool formed to trade oil futures. The court's       order further finds that Bell and BBIC defrauded these investors by,       among other things, sending statements to investors that falsely       represented that their funds had been used to trade oil futures and had       generated profits, when they had not.                   The order also finds that Bell and BBIC used investors' funds to make       returns of principal and purported profits to earlier investors, in a       manner akin to a ""Ponzi"" scheme. Further, the order finds that       all of the defendants converted investors' funds to their personal       use, purchasing such items as a home, a twin-jet airplane, gold coins,       and interests in oil wells and gas leases. Finally, the order finds that       Bell and his company, BBIC, acted as commodity pool operators without       being registered as such with the CFTC.                   In October 1994, the U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of Oklahoma       charged Bell with wire fraud in a single count information concerning       these same activities. Bell pled guilty and has recently completed a       44-month prison sentence.                   The receiver in the CFTC's civil action, Gary C. Clark, Esq., a Tulsa       attorney, has already gathered and returned approximately $4.5 million to       defrauded investors pursuant to previous court orders.                   # # #             Updated February 1, 2001"
GX270-32-0832221	"VERMONT ENVIRONMENTAL BOARD 10 V.S.A. Chapter 151 Re: U.S. Quarried Slate Products, Inc. and Scotch Hill Leasing Corporation by James P.W. Goss, Esq. P.O. Box 578 Rutland, VT 05702 Genier Slate Quarry c/o Victor C. Genier Fair Haven, VT 05743 MEMORANDUM OF DECISION This decision pertains to a motion to dismiss filed by Victor C. Genier on the basis that his operation involves only 9.9 acres of land. As is explained below, the Environmental Board denies the motion because the question of how much land is involved should be the subject of proof at hearing. BACKGROUND This matter pertains to whether a permit is required pursuant to 10 V.S.A. Chapter 151 (Act 250) for two different slate quarry operations located near each other off Blissville Road in Poultney. One of the operations involves U.S. Quarried Slate Products (U.S. Slate) and Scotch Hill Leasing Corporation. U.S. Slate is the quarry operator and Scotch Hill is the landowner. U.S. Slate's quarry operation is located on the site of the former Eagle Quarry. On July 31, 1992, District #l Coordinator Anthony Stout issued Advisory Opinion iitl-165, concluding that no Act 250 permit was required for U.S. Slate's proposed reopening of the Eagle Quarry. In that opinion, the District Coordinator stated that no Act 250 permit would be needed for the reopening because he believed it did not present ""a potential for significant impacts."" He also stated that an Act 250 permit will be required for a ~ manufacturing facility proposed for the site by U.S. Slate. The District Coordinator's opinion was appealed by Alfred Locke and Roger and Doreen Bushey, who own property near U.S. Slate's quarry site. On November 5, 1992, Associate General Counsel Aaron .4dler issued Advisory Opinion #EO-92-267, concluding that an Act 250 permit was and is required prior to reopening the Eagle Quarry. On November 13. 1992. U.S. Slate filed a petition for a declaratory ruling. Following agreement by the Associate General Counsel to reconsider and a withdrawal request from U.S. Slate, Board Chair Elizabeth Courtney remanded the matter for reconsideration. On January 8. 1993, the Associate General Counsel issued Advisory Opinion #EO-92-267 (Reconsidered), Declaratory Ruling Requests #279 and #283   U.S. Quarried Slate Products, Inc. and Scotch Hill Leasing Corp., D.R. #279 Genier Slate Quarry, D.R. $283 Memorandum of Decision Page 2 stating that it remains his opinion that an Act 250 permit was and is required. On January 14, 1993, U.S. Slate and Scotch Hill refiled their petition for a declaratory ruling. The other quarry operation involves extraction by Victor Genier near the site of the former Sbardella Quarry on land located off Blissville Road which he 1:ec-e- ,._-I __^_^_^_ to bw &tom X':Xam P. r-err TL: and Ratter&e Le-fi Qn ^_^_ titi YLupv>e> December 7, 1992, the Dikrict #1 Coordinator issued Advisory Opinion #l-174, concluding that no permit is needed for Mr. Genier's planned extraction activity because the quarry was operating until the early 1970s and resumption of quarry activity on-site will not create new significant impacts. On December 14, 1992, the Busheys filed an appeal of this opinion. Pursuant to 10 V.S.A. $ 6007(c), their appeal is being treated as a petition for a declaratory ruling. On January 21, 1993, the Board issued a notice of a prehearing conference stating that the petitions for declaratory ruling concerning these two quarries will be consolidated due to the proximity of the quarry sites, similarity in issues, and overlap in the parties. On February 2, the Chair convened a prehearing conference. On February 9, 1993, Mr. Genier filed a motion to dismiss. On February 19, the Chair issued a prehearing conference report and order. On February "" 22, the Board received both an opposition to the motion from the Busheys and : response by Mr. Genier to that opposition. The Board deliberated on February 24. Mr. Genier and the Busheys were orally informed of the Boards decision on ' February 26. ~  ti  DISCUSSION Mr. Genier has filed a motion to dismiss that is now before us. Under Board Rule 18(D), the granting of a motion to dismiss is discretionary. Genier's motion is his allegation that only 9.9 acres are a so-called ""lo-acre town."" Mr. Genier specifically states 9.9-acre portion of the approximately 91-acre L_enz parcel and that this is the portion he plans to buy.  :I /:  :,  The basis for Mr. involved and Poultney is that he is only leasing a i: for the quarry operation  In relevant part, 10 V.S.A. 5 6081(a) states that an Act 250 permit is required prior to commencement of construction on: or commencement of. ""development."" To paraphrase 10 V.S.4.  6001(j) and Board Rule 2(A)(2),  `A'   U.S. Quarried Slate Products, Inc. and Scotch Hill Leasing Corp., D.R. #279 Genier Slate Quarry, D.R. #283 Memorandum of Decision Page 3 development subject to Act 250 includes, in relevant part, the construction of improvements for commercial or industrial purposes on a tract or tracts owned or controlled by a person consisting of more than an acre of land, except that in towns with permanent subdivision and zoning bylaws, the land involved must be 10 or more acres. In determining the amount of land involved, the Board counts the tract on which the improvements are located, as well as other land within a radms of five mde:. of my involved lane! 2w'I;l_:! __ ""incident to the i'ie"" or iiihich --.LJ-L 1; _ bears a demonstrable relationship to the main tract and the relationship is such that there is a substantial likelihood of impact on the values Act 250 protects. See Board Rule 2(F). Mr. Genier's argument is that there cannot possibly be Act 250~jurisdiction because of the amounr of leased iand that he intends to buy. It appears uncontested that the land subject to the lease/purchase agreement consists of 9.9 acres. Even so, we see three possible and separate ways in which there may be Act 250 jurisdiction, and thus we deny the motion because these matters should be the subject of proof at hearing. First, in Re: Salvas Paving. Inc., Declaratory Ruling #229 (June 20, 1991), the Board ruled that leasing less than 10 acres of a greater than lo-acre tract does not defeat jurisdiction if the development is in fact on a tract of greater than 10 acres owned by a person, even if the owner is not the lessor-developer. Mr. Genier's motion states that he has a lease/purchase agreement with the Lenzes but does not supply the agreement. For the reasons stated in w, the lease ' part of the agreement is immaterial if the actual tract on which the development is taking place consists of more than 10 acres. The purchase part may be material _ but questions arise concerning the terms. What is the period of the lease? When will the purchase actually occur ? Can the purchase be defeated by the occurrence of subsequent events (such as default on lease terms)? Mr. Genier's purchase of the 9.9 acres could occur so far in the future or be so hinged on contingencies : i that it may be too speculative to be a basis for decision. To assist us in resolving ~this issue, we will require, pursuant to 10 V.S.A. 5 6027(a) and Rule 17(E), that a ~ copy of the lease/purchase agreement be prefiled and be entered into the record at hearing. ;: Second, the motion addresses primarily the main tract on which slate extraction is to occur. It does not foreclose the possibility that there is additional involved land within a radius of five miles. In this regard, we note that Mr. Genier's response to the Busheys' opposition states that there is no such   U.S. Quarried Slate Products, Inc. and Scotch Hill Leasing Corp., D.R. #279 Genier Slate Quarry, D.R. #283 Memorandum of Decision Page 4 additional involved land. However, it is clear from the Busheys' opposition that they believe that such land exists. Accordingly, there is a dispute concerning the facts which a hearing will be necessary to resolve. Third, it is possible that, even if jurisdiction might attach because he and 10 V.S.4. 5 600!(A)(?4)!iii). If thev were would still be more. thanld acres under Mr. Genier purchases the 9.9-acre parcel, the Lenzes may be one ""person"" under held to be one person. then there the ownership and control of that person.  10 V.S.A. 5 6001(14)(A)(iii) provides, among other things, that ""person"": [IIncludes individuals and entities affiliated with each other for profit, consideration, or any other beneficial interest derived from the partition or division of land . . Mr. Genier and the Lenzes may fit this definition. They appear to have an agreement (an affiliation) for the Lenzes to divide their tract and sell a portion to Mr. Genier. Thus, both parties appear to be getting profit, consideration, and beneficial interest from the division of the Lenz tract. Thus, the facts we know now indicate that these individuals may constitute one person. It may be that evidence introduced at hearing will demonstrate that the above-referenced definition of a person does not apply to the facts of this case. Further, we note that we have never applied this definition outside of the context of an allegation that lots are part of a subdivision subject to Act 250 because of the creation of ten lots within a district within five years. See 10 V.S.A. @ 6001( 19), 6081(a) (Act 250 applies to subdivisions as well as developments). In this case, the question is whether Mr. Genier's quarry operation constitutes a. development and we may well decide, after hearing from the parties, that the definition is not applicable in the context of an alleged development. However, we believe that these determinations should be made after we have had an opportunity to hear the facts.   U.S. Quarried Slate Products, Inc. and Scotch Hill Leasing Corp., D.R. #279 Genier Slate Quarry, D.R. #283 Memorandum of Decision Page 5 ORDER 1.

Belden, who was Enron's Chief Energy Trader, has agreed to  plead guilty  to conspiracy to commit wire fraud in a scheme with others at Enron Corp. to manipulate California's energy market, a scheme that was designed in part to alter the price of electricity in the state.   In the first  criminal charges   to be filed in an investigation of the manipulation of the California energy markets during the power crisis of 2000 to 2001, Enron's chief energy trader was charged in San Francisco federal court with one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud.  The defendant has agreed to plead guilty and cooperate with the United States in its investigation.  A hearing for the defendant to plead guilty is scheduled for noon Pacific time in San Francisco federal court before Judge Martin J. Jenkins.   The charges are based on Enron's intentional manipulation of the California energy markets, which was done in part to affect the price of electricity in California.  In pleading guilty, the defendant will admit that Enron's manipulation of the California energy markets was illegal.  The defendant, Timothy N. Belden, also agreed to cooperate with the United States in its continuing investigation into the manipulation of the California energy markets.    The charges were announced at a press conference in Washington, D.C. today by Larry Thompson, Deputy Attorney General of the United States, Kevin V. Ryan, United States Attorney for the Northern District of California, Michael Chertoff, head of the Justice Department's Criminal Division, Leslie Caldwell, Director of the Enron Task Force, and Bruce Gebhardt, the Deputy Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.   The investigation is being led by the U.S. Attorney's Office in San Francisco, the Enron Task Force, the Antitrust and Fraud Divisions of the Department of Justice, and the San Francisco division of the FBI.   Deputy Attorney General Larry Thompson, the head of the Justice Department's  Corporate Fraud Task Force, said, ""During the period of the charged conspiracy, Enron's revenues from Belden's trading unit rose from $50 million in 1999 to $500 million in 2000 to $800 million in 2001.  While Enron benefitted from the overall rise in electricity prices, the information charges that a portion of these increased revenues was due to the execution of these schemes.  The conspiracy charged in this information allowed Enron to exploit and intensify the California energy crisis and prey on energy consumers at their most vulnerable moment.""   U.S. Attorney Kevin V. Ryan, a member of the Corporate Fraud Task Force, said in announcing the guilty plea, ""These charges answer the question that has long troubled California consumers:  whether the energy crisis was spurred in part by criminal activity.  The answer is a resounding yes.  The U.S. Attorney's Office in San Francisco and the Justice Department will bring to justice those who served their own selfish purposes by intentionally and criminally manipulating energy consumers in California and on the West Coast.""   Mr. Belden, age 35 of Houston, Texas, was charged in a Criminal Information filed by the U.S. Attorney's Office with one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 371.  The Criminal Information was filed on October 9, 2002 but was under seal until this morning, when the defendant made his initial appearance in federal court.     Mr. Belden was arraigned on the charges this morning in San Francisco federal court. A change of plea hearing is set for noon today.    According to the charges, Mr. Belden was employed by Enron Corp. in its West Power Trading Division (""West Power"") in Portland, Oregon.  West Power bought and sold wholesale electricity in the Western United States, including California.  From 1998 to 2001, Mr. Belden is alleged to have conspired with others to manipulate the California energy markets and to defraud California electricity customers and other participants in the wholesale electricity markets.    The Information alleges that in 1999, Enron's West Power generated approximately $50 million in revenues.  By 2001, West Power's revenues increased to approximately $800 million as the price of electricity skyrocketed.  Prices during the height of the energy crisis rose from $25 per megawatt hour to, in some cases, $1,500 per megawatt hour.  It is alleged that the price increase is attributable in part to the schemes charged in the Information.   In pleading guilty, Mr. Belden will admit that beginning in approximately 1998, and continuing through 2001, he and other individuals at Enron conspired to manipulate the energy markets in California by:       !      misrepresenting the nature and amount of electricity Enron proposed to supply in the California market, as well as the load it intended to serve;   !      creating false congestion and falsely relieving that congestion on California transmission lines, and otherwise manipulating fees it would receive for relieving congestion;   !      misrepresenting that energy was from out-of-state to avoid federally approved price caps, when in fact, the energy it was selling was from the State of California and had been exported and re-imported;   !      falsely represented that Enron intended to supply energy and ancillary services it did not in fact have and did not intend to supply.       As a result of these false schedules, Mr. Belden will admit that he and his co-conspirators were able to manipulate prices in certain markets, arbitrage price differences between the markets, obtain ""congestion management"" payments in excess of what they would have received with accurate schedules, and receive prices for electricity above price caps set by the California Independent System Operator (""ISO"") and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.  Mr. Belden admitted that he and others received part of the revenues from the schemes through the ISO, which on a monthly basis billed all customers for wholesale electricity in California, and paid all suppliers, like Enron.  The ISO made these payments during the course of the conspiracy to Enron by interstate wire transmission through the Bank of America in San Francisco.    No sentencing date has yet been set before Judge Jenkins.  The maximum statutory penalty for violating 18 U.S.C. § 371 is five years and a fine amount of $250,000, plus restitution.  However, the actual sentence is dictated by the Federal Sentencing Guidelines, which take into account a number of factors, and will be imposed in the discretion of the Court.   According to the plea agreement, the defendant could be eligible for a lower sentence based on the extent of his cooperation with the United States in its investigation.  In addition, the plea agreement requires the defendant to forfeit $2.1 million to the United States, which represents the portion of his salary and bonuses tied to the fraud.     The prosecution is the result of an ongoing investigation begun four months ago by agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the U.S. Attorney's Office in San Francisco.  The investigation was conducted in cooperation with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and the Commodities Futures Trading Commission.   The case is being prosecuted by Assistant United States Attorneys Patrick D. Robbins and Matthew J. Jacobs, as well as Lisa Tenorio-Kutzkey, a trial attorney with the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice based in San Francisco, along with the assistance of Paralegal Deborah Young.     A copy of this press release may be found on the U.S. Attorney's Office's website at  www.usdoj.gov/usao/can .   Related court documents and information may be found on the District Court website  at  www.cand.uscourts.gov   or on  http://pacer.cand.uscourts/gov.

Washington, D.C. 20426           Dear Chairman Wood:           We are writing to request  that you provide the Committee on Energy and Commerce with specific information  regarding the status of Federal Energy Regulatory Commissions (FERC)  investigation into electricity markets in California and the West.     The FERC began its investigation of Western bulk power markets in July  2000.    Since then, in a series of  subsequent investigations, findings and orders, the FERC has taken numerous  steps and made numerous recommendations attempting to address electricity supply  shortages and price volatility in California and the region.              Throughout this time, as you  may recall, this Committee has carefully followed the FERCs activities, along  with Californias attempts to correct its flawed electricity restructuring  policies, and the West-wide energy crisis in general.     Beginning with a  field  hearing in San Diego in September 11, 2000 , the Subcommittee on Energy and  Air Quality (at that time Energy and Power) conducted numerous hearings to  investigate the electric supply and pricing problems occurring in California,  culminating in a legislative process and a written admonition by this Committee  for the FERC to take all necessary steps to ensure that wholesale power prices  are just and reasonable.               In the 107 th   Congress, the Committee developed an extensive hearing record on the California  energy crisis.    On February 15,  2001, the Subcommittee held a hearing entitled  Electricity  Markets: Lessons Learned From California , in which we heard testimony  from California utility regulators, utilities, market participants, and market  analysts.    On March 20 and 22, 2001,  the Subcommittee held two days of hearings entitled  Electricity  Markets: California.     In  addition to further examining the causes of the electricity supply problems  experienced by California, witnesses were asked to comment on what California  has done and could do to address the problem, and similarly what FERC has done  and could do to address the situation.    These  recommendations resulted in a legislative proposal, The  Electric  Emergency Act of 2001 , two days of legislative hearings in May 2001, and a  successful Subcommittee markup.    While  the bill was never enacted into law, many of the proposals were subsequently  adopted by both Federal agencies and the State of California.           The FERC testified at three of  the Subcommittees hearings on the energy crisis in California and the West.     Throughout these hearings, the Subcommittee heard numerous allegations  and denials of wholesale electricity price manipulation, and numerous  allegations and denials of failure of the State and Federal regulatory  structures governing electricity markets and expansion of electric power  infrastructure.    In a  letter  dated June 12, 2001 , Chairman Tauzin and Chairman Barton, along with 13  other House members, expressed strong concern about the threat of price spikes  and blackouts that summer, and strongly advised the FERC to take further actions  to mitigate wholesale electricity prices and keep power flowing into California.     Specifically, the letter called on FERC to create a West-wide price  mitigation plan to ensure that all rates for wholesale electricity sales are  just and reasonable and, if rates were not just and reasonable, to require  refunds and penalties to the full extent allowed by law.     Soon thereafter, the FERC expanded its  innovative  plan for market monitoring and mitigation in California, and opened a formal  investigation into real-time wholesale power sales throughout the West.               On February 13, 2002, the FERC  initiated yet another fact-finding investigation of potential manipulation of  electric and natural gas prices.    As part of that investigation, the FERC recently released  several documents in its possession describing the questionable trading  practices of Enron Corporation.           We are deeply troubled about  market manipulation as described in the memos.     We ask the FERC to carefully review the impacts upon consumers of  practices that created artificial congestion, increased benchmark prices, or  exaggerated revenues and trading quantities through mutual round-trip  transactions.           In  light of these recent disclosures, we request that the FERC provide answers to  the following questions no later than Friday, June 7, 2002.                       Since      the FERC issued its December 15, 2000 Order, what specific steps has the      FERC taken to investigate wholesale power sales in California and the West?                            Summarize      the FERCs findings to date resulting from these investigations, including      the principal causes of electric power price volatility over the past two      years in California and Western Markets and any other contributing factors.                                What      is the FERCs view of the legality of the practices described in the Enron      memos?                               Did      the trading practices described in the Enron memos violate specific rules of      the California Independent System Operator?                            When      did the FERC become aware of the Enron memoranda?                            Was      the FERC previously aware of such trading practices by (a) Enron      Corporation; or (b) other power sellers (including entities not directly      subject to the FERCs jurisdiction)?                            What      specific steps it the FERC taking to investigate similar trading practices      by other power sellers (including non-jurisdictional entities)?                            Summarize      the preliminary findings of the FERC regarding the February 23, 2002      fact-finding investigation of potential manipulation of electric and natural      gas prices.                            Does      the existence of such trading practices as described in the Enron memos      change the earlier conclusions of the FERC regarding the principle causes      and contributing factors of high wholesale power prices in California and      the West?                            Has      the FERC undertaken any analysis of the impact of such trading practices on      consumer electricity prices?    If      so, please provide the Committee with your findings, along with the data and      information used in the analysis.                            (Describe      the FERCs legal authority to investigate and, if appropriate, regulate      such trading practices.    Include      a description of the FERCs authority with respect to entities not      directly subject to the FERCs jurisdiction.                            Assess      whether the FERCs current legal authority is adequate to address any      harms to the public interest related to such trading practices (including      with respect to non-jurisdictional entities).                            Recently,      a California State Senate committee investigating the electricity crisis      released the transcript of a conversation on July 3, 2001, between an      employee of the California Independent System Operator (CA ISO) and a trader      for Enron Corporation.    In that      conversation, the CA ISO employee requests that the Enron trader place a bid      to buy excess standby power at a specific price, reveals bidding information      only available to the CA ISO, and attempts to artificially raise the price      for excess standby power in the hour-ahead market.         Please describe the specific steps the FERC has taken to investigate      this incident.    Does the FERC      have information regarding other incidents in which the CA ISO has attempted      to manipulate power prices?    Please      describe the status of any FERC investigations of the CA ISO and summarize      any findings to date resulting from such investigations.                         Please  provide written responses and all pertinent documents no later than the close of  business June 14, 2002.    If you have any questions, please contact Jason Bentley,  Committee Counsel, at (202) 226-2424.    Thank  you for your prompt attention

GX022-39-3983687	"FOR RELEASE:  JULY 14,     1998       Promoter of Online Pyramid     Scheme Agrees to Settle FTC Charges       In its continuing attack on fraudulent unsolicited commercial e-mail (UCE), the Federal     Trade Commission today announced that it was publishing for public comment a proposed     consent agreement with Kalvin P. Schmidt, an alleged promoter and operator of a high-tech     chain letter software program. According to the FTC’s complaint, Schmidt, doing     business as DKS Enterprises, DS Productions, DES Enterprises,   www.mkt-american.com       and  www.mkt-usa.com , operated a web site promoting two chain or pyramid     marketing programs, ""Mega$Nets"" and ""MegaResources.""       In its complaint, the agency alleges that the Waseca, Minnesota, resident offered     consumers who visited the web sites copies of software programs that formed the basis of     the pyramid marketing programs. For example, contained within the Mega$Nets software     program is a list of five names and addresses. The software program and the web sites     direct a consumer to send $20 to each of the five people listed in the software in order     for the consumer to get his or her name placed at the top of the list of names. The FTC     alleged that upon receiving the money, the five people on the list will send ""access     codes"" to the consumer and these codes will allow the consumer to ""unlock""     the software, delete the last name on the list, and insert his or her name on the top of     the list. In addition, Schmidt’s promotional materials instructed consumers to     perpetuate the scheme by providing the software to others for free by copying the disks     and mailing them or by sending unsolicited e-mail to others, the agency said. The     FTC’s complaint alleges that the ""MegaResource"" operated similarly.       Schmidt also provided others with the means to perpetuate the chain marketing programs     by creating and designing websites that contained copies of the software programs, hosting     these web sites on a server he leases, and composing and sending e-mail messages to     consumers directing them to websites promoting these programs, according to the FTC. In     addition, the complaint alleges that Schmidt made false and unsubstantiated earnings     claims.       The proposed settlement of these charges would ban Schmidt from participating in any     chain letter schemes, pyramid sales schemes or Ponzi schemes, and from assisting or     providing others with the means or instrumentalities to participate in these prohibited     marketing schemes. In addition, the proposed agreement would require him to have a basis     for any earnings claims he makes in the future. At the time such a representation is made,     Schmidt also would have to have competent and reliable evidence that substantiates any     representation about the income, profits, or sales of any marketing plan or program or any     material fact. Finally, the settlement contains various recordkeeping requirements.       The Commission vote to accept the proposed consent agreement for public comment was     4-0. An announcement regarding the proposed consent agreement will be published in the     Federal Register shortly. The agreement will be subject to public comment for 60 days,     after which the Commission will decide whether to make it final. Comments should be     addressed to the FTC, Office of the Secretary, 6th Street and Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W.,     Washington, D.C. 20580.       NOTE:  A consent agreement is for settlement purposes only and does not     constitute an admission of a law violation. When the Commission issues a consent order on     a final basis, it carries the force of law with respect to future actions. Each violation     of such an order may result in a civil penalty of $11,000.

GX271-87-8739859	"VERMONT ENVIRONMENTAL BOARD 10 V.S.A. Ch. 151  RE:  Catamount Slate, Inc. d/b/a Reed Family Slate Products and Fred and Suellen Reed  Declaratory Ruling Petition #389  Memorandum of Decision  This proceeding involves a Petition for a Declaratory Ruling (""Petition"") from a Jurisdictional Opinion (""JO"") concerning a slate quarry operation in Fair Haven, Vermont.  I.  Procedural History  On June 29, 2000, the Environmental Board (""Board"") issued a Memorandum of Decision on three Preliminary Issues presented in this matter. On July 13, 2001, Fred and Suellen Reed and Catamount Slate, Inc., d/b/a Reed Family Slate Products (collectively, ""Catamount Slate"") filed a Motion to Reconsider the June 29 Memorandum of Decision, seeking a new decision on one of the Preliminary Issues, to wit, whether the Coordinator for the District 1 Environmental Commission (""Commission"") had authority to issue Jurisdictional Opinion 1-S-50-2 (Second Reconsideration), pursuant to 10 V.S.A. 6007(c) and EBR 3(C). On July 27, 2001, the Board issued a Memorandum of Decision on the Motion to Reconsider. These Memoranda of Decision contain the relevant Procedural History up to July 27. On August 28, 2001, Joanne Calvi, on behalf of herself and other parties to this appeal (David and Joanne Calvi, Lorene Sheldon, Lee Sheldon, Richard Sheldon, Joan Gagnon, Kathleen Donna, Margaret Riter, and Lindsey and Priscilla Waterhouse (collectively, the ""Neighbors"")), filed a request to extend the filing date of one of the Neighbors' exhibits, N20, to September 7, 2001. On August 29, 2001, Catamount Slate filed a further ""Motion for Reconsideration on Preliminary Issues And/Or Ruling on New Issues."" On September 12, 2001, within their Supplemental Pre-filed Testimony, the Neighbors requested the Board to issue three subpoenas. See Exhibits N31, N33 and N34.   Catamount Slate, Inc. d/b/a Reed Family Slate Products, and Fred and Suellen Reed Declaratory Ruling Petition #389 Memorandum of Decision Page 2  The Board deliberated on all pending motions and requests on September 19, 2001. II. Discussion A. Catamount Slate's Motion for Reconsideration  In her May 23, 2001 Prehearing Order Board Chair Marcy Harding identified three Preliminary Issues: 1. Whether the Coordinator for the District 1 Environmental Commission had authority to issue Jurisdictional Opinion 1-S-50-2 (Second Reconsideration), pursuant to 10 V.S.A. 6007(a) and EBR 3(C). 2. Whether Joanne and David Calvi, Lorene Sheldon, Lee Sheldon, Richard Sheldon, Joan Gagnon, Kathleen Donna, Margaret Riter, Lindsey Waterhouse and/or Priscilla Waterhouse are entitled to party status in this Declaratory Ruling. 3. Whether the definition of the ""Project"" in this Declaratory Ruling should include the construction of a commercial slate building on the said  122 -acre tract where the quarry is located. On June 29, 2001, following written argument from the parties, the Board issued a Memorandum of Decision on the Preliminary Issues. On July 13, 2001, Catamount Slate sought reconsideration of the first and second Preliminary Issues. On July 27, 2001, the Board issued a Memorandum of Decision on Catamount Slate's reconsideration request. Catamount Slate's August 29, 2001 Motion for Reconsideration asks the Board to again address the first Preliminary Issue. Environmental Board Rule (""EBR"") 31(A) states: (A) Motions to alter decisions. A party may file within 30 days form the date of the decision of the board or district commission one and only one motion to alter with respect to the decision. However, no party may file a motion to alter a decision concerning or resulting from a motion to alter.   Catamount Slate, Inc. d/b/a Reed Family Slate Products, and Fred and Suellen Reed Declaratory Ruling Petition #389 Memorandum of Decision Page 3  Pursuant to EBR 31(A), Catamount Slate present motion is barred, both because it is untimely, as it was filed beyond the 30-day time limit imposed by the rule, and because it constitutes a second request to reconsider an issue which has been decided. For these reasons, it is denied. 1. Legislative history  Even if Catamount Slate's motion were to be permitted under EBR 31(A), the Board finds it to be without merit. Catamount Slate makes a number of arguments in support of its belief that the initial Jurisdictional Opinion which addressed its quarry registration, JO #1-S-50, became final as to the world once 30 days had passed from its issuance date. Catamount Slate argues first that the legislative history of the slate quarry registration provision, 10 V.S.A. 6081(l), requires that all Jurisdictional Opinions that address quarry registrations become final as to the world 30 days after they are issued, whether or not anyone has been notified of their issuance. As noted in the Board's earlier Memoranda of Decision, 10 V.S.A. 6081(l) states: (3) Slate quarry registration documents shall be submitted to the district commission together with a request, under the provisions of subsection 6007(c) of this title, for a final determination regarding the applicability of this chapter. The language of 6081(l)(3) is neither confusing nor ambiguous. If a party wants a final determination as to whether a slate quarry exemption applies, he is to follow the process established by 10 V.S.A. 6007(c). Because this language is clear and straightforward, resort to legislative history is neither necessary nor appropriate. ""When the meaning of a statute is plain on its face, we have no need for construction, but rather must enforce it according to its terms."" Russell v. Armitage, 166 Vt. 392, 403 (1997); In re Margaret Susan P., 169 Vt. 252, 263 (1999) (only where statutory language is ""unclear and ambiguous"" may legislative history be used to determine legislative intent); Hitchcock Clinic, Inc. v. Mackie, 160 Vt. 610, 611 (1993): ""This Court will not look beyond the statute itself in an effort to determine whether any contrary legislative intent exists when the statutory language itself is clear and unambiguous."" Citing Cavanaugh v. Abbott Laboratories, 145 Vt. 516, 529 (1985) (""If confusion or ambiguity does not appear, then the statute is not construed, but rather is enforced in accordance with its express terms. Heisse v. State, 143 Vt. 87, 89 (1983)""). And see In   Catamount Slate, Inc. d/b/a Reed Family Slate Products, and Fred and Suellen Reed Declaratory Ruling Petition #389 Memorandum of Decision Page 4  re Burlington Housing Authority, 143 Vt. 80, 83 (1983) (""This Court has consistently held that when the meaning of a statute is plain and unambiguous on its face, it must be enforced according to its express terms without resort to construction."") Catamount Slate makes no argument in its motion that 6081(l)(3) is unclear and ambiguous. 1 Rather, its Memorandum discusses a portion of the legislative history of the provision, the implication being that this is always an appropriate means by which to understand a statute's express language. While an examination of legislative history, when appropriate, can lead to clarification of ambiguous and unclear terms in a statute, legislative history in Vermont is sparse. Unlike the United States Congress, the Vermont legislature does not publish written analyses or explanations of its legislation from the House and Senate Committees which hold hearings on proposed legislation or from conference committees which could be of use in understanding its intent. At most, transcripts from committee hearings can be examined, but the Board finds that such an examination can be a somewhat dubious exercise; there is sometimes a question in the transcript as to who is speaking, transcripts do not always reflect what draft version of a bill is being considered by a particular committee on a particular day, and discrete passages, if taken out of context or edited, can be misleading. The Board must therefore carefully approach any attempt to discern the meaning of a particular law through a reading of isolated transcripts or testimony. Even if the Board does consider the legislative testimony cited by Catamount Slate, despite EBR 31(A)(1)'s prohibition on new evidence and arguments,2 it affords no support for Catamount Slate's positions. a. Legislative history cited by Catamount Slate  1  ""A mere assertion that certain language could have a different meaning does not compel the Board to conclude that the statute is not clear."" Nextel Communications of the Mid-Atlantic d/b/a/ Nextel Communications, Declaratory Ruling #362, Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order at 17 (Nov. 18, 1998). Catamount Slate does not even make this assertion. 2  Motions to reconsider or alter decisions of the Board cannot be used to present new evidence, Van Sicklen Limited Partnership, 4C1013R-EB, Memorandum of Decision at 3 (July 26, 2001); North Country Animal League, #5L0487-4-EB, Memorandum of Decision (Apr. 20, 2000), or new argument. Upper Valley Regional Landfill, #3R0609-EB, Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order at 7 (Nov. 12, 1991).   Catamount Slate, Inc. d/b/a Reed Family Slate Products, and Fred and Suellen Reed Declaratory Ruling Petition #389 Memorandum of Decision Page 5  In furtherance of its arguments, Catamount Slate has provided transcripts of testimony before the Vermont House Natural Resources and Energy Committee from March 23 and 27, 1995 on H. 331, the bill that was the precursor to Act 30 (1995), which established the slate quarry exemption sought here by Catamount Slate. 3 Catamount Slate presents the following certain, discrete (and edited) language in the testimony before the Committee to support a contention that Jurisdictional Opinions for slate quarries were intended to be treated differently from all other Jurisdictional Opinions: REP. BEYER: Findings of Fact contained in certified registration shall not be subject to later challenge, if not appealed within 30 days of issuance, and we provided last year a thought (sic) with an advisory opinions and also a mechanism to make those final.... If nobody challenges it, then there's a mechanism where after 30 days its going to be final and done and case closed. House Natural Resources and Energy Committee March 27, 1995 (Transcript at 28). Unfortunately, Catamount Slate's citation does not include everything that Rep. Beyer said. The full quotation (highlighting those part omitted by Catamount Slate in its Memorandum) is: REP. BEYER: In my mind, this really is like an advisory opinion and the language that is suggested by the Board treats like (sic) an advisory opinion and does, say, though, it's not final. It provides 30 days. Findings of Fact contained in certified registration shall not be subject to later challenge, if not appealed within 30 days of issuance, and we provided last year a thought (sic) with an advisory opinions and also a mechanism to make those final. So there is a way to get to know, to get to the answer, and I think this language does do that, and I think there should be a process where someone can say, that hole wasn't there, but they've got to prove that it wasn't there. You can't just rely on the applicant submitting registration information. If nobody challenges  3  In addition to the difficulties that legislative history, the history provided Slate has not informed the Board as to further provide an understanding as to passed.  arise when transcripts form the sole basis for by Catamount Slate is incomplete. Catamount subsequent developments of H. 331, which can the bill that the House and the Senate ultimately   Catamount Slate, Inc. d/b/a Reed Family Slate Products, and Fred and Suellen Reed Declaratory Ruling Petition #389 Memorandum of Decision Page 6  it, then there's a mechanism where after 30 days its going to be final and done and case closed. Reading the full quotation makes it clear that Rep. Beyer was referring to the fact that the legislature had, ""last year,"" (i.e. in 1994) revised 10 V.S.A. 6007(c) to establish a process to ensure the finality of Jurisdictional Opinions. See Act 232, 25 (1993 Adj. Sess.) Clearly, this is the ""mechanism to make those [Jurisdictional Opinions] final"" to which Rep Beyer refers. It is also apparent that Rep. Beyer also was concerned that parties other than the slate quarry registrant be permitted to participate in the process of determining whether an exemption from Act 250 is warranted: "" You can't just rely on the applicant submitting registration information."" Notably, there is nothing in Rep. Beyer's comments to suggest, as Catamount Slate argues, that slate quarry registrations were to be handled in a manner different than the ordinary 6007 process. Catamount Slate also presents the following exchange between an unknown Committee member and John Ewing, then Chair of the Environmental Board: -----: I register and 30 days later nobody comes forward, it's just, nobody can come forward. Am I correct, John? MR. EWING: That's correct  House Natural Resources and Energy Committee March 27, 1995 (Transcript at 30). Catamount Slate asks the Board to find that Ewing intended that a registration, with no notice to anyone, can become final as to the world with the simple passage of 30 days. Ewing's comments however, must be understood within the context of Rep. Beyer's statement that had occurred only minutes before. Further, it is clear from a reading of the entire Transcript that Ewing had been a consistent advocate for the application of the normal 6007 process to slate quarry registrations. b. Other transcript passages and legislative history, not presented by Catamount Slate That the House Committee intended the standard 6007 Jurisdictional Opinion process to apply to slate quarry registrations is apparent from the vote that the Committee took soon after Rep. Beyer's comments:   Catamount Slate, Inc. d/b/a Reed Family Slate Products, and Fred and Suellen Reed Declaratory Ruling Petition #389 Memorandum of Decision Page 7  REP. McCORMACK: the registration process? -----:  Okay, so we are ready to vote on  Can we hear the motion again?  -----: You moved that we use the standard Act 250 district commission process for registration. -----: Point of inquiry, is that essentially the language, your language proposed has that effect, correct? -----: Our proposed language does. ......  REP. McCORMACK: Anymore discussion? All those in favor please raise your hands. It's unanimous. House Natural Resources and Energy Committee March 27, 1995 (Transcript at 35). The Board further notes that the bill that the House Committee presented to the entire House contained the following proposed language to be added as 10 V.S.A. 6081(l)(3): (3) Quarry registration documents shall be submitted to the district commission together with a request, under the provisions of subsection 6007(c) of this title, for a final determination regarding the applicability of this chapter. The board may order amendments to a quarry registration document , to the extent necessary to ensure its accuracy. Information contained in a quarry registration document shall not be subject to later challenge, after a final determination is reached under subsection 6007(c) of this title. House Journal, March 29, 1995 at 16 (emphasis added). The following day, Representative Corren moved to strike ""all after the first sentence"" in the proposed 6081(l)(3), which was agreed to. House Journal, March 30, 1995 at 2. Thus, what legislative history that there is indicates that the House did not intend that slate quarry registrations achieve the finality status urged by Catamount Slate. If anything, the contrary is apparent from the votes on the House floor. When the Senate addressed the bill, the language from the Corren amendment was not changed. Thus, ultimately, a simple, direct reference to the 6007(c) process, and nothing more, appears in the slate registration statute. The ""inconclusive   Catamount Slate, Inc. d/b/a Reed Family Slate Products, and Fred and Suellen Reed Declaratory Ruling Petition #389 Memorandum of Decision Page 8  legislative history"" relied on by the Catamount Slate is thus ""insufficient to overcome the plain meaning"" of the statutes at issue. State v. Madison, 163 Vt. 360, 373-74 (1995). c. Act 250's obligation to publish notice of the slate quarry registration Catamount Slate next argues that ""if the Act 250 process was utilized instead of registration through a town clerk notice would be provided to all through publication as the following process would be followed...."" Catamount Slate then cites to testimony by John Ewing, earlier in the March 27 Committee hearing, which implies that, at one point, the process for slate quarry registrations might have followed a different path from that which ultimately appears in the statute: MR. EWING: They file a notice of registration, okay, and then we go through a normal process of publication and simplified procedure, and then we would certify that registration and then file that with the town clerk, and the way it's written, it would be filed in the town record. So that at that point, it would become more of a public record so that people would know and can hear that it's happened, plus there would be notice to everybody. House Natural Resources and Energy Committee March 27, 1995 (Transcript at 26). Catamount Slate uses the above testimony by Mr. Ewing to make the claim that ""Because of the failure of this District Coordinator to publish notice as required under 10 V.S.A. 6084 the Coordinator is Estopped from denying finality of JO #1-S-50."" This argument has no merit. The fact that alternative registration processes may have been discussed as the slate quarry bill made its way through the legislature is irrelevant. The bill that ultimately passed and became law is what governs. As noted, that law states that the standard 6007(c) Jurisdictional Opinion process is to be used. There is nothing in 6007(c) that imposes on a Coordinator any obligation under 6084 to publish notice of the issuance of a Jurisdictional Opinion. References to 10 V.S.A. 6084 appear twice in 6007(c). 4 If the person who has requested the Jurisdictional Opinion ""wishes a final determination to be rendered, the district coordinator, at the expense of the requestor and in accordance with the rules 4  The second reference to 6084, not relevant to the present discussion, appears in 6007(c) within the list of those persons who are permitted to appeal a Jurisdictional Opinion to the Board.   Catamount Slate, Inc. d/b/a Reed Family Slate Products, and Fred and Suellen Reed Declaratory Ruling Petition #389 Memorandum of Decision Page 9  of the board shall serve the opinion"" on a certain group of individuals, some of whom are described by reference to 6084. 10 V.S.A. 6007(c) (emphasis added). However, as the Board has noted twice before in its Memoranda of Decision issued on this particular issue: First, if the person who requests a Jurisdictional Opinion wants others to be bound by it, it is incumbent upon that person to make this desire known to the Coordinator, to provide the Coordinator with the names of those persons to be served with the Jurisdictional Opinion, and to pay for such service. The Coordinator has no independent obligation to provide notice to others who have not appeared or participated in the Jurisdictional Opinion process, either by service or publication, of the Opinion. Second, to be bound by a Jurisdictional Opinion, a person must be served with it. July 27, 2001 Memorandum of Decision at 8 - 9, quoting the Board's June 29, 2001 Memorandum of Decision at 10 - 11. Catamount Slate has presented no evidence or argument that it ever requested that JO #1-S-50 be served on anyone. 5 Thus, any obligations that may have been placed on the Coordinator's shoulders (and such obligations do not include the obligation ""to publish notice as required under 10 V.S.A. 6084"") have never been triggered. B. Catamount Slate's Request for Ruling on New Issues  Catamount Slate has also asked that the Board rule on a series of issues that it believes are raised as a result of its conclusion in its earlier Memoranda of Decision that because under 6007(c), ""any person ... may request a jurisdictional opinion from the 5  Catamount Slate implies (Memorandum at 5) that its simple submission of its registration documents pursuant to 10 V.S.A. 6081(l)(3), by itself, imposed an obligation on the Coordinator to serve JO #1-S-50 on all parties and affected persons. But that section's direct reference to 10 V.S.A. 6007(c) informs the registrant that, if he wishes finality for any Jurisdictional Opinion that may be issued, there is a specific procedure that he must follow: he must inform the Coordinator of his wish for finality, he must provide the Coordinator with the names of those he wishes to be notified, and he must pay for service on those whom he wishes to be bound by the opinion. Catamount Slate took none of these actions.   Catamount Slate, Inc. d/b/a Reed Family Slate Products, and Fred and Suellen Reed Declaratory Ruling Petition #389 Memorandum of Decision Page 10  district coordinator concerning the applicability of this chapter,"" ""[i]n some respects, under the statute, no Jurisdictional Opinion issued by a Coordinator can ever be considered to be absolutely final as regards the world."" July 27, 2001 Memorandum of Decision at 9, quoting the Board's June 29, 2001 Memorandum of Decision at 10 - 11. Catamount Slate asks the Board to rule on: a. Whether the Environmental Board through its rule making authority had a duty to implement the intent of the legislature and provide a workable finality procedure for Jurisdictional Opinions relative to Slate Quarry registrations. b. Whether the Environmental Board breached its duty through its rule making authority to provide a workable finality procedure for jurisdictional opinions. c. Whether the Environmental Board Rules preclude rather than provide finality, thus compromising the substantive requirements of 10 V.S.A. 6007(c) as incorporated by 10 V.S.A. 6081(l)(3) concerning the finality of jurisdictional opinions of registered quarries. d. Does the failure of the Board's regulatory scheme to enable the identification of affected persons with promptness and specificity require that service upon and appeal by ""persons/entities affected by the outcome"" be disregarded as an impediment to finality determinations which the Legislature contemplated for Slate quarry Jurisdictional Opinion (sic) under 10 V.S.A. 6007(c). Catamount Slate Request at 3 - 4. W hether the Board has the duties alleged by Catamount Slate, whether the Board breached those duties, whether the Board's rules are contrary to the intent of the legislature, whether the Board's rules or ""regulatory scheme"" are flawed or fraught with failure, and what should be the remedy for such flaws and failures, is not for the Board to decide. While the Board has certain powers to determine ""the applicability of any statutory provision or of any rule or order of the [Board],"" 3 V.S.A. 808, the validity of a rule may only be determined ""in an action for a declaratory judgment in the Washington superior court...."" 3 V.S.A. 807. In its own defense, the Board will note, however, that, as it pointed out in its July 27, 2001 Memorandum of Decision at 9, the finality problem suffered by Catamount   Catamount Slate, Inc. d/b/a Reed Family Slate Products, and Fred and Suellen Reed Declaratory Ruling Petition #389 Memorandum of Decision Page 11  Slate ""is not an impediment to Catamount Slate's position that the Board has artificially erected; Catamount Slate's difficulties in this regard arise out of the language of 6007(c)."" It is the statute that allows ""any person"" (who is not otherwise barred by the statute's finality provisions) to seek a Jurisdictional Opinion, presumably at any time; 6 Environmental Board Rule 3(C)(1) merely parrots the statutory language. Indeed, were the Board to promulgate rules which abrogated these statutory rights, to the benefit of the slate quarry industry or anyone else, the Board's rules would be subject to attack as contrary to the plain language of the section. C. The Neighbors' request for an extension of time in which to file Exhibit N20.  The Neighbors have submitted some aerial photographs, but had trouble securing one photograph (Exhibit N20) and therefore missed the August 29, 2001 filing date. In their August 28, 2001 filing, they explain the reason for the difficulty in obtaining the photograph and ask that they be allowed until September 7, 2001 to file Exhibit N20. Catamount Slate has not opposed this request. The Board grants the Neighbors' request and allows the late filing of Exhibit N20. D. The Neighbors' subpoena requests  The Neighbors ask the Board to subpoena three witnesses: William Burke, the Commission Coordinator; Larry Becker, State Geologist; and Caryl Philip Adams, the Fair Haven Zoning Administrator (see Exhibits N31, N33 and N34). The Board has reviewed the parties' pre-hearing filings and finds, at present, that only Burke's presence at the hearing may provide evidence which will assist the Board in its determination of the merits of this case. In particular, since Burke took a site visit to the Catamount Slate land in April 2000, his observations as to what he saw at that time and what he may see during the Board's scheduled site visit on October 3, 2001 may assist the Board in this matter. The Board therefore grants the Neighbors' request as to Burke and denies the Neighbors' request as to Becker and Adams. The Board further questions Catamount Slate's claim that ""[T]he language of the statute does not contemplate that service upon some, but not all parties or affected persons, renders finality only upon those served."" Memorandum at 6. Service under 6007(c) is clearly intended to put a person on notice that, if he disagrees with the Jurisdictional Opinion, he had better seek reconsideration of or appeal that opinion or forever be bound by it. Certainly, the statute cannot be read to mean that those who are not served  those who have no idea that a Jurisdictional Opinion exists that finds a slate quarry to be exempt from Act 250  are also so bound. Due process concepts of notice and the opportunity to be heard must dictate otherwise. 6   Catamount Slate, Inc. d/b/a Reed Family Slate Products, and Fred and Suellen Reed Declaratory Ruling Petition #389 Memorandum of Decision Page 12  III.

RE:  Catamount Slate, Inc. d/b/a Reed Family Slate Products and Fred and Suellen Reed  Declaratory Ruling Petition #389  Memorandum of Decision This proceeding involves a Petition for a Declaratory Ruling (""Petition"") from a Jurisdictional Opinion (""JO"") concerning a slate quarry operation in Fair Haven, Vermont.  I.  Procedural History  On June 29, 2000, the Environmental Board (""Board"") issued a Memorandum of Decision on three Preliminary Issues presented in this matter. That Memorandum of Decision contains the relevant Procedural History up to that date. On July 13, 2001, Fred and Suellen Reed and Catamount Slate, Inc., d/b/a Reed Family Slate Products (collectively, ""Catamount Slate"") filed a Motion to Reconsider the June 29 Memorandum of Decision, seeking a new decision on the following Preliminary Issue: 1. Whether the Coordinator for the District 1 Environmental Commission had authority to issue Jurisdictional Opinion 1-S-50-2 (Second Reconsideration), pursuant to 10 V.S.A. 6007(c) and EBR 3(C). On July 16, 2001, Catamount Slate filed a Motion for Permission to Take an Interlocutory Appeal and a Motion to Stay Proceedings. On July 23, 2001, Joanne and David Calvi filed a response to Catamount Slate's Motion to Reconsider. The Board deliberated on all pending motions on July 25, 2001.   Catamount Slate, Inc. d/b/a Reed Family Slate Products, and Fred and Suellen Reed Declaratory Ruling Petition #389 Memorandum of Decision Page 2  II.  Discussion A. Motion to Reconsider 1. Whether service on Emily Joselson is service on the neighbors; whether the Neighbors had actual notice of JO #1-S-50-1 .  Pursuant to EBR 31(A), motions to reconsider or alter decisions of the Board generally cannot be used to present new evidence, North Country Animal League, #5L0487-4-EB, Memorandum of Decision at (Apr. 20, 2000), or new argument, Upper Valley Regional Landfill, #3R0609-EB, Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order at 7 (Nov. 12, 1991), or to reconsider matters not initially considered. Black River Valley Rod & Gun Club, Inc., #2S1019-EB, Memorandum of Decision at 2 (June 12, 1997). And see Finard-Zamias Associates, et al., #1R0661-EB, Memorandum of Decision at 2 (Jan. 16, 1991) (""This interpretation is based on the need to maintain the integrity of the Board's appeal process by ensuring that arguments and evidence are introduced prior to final decision."") The claim by Catamount Slate that Joselson represented neighbors to this Project (David and Joanne Calvi, Lorene Sheldon, Lee Sheldon, Richard Sheldon, Joan Gagnon, Kathleen Donna, Margaret Riter, and Lindsey and Priscilla Waterhouse (hereinafter the ""Neighbors"")) before the Town of Fair Haven Zoning Board of Adjustment (""ZBA"") is a new claim, supported with new evidence. Prior to Catamount Slate's July 13 filings, the only evidence that the Board had was a Notice of Appeal from the ZBA decision to the Environmental Court filed by Ren Barlow. Catamount Slate has now provided Exhibit A, which shows that Emily Joselson signed an October 7, 1999 Certificate of Service concerning the Notice of Appeal to the Environmental Court of behalf of the Neighbors. Catamount Slate presents new evidence and makes new argument in its motion as to Joselson's representation. Its motion, in this regard, is therefore improper and is thus denied. Even if the Board were to address the merits of Catamount Slate's motion, it would find them to be without merit. Catamount Slate's arguments: Catamount Slate makes a series of arguments as to why the District 1 Environmental Commission Coordinator (""Coordinator"") did not have the authority to issue JO #1-S-50-2. These arguments focus on a claim that the Neighbors are timebarred from appeal as they had notice or were served with JO #1-S-50-1 and did not seek a timely   Catamount Slate, Inc. d/b/a Reed Family Slate Products, and Fred and Suellen Reed Declaratory Ruling Petition #389 Memorandum of Decision Page 3  reconsideration of that JO. Thus, Catamount Slate contends that the Coordinator was without authority to issue JO #1-S-50-2. The Board has heard some of these arguments before. Boiled down to their basics, Catamount Slate makes the following claims: a. that notice to an attorney is notice to that attorney's clients  1. Emily Joselson and Rendall Barlow, who are members of the same law firm, have represented the Neighbors since at least their appeal of a conditional use permit issued by the ZBA relative to the Catamount Slate quarry, which the ZBA refers to as a ""State of Vermont registered quarry site."" 2. All of the parties who requested reconsideration of JO #1-S-50-1 are the same as those who appealed the ZBA decision. 3. #1-S-50-1. 4. The land involved in the ZBA decision is the same as the land involved in JO  JO #1-S-50-1 was served on attorney Emily Joselson.  5. Notice to an attorney or ""to an attorney's office ... qualifies as notice to the client."" Irwin v. Department of Veterans Affairs, 498 U.S. 89, 92 (1990). 1 1  The Irwin decision explains: Under our system of representative litigation, ""each party is deemed bound by the acts of his lawyer-agent and is considered to have 'notice of all facts, notice of which can be charged upon the attorney.' "" Link v. Wabash R. Co., 370 U.S. 626, 634, 82 S.Ct. 1386, 1390, 8 L.Ed.2d 734 (1962) (quoting Smith v. Ayer, 101 U.S. 320, 326, 25 L.Ed. 955 (1880)). Congress has endorsed this sensible practice in the analogous provisions of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, which provide that ""[w]henever under these rules service is required or permitted to be made upon a party represented by an attorney the service shall be made upon the attorney unless service upon the party is ordered by the court."" Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 5(b). To read the term ""receipt"" to mean only ""actual receipt by the claimant"" would render the practice of notification through counsel a meaningless exercise. If Congress intends to depart from the common and established practice of providing notification through   Catamount Slate, Inc. d/b/a Reed Family Slate Products, and Fred and Suellen Reed Declaratory Ruling Petition #389 Memorandum of Decision Page 4  b.  that Joselson represented the Neighbors in the JO process  6. It is clear that Barlow and Joselson represented the Neighbors in JO #1-S50-1 because there would otherwise have been no reason to serve Joselson with the JO. Since it is standard office procedure to serve attorneys who the Coordinator learns are representing ""interested persons,"" it can be surmised that Joselson was served because the Coordinator had determined that she was such an attorney. Joselson was served because she represented parties interested or affected by the outcome of JO #1-S-50-1. 7. In light of the fact that Joselson represented the Neighbors in the ZBA appeal, service of JO #1-S-50-1 on Joselson is service on the clients of her firm. c. The Neighbors had actual notice of JO #1-S-50-1  8. The Neighbors had actual notice of JO #1-S-50-1. This is all that is required under the Vermont Supreme Court's decision in In re Great Waters of America, 140 Vt. 105, 109 (1981). Joanne and David Calvi's response to Catamount Slate's arguments: Joanne and David Calvi have a filed a response to Catamount Slate's arguments. The Calvis state that, while Ms. Joselson did represent them and others in the ZBA matter counsel, it must do so expressly. See Decker v. Anheuser-Busch, 632 F.2d 1221, 1224 (CA5 1980). We also reject Irwin's contention that there is a material difference between receipt by an attorney and receipt by that attorney's office for purposes of  2000e-16(c). The lower federal courts have consistently held that notice to an attorney's office which is acknowledged by a representative of that office qualifies as notice to the client. See Ringgold v. National Maintenance Corp., 796 F.2d 769 (CA5 1986); Josiah-Faeduwor v. Communications Satellite Corp., 251 U.S.App.D.C. 346, 785 F.2d 344 (1986). Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 5(b) also permits notice to a litigant to be made by delivery of papers to the litigant's attorney's office. The practical effect of a contrary rule would be to encourage factual disputes about when actual notice was received, and thereby create uncertainty in an area of the law where certainty is much to be desired.   Catamount Slate, Inc. d/b/a Reed Family Slate Products, and Fred and Suellen Reed Declaratory Ruling Petition #389 Memorandum of Decision Page 5  and was a part of the mediation process in this matter, her firm was not ""retained to pursue actions in the Vermont Environmental Board or the Act 250 process."" Discussion of Catamount Slate's arguments: Ordinarily, service on or notice to an attorney is equivalent to service or notice on that attorney's clients, see V.R.C.P. 5(b). But this argument begs the question as to whether Joselson was the Neighbors' attorney for purposes of the JO proceedings. In Irwin, this was not an issue; the decision specifically states: ""There is no question but that petitioner appeared by his attorney in the EEOC proceeding."" 498 U.S. at 92. Interestingly, this was the question in the Vermont Supreme Court case which the Board cited in its June 29 Memorandum of Decision and to which Catamount Slate refers in its present argument. In Agency of Natural Resources v. Towns, 168 Vt. 449 (1998), the question was whether, when a phone call was made alerting the Attorney General's Office to an illegal waste site, this constituted notice to the Agency of Natural Resources (""ANR"") of the existence of the site. If it did, then ANR's later action to compel the cleanup of the site would have been barred by the statute of limitations. The Court's decision makes it clear that the question whether an attorney is a person's representative is a question of fact. Thus, even if the Board accepts Catamount Slate's first five statements as true, there is no evidence in the record before the Board, as there was in Irwin, that the Neighbors ""appeared by their attorney"" in the Jurisdictional Opinion proceedings. As to Catamount Slate's second claim - that Joselson represented the Neighbors in the JO process - the Board has no way of knowing why JO #1-S-50-1 was served on Joselson; she may have expressed an interest to the Coordinator to see anything he issued, as it could play some role in the ZBA appeal. While, no doubt, the connections between the JOs and the ZBA appeal are facially apparent, it is a stretch to infer that Joselson's representation of the Neighbors in the ZBA case equates to her representation in the JO series and thus service on her equates to service on the Neighbors. Whether Joselson represented the Neighbors on the JO proceedings is a question of fact, and the Board finds that Catamount Slate has presented insufficient evidence to allow the Board to find that Joselson, or any other member of her firm, acted as the Neighbors' representative or attorney in the JO proceedings before the Coordinator. Finally, as to Catamount Slate's claim that the Neighbors had actual notice of JO #1-S-50-1 and that this is all that is required under the Vermont Supreme Court's Great   Catamount Slate, Inc. d/b/a Reed Family Slate Products, and Fred and Suellen Reed Declaratory Ruling Petition #389 Memorandum of Decision Page 6  Waters decision: this argument ignores the Board's analysis in the June 29 Memorandum of Decision on this point: The problem with this argument is inherent in the language of the statute: ""If the requestor wishes a final determination to be rendered on the question [of jurisdiction], the district coordinator ... shall serve the opinion [on interested parties]...."" (Emphasis added). Service is effectuated, under Board policy, by the mailing of a Jurisdictional Opinion to a person. And see 10 V.S.A. 6007(c) (appeal to the Board from a Jurisdictional Opinion must be taken within 30 days of ""the mailing of the opinion""); EBR 3(C)(3) and 12(J). That a person may have had actual notice or might otherwise have become aware of a Jurisdictional Opinion is immaterial; for a Jurisdictional Opinion to be binding on a person, the law requires that it be served on him. Nor does the Board find the Great Waters case to be apposite here. That case addressed only the question of whether the constitution required actual notice that an application had been submitted to a District Commission be given to an adjoining landowner; the Court held that, as an adjoiner has no constitutionally protected liberty or property rights to notice or to participate in Act 250 cases, but has only those rights that the legislature has granted to him, actual notice of an application is not constitutionally required. Notice, however, is different from service, and, in 6007(c) the legislature has specifically stated that only those persons who are served with a Jurisdictional Opinion will be bound by it. Memorandum of Decision at 6  7. Catamount Slate provides no reason as to why the Board's earlier analysis is somehow incorrect. 2. A decision on a quarry registration is a ""final determination"" that is subject to different rules than those which apply to ordinary JOs.  Catamount Slate's arguments on this point are new and perhaps should have been made in its initial May 31, 2001 filings. However, they can also be considered to be arguments which are made in response to the Board's June 29, 2001 Memorandum of Decision, and the Board does not therefore consider them to be barred under EBR 31(A). See, Nehemiah Associates, Inc., #1R0672-1-EB, Memorandum of Decision at 2 - 3 (Oct. 3, 1995) (new arguments are not acceptable, with the exception that parties may present argument ""about matters they could not reasonably have known about before."")   Catamount Slate, Inc. d/b/a Reed Family Slate Products, and Fred and Suellen Reed Declaratory Ruling Petition #389 Memorandum of Decision Page 7  Catamount Slate's arguments: Catamount Slate argues that: 1. Quarry registrations are entitled to a finality status that is different from other JOs. Catamount Slate has not had the advantage of this finality. 2. The legislature placed an obligation on the Board to determine how this finality should be accomplished; it can be accomplished by service, by publication, by personal service, or evidence of actual notice. 3. There is no notice on the registration form that quarry registration decisions could be subject to reopening, and the legislature could not have conceived that this could occur. 4. The quarry registration form requires that only adjoiners, the town and other statutory parties be served. 5. Catamount Slate relied on the quarry registration form when filling it out.  6. The interested parties had adequate opportunity to participate in the decision-making process concerning the quarry registration. 2 7. Two state representatives, Ira Pike and Fred Maslack, state by affidavit that it is their understanding that the slate quarry exemption statute, 10 V.S.A.  6081(l), would allow a quarry owner to obtain a ""final determination"" that would not be subject to later attack. Discussion of Catamount Slate's arguments: It is unclear, from a reading of the statute, where Catamount Slate finds a legislative intent to somehow make a special case for the finality of quarry registrations different from those which are afforded to other JOs. The slate quarry exemption statute, reads, in pertinent part: 2  Of course, if as Catamount Slate argues, it was not required to serve these persons with its application, it is somewhat difficult to see how they would have known to participate.   Catamount Slate, Inc. d/b/a Reed Family Slate Products, and Fred and Suellen Reed Declaratory Ruling Petition #389 Memorandum of Decision Page 8  (3) Slate quarry registration documents shall be submitted to the district commission together with a request, under the provisions of subsection 6007(c) of this title, for a final determination regarding the applicability of this chapter. (4) The final determination regarding a slate quarry registration under subsection 6007(c) of this title shall be recorded in the municipal land records at the expense of the registrant along with an accurate site plan of the parcel depicting the site specific information contained in the registration documents. 10 V.S.A. 6081(l)(3) and (4). While the Board recognizes that both subsections (3) and (4) of 6081(l)(3) and (4) use the words ""final determination,""3 it is apparent from the plain language of these subsections and their direct references to the ""provisions of subsection 6007(c) of this title"" that the legislature intended the JO process to apply to slate quarry registrations in the same manner as they apply to other JOs. Nothing in 6081(l)(3) and (4) indicates that there is to be special or preferential treatment of such registrations. As the Board summarized its conclusions in its June 29 Memorandum of Decision, 6007(c) and Environmental Board Rule 3(C)(1) make its clear that First, if the person who requests a Jurisdictional Opinion wants others to be bound by it, it is incumbent upon that person to make this desire known to the Coordinator, to provide the Coordinator with the names of those persons to be served with the Jurisdictional Opinion, 3  Under subsection (3), a person may submit quarry registration documents to the District Commission and a request for a JO to the Coordinator, as provided by 10 V.S.A. 6007(c). Whether such a request for a JO becomes a ""final determination"" is governed by the provisions of 6007(c). Likewise, the Board reads the words, ""final determination"" in subsection (4) to mean that, when a person receives a JO that is not appealed, it must be filed in the land records. But subsection (4) should not be read to implicitly amend 6007(c) by giving special status to slate quarry registrations. Amendments of statutes by implication are not favored. United States v. Welden, 337 U.S. 95, 102 n.12 (1964); and see State Agency of Natural Resources v. Riendeau, 157 Vt. 615, 620 (1991) (repeals by implication are disfavored).   Catamount Slate, Inc. d/b/a Reed Family Slate Products, and Fred and Suellen Reed Declaratory Ruling Petition #389 Memorandum of Decision Page 9  and to pay for such service. The Coordinator has no independent obligation to provide notice to others who have not appeared or participated in the Jurisdictional Opinion process, either by service or publication, of the Opinion. Second, to be bound by a Jurisdictional Opinion, a person must be served with it. [4 ] Lastly, even if service is made upon many people, the finality of a Jurisdictional Opinion cannot be guaranteed. Section 6007(c) reads, ""With respect to the partition or division of land, or with respect to an activity which might or might not constitute development, any person ... may request a jurisdictional opinion from the district coordinator concerning the applicability of this chapter."" (Emphasis added) Thus, in some respects, under the statute, no Jurisdictional Opinion issued by a Coordinator can ever be considered to be absolutely final as regards the world. June 29, 2001 Memorandum of Decision at 10 11. This is not an impediment to Catamount Slate's position that the Board has artificially erected; Catamount Slate's difficulties in this regard arise out of the language of 6007(c). Thus, if slate quarry registrations are not entitled to any special ""finality"" status, there is likewise no obligation for the Board to provide such status by providing some sort of notice or service on persons beyond that which is provided for in 6007(c). The affidavits of the two state representatives are problematic in two respects. First, they constitute new evidence, something which is generally not allowed within the context of a reconsideration motion. EBR 31(A)(1). Second, ""The remarks of a single legislator, even the sponsor, are not controlling in analyzing legislative history."" Chrysler Corp. v. Brown, 441 U.S. 281, 311 (1978). See also State of Vermont v. Brinegar, 379 F. Supp. 606, 611 (D. Vt. 1974).  4  Thus, while Catamount Slate may be correct in noting that the registration form requires that only certain entities be served, this does not mean that other persons, who are not served with the Jurisdictional Opinion request, are somehow bound by a determination about which they know nothing.   Catamount Slate, Inc. d/b/a Reed Family Slate Products, and Fred and Suellen Reed Declaratory Ruling Petition #389 Memorandum of Decision Page 10  B.  Motion to Take Interlocutory Appeal  Under the Vermont Rules of Appellate Procedure (""VRAP"") 5, a party which wishes to take an interlocutory appeal to the Vermont Supreme Court from a trial court or an administrative body must first seek permission from the lower tribunal. Catamount Slate's present motion is such a request. The Vermont Supreme Court has written: Interlocutory appeals are an exception to the normal restriction of appellate jurisdiction to the review of final judgments. There are weighty considerations that support the finality requirement. Piecemeal appellate review causes unnecessary delay and expense, and wastes scarce judicial resources. Furthermore, an appellate court labors under great disadvantages in disposing of interlocutory appeals. We are deprived of the benefits of a final trial court opinion. Interlocutory review requires us to decide legal questions in a vacuum, without benefit of factual findings. Appellate decisionmaking suffers from such abstractness. By its very nature then, interlocutory appeals impair this Court's basic functions of correctly interpreting the law and providing justice for all litigants. Despite those hazards, there is a narrow class of cases in which interlocutory review is nonetheless advisable. In re Pyramid Co. of Burlington, 141 Vt. 294, 300 - 01 (1982) (internal citation omitted). The Vermont Supreme Court has held that ""Interlocutory appeal is appropriate for questions of law, not fact,"" because a question of law ""is one capable if accurate resolution by an appellate court without the benefit of a factual record. If factual distinctions could control the legal result, the issue is not an appropriate subject for interlocutory appeal."" Pyramid, 141 Vt. at 304. And see State v. Dubois, 150 Vt. 600 (1988). As noted, whether Emily Joselson represent the Neighbors in the JO process, at least as of the time that JO #1-S-50-1 was served is a question of fact. Thus, the question of whether the appearance of Joselson's name on the Certificate of Service for JO #1-S50-1 constitutes notice of JO #1-S-50-1 to the Neighbors is not an appropriate question for interlocutory appeal. 5 5  The Board notes that Catamount Slate has not presented evidence on this question beyond the documents it has submitted.   Catamount Slate, Inc. d/b/a Reed Family Slate Products, and Fred and Suellen Reed Declaratory Ruling Petition #389 Memorandum of Decision Page 11  1.  Interlocutory appeal elements  There are three factors which a party seeking to take an interlocutory appeal must demonstrate. First, the party must show that the order appealed from (here the Board's June 29, 2001 Memorandum of Decision or the Board's decision on Catamount Slate's pending reconsideration motion) involves a ""controlling question of law;"" second there must be a ""substantial ground for difference of opinion"" as to the correctness of that order; and third, an interlocutory appeal should ""materially advance the termination of the litigation."" Pyramid, 141 Vt. at 301; State v. Wheel, 148 Vt. 439 (1987); VRAP 5(b). Repeating the arguments as to finality and notice that it made both in its initial May 31, 2001 filings and its July 13, 2001 arguments in favor of its reconsideration motion, Catamount Slate presents its reasons as to why the question of law which it wishes to present to the Supreme Court is one which is both ""controlling"" and as to which there is a ""substantial ground for difference of opinion;"" it then argues that the litigation will terminate if it is successful. a. ""controlling question of law""  A question is ""controlling"" when it governs the outcome of the litigation. State v. Wheel. It may also be ""controlling"" if reversal would have ""a substantial impact on the litigation, either by saving substantial litigation time, or by significantly narrowing the range of issues, claims or defenses at trial."" Pyramid, 141 Vt. at 303. Here, if Catamount Slate is right, and the Neighbors are time-barred from seeking reconsideration of JO #1-S-501(for any or all of the legal  but not factual - reasons argued by Catamount Slate), then this litigation would end, and the question would be ""controlling."" Likewise, were slate quarry registration requests to be accorded special status which somehow removes them from the ordinary JOs addressed in 10 V.S.A. 6007(c), this question of law might also be ""controlling."" b. ""substantial ground for difference of opinion""  Whether there is a ""substantial ground for difference of opinion"" depends on whether the Board believes that ""a reasonable appellate judge could vote for reversal of the challenged order."" Pyramid, 141 at 307 (citation and internal quotes omitted). 6 ""Unless an order triggers this degree of doubt in the mind of a trial judge, certification [to 6  Interestingly, the Supreme Court has held that the vehemence of a disagreeing attorney's arguments is not relevant to the inquiry. Id. at 306.   Catamount Slate, Inc. d/b/a Reed Family Slate Products, and Fred and Suellen Reed Declaratory Ruling Petition #389 Memorandum of Decision Page 12  allow the interlocutory appeal] is improper."" Id. Finally, the Supreme Court notes that a denial of permission to take an interlocutory appeal is itself appealable, thereby ""assuring that the doubtfulness of trial court rulings can be evaluated by an independent arbiter after the denial of certification."" Id. The Board does not find doubt in its decision which rises to the level appropriate to satisfy this element and justify interlocutory review. c. ""the potential to materially advance the termination of the litigation""  ""An interlocutory appeal is proper only if it may advance the ultimate termination of a case."" Pyramid, 141 Vt. at 305 (emphasis in original). And in deciding whether to grant an interlocutory appeal, the trial court ""must consider not only the time saved at trial, but also the time expended on appeal,"" State v. Lafayette, 148 Vt. 288, 290 (1987), quoting Pyramid, 141 Vt. at 305, both the appeal time expended in the interlocutory appeal and the appeal of the final order. Indeed, the Supreme Court found in the Pyramid case that the trial court could have foreseen that its final decision would be appealed, regardless of the Supreme Court's resolution of the interlocutory appeal, and, therefore, ""certification [of the interlocutory appeal] has probably assured an even greater delay."" Pyramid, 141 Vt. at 306. The Board must balance several considerations. On the side of granting Catamount Slate's motion for interlocutory review is the possibility that a holding by the Supreme Court that the Neighbors are time-barred from seeking reconsideration of JO #1-S-50-1 and that the Coordinator did not have the independent authority to issue JO #1-S-50-2, sua sponte; will terminate this litigation, and the Board will never reach the merits. Likewise, a holding that slate quarry registrations are entitled to some sort of special finality status which removes registration decisions from the ordinary context of 6007(c) may also lead to the end of this matter. Finally, the Board is mindful of the wasted cost to the parties of going forward with this case, should the Court ultimately decide that it should have been dismissed today. On the other hand, the Board must consider that the hearing in this case is scheduled for October 3, 2001, and it is likely that the Board will be able to deliberate and issue a decision before the end of the year, if this case proceeds as presently scheduled. Further, the Board may ultimately find in Catamount Slate's favor on the merits of the ultimate question of its exempt status, thus terminating this litigation, causing all of Catamount Slate's procedural arguments to be moot, and causing any time or resources spent in the Supreme Court on interlocutory appeal to have been wasted. Finally, an   Catamount Slate, Inc. d/b/a Reed Family Slate Products, and Fred and Suellen Reed Declaratory Ruling Petition #389 Memorandum of Decision Page 13  interlocutory appeal to the Court will take time, and unless the appeal were to be placed on an expedited schedule, the Board believes it unlikely that the Court would be able to hear and decide the appeal within the next several months. On balance, the Board concludes that less waste of time and resources will be likely if this matter proceeds to a hearing before the Board as scheduled. In sum, therefore, the Board does not find that Catamount Slate has presented adequate grounds for interlocutory review, and it therefore denies Catamount Slate's motion. 7  7  There is one other element in the consideration of whether to allow an interlocutory appeal which does not appear in VRAP 5 but which has played a role in the Supreme Court's determination of at least one case  prejudice to the parties. In In re C.H., 151 Vt. 310 (1989), the Court waived strict adherence to the required elements of VRAP 5(b) because it found that having to wait to appeal until a final judgment had been reached could result in ""substantial injuries"" to the party seeking interlocutory review. Our Supreme Court has never specifically looked to the prejudice that could result to a party who had to wait until an interlocutory appeal had been heard before receiving a final decision on the merits, but that prejudice is potentially present in this matter. Currently, even though Act 250 jurisdiction over Catamount Slate's quarry has been determined in JO #1-S-50-2, Catamount Slate continues to operate its quarry and to the possible detriment of the Neighbors. The delay that will result from allowing this interlocutory appeal, even if Catamount Slate is unsuccessful in such an appeal, will inure to Catamount Slate's benefit and a concomitant potential harm to the Neighbors. This delay may also be prejudicial to Act 250 itself, as the longer Catamount Slate can avoid a final decision on the merits, the longer it can operate its quarry in the face of a JO. The Board's decision to deny Catamount Slate's motion, however, does not depend on a finding of prejudice to the Neighbors or to Act 250.   Catamount Slate, Inc. d/b/a Reed Family Slate Products, and Fred and Suellen Reed Declaratory Ruling Petition #389 Memorandum of Decision Page 14  C.  Motion to Stay Proceedings  The parties' initial filings (prefiled testimony and Exhibits) are due on August 1, 2001. Catamount Slate asks the Board to stay its proceedings until such time as the Board rules on Catamount Slate's interlocutory appeal motion. As the Board has today denied Catamount Slate's motion, the stay request is moot.  III.  Order Catamount Slate's motions are denied.  Dated at Montpelier, Vermont this 27th day of July 2001.

GX270-51-2510634	"VERMONT ENVIRONMENTAL BOARD 10 V.S.A. Ch. 151  RE:  Catamount Slate, Inc. d/b/a Reed Family Slate Products and Fred and Suellen Reed  Declaratory Ruling #389  Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order This proceeding involves a Petition for a Declaratory Ruling (Petition) from a Jurisdictional Opinion concerning a slate quarry operation in Fair Haven, Vermont.  I.  Procedural History  On July 21, 2000, District #1 Environmental Commission (Commission) Coordinator William Burke (Coordinator) issued Jurisdictional Opinion #1-S-50-2 (Second Reconsideration) (JO) in which he determined that commercial extraction of slate from four slate quarry holes on a  122-acre tract located off Inman Pond Road in the Town of Fair Haven (Project) requires a permit pursuant to 10 V.S.A.  6001-6092 (Act 250). On August 9, 2000, Fred and Suellen Reed and Catamount Slate, Inc., (collectively, Catamount Slate) filed a Petition for Declaratory Ruling with the Environmental Board (Board), appealing the JO. On August 29, 2000, the General Counsel for the Board issued a Notice of Prehearing Conference and Petition for Declaratory Ruling, informing those individuals who had received notice of the JO that the Petition had been filed and setting a date and time for the Prehearing Conference in this matter for September 14, 2000 at 2:00 p.m. On September 7, 2000, James Leary, Esq., the attorney for Catamount Slate at that time, informed the Board by letter that Catamount Slate and neighboring landowners, following mediation, ""appear to have reached a resolution of the issues"" underlying the Petition. Leary's letter noted that settlement documents were being drafted and stated further that he anticipated ""that Catamount Slate will withdraw its appeal after the necessary documents have been executed by the appropriate persons."" Leary therefore requested that the scheduled September 14 Prehearing Conference be continued ""pending the withdrawal of the appeal.""   Catamount Slate, Inc. d/b/a Reed Family Slate Products, and Fred and Suellen Reed Declaratory Ruling #389 Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order Page 2  On September 7, 2000, in response to Leary's letter, Board Chair Marcy Harding issued an Order, continuing the Prehearing Conference to October 13, 2000. The Chair's Order required that any further request for a continuance be filed no later than October 5, 2000. On October 3, 2000, Leary filed a second request for a continuance, noting again that the parties were continuing their attempts at a non-adversarial resolution of this matter. Leary stated that, as a part of the settlement, Catamount Slate would seek an Act 250 permit for the quarry (and associated mill facility), and once a final permit had been obtained that incorporated the relevant terms of the global settlement, Catamount Slate would withdraw the instant appeal. Leary therefore requested that the Prehearing Conference in this matter be continued pending the issuance of a final Act 250 Permit by the Commission. On October 4, 2000, in response to Leary's request, the Chair issued an Order continuing this proceeding until the Commission issued a decision concerning the Land Use Permit application which Catamount Slate stated it intended to file. The Chair's Order required that on or before January 9, 2001, Catamount Slate file with the Board a status report concerning its application. In late February 2001, with the filing of a motion to withdraw as counsel filed by Leary, it came to the Board's attention that attempts at an informal resolution of the issues underlying the Petition had been unsuccessful and that this Petition might therefore need to be set for further proceedings. On May 1, 2001, the Chair held a status conference in this matter and determined that this case should be set for a Prehearing Conference. On May 22, 2001, the Chair convened a Prehearing Conference. On June 29, 2001, the Board issued Memoranda of Decision on three Preliminary Issues presented in this matter. Subsequent Memoranda were issued on July 27 and September 20, 2001, following reconsideration motions filed by Catamount Slate. Hearing was held on October 3, 2001 in Fair Haven, Vermont. Catamount Slate participated through its attorney, Stephanie Lorentz, Esq. Certain neighbors to the Project also participated: Joanne and David Calvi, Lorene Sheldon, Lee Sheldon, Richard Sheldon, Joan Gagnon, Kathleen Donna, Margaret Riter and Lindsey and Priscilla Waterhouse.   Catamount Slate, Inc. d/b/a Reed Family Slate Products, and Fred and Suellen Reed Declaratory Ruling #389 Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order Page 3  On October 17, 2001, Catamount Slate filed two post-hearing motions. The motions ask (a) for the opportunity to provide rebuttal testimony to the testimony provided at the hearing by Coordinator William Burke, and (b) that the testimony of Joseph Badgewick be struck. The Board deliberated on this matter on October 17, November 14 and December 19, 2001. This matter is now ready for final decision.  II.  The Issue  The issue to be decided is ""Whether the Project requires an Act 250 Land Use Permit.""  III.  Findings of Fact  To the extent any proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law are included below, they are granted; otherwise, they are denied. See, Secretary, Agency of Natural Resources v. Upper Valley Regional Landfill Corporation, 167 Vt. 228, 241-42 (1997); Petition of Village of Hardwick Electric Department, 143 Vt. 437, 445 (1983). 1 A. The quarry tract  1. Frederick Reed and Suellen Reed own a +/-122 acre parcel of land located on the northeasterly side of ""Old Marsh Pond"" in Fair Haven, Vermont. 2. Catamount Slate presently operates a slate quarry on the Reeds' Fair Haven land. 3. At one time, there were at least four small slate quarry pits on the Reed land; each of these four quarry pits was a separate and distinct pit, some distance from and unrelated to the others. There is present evidence of two of these quarry pits on the Reed land; the current quarrying operation has destroyed and subsumed the other two quarry pits. The Board makes its Findings of Fact based solely on evidence provided by Catamount Slate and observed at the site visit. Because the Board has not relied upon the testimony of William Burke or Joseph Badgewick, Catamount Slate's post-hearing motions are moot. 1   Catamount Slate, Inc. d/b/a Reed Family Slate Products, and Fred and Suellen Reed Declaratory Ruling #389 Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order Page 4  4. Other pits, their ages unknown, exist on the Reed land; they do not appear to be natural holes. Waste slate or shale appears in or near some of these pits. B. The four quarry pits 1. the north pit  5. The northern-most quarry pit at issue in this case (the north pit) is located on the Reed land, several hundred yards to the northwest of the present quarry operation, near the east shore of Inman Pond. 6. The north pit is approximately 25 feet long, three to six feet wide, and four to six feet deep; slate pieces lie in the bottom of the pit. 7. Some of the walls of the north pit are flat; there are drill holes on the walls.  8. Brush grows on the sides of the north pit; no trees are growing in the pit, but there is a rotted out stump on the edge of the pit. 9. The area immediately around the north pit is a mixed deciduous forest which has been logged within the last 30 years. 10. Waste slate mounds appear around the north pit; some slate pieces are large; there is no uniformity of size and the pieces are odd shapes. One waste slate mound to the west of the north pit, an oval shape about 20 feet long, eight feet wide and three feet high, appears to have existed for some time. 2. the south pit  11. The southern-most quarry pit at issue in this matter (the south pit) is located to the east of the marsh and to the southwest of the present quarry operation; it is the southern-most of the three historical pits in its immediate area. 12. The south pit is larger than the north pit; it is shaped like a about 35  40 feet long and 5 - 15 feet wide; there is water in this pit, so is unknown, but the walls above the water surface are at most five to six There is waste slate to the south side of this pit. Three blue/white wires hole. ""Y"" and is its exact depth feet high. extend into this   Catamount Slate, Inc. d/b/a Reed Family Slate Products, and Fred and Suellen Reed Declaratory Ruling #389 Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order Page 5  3.  the other two quarry pits  13. Two other quarry pits once existed on the Reed land; they were located northeast of and in the immediate area of the south pit. 14. These two other quarry pits (the subsumed pits) are no longer evident, having been destroyed and subsumed by the present quarrying operation. 15. There is no evidence of any relationship (physical or otherwise) between the south pit and the two subsumed pits. C. Extraction of slate at the four quarry pits 1. 16. of 1954. 17. the south pit  Andrew Brown worked for Henry Reed, Fred Reed's father, in the summer  Henry Reed paid Brown an hourly wage for this work.  18. Brown quarried slate from the south pit, the pit closest to the marsh (Inman Pond). At the time he worked the south pit, it appeared to have been worked at some prior time by others. 19. The work performed by Andy Brown was performed utilizing crowbars, shovels, horses and a pulley system. Brown and Henry Reed also blasted the south pit with black powder. 20. The commercial slate extracted from the south pit in which Brown and Henry Reed worked was dimensional stone known as flagging. 21. About five or six, one-quarter wagon loads of slate were removed from the site by Brown and Henry Reed utilizing a wagon pulled by a horse over the dike across Inman Pond. 22. At least some of the slate Brown and Henry Reed quarried from the south pit was marketed commercially. 23. Catamount Slate's present quarrying operations do not include the south pit and are not connected to, related to, or an offshoot of, the south pit.   Catamount Slate, Inc. d/b/a Reed Family Slate Products, and Fred and Suellen Reed Declaratory Ruling #389 Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order Page 6  2.  the north pit and the subsumed pits  24. In 1954, Brown saw the subsumed pits; he is also aware of the north pit but has never seen it. He did not work these other three pits, however, and he is only aware of work prior to 1970 at the south pit where he worked. 25. There is no evidence of the commercial sale of slate from the north pit or the subsumed pits prior to 1970. IV. Conclusions of Law A. The slate quarry exemption law  In 1995, in order to provide certain exemptions to the slate quarrying industry, the Vermont legislature amended 10 V.S.A. 6001 and 6081. A new definition of ""slate quarry"" was added as 6001(25): (25) ""Slate quarry"" means a quarry pit or hole from which slate has been extracted or removed for the purpose of commercial production of building material, roofing, tile or other dimensional stone products. ""Dimensional stone"" refers to slate that is processed into regularly shaped blocks, according to specifications. The words ""slate quarry"" shall not include pits or holes from which slate is extracted primarily for purposes of crushed stone products, unless, as of June 1, 1970, slate had been extracted from those pits or holes primarily for those purposes. New language concerning Act 250 jurisdiction over slate quarries was also added as 10 V.S.A. 6081( j), (k) and (l): (j) With respect to the extraction of slate from a slate quarry that is included in final slate quarry registration documents, if it were removed from a site prior to June 1, 1970, the site from which slate was actually removed, if lying unused at any time after those operations commenced, shall be deemed to be held in reserve, and shall not be deemed to be abandoned.   Catamount Slate, Inc. d/b/a Reed Family Slate Products, and Fred and Suellen Reed Declaratory Ruling #389 Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order Page 7  (k) (1) With respect to the commercial extraction of slate from a slate quarry, activities that are not ancillary to slate mining operations may constitute substantial changes, and be subject to permitting requirements under this chapter. ""Ancillary activities"" include the following activities that pertain to slate and that take place within a registered parcel that contains a slate quarry: drilling, crushing, grinding, sizing, washing, drying, sawing and cutting stone, blasting, trimming, punching, splitting and gauging, and use of buildings and use and construction of equipment exclusively to carry out the above activities. Buildings that existed on April 1, 1995, or any replacements to those buildings, shall be considered ancillary. (2) Activities that are ancillary activities that involve crushing, may constitute substantial changes if they may result in significant impact with respect to any of the criteria specified in subdivisions 6086(a)(1) through (10) of this title. (l ) (1) By no later than January 1, 1997, any owner of land or mineral rights or any owner of slate quarry leasehold rights on a parcel of land on which a slate quarry was located as of June 1, 1970, may register the existence of the slate quarry with the district commission and with the clerk of the municipality in which the slate quarry is located, while also providing each with a map which indicates the boundaries of the parcel which contains the slate quarry. (2) Slate quarry registration shall state the name and address of the owner of the land, mineral rights or leasehold rights; whether that person holds mineral rights, or leasehold rights or is the owner in fee simple; the physical location of the same; the physical location and size of ancillary buildings; and the book and page of the recorded deed or other instrument by which the owner holds title to the land or rights. (3) Slate quarry registration documents shall be submitted to the district commission together with a request, under the provisions of subsection 6007(c) of this title, for a final determination regarding the applicability of this chapter.   Catamount Slate, Inc. d/b/a Reed Family Slate Products, and Fred and Suellen Reed Declaratory Ruling #389 Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order Page 8  (4) The final determination regarding a slate quarry registration under subsection 6007(c) of this title shall be recorded in the municipal land records at the expense of the registrant along with an accurate site plan of the parcel depicting the site specific information contained in the registration documents. (5) With respect to a slate quarry located on a particular registered parcel of land, ancillary activities on the parcel related to the extraction and processing of slate into products that are primarily other than crushed stone products shall not be deemed to be substantial changes, as long as the activities do not involve the creation of one or more new slate quarry holes that are not related to an existing slate quarry hole. 10 V.S.A. 6081( j), (k) and (l). Distilled to its basics for purposes of this matter, this legislation means that: 1. Any registered slate quarry that was in existence before July 1, 1970 will never be deemed to have been abandoned. 2. Any registered slate quarry in existence before July 1, 1970 is exempt from Act 250 jurisdiction. See Northeast Developers, Inc., Declaratory Ruling #342, Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order (Oct. 28, 1997). 3. Even a substantial change to any registered slate quarry in existence before July 1, 1970 will not require an Act 250 permit.2 Other language which addresses ""ancillary activities"" to slate extraction and processing is not pertinent to the issue before the Board in this case.  While the statute actually states that activities that are not ""ancillary"" to slate mining operations may be ""substantial changes,"" the inference is that activities that are ancillary to such operations  including the mining itself  are not ""substantial changes"" and therefore do not trigger jurisdiction.  2   Catamount Slate, Inc. d/b/a Reed Family Slate Products, and Fred and Suellen Reed Declaratory Ruling #389 Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order Page 9  B.  Burden of proof  As the party seeking the benefit of the slate quarry exemption, Catamount Slate bears both the burdens of production and persuasion that it applies to its circumstances. United States v. First City National Bank of Houston, 386 U.S. 361, 366 (1967); Vermont Verde Antique International, Inc., Declaratory Ruling Request #387, Dismissal Order at 4 (Feb. 2, 2001). The burden of production is the burden of going forward with evidence. See, Director, Office of Workers' Compensation Programs, Department of Labor v. Greenwich Collieries, 512 U.S. 267, 272-274 (1994)(discussing burden of production and burden of persuasion); Re: Thomas Howrigan Gravel Extraction, Declaratory Ruling #358, Findings, Conclusions and Order at 9 (Aug. 30, 1999), citing Champlain Construction Co., Declaratory Ruling #214, Memorandum of Decision at 2-4 (Oct. 2, 1990)).  C.  Elements to the exemption  To obtain the statutory exemption for a pit, Catamount Slate must prove: 1. that a slate quarry (or quarries) exists on its land. The elements of the definition of a slate quarry, as set out in 10 V.S.A. 6001(25), are: a. b. c. that it is a quarry pit or hole from which slate has been extracted or removed for the purpose of commercial production of  i. building material, roofing, tile or other dimensional stone products (slate that is processed into regularly shaped blocks, according to specifications); or ii. crushed stone products, if, as of June 1, 1970, slate had been extracted from those pits or holes primarily for those purposes. (This part does not apply to the present case, as Catamount Slate has never argued that its pits produced crushed product.) 2. that the slate quarry existed as of June 1, 1970; 10 V.S.A. 6081(l)(1); and,   Catamount Slate, Inc. d/b/a Reed Family Slate Products, and Fred and Suellen Reed Declaratory Ruling #389 Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order Page 10  3. that the owner of the slate quarry registered such quarry with the district commission no later than January 1, 1997. 10 V.S.A. 6081(l)(1). Since the definition of slate quarry is tied to the particular quarry pit or hole, the Board must look at each individual hole to determine whether or not it meets the requirements of the law. See, Northeast Developers, supra, at 5. It may well be that one or more of the four holes on the 122-acre tract owned by Catamount Slate qualifies for the exemption. But the Board's consideration cannot be of the entire tract; a finding that there is an exempt pit on the tract does not mean that the entire tract is therefore exempt. Rather, the exemption that the statute affords can be granted only to the particular pit that meets all of the elements of the law.  D.  Discussion  Catamount Slate has proved that, prior to 1970, slate was extracted from four separate pits on the Reed land. Catamount Slate has also proved that the extraction of the slate from one of these pits  the south pit worked by Andrew Brown in 1954, was for the purpose of the commercial production of dimensional stone products. As to the three other pits at issue in this matter, although Brown observed the subsumed pits in 1954, and other evidence indicates that the north existed prior to 1970, Catamount Slate has not provided any evidence that the extraction of slate from the subsumed pits or the north pit was for commercial purposes. Slate extracted from those pits could have been used for private, non-commercial purposes, especially given the small size of those pits. Further, Brown's testimony and other evidence offered by Catamount Slate and admitted into the record indicate that the north pit and the two subsumed pits are and were separate and distinct from the south pit. They are located some distance away from the south pit; the north pit is several hundred yards distant, and there is no evidence of any relationship between the south pit and these other pits. The Board is constrained by the language of the statute to treat each pit individually; ""slate quarry"" is defined in 10 V.S.A. 6001(25) as ""a quarry pit or hole,"" not the area or general location where a quarry pits or hole exists. Thus, the Board cannot find that, because of their proximity to the south pit, the subsumed pits (and therefore the present Catamount Slate quarrying operation) should be afforded the same exemption as the south pit enjoys. That the north pit and the subsumed pits may have been in the same general area as the exempt south pit is not relevant; that the north pit and the subsumed pits were at all times pits that were separate and distinct from the south pit is.   Catamount Slate, Inc. d/b/a Reed Family Slate Products, and Fred and Suellen Reed Declaratory Ruling #389 Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order Page 11  The Board therefore concludes that the south pit qualifies for the slate quarry exemption provided by 10 V.S.A. 6081(j), (k) and (l). All of the remaining pits at issue in this Declaratory Ruling  the north pit and the subsumed pits - do not qualify for the said exemption. V. Order  1. The south pit (the southernmost of the four pre-1970 quarry pits on the Reed land and the one worked by Andrew Brown and Henry Reed in 1954) qualifies for the slate quarry exemption provided by 10 V.S.A. 6081(j), (k) and (l). 2. All of the remaining pits at issue in this Declaratory Ruling  the north pit and the subsumed pits - do not qualify for the exemption provided by 10 V.S.A. 6081(j), (k) and (l). 3. Because the present slate quarrying operation being conducted by Catamount Slate on the Reed land is occurring in the vicinity of the location of the two non-exempt subsumed pits, an Act 250 Land Use Permit was and is required for the said present quarrying operation. 4. Catamount Slate's post-hearing motions are moot.  Dated at Montpelier, Vermont this 20th day of December 2001.

GX270-40-7773444	"VERMONT ENVIRONMENTAL BOARD 10 V.S.A. Ch. 151  RE:  Catamount Slate, Inc. d/b/a Reed Family Slate Products and Fred and Suellen Reed  Declaratory Ruling #389  Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order This proceeding involves a Petition for a Declaratory Ruling (Petition) from a Jurisdictional Opinion concerning a slate quarry operation in Fair Haven, Vermont.  I.  Procedural History  On July 21, 2000, District #1 Environmental Commission (Commission) Coordinator William Burke (Coordinator) issued Jurisdictional Opinion #1-S-50-2 (Second Reconsideration) (JO) in which he determined that commercial extraction of slate from four slate quarry holes on a  122-acre tract located off Inman Pond Road in the Town of Fair Haven (Project) requires a permit pursuant to 10 V.S.A.  6001-6092 (Act 250). On August 9, 2000, Fred and Suellen Reed and Catamount Slate, Inc., (collectively, Catamount Slate) filed a Petition for Declaratory Ruling with the Environmental Board (Board), appealing the JO. On August 29, 2000, the General Counsel for the Board issued a Notice of Prehearing Conference and Petition for Declaratory Ruling, informing those individuals who had received notice of the JO that the Petition had been filed and setting a date and time for the Prehearing Conference in this matter for September 14, 2000 at 2:00 p.m. On September 7, 2000, James Leary, Esq., the attorney for Catamount Slate at that time, informed the Board by letter that Catamount Slate and neighboring landowners, following mediation, ""appear to have reached a resolution of the issues"" underlying the Petition. Leary's letter noted that settlement documents were being drafted and stated further that he anticipated ""that Catamount Slate will withdraw its appeal after the necessary documents have been executed by the appropriate persons."" Leary therefore requested that the scheduled September 14 Prehearing Conference be continued ""pending the withdrawal of the appeal.""   Catamount Slate, Inc. d/b/a Reed Family Slate Products, and Fred and Suellen Reed Declaratory Ruling #389 Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order Page 2  On September 7, 2000, in response to Leary's letter, Board Chair Marcy Harding issued an Order, continuing the Prehearing Conference to October 13, 2000. The Chair's Order required that any further request for a continuance be filed no later than October 5, 2000. On October 3, 2000, Leary filed a second request for a continuance, noting again that the parties were continuing their attempts at a non-adversarial resolution of this matter. Leary stated that, as a part of the settlement, Catamount Slate would seek an Act 250 permit for the quarry (and associated mill facility), and once a final permit had been obtained that incorporated the relevant terms of the global settlement, Catamount Slate would withdraw the instant appeal. Leary therefore requested that the Prehearing Conference in this matter be continued pending the issuance of a final Act 250 Permit by the Commission. On October 4, 2000, in response to Leary's request, the Chair issued an Order continuing this proceeding until the Commission issued a decision concerning the Land Use Permit application which Catamount Slate stated it intended to file. The Chair's Order required that on or before January 9, 2001, Catamount Slate file with the Board a status report concerning its application. In late February 2001, with the filing of a motion to withdraw as counsel filed by Leary, it came to the Board's attention that attempts at an informal resolution of the issues underlying the Petition had been unsuccessful and that this Petition might therefore need to be set for further proceedings. On May 1, 2001, the Chair held a status conference in this matter and determined that this case should be set for a Prehearing Conference. On May 22, 2001, the Chair convened a Prehearing Conference. On June 29, 2001, the Board issued Memoranda of Decision on three Preliminary Issues presented in this matter. Subsequent Memoranda were issued on July 27 and September 20, 2001, following reconsideration motions filed by Catamount Slate. Hearing was held on October 3, 2001 in Fair Haven, Vermont. Catamount Slate participated through its attorney, Stephanie Lorentz, Esq. Certain neighbors to the Project also participated: Joanne and David Calvi, Lorene Sheldon, Lee Sheldon, Richard Sheldon, Joan Gagnon, Kathleen Donna, Margaret Riter and Lindsey and Priscilla Waterhouse.   Catamount Slate, Inc. d/b/a Reed Family Slate Products, and Fred and Suellen Reed Declaratory Ruling #389 Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order Page 3  On October 17, 2001, Catamount Slate filed two post-hearing motions. The motions ask (a) for the opportunity to provide rebuttal testimony to the testimony provided at the hearing by Coordinator William Burke, and (b) that the testimony of Joseph Badgewick be struck. The Board deliberated on this matter on October 17, November 14 and December 19, 2001. This matter is now ready for final decision.  II.  The Issue  The issue to be decided is ""Whether the Project requires an Act 250 Land Use Permit.""  III.  Findings of Fact  To the extent any proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law are included below, they are granted; otherwise, they are denied. See, Secretary, Agency of Natural Resources v. Upper Valley Regional Landfill Corporation, 167 Vt. 228, 241-42 (1997); Petition of Village of Hardwick Electric Department, 143 Vt. 437, 445 (1983). 1 A. The quarry tract  1. Frederick Reed and Suellen Reed own a +/-122 acre parcel of land located on the northeasterly side of ""Old Marsh Pond"" in Fair Haven, Vermont. 2. Catamount Slate, Inc. presently operates a slate quarry on the Reeds' Fair Haven land. 3. At one time, there were at least four small slate quarry pits on the Reed land; each of these four quarry pits was a separate and distinct pit, some distance from and unrelated to the others. There is present evidence of two of these quarry pits on the Reed land; the current quarrying operation has destroyed and subsumed the other two quarry pits. The Board makes its Findings of Fact based solely on evidence provided by Catamount Slate and observed at the site visit. Because the Board has not relied upon the testimony of William Burke or Joseph Badgewick, Catamount Slate's post-hearing motions are moot. 1   Catamount Slate, Inc. d/b/a Reed Family Slate Products, and Fred and Suellen Reed Declaratory Ruling #389 Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order Page 4  4. Other pits, their ages unknown, exist on the Reed land; they do not appear to be natural holes. Waste slate or shale appears in or near some of these pits. B. The four quarry pits 1. the north pit  5. The northern-most quarry pit at issue in this case (the north pit) is located on the Reed land, several hundred yards to the northwest of the present quarry operation, near the east shore of Marsh Pond. 6. The north pit is approximately 25 feet long, three to six feet wide, and four to six feet deep; slate pieces lie in the bottom of the pit. 7. Some of the walls of the north pit are flat; there are drill holes on the walls.  8. Brush grows on the sides of the north pit; no trees are growing in the pit, but there is a rotted out stump on the edge of the pit. 9. The area immediately around the north pit is a mixed deciduous forest which has been logged within the last 30 years. 10. Waste slate mounds appear around the north pit; some slate pieces are large; there is no uniformity of size and the pieces are odd shapes. One waste slate mound to the west of the north pit, an oval shape about 20 feet long, eight feet wide and three feet high, appears to have existed for some time. 2. the south pit  11. The southern-most quarry pit at issue in this matter (the south pit) is located to the east of the marsh and to the southwest of the present quarry operation; it is the southern-most of the three historical pits in its immediate area. 12. The south pit is larger than the north pit; it is shaped like a about 35  40 feet long and 5 - 15 feet wide; there is water in this pit, so is unknown, but the walls above the water surface are at most five to six There is waste slate to the south side of this pit. Three blue/white wires hole. ""Y"" and is its exact depth feet high. extend into this   Catamount Slate, Inc. d/b/a Reed Family Slate Products, and Fred and Suellen Reed Declaratory Ruling #389 Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order Page 5  3.  the other two quarry pits  13. Two other quarry pits once existed on the Reed land; they were located northeast of and in the immediate area of the south pit. 14. These two other quarry pits (the subsumed pits) are no longer evident, having been destroyed and subsumed by the present quarrying operation. 15. There is no evidence of any relationship (physical or otherwise) between the south pit and the two subsumed pits. C. Extraction of slate at the four quarry pits 1. 16. of 1954. 17. the south pit  Andrew Brown worked for Henry Reed, Fred Reed's father, in the summer  Henry Reed paid Brown an hourly wage for this work.  18. Brown quarried slate from the south pit, the pit closest to the marsh (Inman Pond). At the time he worked the south pit, it appeared to have been worked at some prior time by others. 19. The work performed by Andy Brown was performed utilizing crowbars, shovels, horses and a pulley system. Brown and Henry Reed also blasted the south pit with black powder. 20. The commercial slate extracted from the south pit in which Brown and Henry Reed worked was dimensional stone known as flagging. 21. About five or six, one-quarter wagon loads of slate were removed from the site by Brown and Henry Reed utilizing a wagon pulled by a horse over the dike across Inman Pond. 22. At least some of the slate Brown and Henry Reed quarried from the south pit was marketed commercially. 23. Catamount Slate's present quarrying operations do not include the south pit and are not connected to, related to, or an offshoot of, the south pit.   Catamount Slate, Inc. d/b/a Reed Family Slate Products, and Fred and Suellen Reed Declaratory Ruling #389 Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order Page 6  2.  the north pit and the subsumed pits  24. In 1954, Brown saw the subsumed pits; he is also aware of the north pit but has never seen it. He did not work these other three pits, however, and he is only aware of work prior to 1970 at the south pit where he worked. 25. There is no evidence of the commercial sale of slate from the north pit or the subsumed pits prior to 1970. IV. Conclusions of Law A. The slate quarry exemption law  In 1995, in order to provide certain exemptions to the slate quarrying industry, the Vermont legislature amended 10 V.S.A. 6001 and 6081. A new definition of ""slate quarry"" was added as 6001(25): (25) ""Slate quarry"" means a quarry pit or hole from which slate has been extracted or removed for the purpose of commercial production of building material, roofing, tile or other dimensional stone products. ""Dimensional stone"" refers to slate that is processed into regularly shaped blocks, according to specifications. The words ""slate quarry"" shall not include pits or holes from which slate is extracted primarily for purposes of crushed stone products, unless, as of June 1, 1970, slate had been extracted from those pits or holes primarily for those purposes. New language concerning Act 250 jurisdiction over slate quarries was also added as 10 V.S.A. 6081( j), (k) and (l): (j) With respect to the extraction of slate from a slate quarry that is included in final slate quarry registration documents, if it were removed from a site prior to June 1, 1970, the site from which slate was actually removed, if lying unused at any time after those operations commenced, shall be deemed to be held in reserve, and shall not be deemed to be abandoned.   Catamount Slate, Inc. d/b/a Reed Family Slate Products, and Fred and Suellen Reed Declaratory Ruling #389 Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order Page 7  (k) (1) With respect to the commercial extraction of slate from a slate quarry, activities that are not ancillary to slate mining operations may constitute substantial changes, and be subject to permitting requirements under this chapter. ""Ancillary activities"" include the following activities that pertain to slate and that take place within a registered parcel that contains a slate quarry: drilling, crushing, grinding, sizing, washing, drying, sawing and cutting stone, blasting, trimming, punching, splitting and gauging, and use of buildings and use and construction of equipment exclusively to carry out the above activities. Buildings that existed on April 1, 1995, or any replacements to those buildings, shall be considered ancillary. (2) Activities that are ancillary activities that involve crushing, may constitute substantial changes if they may result in significant impact with respect to any of the criteria specified in subdivisions 6086(a)(1) through (10) of this title. (l ) (1) By no later than January 1, 1997, any owner of land or mineral rights or any owner of slate quarry leasehold rights on a parcel of land on which a slate quarry was located as of June 1, 1970, may register the existence of the slate quarry with the district commission and with the clerk of the municipality in which the slate quarry is located, while also providing each with a map which indicates the boundaries of the parcel which contains the slate quarry. (2) Slate quarry registration shall state the name and address of the owner of the land, mineral rights or leasehold rights; whether that person holds mineral rights, or leasehold rights or is the owner in fee simple; the physical location of the same; the physical location and size of ancillary buildings; and the book and page of the recorded deed or other instrument by which the owner holds title to the land or rights. (3) Slate quarry registration documents shall be submitted to the district commission together with a request, under the provisions of subsection 6007(c) of this title, for a final determination regarding the applicability of this chapter.   Catamount Slate, Inc. d/b/a Reed Family Slate Products, and Fred and Suellen Reed Declaratory Ruling #389 Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order Page 8  (4) The final determination regarding a slate quarry registration under subsection 6007(c) of this title shall be recorded in the municipal land records at the expense of the registrant along with an accurate site plan of the parcel depicting the site specific information contained in the registration documents. (5) With respect to a slate quarry located on a particular registered parcel of land, ancillary activities on the parcel related to the extraction and processing of slate into products that are primarily other than crushed stone products shall not be deemed to be substantial changes, as long as the activities do not involve the creation of one or more new slate quarry holes that are not related to an existing slate quarry hole. 10 V.S.A. 6081( j), (k) and (l). Distilled to its basics for purposes of this matter, this legislation means that: 1. Any registered slate quarry that was in existence before July 1, 1970 will never be deemed to have been abandoned. 2. Any registered slate quarry in existence before July 1, 1970 is exempt from Act 250 jurisdiction. See Northeast Developers, Inc., Declaratory Ruling #342, Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order (Oct. 28, 1997). 3. Even a substantial change to any registered slate quarry in existence before July 1, 1970 will not require an Act 250 permit.2 Other language which addresses ""ancillary activities"" to slate extraction and processing is not pertinent to the issue before the Board in this case.  While the statute actually states that activities that are not ""ancillary"" to slate mining operations may be ""substantial changes,"" the inference is that activities that are ancillary to such operations  including the mining itself  are not ""substantial changes"" and therefore do not trigger jurisdiction.  2   Catamount Slate, Inc. d/b/a Reed Family Slate Products, and Fred and Suellen Reed Declaratory Ruling #389 Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order Page 9  B.  Burden of proof  As the party seeking the benefit of the slate quarry exemption, Catamount Slate bears both the burdens of production and persuasion that it applies to its circumstances. United States v. First City National Bank of Houston, 386 U.S. 361, 366 (1967); Vermont Verde Antique International, Inc., Declaratory Ruling Request #387, Dismissal Order at 4 (Feb. 2, 2001). The burden of production is the burden of going forward with evidence. See, Director, Office of Workers' Compensation Programs, Department of Labor v. Greenwich Collieries, 512 U.S. 267, 272-274 (1994)(discussing burden of production and burden of persuasion); Re: Thomas Howrigan Gravel Extraction, Declaratory Ruling #358, Findings, Conclusions and Order at 9 (Aug. 30, 1999), citing Champlain Construction Co., Declaratory Ruling #214, Memorandum of Decision at 2-4 (Oct. 2, 1990)).  C.  Elements to the exemption  To obtain the statutory exemption for a pit, Catamount Slate must prove: 1. that a slate quarry (or quarries) exists on its land. The elements of the definition of a slate quarry, as set out in 10 V.S.A. 6001(25), are: a. b. c. that it is a quarry pit or hole from which slate has been extracted or removed for the purpose of commercial production of  i. building material, roofing, tile or other dimensional stone products (slate that is processed into regularly shaped blocks, according to specifications); or ii. crushed stone products, if, as of June 1, 1970, slate had been extracted from those pits or holes primarily for those purposes. (This part does not apply to the present case, as Catamount Slate has never argued that its pits produced crushed product.) 2. that the slate quarry existed as of June 1, 1970; 10 V.S.A. 6081(l)(1); and,   Catamount Slate, Inc. d/b/a Reed Family Slate Products, and Fred and Suellen Reed Declaratory Ruling #389 Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order Page 10  3. that the owner of the slate quarry registered such quarry with the district commission no later than January 1, 1997. 10 V.S.A. 6081(l)(1). Since the definition of slate quarry is tied to the particular quarry pit or hole, the Board must look at each individual hole to determine whether or not it meets the requirements of the law. See, Northeast Developers, supra, at 5. It may well be that one or more of the four holes on the 122-acre tract owned by Catamount Slate qualifies for the exemption. But the Board's consideration cannot be of the entire tract; a finding that there is an exempt pit on the tract does not mean that the entire tract is therefore exempt. Rather, the exemption that the statute affords can be granted only to the particular pit that meets all of the elements of the law.  D.  Discussion  Catamount Slate has proved that, prior to 1970, slate was extracted from four separate pits on the Reed land. Catamount Slate has also proved that the extraction of the slate from one of these pits  the south pit worked by Andrew Brown in 1954, was for the purpose of the commercial production of dimensional stone products. As to the three other pits at issue in this matter, although Brown observed the subsumed pits in 1954, and other evidence indicates that the north existed prior to 1970, Catamount Slate has not provided any evidence that the extraction of slate from the subsumed pits or the north pit was for commercial purposes. Slate extracted from those pits could have been used for private, non-commercial purposes, especially given the small size of those pits. Further, Brown's testimony and other evidence offered by Catamount Slate and admitted into the record indicate that the north pit and the two subsumed pits are and were separate and distinct from the south pit. They are located some distance away from the south pit; the north pit is several hundred yards distant, and there is no evidence of any relationship between the south pit and these other pits. The Board is constrained by the language of the statute to treat each pit individually; ""slate quarry"" is defined in 10 V.S.A. 6001(25) as ""a quarry pit or hole,"" not the area or general location where a quarry pits or hole exists. Thus, the Board cannot find that, because of their proximity to the south pit, the subsumed pits (and therefore the present Catamount Slate quarrying operation) should be afforded the same exemption as the south pit enjoys. That the north pit and the subsumed pits may have been in the same general area as the exempt south pit is not relevant; that the north pit and the subsumed pits were at all times pits that were separate and distinct from the south pit is.   Catamount Slate, Inc. d/b/a Reed Family Slate Products, and Fred and Suellen Reed Declaratory Ruling #389 Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order Page 11  The Board therefore concludes that the south pit qualifies for the slate quarry exemption provided by 10 V.S.A. 6081(j), (k) and (l). All of the remaining pits at issue in this Declaratory Ruling  the north pit and the subsumed pits - do not qualify for the said exemption. V. Order  1. The south pit (the southernmost of the four pre-1970 quarry pits on the Reed land and the one worked by Andrew Brown and Henry Reed in 1954) qualifies for the slate quarry exemption provided by 10 V.S.A. 6081(j), (k) and (l). 2. All of the remaining pits at issue in this Declaratory Ruling  the north pit and the subsumed pits - do not qualify for the exemption provided by 10 V.S.A. 6081(j), (k) and (l). 3. Because the present slate quarrying operation being conducted by Catamount Slate on the Reed land is occurring in the vicinity of the location of the two non-exempt subsumed pits, an Act 250 Land Use Permit was and is required for the said present quarrying operation. 4. Catamount Slate's post-hearing motions are moot.  Dated at Montpelier, Vermont this 20th day of December 2001.

Box 578 Rutland, VT 05702 Genier Slate Quarry c/o Victor C. Genier Fair Haven, VT 05743 MEMORANDUM OF DECISION AND STAY ORDER On July 30, 1993, the Environmental Board issued Declaratory Rulings #279 and, #283, concluding that a permit is required pursuant to 10 V.S.A. Chapter 151 (Act 250) for two different slate quarry operations located near each other off Blissville Road in Poultney. The quarries are operated by U.S. Quarried Slate Products, Inc. (US Slate) and Victor Genier. The Board further concluded that a permit is required prior to further operations on the quarry sites. On August 12, 1993, the Board received the following from James P.W. Goss, Esq. on behalf of US Slate and Victor Genier: (a) a joint motion to bifurcate, (b) a motion on behalf of US Slate for reconsideration and continued operation,- and (c) a separate motion for same on behalf of Mr. Genier. .  Declaratory Ruling Requests #279 and #283  __  dn August 17, 1993, the Blissville Road Concerned Citizens Group filed a request for additional time to respond to the Motions for Reconsideration and on August 19 filed a Response to Motions for Reconsideration on the issue of `. allowing petitioners to continue operations until an Act 250 permit is issued to them, a Draft Response to Mot.ion for Reconsideration by U.S. Quarried Slate Products Inc. on the remaining issues, and a Draft Response to Motion for Reconsideration by Victor Genier on the remaining issues. The Board deliberated on August 19, 1993. The Board makes the following decisions:  (4  The motion to bifurcate is denied because there are common questions of fact and law with respect to the two declaratory ruling petitions, and because-the Board and the parties are and have been able to separate the facts and issues that need to be separated. The Board will take the motions to reconsider under advisement because it believes that they deserve careful and unhurried consideration. The Board will deliberate further concerning them on September 8, 1993.

(d) (e)  There shah be no more than five truck trips into and five truck trips out of each quarry within.any given 24-hour period. . The hours of operation for each quarry shall be limited to 7:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. Monday through Friday and 8:00 a.m. to noon on Saturday. No trucks may arrive before 7:00 a.m. or leave after 5:00 p.m. In the motions, US Slate and Mr. Genier have sought stays to last until _  January 15, 1994. The Board will give further consideration to this request. However, as a preliminary matter, the requested period does not appear justified. US Slate represents in its motion that it is about to file an Act 250 application and that it projects that three months will be needed to complete the application process. US Slate has been on notice since November 1992 of the permit requirement and therefore should be prepared to proceed quickly. The Board will therefore grant US Slate a 90-day stay.  With regard to Mr. Genier, his first notice of the permit requirement is the July 30 decision. Therefore, the Board believes he should receive an additional 30 days to prepare an application. Consequently, the stay period for Mr. Genier will 120 days. ORDER The following underlined portion of paragraph three of the Board's 1. July 30, 1993 order in this case is preliminarily stayed for 90 days unless extended: An Act 250 permit was required prior to commencement of quarrying activities, and any associated construction, Tract by US Slate, and remains required prior to anv further auarrvina or related construction on that Tract. including the prooertv of the Stovers discussed in the Findings. above.   U.S. Quarried Slate Products~~~I~~.,,.,~. 2j r) 1f and Scotch Hill Leasing Corp.,,D.R. #279 Genier Slate Quarry, D.R. #283 Memorandum of Decision and Stay Order Page 5 (c) (d) (e) Twenty-four hours notice must be provided prior to each and every blast to all parties to these declaratory ruling petitions.

MIKE MCGRATH, ATTORNEY GENERAL OF THE STATE OF MONTANA (""ATTORNEY GENERAL""); FLATHEAD ELECTRIC COOPERATIVE, INC. (""FLATHEAD"") and; ROES 1 THROUGH 100, INCLUSIVE (""ROES""), and for their cause of action against the Defendants allege the following. NATURE OF ACTION 1. This is an action instituted under the laws of Montana for injunctive and equitable relief for injuries that were and are being sustained as a result of Defendants' unlawful and unfair business practices involving the sale of wholesale electricity and natural gas and Defendants' manipulation of the markets for wholesale electricity and natural gas. This action seeks damages, restitution, and disgorgement with respect to the monetary injuries suffered and being suffered by Plaintiffs due to Defendants' manipulation of electricity and natural gas prices. 2. As described below, Plaintiffs allege that Defendants unlawfully manipulated the markets for electricity and natural gas by fixing prices and restricting supply into the markets operated by the California Power Exchange (""PX"") and the California Independent System Operator (""ISO"") or by engaging in other conduct for the purpose of artificially and illegally inflating the prices of electricity and natural gas and/or charging unlawful prices for such electricity and natural gas. 3. On information and belief, such conduct occurred within Montana, as well as other states on the Western Power Grid. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (""FERC"") has  COMPLAINT  2   1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28  stated that the markets in the West are highly interconnected and, on information and belief, intentional and reckless conduct in the Western Power Grid had extremely adverse consequences in Montana. Businesses shut down, people lost their livelihoods, and people on fixed income were forced to spend precious money on a necessity that was intentionally inflated to serve the ends of bad actors. 4. As a direct and foreseeable result of Defendants' conduct, retail and wholesale customers in Montana have paid and are paying substantially higher prices for electricity and natural gas than they would pay in a competitive and unmanipulated market. 5. Montana's economy, on information and belief, was intentionally drained of millions of dollars to line the pockets of Defendants. 6. Defendants include companies that acted as brokers or marketers on the Western Power Grid and key electricity and natural gas traders on the Western Power Grid who ""gamed"" the power market and participated in other manipulative practices, thereby contributing to the artificial and illegal increase of electricity and natural gas prices in the wholesale markets. 7. Certain of these Defendant companies engaged in a series of scams with names such as ""Death Star,"" ""Ricochet,"" ""Wheel Out,"" and ""Get Shorty."" These scams contributed to a false electricity shortage in California and electricity and natural gas price manipulation throughout the West, including Montana, thereby artificially inflating the prices of electricity and natural gas. 8. Defendants also include generators who either withheld generation, sold generation into the market at wildly inflated prices or double-sold the same generation to the California ISO, including to the Bonneville Power Association (""BPA"") who then resold to Montana. 9. As a result of Defendants' anti-competitive and fraudulent schemes during 2000 and 2001, wholesale electricity and natural gas rates far exceeded rates in a fully competitive market.  COMPLAINT  3   1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28  10. Due to this uncompetitive electricity and natural gas market, Montana ratepayers paid electricity and natural gas prices greatly in excess of rates that would exist in a competitive and unmanipulated market. 11. This action seeks to remedy Defendants' ongoing manipulation of wholesale and retail energy and natural gas prices and supplies, which has resulted in drastic energy shortages and price increases. Plaintiffs seek an injunction requiring Defendants to cease and desist from committing further acts of unfair trade practices. Plaintiffs further seek an Order for three times the actual damages sustained as a direct result of such unfair trade practices. Plaintiffs also seeks damages for deceit with intent to commit fraud and for prima facie torts committed by Defendants. JURISDICTION AND VENUE 12. This Court has jurisdiction to hear the claims alleged in this Complaint and is a court of competent jurisdiction to grant the relief requested pursuant to Mont. Code Ann. 3-5302(1)(b). Additionally, this Court has jurisdiction because Plaintiffs bring their claims under Montana's Unfair Trade Practices and Consumer Protection Act of 1973 (""Montana Unfair Trade Practices Act""). M.C.A.  30-14-101 et seq. The court also has jurisdiction over common law claims for fraud and prima facie tort. Mont. Code Ann. Title 25, Chapter 20, M.R.Civ.P., Rule 4B(1)(a) and (b). 13. Each Defendant does sufficient business in Montana or otherwise has sufficient minimum contacts in Montana by intentionally availing themselves of the Montana market through the distribution, sale, or trade of electricity or natural gas in the State of Montana or by having a facility located in Montana to render the exercise of jurisdiction over them by a Montana court consistent with traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice. Furthermore, Defendants collectively have effectively availed themselves of the Montana market through improper manipulation of the Western electricity and natural gas markets with known deleterious effects on Montana and its citizens. 14. Venue is proper in Lewis and Clark County because the cause of action alleged in this Complaint, and the liability arising therefrom, arose in part in Lewis and Clark County.  COMPLAINT  4   1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28  Additionally, many of the violations of law alleged herein occurred in Lewis and Clark County. M.C.A.  25-2-124. PARTIES 15. Plaintiff ATTORNEY GENERAL is the chief law officer of the State of Montana and is a representative of the people of the State of Montana for purposes of this litigation. Mont. Const. Art. VI,  4(4). The ATTORNEY GENERAL brings this suit in part pursuant to the doctrine of parens patriae.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS 37. On March 26, 2003, FERC released results of its major investigation into the extremely dysfunctional western energy markets in 2000 and 2001. Final Report on Price Manipulation in Western Markets, Docket No. PA02-02-000, March 26, 2003 (hereinafter Exhibit ""A""). The FERC report revealed evidence of manipulation in western electricity and natural gas markets. 38. To varying degrees, Defendant independent generators in California, including but not limited to WILLIAMS, DUKE, DYNEGY, MIRANT, and RELIANT, all deliberately and systematically withheld energy from the market. Such withholding created false shortages and scarcity, thereby artificially and illegally inflating electricity prices.  COMPLAINT  8   1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28  39. Defendant generators and other suppliers intentionally submitted bids to the PX and ISO energy markets for the sole purpose of exercising market power. Defendants bid higher after the ISO was in system emergency for the sole and express purpose of increasing their own profits and artificially and illegally inflating electricity prices in the West beyond competitive levels 40. Defendant suppliers, including but not limited to EES, EPM, POWEREX, MIRANT, DYNEGY, and RELIANT, intentionally submitted false load schedules for the purpose of increasing electricity scarcity and market prices. This strategy was known by such names as ""Fat Boy"" or ""Inc-ing"" Load. 41. Defendant generators and power marketers, including but not limited to POWEREX and EL PASO, exported large amount of power out of California on a day-ahead basis. Defendants then imported that same power back into California to sell at inflated prices in the real-time market. This strategy was known as ""Megawatt Laundering."" 42. Defendant market participants, including but not limited to EES, EPM, MIRANT, DUKE, and POWEREX, created fictitious congestion and counterflows through congestion games such as circular export-import schedules, known as ""Death Star."" Such gaming resulted in payments to Defendants without actually moving power or relieving congestion. 43. Defendant generators, including but not limited to MIRANT, RELIANT, and DYNEGY, sold the same generation twice. Such Defendant generators sold reserves, but failed to keep the reserves available for use by the ISO. 44. Defendant generators, including but not limited to WILLIAMS, DYNEGY, and DUKE, purchased non-public information about competitors' outages from Industrial Information Resources, Inc. (""IIR""). Defendants then used this information to time sales, outages, and other such activities. 45. Defendant sellers, power marketers, and public power utilities colluded in trading strategies to create false shortages and to artificially and illegally inflate electricity  COMPLAINT  9   1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28  and natural gas prices. Such collusion included trader conversations, industry group discussions, and sharing of otherwise competitive market information. 46. Through their membership in the Intercontinental Exchange (""ICE""), Defendant market participants, including but not limited to WILLIAMS, MIRANT, RELIANT, DUKE, and DYNEGY, colluded to manipulate the electricity and natural gas markets through such trading practices as creation of artificial transmission congestion (i.e., ""Death Star""). Defendants, including but not limited to GOLDMAN SACHS and MORGAN STANLEY, were key partners in ICE and colluded to create the energy crisis from its inception and maximize energy profits. 47. According to FERC, beginning in the summer of 2000, Defendants, including but not limited to RELIANT, manipulated natural gas markets at the Arizona-California border Topock hub by what FERC refers to as churning. As a consequence, natural gas prices in the California market increased dramatically during 2000. See, Exhibit ""A,"" FERC Report at II-1. 48. Defendants, including but not limited to RELIANT, MIRANT, and WILLIAMS, sold power to BPA. BPA passed through artificially and illegally high market-based rates to its consumers, including Montana ratepayers. BPA does and will continue to pass these artificially and illegally high rates through to Montana ratepayers. 49. Defendants, including but not limited to EL PASO, engaged in systematic natural gas price manipulation. Defendants manipulated the published natural gas price index in order to favor their own financial positions. See, Exhibit ""A"" at III-13 and 14. 50. Defendants, including but not limited to EL PASO, deliberately targeted the Sumas trading hub on the British Columbia-Washington border with false trades to be included in the December 2001 monthly price index. See, Exhibit ""A"" at II-2. Montana trading hubs such as AECO-C were affected by this fraudulent manipulation. 51. Defendant natural gas traders, including but not limited to EL PASO, WILLIAMS, EES, EPM, MIRANT, DYNEGY, DUKE and RELIANT, deliberately lied to Inside  COMPLAINT  10   1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28  FERC and Gas Daily, trade publications responsible for publishing various indices used by the natural gas industry to set prices for trades. Due to these deliberate lies by Defendants, natural gas prices became artificially and illegally inflated. See, Exhibit ""A"" at III-2. 52. Due to the highly interconnected nature of Western electricity and natural gas markets, California and Northwest gas prices significantly influenced prices in Montana. See, Exhibit ""A"" at V-7. Montana electricity and natural gas ratepayers suffered fraudulently increased prices passed through by local utilities attributable to Defendants' market manipulation. Between 2001 and 2002, Montana Power Company (""MPC"") and NWE customers paid approximately $31 million for natural gas, the price of which Defendants, including but not limited to EL PASO, EES, EPM, MIRANT, DYNEGY, DUKE, RELIANT, WILLIAMS, artificially and illegally inflated. 53. During the worst 12-month period of the artificial and illegal 2000 and 2001 electricity and natural gas price increase, most, if not all, large Montana industrial power customers' contracts expired. Defendant marketers in Montana, including but not limited to PGE and AVISTA, colluded in refusing to sell energy to industrial customers whose contracts had expired, forcing such customers to purchase power above Mid-C prices. 54. Because the Western Power Grid is interconnected, Defendant bad actors in the California market similarly affected short-term and long-term Montana electricity and natural gas markets. As purchasers of natural gas and electricity in such an affected market, Plaintiffs absorbed the entire illegal and artificial cost inflation. 55. As a result of Defendants' collusion to manipulated prices for electricity and natural gas, Plaintiffs did pay and continue to pay rates greatly in excess of competitive and unmanipulated market prices, thereby damaging the State of Montana in general.  COMPLAINT  11   1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28  CAUSES OF ACTION FIRST COUNT ALLEGED AGAINST ALL DEFENDANTS (Entering an Agreement to Fix the Price of Electricity and Natural Gas) 56. Plaintiffs incorporate by reference Paragraphs 1 through 55 inclusive, as if fully set forth herein. 57. Mont. Code Ann.  30-14-205(1) prohibits a person or group of persons, directly or indirectly, from entering an agreement for the purpose of fixing the price or regulating the production of an article of commerce. 58. Defendants agreed to withhold supplies of electricity and natural gas into the PX and ISO markets in order to manipulate the prices at which wholesale electricity and natural gas were sold. Defendants also agreed to manipulate electricity and natural gas prices in order to sell electricity and natural gas at artificially and illegally inflated prices. Additionally, Defendants agreed to refuse to sell energy to Montana industrial ratepayers, forcing such industrials to purchase power at inflated prices. Defendants agreed to engage in gaming strategies designed to substantially increase market prices for natural gas and electricity. As purchasers of electricity and natural gas, Plaintiffs entirely absorbed such illegally and artificially inflated prices. SECOND COUNT ALLEGED AGAINST ALL DEFENDANTS (Limiting Energy Supply to Create and Carry out Restrictions in Trade) 59. Plaintiffs incorporate by reference Paragraphs 1 through 58 inclusive, as if fully set forth herein. 60. Mont. Code Ann.  30-14-205(2)(a) prohibits a person or group of persons from limiting production for the purposes of creating or carrying out any restriction in trade. 61. By deliberately withholding electricity and natural gas from the energy market, Defendants limited the available supply in order to artificially and illegally increase sale prices.

THIRD COUNT ALLEGED AGAINST ALL DEFENDANTS (Increasing the Price of Electricity and Natural Gas to Create and Carry out Restrictions in Trade) 62. Plaintiffs reallege Paragraphs 1 through 61 inclusive, as if fully set forth herein. 63. Mont. Code Ann.  30-14-205(2)(b) prohibits a person or group of persons from increasing the price of merchandise or commodities for the purpose of creating or carrying out any restriction in trade. 64. Defendants artificially and illegally increased prices for electricity and natural gas during 2000 and 2001 in order to restrict trade by ""gaming"" the market and submitting false trade information. As purchasers of electricity and natural gas at artificially and illegally inflated rates, Plaintiffs entirely absorbed such artificial and illegal price increases. FOURTH COUNT ALLEGED AGAINST ALL DEFENDANTS (Preventing Competition in the Sale of Electricity and Natural Gas) 65. Plaintiffs reallege Paragraphs 1 through 64 inclusive, as if fully set forth herein. 66. Mont. Code Ann. 30-14-205(2)(c) prohibits a person or group of persons from preventing competition in the distribution or sale of merchandise or commodities. 67. Defendants prevented competition in the sale of electricity and natural gas by each acting as an agent and co-conspirator of each other Defendant. Defendants' actions, individually and collectively, prevented true competition in the western energy market. Defendants acted within the scope of this agency and conspiracy and, continuing to date, engaged in a conspiracy to violate the law as herein detailed and to mislead and deceive governmental agencies and purchasers of electricity and natural gas.

Plaintiffs reallege Paragraphs 1 through 67 inclusive, as if fully set forth herein. 69. Mont. Code Ann. 30-14-205(2)(d) prohibits a person or group of persons from fixing a standard or figure whereby the price of an article of commerce intended for sale, use, or consumption will be in any way controlled. 70. Defendants fixed a standard whereby the price of electricity and natural gas intended for sale, use, or consumption in Montana was controlled by colluding in trading strategies to artificially and illegally increase electricity and natural gas prices. SIXTH COUNT ALLEGED AGAINST ALL DEFENDANTS (Deceit with Intent to Commit Fraud) 71. Plaintiffs reallege Paragraphs 1 through 70 inclusive, as if fully set forth herein. 72. Mont. Code Ann.  27-1-712 holds one who willfully deceives another with intent to induce him to alter his position to his injury or risk liable for any damage, which he thereby suffers. 73. Defendants, including but not limited to EL PASO, WILLIAMS, EES, EPM, MIRANT, DYNEGY, DUKE and RELIANT, made representations to trade publications that Defendants knew to be false and material to the price of natural gas. Defendants made such false representations with the intent that Plaintiffs rely on such representations to Plaintiffs' detriment. On information and belief, certain other Defendants, including but not limited to ENRON, WILLIAMS and DYNEGY, perpetrated a fraud on the citizens of California and the entire west, including Montana, pursuant to the various illegal practices set forth herein. 74. The representations were made with the intent that purchasers, regulators, and legislators, among others, rely on them. Since the information in question about the nature of Defendants' activities were in the control of Defendants, those who were misled had no reasonable basis for questioning Defendants' statements that market forces as opposed to illegal schemes were the cause of the unprecedented price spike COMPLAINT 14   1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28  in the western energy markets in 2000-2001. Various investigations and legislative actions were forestalled on the representations of these Defendants, with the result that Montana has been substantially harmed economically in a way that could have been prevented but for Defendants' misrepresentations. Such reliance on Defendants statements was justified given the concealed and conspiratorial nature of Defendants' misconduct. 75. Plaintiffs were consequently and proximately harmed by reliance on Defendants' fraudulent representations because Plaintiffs paid for natural gas and electricity prices that were significantly higher than they would have paid in an unmanipulated market provided with true information. SEVENTH COUNT ALLEGED AGAINST ALL DEFENDANTS (Prima Facie Tort) 76. Plaintiffs reallege Paragraphs 1 through 75 inclusive, as if fully set forth herein. 77. The common law principle of a prima facie tort states that harm intentionally inflicted is prima facie actionable unless justified. 78. Defendants committed massive fraud on the entire western electricity and natural gas market in 2000 and 2001 in order to artificially and illegally inflate electricity and natural gas prices. Defendants acted with the intent and result of depriving millions of persons of electricity and natural gas, including commercial and residential ratepayers throughout the West, costing such persons money and detrimentally affecting state economies throughout the West. Included among those ratepayers deprived of money are Montana citizens and residents and those state economies harmed include Montana's economy. Defendants so acted with no justification other than to illegally increasing their own profits. 79. Defendants intentionally inflicted harm on Plaintiffs causing special damages to Plaintiffs, in the form of artificially and illegally inflated electricity and natural gas prices, without excuse or justification. Defendants committed such prima facie tort  COMPLAINT  15   1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28  through a series of actions that would otherwise be lawful, save for Defendants' massive fraudulent acts. PRAYER FOR RELIEF WHEREFORE, Plaintiffs pray for judgment against Defendants, and each of them, as follows: 1. For injunctive relief, as authorized in Mont. Code Ann.  30-14-222 (1), to enjoin Defendants, and each of them, their successors, agents, representatives, employees, and all persons acting in concert with them, from engaging in unfair or deceptive trade practices in the conduct of any trade or commerce, including, but not limited to, the types of acts or practices herein alleged; 2. For an order, as authorized by Mont. Code Ann. 30-14-222(2), directing Defendants, and each of them, to pay three times the amount of actual damages sustained by Plaintiffs as a results of Defendants' unfair or deceptive trade practices alleged herein in an amount according to proof; 3. For damages incurred by Plaintiffs as the direct result of Defendants' deceit with intent to commit fraud and involvement in the prima facie tort as alleged herein; 4. For pre- and post-judgment interest; 5. For attorneys' fees and costs of the suit incurred herein; and 6. For such other and further relief as the nature of the case may require and the Court deems just and proper. Dated this 30th day of June, 2003.  MICHAEL J.

GX259-56-3881763	"Posted: May 28, 1998 10 a.m.  Order 98-5-33 Served: June 2, 1998 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION OFFICE OF THE SECRETARY WASHINGTON, D.C. Action on IATA Agreement Issued by the Department of Transportation on the 28th day of May, 1998  -----------------------------------------------------------+ Agreement Among Member Carriers of the | | INTERNATIONAL AIR TRANSPORT ASSOCIATION | | concerning passenger services matters: | -----------------------------------------------------------+ ORDER  Docket OST-98-3316 R-1 through R-52  The International Air Transport Association (IATA) has filed an agreement with the Department for approval and exemption from the U.S. antitrust laws under sections 41309 and 41308 of Title 49 of the United States Code. The agreement was adopted at the Nineteenth Passenger Services Conference held in Kuala Lumpur, during October 14-16, 1997.1/ The agreement consists of a number of resolutions and recommended practices (R.P.'s) affecting passenger services.2/ They address codes, notices, formats and procedures relating to the issuance of electronic and paper tickets, boarding passes and other travel documents; baggage handling procedures and tag specifications; assignment of airline designators, accounting codes and location identifiers; and standard interline agreements and reservation procedures.  Existing Resolutions and Recommended Practices: Most of the proposals in the agreement involve non-substantive changes, essentially of a technical, editorial or administrative nature, to existing approved resolutions and recommended practices, and appear to be in conformity with our substantive policies and concerns. As such, they raise no public interest issues, and will be approved.  New Resolutions and Recommended Practices: The agreement: (1) adopts new provisions under which information concerning the operating carrier will be shown on the electronic ticket itinerary receipt, and on most paper flight coupons and boarding passes, in code share situations;3/ (2) revises Resolutions 780 and 780e, governing interline agreements, to replace the IATA Fares Data Bank with the Airline Tariff 1  / IATA memorandum PSC/Reso/090, filed with the Department on January 7, 1998. IATA's Nineteenth Passenger Services Conference was held in conjunction with the Eighteenth Joint ATA/IATA Passenger Services Conference. 2 / The individual resolutions and recommended practices, along with their subject matter, are listed in the attached appendices. 3 / Due to what are apparently technical problems, the carriers were unable to agree on code-share disclosure procedures for the transitional automated tickets governed by Resolutions 722 and 722a, although they continue to explore methods to accomplish this.   -2-  Publishing Co. (ATPCO) as the source for all interlineable fares; and (3) amends Resolution 724a, which deals with overbooking issues, to add a standard notice concerning ""Denied Boarding by Overbooking"" which members must include with tickets in countries where denied boarding compensation rules are in place. Other, new provisions established by the agreement include: a) Resolution 769, governing baggage tag issuer codes, whose purpose is to extend the life of the current baggage tag system, which depends upon two-character airline designators and three-digit accounting codes, in the event that airline designators and accounting codes are lengthened; b) R.P. 1740c, establishing specifications for the use of radio frequency (RF) identification technology to handle interline baggage; and (c) R.P. 1798, establishing guidelines, developed in cooperation with the World Health Organization and the International Organization for Migration, for carriers to follow in cooperation with local public health authorities when carriers unknowingly carry passengers with infectious diseases. Most of the above-noted proposals involve non-substantive matters, essentially of a technical, editorial, or administrative nature, and appear to be in conformity with our substantive policies and concerns. As such, they raise no public interest issues, and will be approved.4/ However, we will not approve IATA's new notice on denied boarding compensation as provided for in Resolution 724a. This notice is neither commensurate nor compatible with the Department's explicit notice concerning denied boarding compensation set out in 14 CFR ?250. 11. IATA's notice, including the ""optional text"", is less detailed and less clear than the Department's notice requirements. It sets too low a standard, and we are concerned that if approved, it would become in practice the international standard, undermining the Department's Part 250 notice. Accordingly, we will disapprove Resolution 724a.  Section 41309 of the Code directs us to approve any agreement or modification of an agreement if we find that it will not substantially lessen competition, and is not adverse to the public interest or in violation of the Code. Except for the disapproved notice on denied boarding compensation, we find that the agreement in Docket OST-98-3316, as conditioned, is not adverse to the public interest, in violation of the Code, or likely to lessen competition substantially, and that it should be approved. Furthermore, we conclude that the approved portions of the agreement should be granted immunity from the operation of the antitrust laws to the extent necessary to permit their implementation. In general, they amend existing provisions already approved and immunized by the Department. Where new provisions are created, they perform administrative and facilitatory functions similar to other resolutions that have been approved and immunized. As a result, none raises immunity issues not previously considered, and the conferral of immunity upon them is consistent with our policy of conferring immunity on amendments coextensively with the underlying agreements. Pursuant to the authority duly assigned under the Department's Regulations 14 CFR 385.13: 1. We do not find that Resolutions R-1 through R-9 and R-11 through R-52 of the agreement in Docket OST-98-3316, as set forth in attached Appendix A, to be adverse to the public interest, in violation of the Code, or likely to lessen competition substantially, provided that approval is subject, where applicable, to conditions previously imposed; and 2. We find that Resolution R-10 of the agreement in Docket OST-98-3316, as set forth in attached Appendix B, to be adverse to the public interest and in violation of the Code.  4  / Nothing in our approval of IATA's new code-share notice provisions should be interpreted as modifying any of the requirements provided for in the Department's policy on airline designator code-sharing in 14 CFR 399.88 or in Department orders approving individual code-sharing agreements. In addition, the Department has a proposal to strengthen its current rules concerning airline disclosure of code-sharing arrangements to consumers pending in Docket OST-95-179.   -3-  ACCORDINGLY, 1. We approve R-1 through R-9 and R-11 through R-52 of the agreement in Docket OST-98-3316, as listed in the attached Appendix A, under 49 U.S.C. 41309, subject, where applicable, to conditions previously imposed; 2. We disapprove Resolution R-10 of the agreement in Docket OST-98-3316, as set forth in attached Appendix B; and 2. To the extent that R-1 through R-9 and R-11 through R-52 of the agreement in Docket OST-98-3316 are approved, we exempt any person affected by this order from the operation of the antitrust laws as provided in 49 U.S.C. 41308. Persons entitled to petition the Department for review of this order, under 14 CFR 385.50, may file such petitions within ten days after the date of service of this order. This order shall be effective and become the action of the Department of Transportation upon expiration of the above period, unless within such period a petition for review is filed or the Assistant Secretary for Policy and International Affairs gives notice that he will review this order on his own motion.

MIKE MCGRATH, ATTORNEY GENERAL, FLATHEAD ELECTRIC COOPERATIVE, INC. AND ROES 1  1000 FOR RATE REFUNDS I. INTRODUCTION Petitioners, The People of the State of Montana, ex rel. Mike McGrath, Attorney General of the State of Montana, Flathead Electric Cooperative, Inc., and Roes 1  1000 (hereinafter referred to as ""Petitioners""), acting by and through counsel, hereby petition the Montana Public Service Commission (""Commission"") to issue rate refunds for excessive rates paid during 2000 and 2001 to all sellers of energy or capacity subject to the Commission's jurisdiction that manipulated the western energy market. Pursuant to M.C.A.  69-3-201 and  69-3-321, the Commission had the duty to ensure that every public utility charges rates that are reasonable and just. Furthermore, pursuant to M.C.A. MONTANA'S PETITION FOR RATE REFUND  -1-    69-8-403(7) and  69-8-408(2), the Commission has a duty to protect consumers from anticompetitive, abusive, fraudulent or deceptive conduct by energy and natural gas marketers and others. Due to the market manipulation that caused rates to skyrocket in 2000 and 2001, rates paid in Montana were unreasonable and unjust. As set forth herein, upon information and belief and subject to further discovery, Petitioners are entitled to rate refunds for the unreasonable and unjust charges. Furthermore, upon information and belief and subject to further discovery, the Commission should impose penalties of up $1,000 for each day that any fraudulent or deceptive practice was engaged in by any company licensed to market to retail customers in Montana. II. PARTIES The interests of the People of the State of Montana are being represented by Montana's Attorney General, Mike McGrath, as authorized by M.C.A.  2-15-501 and  30-14-222(1) (2001). Flathead Electric Cooperative, Inc. (""Flathead""), a Montana corporation, is a locally owned and operated rural electrical cooperative serving residential and commercial ratepayers in northwest Montana, which made purchases from the western energy markets during 2000 and 2001. Roes 1  1000 are parties that were injured by unjust and unreasonable charges during 2000 and 2001 whose actual names and capacities have not yet been discovered. This Petition seeks relief from all sellers of energy or capacity subject to the Commission's jurisdiction involved in the illegal manipulation of the western energy markets in 2000 and 2001.  MONTANA'S PETITION FOR RATE REFUND  -2-   III.  BACKGROUND This action is instituted to obtain relief in the form of rate refunds for unjust and  unreasonable charges during 2000 and 2001 that resulted from the unlawful and unfair business practices involving the sale of gas or electric energy and manipulation of the market for wholesale energy. In the latter part of 2002, Petitioners became aware that the entire western energy market was unlawfully manipulated through price fixing and restriction of the energy supply into the markets operated by the California Power Exchange (""PX"") and the California Independent System Operator (""ISO""). Sellers of energy and capacity engaged in other conduct for the purpose of artificially inflating the price of electricity and/or charging unlawful prices for such electricity. The Federal Energy (""FERC"") has recently stated that the markets in the western grid are interconnected. Consequently, as a direct and foreseeable result of the misconduct by  those engaged in market manipulation, retail and wholesale customers in Montana have paid substantially higher prices than they would have paid in a competitive and unmanipulated market.1 The bad actors include companies that acted as brokers or marketers on the western power grid, and key electricity traders on the western power grid who ""gamed"" the power market and participated in other manipulative practices, thereby contributing to the illegal increase of power prices in the wholesale market. Certain of these companies engaged in a series of scams with names such as ""Death Star,"" ""Ricochet,"" ""Wheel Out,"" and ""Get Shorty."" In addition, generation companies withheld generation or double sold it to the  San Diego Gas & Electric Company v. Sellers of Energy and Ancillary Services into Markets Operated by the California Independent System Operator(""ISO"") and Power Exchange (""PX""), et al., 96 FERC  61,418, at 62,556 (2001). MONTANA'S PETITION FOR RATE REFUND  1  -3-   California ISO through a variety of schemes. These illegal scams collectively created artificial energy shortages in California and the west to the benefit of the bad actors. The market manipulation activities resulted in artificially inflated prices for energy and natural gas throughout the west, including Montana. As a result of these illegal and fraudulent schemes during 2000 and 2001, wholesale electricity rates far exceeded rates in an honest and fully competitive market. Due to this uncompetitive and manipulated market, Montana energy and natural gas consumers have paid and continue to pay electricity prices greatly in excess of rates that would been have charged in a truly competitive market. This Petition seeks to remedy the excessive rates charged to Montana's ratepayer due to the ongoing manipulation of wholesale energy prices and supply, which resulted in drastic energy shortages and price increases. Petitioners seek refunds of the unjust and unreasonable charges. Petitioners further seek the cancellation of the licenses of the bad actors identified herein who are licensed by the Commission to market electricity and/or natural gas in Montana to retail customers. IV. UNJUST AND UNREASONABLE CHARGES On February 13, 2002, FERC launched a major investigation into the causes for the ""wildly dysfunctional"" western energy markets.2 In FERC's report of March 26, 2003, the staff reported that it found evidence of manipulation of both electricity and  San Diego Gas & Electric Company v. Sellers of Energy and Ancillary Services into Markets Operated by the California Independent System Operator(""ISO"") and Power Exchange (""PX""), et al., 96 FERC  61,120, at 61,521 (2001)(Opinion of Commissioner Massey, dissenting in part & concurring in part).  2  MONTANA'S PETITION FOR RATE REFUND  -4-   natural gas markets.3 FERC also found that the electric and gas markets in the west are inextricably linked.4 Numerous entities were found specifically to have been extensively involved in market manipulation of the western electric markets. The entities include: AEP, Aquila, Avista, BPA, Coral Power, Duke, Dynegy, Enron, Idaho Power, LADWP, Mirant, PG&E, PacifiCorp, Portland General, Powerex, Reliant, Sempra, Sierra Pacific, Southern California Edison, and Williams.5 The FERC staff recommended a total of thirty entities be directed to show cause why their behavior did not constitute gaming or other anomalous market behavior, and even that some licenses be revoked.6 The FERC staff found that market dysfunction in the California short-term markets affected long-term contracts, and recommended using the information in the report to find that long-term contracts were not just and reasonable.7 FERC also found that spot prices in the northwest during January  June 2001 were considerably out of line with input costs.8 For gas markets, FERC found that market dysfunctions related to marketer misconduct, such as transaction misreporting and wash trading.9 Spot prices reflected charges that far exceeded the cost of transportation.10 FERC concluded that the gas prices were not the product of a well-functioning competitive market.11  FERC's Final Report on Price Manipulation in Western Markets, Docket No. PA02-02-000, March 26, 2003, p. 2 (attached hereto as Exhibit 1).

Market Manipulators are Public Utilities under Montana Law The Commission has jurisdiction to supervise, regulate and control the operations of public utilities in Montana. M.C.A.  69-1-102 and 69-3-102. The Commission's jurisdiction applies to any public utility doing business in this state. M.C.A.  69-3-110. Under Montana law, a ""public utility"" is defined as: every corporation, both public and private, company, individual, association of individuals, their lessees, trustees, or receivers appointed by any court whatsoever that now or hereafter may own, operate, or control any plant or equipment, any part of a plant or equipment, or any water right within the state for the production, delivery or furnishing to other persons, firms, associations, or corporations, private or municipal: ...

Based on that definition, the following entities are some of the ""public utilities"" in Montana: British Columbia Power Exchange Corp., Illinova Energy Partners, Inc., PacifiCorp, Puget Sound, PG&E Energy Trading-Power, L.P., PPL, Avista, Enron Power Marketing, Inc., Energy West, Duke Energy Trading and Marketing, LLC, and TransCanada Gas Services. Several of these entities are registered with the Commission as electricity and gas suppliers,12 who, based on the information released by FERC in its investigation, are tied to the manipulation of the western energy markets, including British Columbia Power Exchange Corp., Illinova Energy Partners, Inc., PG&E Energy Trading-Power, L.P., Enron Power Marketing, Inc., and Duke Energy Trading and Marketing, LLC.

The Commission also has authority to revoke the licenses of, and impose penalties on, any electricity supplier that has committed fraud or engaged in deceptive practices. M.C.A.  69-8-408. B. Effect of Manipulation on Prices in Montana The prices for gas and electric energy approximately doubled in Montana due to the 2000 and 2001 market manipulations. In 1997, the average price paid by Montana consumers for electricity was in the range between $22 and $27 per megawatt hour (""MWH""). According to NorthWestern Energy's (""NWE"") recent filing, at least its customers will pay between $41 per MWH. See, Docket No. D2003.6.77, at __. Spread out over a year, this represents an increase of roughly $80 million dollars in increased charges that NWE's customers will pay this year. Although Montana's default supply customers were protected from the worst ravages of the market manipulation in 20002001 by a power supply contract between the former Montana Power Company (now NWE), and PPL Montana, the residual effects of the market manipulation have not been determined and it is probable that NWE's current default supply pricing for its electricity customers contains a premium associated with the misconduct of 2000-2001. Industrial customers of NWE were not so lucky and they paid a terrible price for the misconduct of the companies that engaged in market manipulation. During the height of the Western Energy Crisis, those companies that were able to continue operating were forced to buy under short-term contracts that were often in excess of $100/MWH. The industrial class as a whole paid roughly three to four times as much for power during 2000-2001 as they had the prior year, or approximately $50 million dollars more, to meet  MONTANA'S PETITION FOR RATE REFUND  -7-   their electricity demands than they had the year before. Petitioner Flathead incurred additional energy charges of at least $1 million for 2 MW of power purchased from the Big Fork Hydro during the 2000-2001 period. Flathead also incurred millions in additional charges for power purchased during 2002 as compared to 2001 as the result of entering into long term power contracts to stave off being subjected to market prices in 2002. Montana's natural gas customers were also protected from the worst of the gas market manipulation, which FERC discovered went hand in hand with the energy market manipulation on the part of companies such as Reliant, Williams and El Paso. As part of the restructuring of the former Montana Power Company's natural gas utility, Montana Power Company spun its natural gas production assets to a third party that supplied the bulk of natural gas sold to Montana Power Company's natural gas default supply. By Commission-approved stipulation, the contract was roughly set at $1.50-$1.60 per million cubic feet (""Mcf"") during the 2000-2001 period. Now, NWE proposes that natural gas prices for Montana residential customers be adjusted to approximately $4 per Mcf. The difference is roughly two-and-a half times what customers had paid under the default supply contract for the same volume of gas. Retail customers who bought from competitive natural gas suppliers in late 2000 and early 2001 were also forced to pay much higher prices for natural gas supply, on the order of two to two and-a-half times what they had paid in prior years. For example, in January of 2001 alone, customers who bought at market prices in Montana paid roughly $10/Mcf . Of the approximately 3 to 4 Bcf of customer load that was buying at market, those customers paid roughly $2 million dollars more for one month of natural gas than  MONTANA'S PETITION FOR RATE REFUND  -8-   they had paid the prior January. It is also the case that in Docket No. D2001.10.136, Energy West Resources passed on substantial gas cost increases to their core customers in a gas tracker as a result of spikes in market prices in 2000 and 2001. All told, the damages to Montana consumers, both direct and indirect purchasers, runs into the millions of dollars. There is also no question that the conduct of the parties identified by FERC as part of market manipulation schemes caused the harm to Montana's electric and natural gas consumers. The market manipulators benefited from their actions that damaged Montana's consumers. C. Commission is Required to Protect Montana Consumers from Unjust and Unreasonable Rates The Commission has a duty to ensure rates for Montana consumers are just and reasonable. M.C.A.  69-3-201. Specifically, every public utility that provides ""any heat, light, or power"" or ""for any service to be rendered as or in connection with any public utility"" shall charge rates that are ""reasonable and just, and every unjust and unreasonable charge is prohibited and declared unlawful."" M.C.A.  69-3-201. ""The [C]ommission shall inquire into any neglect or violation of the laws of this state by any public utility, as hereinbefore defined, doing business in this state."" M.C.A.  69-3110(1). As stated previously, the Commission ""shall promulgate rules that protect consumers, distribution services providers, and electricity suppliers from anticompetitive and abusive practices."" M.C.A.  69-8-403(7). Those rules were promulgated, and appear at A.R.M.  38.5.6010(2), giving the Commission the authority to investigate complaints of deceptive, false, or fraudulent misconduct and to impose fines upon a finding of such behavior. Consequently, the Commission has numerous statutory and  MONTANA'S PETITION FOR RATE REFUND  -9-   regulatory directives that require it to investigate violations, protect consumers, and ensure just and reasonable rates. Once the Commission finds a violation by a public utility, the Commission ""may compel compliance with the provisions of this chapter and of the orders of the commission by proceedings in mandamus, by injunction, or by other civil remedies."" M.C.A.  69-3-110(5). ""The [C]ommission may order refunds or credits of rates, tolls, or charges collected in violation of this section and may order payment of interest at a reasonable rate on the refunded amount."" M.C.A.  69-3-305(3). Also, the Commission may revoke or suspend a license of an electricity supplier, impose a penalty, or both, for just cause on the commission's own investigation or upon the complaint of an affected party if it is established that the supplier committed fraud or engaged in deceptive practices. M.C.A.  69-8-408(1). As a result, the Commission is required to inquire into the effects of the violations of law by the market manipulators, and is empowered to compel compliance with the requirement to charge reasonable and just rates by imposing penalties, injunctive relief and other civil remedies, such as ordering refunds.

Oregon Public Utility Commission Staff April 29, 2003  On May 6, 2002, Enron Corporation turned over to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) three memos describing some of the company's trading strategies in California wholesale power markets in 2000. The trading strategies--with colorful names like Fat Boy, Ricochet, and Death Star--were designed to exploit loopholes in California's market design. Disclosure of the memos jump-started FERC's investigation of market abuses as a cause of the explosion of wholesale prices in West Coast markets in 2000-01. Since the memos surfaced, FERC has focused on who participated in the so-called Enron trading strategies and whether those participating violated any FERC requirements, such as codes and standards of conduct. Our report examines trading in western markets in 2000-01 from a different perspective: it addresses whether the activities of Oregon's three investor-owned electric utilities-Portland General Electric (PGE), PacifiCorp, and Idaho Power Company--violated any Oregon statutes or Commission rules or orders. It is based on our review of the information available from the current FERC investigations, and it presents our preliminary conclusions and recommendations for Commission action. This report is organized as follows. Section 1 describes the Enron trading strategies, why they are claimed to be illegal or improper, and what is known about their effect on the market. Section 2 summarizes ongoing FERC proceedings and criminal and civil investigations into trading practices and market prices during the 2000-01 crisis. Section 3 discusses the evidence from these cases about the involvement of PGE, PacifiCorp, and Idaho Power in suspect trading activities. Section 4 examines whether  1   Draft  the utilities violated any of the laws, rules, or orders administered or issued by the Commission. Finally, Section 5 presents our recommendations for Commission action.  2   Draft  1. The Enron Trading Strategies  The Enron memos discuss ten trading strategies, and several variants of them have been identified since the memos were released. This section describes the strategies, why they are allegedly illegal or improper, and what is known about their effect on market prices. 1  We divide the trading strategies into three categories: inc-ing load, arbitrage, and congestion payment strategies.  Inc-ing load This strategy, called Fat Boy in the Enron memos, was a response to the common practice by California's investor-owned utilities of significantly underscheduling load, i.e., understating expected need, in the day-ahead market operated by the California Power Exchange (PX). The California utilities did this because any load not scheduled in the day-ahead market would be served in the real-time market by the California Independent System Operator (ISO), which had tighter price caps than the PX and lower expected prices. The utilities' strategy of underscheduling load in the day-ahead market meant that the ISO had to find a way to serve the excess load when it appeared in the real-time market. The ISO met the excess load by calling on supplemental energy offered by suppliers or by offsetting it with unexpected generation.  This section is based primarily on the Enron memos and on: Falk, Jonathan, ""Substituting Outrage for Thought: The Enron `Smoking Gun' Memos,"" The Electricity Journal, August/September, 2002; Kee, Edward, ""Direct Testimony Before the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission,"" Docket No. EL02-26-000 et al., August 27, 2002; McCullough, Robert, Direct Testimony Before the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission,"" Docket No. EL02-26-000 et al., July 2, 2002; McCullough, Robert, ""Congestion Manipulation in ISO California,"" Memorandum, McCullough Research, June 5, 2002; Chandley, John, ""The Enron Trading Practices: How They Worked, Why They Occurred, What They Teach Us,"" Presentation at EUCI Conference on Market Design, Atlanta, GA, September 23-24, 2002, California ISO, ""Analysis of Trading and Scheduling Strategies Described in Enron Memos,"" October 4, 2002, and FERC Staff, ""Final Report on Price Manipulation in Western Markets,"" Docket No. PA02-2-000, March, 2003.  1  3   Draft  Enron and other suppliers quickly recognized the California utilities' strategy and saw an opportunity to serve the excess load in the real-time market. Enron used Fat Boy as a way to send additional generation to the real-time market. It overscheduled (""inc-ed"") load, with matching generation, in the day-ahead market so that it would have surplus generation available in the real-time market. Enron's expectation was that the ISO would use the excess generation to serve the excess load that appeared in the real-time market. Fat Boy depended on Enron purposefully submitting false schedules to the PX. This deception was clearly improper and may have violated the ISO tariff and constituted unjust and unreasonable practices under the Federal Power Act.2 However, because Fat Boy offset the effect of underscheduling by the California utilities, the strategy apparently had little adverse impact on western markets in 2000-01 and may even have reduced prices. 3  Arbitrage Most of these strategies took advantage of different prices for the same product. One obtained a higher price by misrepresenting the product sold. Export of California Power was a strategy to buy power in the California market at or below the price cap and then resell it outside the state at a higher (uncapped) price. It had the potential to increase prices in California and reduce them in the export markets.  FERC investigative staff concluded in its Final Report in Docket No. PA02-2-000 that almost all of the Enron strategies violated the antigaming or anomalous market behavior provisions of the ISO and PX tariffs. FERC trial staff in Docket No. EL02-114-000 claimed that other allegedly false schedules submitted by Enron were unjust and unreasonable practices under Sections 205 and 206 of the Federal Power Act (Commission Staff's Revised Statement of Asserted Violations, Item No. II.A, December 10, 2002). 3 Chandley, p. 14.  2  4   Draft  Ricochet took advantage of the fact that imports into California could be priced above the caps. Enron would buy power in the California day-ahead market and sell it to an entity outside the state. It would then repurchase the power from the out-of-state entity and sell the imported power in the California real-time market at a price above the cap. Enron would make money if the real-time price paid for out-of-state supplies exceeded the day-ahead purchase price and the real-time price for in-state supplies. The success of the strategy depended on there being excess demand in the real-time market, which often occurred because California utilities underscheduled load in the day-ahead market (as discussed above). Profitable execution of Ricochet raised overall market prices in California, because it scheduled power transfers simply to obtain a higher price. Get Shorty involved selling ancillary services in the day-ahead market and covering the obligation with a purchase in the real-time market.4 This strategy was profitable when the day-ahead sale price exceeded the real-time purchase price. Since Enron was required to identify the source of the ancillary services (e.g., a specific generation unit) when it made the sale in the day-ahead market, it may have submitted false information to the ISO. Selling ancillary services without having the physical assets to provide them may have posed a threat to system reliability. Non-firm as Firm was a strategy to avoid providing or paying for operating reserves. Operating reserves represent generating capacity that can be called into service quickly when other plants experience unexpected outages. Suppliers selling non-firm energy in the California market were charged by the ISO for the costs of procuring operating reserves. Those selling firm energy were presumed to be providing their own reserves and were not charged. The Non-firm as Firm strategy involved buying non-firm power outside of California and then selling it in the state and representing it as firm to the ISO. The strategy was profitable because it avoided the cost of obtaining operating reserves. The ISO now requires verification that imports said to be firm actually are firm.  The practice of making a forward sale and then meeting the commitment with a purchase in the realtime market is commonly known as selling short.  4  5   Draft  Except for Export of California Power, these arbitrage strategies may have violated the ISO and PX tariffs and been unjust and unreasonable practices under the Federal Power Act. According to FERC staff, Ricochet was not legitimate arbitrage, and Get Shorty and Non-firm as Firm were illegal gaming because they were based on submitting false information to the ISO.  Congestion payment strategies These strategies took advantage of the ISO's rules for paying for relief of transmission paths that were scheduled to their full capacity. Users could get paid for reducing flows in the direction of the congestion or by increasing flows in the opposite direction. Several of the Enron strategies were designed to collect these payments from the ISO without actually relieving any congestion (i.e., falsely relieving congestion), while at least one other strategy created phony congestion and then relieved it (i.e., relieving false congestion). The Enron memos describe Death Star as a strategy that falsely relieved congestion. Enron would schedule a northbound counterflow on congested paths in California to collect congestion relief payments from the ISO, while simultaneously scheduling a return southbound flow on paths outside the control of the ISO. With the same amount of power scheduled to flow north and then south back to the point of origin, power did not actually flow and no congestion was relieved.5 Death Star was profitable as long as the congestion relief payments from the ISO exceeded the cost of the scheduled transmission. Three other strategies falsely relieved congestion. Non-firm Export involved scheduling a counterflow out of the ISO's control area, collecting the congestion relief payment, and then withdrawing the schedule. The ISO prohibited Non-firm Export in a market notice  As discussed in Section 3, PGE argues that these transactions did in fact relieve congestion even though power did not flow.  5  6   Draft  issued July 21, 2000. Scheduling Energy to Collect the Congestion Charge II worked by scheduling a counterflow on a congested path, receiving the congestion relief payment, and then not delivering the energy in real time. The ISO would charge the trader the cost of supplying the missing power. This strategy was profitable if the congestion relief payment was more than the replacement energy cost, which could occur because the price for replacement energy in the ISO real-time market was capped, but the congestion relief payment was not. Wheel Out exploited a loophole allowing market participants to schedule transmission on lines that were out of service. Enron would schedule an export on an out-of-service line, and then if the export proved to be a counterflow that relieved congestion in the hour-ahead market, it would earn a congestion relief payment. Since the line was out-of-service, the ISO would cancel the schedule in real time, but Enron would keep the congestion relief payment. The ISO eventually put an end to Wheel Out by refusing to accept schedules across lines that were not in service. Load shift was a plan to relieve false congestion. Enron would intentionally  underschedule load in one zone in California and overschedule load in another, thereby increasing congestion in the direction of the overscheduled zone. The relief occurred when Enron later adjusted the two schedules to reflect actual expected loads. The adjustment created a counterflow toward the underscheduled zone, earning Enron a congestion relief payment from the ISO. Enron needed to have firm transmission rights (FTRs) in the direction of the overscheduled zone to cover its exposure to ISO congestion charges, but any of its FTRs that were not used may have earned artificially high FTR payments from the ISO. FERC staff found that this strategy was not very successful, in that Enron was not able to affect the price paid for congestion management. As they are described in the Enron memos, these congestion payment strategies were clearly deceptive and therefore may have violated the ISO tariff and constituted unjust and unreasonable practices under the Federal Power Act. However, since congestion relief payments are not included in reported market prices and price indexes (which are  7   Draft  used to price many other transactions), the strategies probably had little impact on energy prices in western markets in 2000-01.  8   Draft  2. Investigations of the Western Electricity Crisis  Several federal and state authorities are investigating trading activity and pricing in western markets in 2000-01. Some cases focus on whether any trading practices were used to game or manipulate the market. Others address whether market prices were in and of themselves unjust or unreasonable. proceedings. This section summarizes the major  FERC proceedings Fact-Finding Investigation of Potential Manipulation of Electric and Natural Gas Prices In an order issued on February 13, 2002, FERC directed its staff to investigate whether any entity manipulated short-term prices for electricity or natural gas or otherwise exercised undue influence over wholesale electric prices in western markets in the period beginning January 1, 2000.6 On May 8, 2002, right after the Enron memos came to light, the FERC staff asked companies who sold electricity or ancillary services in wholesale markets in the West during 2000-01 to admit or deny engaging in the Enron trading strategies. PGE, PacifiCorp, and Idaho Power all responded. FERC, however, concluded that PGE and three other companies did not provide complete and accurate responses to the May 8 request and, on June 4, 2002, directed the four to show cause why their market-based rate authority should not be revoked. PGE answered on June 14, 2002, and later provided two supplemental responses. Based on its staff's findings, FERC opened a separate investigation into possible misconduct by PGE and Enron Power Marketing, Inc. (EPMI) on August 13, 2002. 7  FERC cited preliminary evidence of possible violations by PGE and EPMI of their codes  6 7  The proceeding is docketed as PA02-2-000. Docket No. EL02-114-000  9   Draft  of conduct and FERC's standards of conduct. Codes of conduct govern the relationship between a public utility and an affiliated power marketer, while standards of conduct require that a transmission provider not discriminate in favor of its merchant side or its marketing affiliates at the expense of other users. misconduct. At the same time, FERC initiated separate proceedings on trading activity by Avista and El Paso Electric. The Avista case focuses on the company's role as an intermediary in Death Star transactions with Enron and PGE. In the other case, FERC alleges that El Paso gave preferential transmission access and control of its trading desk to Enron. FERC trial staff has reached settlement with both companies (but not other parties in the proceedings). Under the terms of its settlement, Avista would agree to certain record keeping and training requirements but would be cleared of charges that it knowingly participated in any improper trading strategies or failed to provide relevant information in the Fact-Finding Investigation. El Paso would refund $14 million and give up its market-based rate authority until the end of 2004 in order to settle the claims against it. FERC trial staff submitted direct testimony in PGE's case on December 10, 2002. Citing the company's role in Death Star transactions and its failure to post deals with Enron properly (discussed in Section 3, below), FERC staff concluded that PGE violated the code of conduct and other provisions in its market-based rate tariff and engaged in practices that are unjust and unreasonable under Sections 205 and 206 of the Federal Power Act. FERC staff recommended that PGE's market-based rate authority be revoked for two years and that the company revise its training, monitoring and other procedures to ensure that the violations do not occur again. In its direct testimony, filed on February 24, 2003, PGE explained that the transactions challenged by FERC staff appeared to the company to be legitimate and of a type familiar to utilities in the Northwest. PGE argued that Death Star transactions actually relieved congestion and benefited electricity customers in California. The company also stated that most of its FERC identified refunds and revocation of market-based rate authority as possible remedies for any demonstrated  10   Draft  posting errors should not be considered errors or tariff violations at all, because the posting requirement is vague and the deals with Enron were still visible and available to other market participants. FERC staff is scheduled to file its rebuttal testimony in PGE's case on May 12, 2003. PGE is discussing settlement of the case with FERC staff and other parties to the proceeding. The other parties include the OPUC, the Industrial Customers of Northwest Utilities, Blue Heron Paper Company, the City of Tacoma, and several California agencies and utilities. On January 31, 2003, FERC approved a settlement between its staff and Reliant Energy in the Fact-Finding Investigation. The settlement requires Reliant to pay $13.8 million to PX customers because the company limited the amount of power it offered to the PX for delivery on June 21-22, 2000, in an attempt to increase prices. On March 26, 2003, FERC investigative staff issued its Final Report in the Fact-Finding Investigation. The staff found that most of the Enron trading strategies violated the antigaming or anomalous market behavior provisions of the Market Monitoring and Information Protocol (MMIP) in the FERC-approved ISO and PX tariffs. 8  ""Gaming""  means taking unfair advantage of ISO or PX rules and procedures, or system conditions, to the detriment of market efficiency and consumers. It also includes actions that make the system vulnerable to price manipulation. Market behavior is ""anomalous"" if it is significantly different from normal behavior in competitive markets or leads to unusual or unexplained market outcomes. The staff recommended that 38 utilities and marketers (including PGE, PacifiCorp, and Idaho Power) identified by the ISO as participating in the suspect trading activities be directed to show cause why they should not be found in violation of the tariffs and required to give back all the related profits. 8  9  FERC staff stated that the following strategies violated the antigaming or anomalous market behavior provisions of the MMIP: Non-firm Export, Death Star, Wheel Out, Load Shift, Get Shorty, Non-firm as Firm, Ricochet and Fat Boy. 9 In a report issued on October 4, 2002 (""Analysis of Trading and Scheduling Strategies Described in Enron Memos"") and supplemented on January 17, 2003, the ISO assessed the extent and impact of participation in the various Enron strategies. The ISO described how it screened its transactions data to  11   Draft  FERC staff also found that nine companies (including Idaho Power) submitted bids to the ISO between May and October 2000 that exceeded $250 per megawatt-hour (MWh), well beyond the cost of generation. The staff recommended that the companies be required to show cause why they should not be found to have engaged in economic withholding or inflated bidding in violation of the ISO tariff and required to give back unjust profits. FERC invited comment on its staff's interpretation of the MMIP provisions, and it has not yet issued the requested show cause orders. Other FERC staff recommendations in the Final Report and FERC's response are discussed below. Refund cases FERC is considering refunds on transactions during the western electricity crisis in two proceedings, known as the California and Northwest refund cases. The California case opened with a complaint filed by San Diego Gas & Electric on August 2, 2000. On November 1, 2000, FERC concluded that the market structure and rules for wholesale electricity sales in California were seriously flawed and contributed to unjust and unreasonable rates. After attempts to settle the case were unsuccessful, FERC ordered evidentiary hearings on the use of a mitigated market clearing price (MMCP) to determine refunds. The MMCP is based on the marginal cost of the last unit dispatched to meet load. The order also established a refund period beginning October 2, 2000 (sixty days after San Diego's filing) and ending June 20, 2001 (when price caps were imposed). On December 12, 2002, the FERC administrative law judge (ALJ) in the California case issued a proposed finding for refunds of about $1.8 billion to the California ISO and PX. This amount would be netted against the roughly $3 billion still owed to suppliers by the ISO and PX. It is substantially less than the $8.9 billion sought by California parties.  identify trades or schedules of each type, but it noted that in some cases its methods were imperfect (e.g., incorrectly classifying some transactions as Death Star deals, but overlooking others).  12   Draft  FERC initiated the Northwest refund case in an order issued on July 25, 2001.  10  FERC  directed the ALJ for the case to determine whether rates for spot market sales in the region were unjust and unreasonable during the potential refund period of December 25, 2000, through June 20, 2001, and it set an expedited schedule for the proceeding. On September 24, 2001, the ALJ concluded that spot market prices in the Northwest were not unjust and unreasonable during the refund period and recommended that the case be closed. On August 21, 2002, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals directed FERC to allow parties to submit evidence on market manipulation in the California refund case. FERC responded on November 20, 2002, with an order giving parties until February 28, 2003 (later extended to March 3, 2003) to conduct discovery, introduce evidence, and recommend findings with respect to market manipulation. On December 19, 2002, it issued a similar order, with the same deadline, in the Northwest refund case. On March 3, 2003, refund proponents submitted filings in the two cases that 1) summarized evidence of market manipulation from other FERC cases, 2) offered new evidence of such activity, and 3) charged specific suppliers and utilities with engaging in abusive practices. Other parties responded on March 17, 2003. In its Final Report in the Fact-Finding Investigation, FERC staff concluded that spot gas prices in California were artificially high during the refund period, due in part to manipulation of gas price indices and other market abuses. On March 26, 2003, FERC adopted its staff's recommendation to use producing area prices plus transportation as a proxy for competitive gas prices in computing the MMCP in the California refund case. In calculating refunds, however, generators would be compensated for their actual gas expenses. Replacing published natural gas prices with the lower proxy prices is FERC staff also expected to increase the refund amount by about $1.5 billion.  concluded that spot prices in the Northwest during the refund period were excessive, i.e., not based on cost, and recommended that the finding be referred to the ALJ in the The docket for the case (EL01-10-000) was opened on October 26, 2000, when Puget Sound Energy petitioned FERC to cap wholesale prices for energy and capacity in the Northwest.

At its March 26, 2003 meeting, FERC  indicated that any refunds in the Northwest case will be limited to spot purchases (30  The OPUC has been an active participant in the Northwest refund case. not unjust and unreasonable during the refund period.  The  Commission disagreed with the ALJ's finding that spot market prices in the region were The Commission, however, opposed refunds as a general remedy, arguing that only those who manipulated the market or otherwise exercised market power at the expense of others should be required to make refunds. Ordering refunds by all parties who sold in the spot market at more than some reference price would be inequitable, because it would favor buyers who relied on the spot market over those who purchased in the forward market and because some market participants are not subject to FERC's jurisdiction. The Commission also filed comments in the California refund case outlining principles for any refunds ordered. The principles are that: past due bills for wholesale purchases should be paid before refunds occur; refunds should be ordered only for utilities that were substantially harmed, in percentage terms; refunds should cover market index transactions of any term and bilateral deals with terms up to thirty days; refunds should be limited to a specific time period for the entire western market; sellers should not be required to refund more than their net margins on sales; and regulated Oregon utilities with an obligation to serve should not be required to make refunds, because they do not have market power and they resell power they purchased in advance to serve their retail customers only when it turns out to be surplus to customers' needs. Contract cases Once wholesale prices fell in mid-2001, many forward contracts signed during the western electricity crisis looked uneconomic. Some purchasers filed complaints asking  Northwest refund case is also known as the Puget investigation, although Puget itself opposes refunds.  14   Draft  FERC to modify the contracts. In setting the complaints for hearing, FERC stated that the petitioners had a heavy burden of proving that the agreements should be revised. Two of the contract cases involve Northwest utilities. Snohomish County PUD filed a complaint against Morgan Stanley Capital Group that was consolidated with several others. On December 19, 2002, the FERC ALJ for the proceeding issued an initial decision denying the requests for contract modification. The ALJ ruled that the standard for FERC to reform a contract is that it is contrary to the public interest, i.e., that the contract would bankrupt the company, cause undue discrimination, or impose an excessive burden on its customers. The judge rejected the claim that a lesser standard, that the contract rates are not just and reasonable, applies. The ALJ concluded that, under the public interest test, the petitioners failed to show that faults in the ISO and PX spot markets adversely affected the long-term markets. On May 2, 2002, PacifiCorp filed complaints against four suppliers, requesting modification of contracts for delivery of energy during the three months beginning July 1, 2002. PacifiCorp argued that the contract rates were not just and reasonable and/or contrary to the public interest as a result of market failure in California and the imposition of price caps after the contracts were signed. The caps were lower than the contract rates and remained in effect through the term of the contracts. Therefore, unlike the longer-term deals at issue in the other contract cases, PacifiCorp's contracts were necessarily out-of-market. On February 26, 2003, however, the FERC ALJ issued an initial decision rejecting PacifiCorp's request, finding that the company did not meet the public interest standard for modifying the contracts. On March 13, 2003, PacifiCorp asked FERC to reopen the case to consider the evidence from the Fact-Finding Investigation that Reliant (one of the four counterparties) withheld power to increase prices. On April 17, 2003, the OPUC sent FERC a letter supporting refunds in the PacifiCorp dockets. Noting the link between California spot market prices and forward market prices established by FERC staff in the Fact-Finding Investigation, the OPUC argued that the PacifiCorp contracts should be reformed because FERC ordered  15   Draft  refunds in the California spot market because the market was dysfunctional and was manipulated. Finally, in a complaint filed on February 25, 2002, the California Public Utilities Commission and Electricity Oversight Board challenged 32 of the contracts signed by the state during the electricity crisis. They claimed that the contract rates exceed just and reasonable levels by about $14 billion. Since the complaint was filed, the state has reached settlement on 21 of the contracts, saving $5.1 billion. FERC staff concluded in its Final Report in the Fact-Finding Investigation that market abuses caused spot market prices to be higher than justified by supply and demand conditions during the western electricity crisis and that spot market prices influenced forward prices negotiated during the crisis. The staff recommended that its analysis be considered in the contract cases if the just and reasonable standard applies. At its March 26, 2003 meeting, however, FERC signaled that it will apply the stricter public interest standard and that it will not abrogate contracts with terms of more than 30 days that were signed during the crisis.  Criminal and civil proceedings On October 17, 2002, Tim Belden, the former head of western energy trading for Enron, pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud. Belden admitted to submitting false information to the ISO and PX and implementing other fraudulent schemes in order to boost Enron's revenues. The plea came in connection with a continuing probe into manipulation of California's energy markets being conducted by the U.S. Attorney's Office in San Francisco, the U.S. Department of Justice, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Belden is apparently cooperating with the investigation and may implicate other individuals and companies. The U.S. Attorney has kept Belden under wraps since he pleaded guilty, and we have not been able to question him. On February 4, 2003, Jeffrey Richter, who was head of short-term energy trading in  16   Draft  California for Enron and reported to Belden, pleaded guilty to wire fraud and lying to federal investigators. Richter admitted involvement in designing and running the Get Shorty and Load Shift strategies. On another front, the attorneys general of California, Oregon, and Washington began a joint investigation into possible price manipulation and antitrust violations in western power markets in early 2001. On November 11, 2002, the three states announced a settlement with the Williams Companies. Williams will pay Oregon $15 million over three years and cooperate in the states' scrutiny of the trading practices of other market participants, and Oregon will drop its investigation of Williams. On March 21, 2003, the three states, along with Nevada and other parties, announced an agreement in principle with El Paso Corporation, under which Oregon will receive $17 million in damages. The OPUC and the Oregon Office of Energy assisted the Oregon Department of Justice in identifying possible misconduct and estimating the harm to Oregon consumers.  17   Draft  3. PGE, PacifiCorp, and Idaho Power Trading Activity  This section describes the involvement of PGE, PacifiCorp, and Idaho Power in questionable trading activities during the western electricity crisis. It is based largely on information developed in the FERC investigations. We also requested information from PGE on several occasions, and the company cooperated in responding. We requested only limited information from PacifiCorp or Idaho Power in preparing this report.  PGE In its response to the May 8, 2002 data request in FERC's Fact-Finding Investigation, PGE identified 17 days during April, May, and June of 2000 when it may have been used as an intermediary in Death Star transactions. PGE has reported separately that it may have failed to properly post a large majority of its transactions with Enron in 19992001. PGE also stated in its response to the May 8 request that for more than 30 years it has purchased power from California to meet its retail customers' expected needs and then resold any surplus in the wholesale market. In late 2000 and early 2001 in particular, PGE bought power in the day-ahead market in California to insure it would have enough power to serve its customers and to avoid the greater price volatility of the real-time market. The purchases became part of the company's resource portfolio, and any subsequent resale of power in excess of its actual needs cannot be traced to a specific source. PGE also stated that others may have used its ""parking"" service to engage in Ricochet deals. 11  PGE later found that Enron used its parking service only once during  the western electricity crisis and that the transaction was not a Ricochet.  11  ""Parking"" is a service that allows a marketer to buy power in the day-ahead market for later resale in the real-time market. It is available from several other utilities in the western market.  18   Draft  In preparing its response to the May 8 FERC request, PGE interviewed employees involved in trading activities and directed them to gather relevant documents. The company also searched computer and e-mail files using keywords describing the Enron trading strategies. The company, however, does not have complete electronic files before December 11, 2000 because the tapes for backing up the data were periodically overwritten until then. PGE identified the 17 days of potential Death Star trades through a computer search of trading records based on details of the transaction recalled by Bill Casey, a manager on the trading floor. The company later conducted a more detailed examination of its transmission and trading records (by searching for hours in which the necessary steps for a Death Star transaction occurred on PGE's system and then reviewing trading in those hours in detail) and reduced the count to 15 days. During the course of the FERC investigations, PGE provided transcripts of trader telephone conversations occurring on more than 50 days in 2000-01. PGE's traders ordinarily arrange transactions with others over the phone, and the company has trading floor voice recordings for all of 2000-01 except for a few hours in May and June of 2001, when the recording system failed. The transcripts do not indicate that PGE participated in any of the Enron trading strategies beyond the 15 days of potential Death Star transactions. FERC trial staff asked for all the recordings of conversations between PGE's marketing and transmission traders but later narrowed its request to 20 specific days. FERC staff listened to the recordings and found no evidence of PGE involvement in any of the other Enron trading strategies. In early December 2002, several PGE real-time and transmission traders were deposed (in EL02-114-000) at the request of the City of Tacoma. The OPUC participated in the questioning. Most of the traders knew very little about Death Star and the other Enron trading strategies. They appear to focus on getting the job done (balancing loads and resources each hour or scheduling transmission) and then moving on to the next hour or the next transmission request. The depositions did not reveal any significant new information about PGE's involvement in Death Star or other Enron strategies.  19   Draft  On March 26, 2003, FERC staff for the Fact-Finding Investigation recommended that PGE and others identified as participating in Enron trading strategies be directed to show why they should not be found to have violated the antigaming and anomalous market behavior provisions of the ISO and PX tariffs and required to return the related profits. FERC staff claimed that PGE was involved in potential Ricochet deals and referenced ISO findings that the company was engaged in the Get Shorty strategy (selling ancillary services short). orders requested by its staff. Death Star As discussed briefly in Section 1, Death Star was a strategy to collect congestion relief payments without adjusting loads or resources. Enron scheduled power to flow north on transmission paths in California that were congested north-to-south and collected congestion relief payments from the ISO, while at the same time scheduling southbound flows on paths outside the control of the ISO. In the transactions involving PGE, power was scheduled to flow in a loop, entering the transmission system in southern California, flowing north to PGE's system and then back south, leaving the system in southern California. With the same amount of power scheduled to flow north and south, no additional power was generated or consumed, and no power actually flowed. Since no power flowed, FERC staff has concluded that no congestion was relieved. As noted above, PGE identified 15 days during April, May, and June of 2000 when it may have been used as an intermediary in Death Star transactions. steps in most of the transactions are shown in Table 1. 13 12  FERC, however, has not yet issued the show cause  The specific  PGE, however, was not very active in selling ancillary services short. The ISO reported that PGE had a net loss of $250 (on $1,095 in gains and $1,345 in losses). 13 The company reduced its original estimate of 17 days because the southbound flow was scheduled with the ISO on two of the days. It is not able to verify the southbound flow on one other day but cannot rule it out as a Death Star transaction.  12  20   Draft  Table 1: The Death Star Transactions Northbound 1.

EPMI schedules transmission from COB to Mead on paths not controlled by the ISO  PGE does not concede that any of the transactions were Death Star deals because its records do not show the northbound leg in California (Step 1). FERC staff concluded that they were part of a Death Star strategy, based on 1) internal Enron documents describing how to run Death Star, and 2) a matching of the PGE and EPMI transaction databases and comments in the EPMI logs identifying at least some of the deals with PGE as Death Star. EPMI could not implement Death Star by simply scheduling transmission north to COB and then south on a path outside the ISO's control area (i.e., skipping a northwest loop  21   Draft  like the one in Steps 2-10) because the ISO prohibited this type of flow reversal at COB. PGE provided scheduling and control area services EPMI needed to side step this prohibition on flow reversals at COB. First, PGE scheduled transmission north from COB to its system (Step 4). PGE's control area became the ""sink"" on the northbound leg of Death Star. In transmission scheduling, the ""sink"" is the utility control area at the end of a transmission path, where the power leaves the transmission system. Second, PGE scheduled transmission from its own generators to the John Day substation (Step 8). PGE became the ""source"" on the southbound leg of Death Star. The ""source"" is the control area at the beginning of a transmission path, where power enters the transmission grid. In effect, PGE took power with an ISO source from EPMI and returned it to EPMI with a PGE source. This change in source tag helped EPMI get around the ISO's ban on flow reversals at COB. Any other Northwest utility able to sink the power could have provided the services EPMI needed. PGE's compensation for providing these services was minimal. In most instances, the premium in the sale price at John Day (Step 9) was $0.90 per MWh, and less than 2,500 MWh were sold. The ISO has estimated that Enron collected about $484,000 in congestion relief payments from this type of Death Star transaction in 1998-2001, but we do not know how much Enron made on the deals involving PGE.14 The last Death Star transaction with PGE occurred on June 6, 2000. EPMI may have halted the activity because PGE told its own traders (and presumably, EPMI) on June 6 that it would impose higher wheeling costs on EPMI because Bonneville was planning to charge PGE more for transmission from COB to PGE's system. The additional charges may have made running Death Star through PGE uneconomic for EPMI. PGE has consistently stated that it did not knowingly participate in any deceptive or misleading trading strategies. It asserts that it was unaware that EPMI was executing a California ISO, ""Analysis of Trading and Scheduling Strategies Described in Enron Memos,"" October 4, 2002. The report also states that Enron earned about $2.8 million in congestion payments from ""circular scheduling"" overall. Death Star is a specific type of circular schedule. In the Addendum issued on 14  22   Draft  Death Star strategy because it did not know about the Mead to COB flow that initiated the cycle shown in Table 1. PGE says that the portion of the deal its traders saw appeared to be legitimate and was attractive because it allowed PGE to earn a fee for a buy-sell transaction that did not require it to assume any market risk. The company has also claimed that the Death Star transactions did not harm the market but instead actually relieved congestion and reduced costs to California consumers. According to PGE, when the ISO's lines were congested north-to-south, an EPMI counterflow (Step 1) of, say, 10 megawatts (MW), enabled the ISO to schedule another 10 MW south. EPMI was able to schedule the counterflow even though it did not have a 10 MW load to serve in the north because it used its north-to-south transmission rights on lines outside the ISO's control to create a circular path with no power actually flowing. In effect, EPMI used its non-ISO rights to give the ISO an equivalent amount of additional north-to-south capacity, i.e., to relieve congestion. The additional transfer capability allowed low-cost generation in the north to displace high-cost generation in the south, thereby reducing overall costs in California. The ISO does not know about available transmission capacity on non-ISO lines until 40 minutes before the hour. Before that time, the ISO may see congestion on its lines even though the entire system has additional transfer capability. PGE concedes that the congestion Death Star relieved on the ISO's lines on a preschedule basis would have been relieved anyway in real time (when the available transmission on non-ISO lines became visible to the ISO), but it argues that making the capacity available in advance reduced uncertainty for the ISO. FERC investigative staff nevertheless considers Death Star to be a violation of the antigaming provisions of the MMIP provisions of the ISO and PX tariffs. In its Final Report in the Fact-Finding Investigation, the staff characterizes Death Star as an ""imaginary"" transaction designed to capture congestion relief payments by ""fooling"" the  January 17, 2003, the ISO upped the congestion payments to Enron from circular scheduling to $5.3 million but did not address the $484,000 attributed to Death Star in the initial report.  23   Draft  ISO's congestion management computer program. The Final Report does not address whether Death Star actually relieved congestion. Posting errors Under the terms of its market-based rate authority, when PGE offers to buy from or sell to an affiliated power marketer, it must simultaneously make the same offer to all others on an electronic bulletin board. PGE is also required to post the actual price charged when an affiliate accepts an offer. The purpose of the posting requirement is to ensure that PGE does not favor its affiliates by buying at a higher price or selling at a lower price than it is willing to offer others. After FERC opened its Fact-Finding Investigation on February 8, 2002, PGE began to review its transactions with affiliates and discovered a large number of errors in posting transactions with EPMI.15 From 1999 through 2001, PGE made posting errors in 65 percent of its transactions with EPMI (1,290 out of 1,979 total trades). Trading with EPMI during this time accounted for 11 percent of PGE's wholesale sales revenues and 10 percent of its wholesale purchase costs. Almost all of the trades were buy-sell transactions, in which PGE bought power from EPMI at one location and simultaneously sold the same amount of power back at another location at a small profit. EPMI was in effect moving its power from one point to another to advance or complete a sale (although PGE often accomplished the transfer by cutting the power received from its own resources at the buy location and increasing it at the sell location, rather than actually scheduling transmission of the power between the two points). other utilities (such as Chelan PUD) offered the same service. Most of the errors involved a difference in what was offered and what was accepted (with both the offer and the acceptance posted). PGE usually offered a flat product (the EPMI accounted for the vast majority of PGE's buy-sell transactions, but PGE claims that  15  PGE self-reported its findings to FERC on April 15, 2002 (term transactions, which are a month or more in duration) and on August 1, 2002 (daily and hourly trades).  24   Draft  same amount of power in all hours), but in these cases EPMI accepted and received a shaped product (different amounts of power in on- and off-peak hours). 16  In other  cases, PGE failed to post the offer to EPMI, erred in posting EPMI's acceptance, was unable to confirm it had posted an offer or acceptance, or made miscellaneous or multiple posting mistakes. FERC trial staff has concluded that PGE violated its market-based rate authority by failing to post its transactions with EPMI properly. PGE claims that the posting requirement in its FERC tariff is vague and subject to interpretation and that a difference between the posted offer and acceptance (which accounted for most of the errors) shouldn't be considered an error at all because other parties knew from the posted offer or acceptance what PGE was willing to buy or sell. Furthermore, PGE argues that EPMI did not get an unfair advantage from the posting errors because EPMI could have obtained the same service from others at lower cost. PGE also states that the errors had no effect on market prices because almost all the deals were priced at index (i.e., at posted market prices).  PacifiCorp In its response to FERC's May 8, 2002 ""admit or deny"" request, PacifiCorp admitted to Export of California Power. The company bought energy in the California market in 2000-01 mainly to serve its retail customers but also to resell at a higher price outside California. PacifiCorp noted that it has historically purchased energy from California in order to serve its customers and balance its system. In its response to FERC, PacifiCorp denied initiating any Ricochet trades but stated that it was an intermediary in Ricochet transactions with Enron. During a five-month period starting in July 2000, PacifiCorp entered into 767 buy-sell transactions with EPMI,  PGE asserts that all parties knew that PGE's posting of a flat product meant it would accept shaped deals.  16  25   Draft  Aquila, Sempra, and Williams. These deals involved a total of 40,376 MWh, less than one percent of the company's wholesale purchases or sales for 2000. PacifiCorp stated that the trades at first looked the same as other buy-sell transactions using its transmission system. As the number of transactions increased, however, the company became increasingly aware that they were limited to a single point of delivery, and it grew concerned that the deals were a form of megawatt laundering (another term for Ricochet). As a result, PacifiCorp stopped doing these buy-sell deals in mid-November 2000. PacifiCorp also denied engaging in a Death Star trading strategy but noted that it circulated energy in a similar manner at the ISO's request to relieve congestion on the ISO's lines. 1998). The ISO has reported that PacifiCorp collected about $250,000 in congestion relief payments in 1998-2002 (with almost 60 percent of the payments in The company stated that these circulating trades were not Death Star transactions because in all circumstances energy was actually put onto and taken off the ISO grid. PacifiCorp also described certain transactions involving the use of its transmission system or rights and a buy-sell with a counterparty as ""PacifiCorp Transmission Transactions."" PacifiCorp used its transmission rights to move energy between the Malin and Captain Jack substations at COB. Malin is a terminus for two high-voltage transmission lines that are in the ISO's control area, and Captain Jack is a terminus for another line that is outside the ISO's control. PacifiCorp explained that it was using its transmission rights at COB to assist other entities in using their own transmission assets and rights. We cannot determine from the information in the company's FERC response whether another party could have used these ""Transmission Transactions"" to implement any of the Enron trading strategies. In its Final Report in the Fact-Finding Investigation, FERC staff argued that PacifiCorp and others identified by the ISO as participants in the Enron trading strategies should be directed to show cause why they should not be found in violation of the ISO and PX  26   Draft  tariffs and required to give back the related profits.  FERC staff cited PacifiCorp's  involvement in potential Ricochet deals, while the ISO has reported that the company collected congestion revenues from circulating trades (discussed above) and from counterflows that were later cancelled. requested show cause orders. FERC, however, has not yet issued the  Idaho Power In its response to FERC's ""admit or deny"" request, Idaho Power denied participating in any of the Enron trading strategies. However, in the course of winding down the power marketing activities of its IDACORP Energy subsidiary in mid-2002, the company discovered and disclosed possible violations of FERC requirements, including 1) preferential transmission access for IDACORP Energy trades, 2) unapproved electricity transactions between IDACORP Energy and the utility, and 3) the unauthorized assignment of the utility's power marketing contracts to IDACORP Energy. These activities do not appear to be related to implementation of the Enron trading strategies, and Idaho Power is attempting to resolve the matter with FERC and the Idaho PUC. On March 26, 2003, FERC investigative staff recommended that Idaho Power be directed to show why its bidding activity between May and October of 2000 and its participation in Enron trading strategies did not violate the ISO and PX tariffs and why it should not be required to return the associated profits. The staff's Final Report in the Fact-Finding Investigation notes that Idaho Power submitted bids to the ISO at the prevailing price cap ($750, $500, or $250 per MWh) on 23 days in mid-2000 and that the bids cannot be justified by the cost of generation. FERC staff calls this behavior economic withholding or inflated bidding. The staff's report also describes the company's involvement in potential Ricochet trades and points to the ISO's finding that it collected congestion revenues from circulating trades and from counterflows that were later cancelled. FERC, however, has not issued the requested show cause orders yet.  27   Draft  4. Potential Violations of Oregon Laws, Rules, and Orders  In this section, we discuss whether trading activities by PGE, PacifiCorp, and Idaho Power in 2000-01 violated any Oregon laws administered by the Commission or any of the Commission's own rules and orders. We believe that three types of Oregon provisions are relevant here. The first two-merger conditions and affiliated interest requirements--are discussed below for PGE in the context of its dealings with EPMI. Trading by PacifiCorp and Idaho Power during the western energy crisis does not appear to raise the affiliate issues covered by these requirements. The third provision--the Commission's responsibility and authority under ORS 756.040 to protect customers--pertains to the trading activities of all three utilities in 2000-01.  ORS 756.040 ORS 756.040 sets out the Commission's general powers. It states that the Commission shall protect utility customers from ""unjust and unreasonable exactions and practices"" and ""obtain for them adequate service at fair and reasonable rates."" Staff's counsel advises that the Commission has the authority under ORS 756.040 to reduce rates prospectively to compensate customers for the effects of past utility misconduct or mismanagement. cases in turn. The Commission can take this action without violating either the filed rate doctrine or limits on retroactive ratemaking. The filed rate doctrine is that as long as a rate is in effect consistent with Commission action, it is for all purposes the legal rate. Under the filed rate doctrine, a court cannot require refunds or reduce rates claimed to be excessive because of utility misconduct or mismanagement, but a commission can reduce rates going forward to compensate customers for the excess they paid in the past. This rate reduction would not be prohibited as retroactive ratemaking because it would be based on the effect of the misconduct or mismanagement, not on the extent to which past earnings were higher than expected. 17  17  We address the misconduct and mismanagement  28   Draft  Misconduct contributing to higher costs and rates If a utility was involved in illegal trading activities and those activities contributed to higher wholesale prices in western markets and higher retail prices for the utility's customers, then a rate reduction based on some or all of the higher cost to retail customers could be justified. A trading activity is illegal if it violates a law, tariff, or other legal requirement. In  deciding whether a violation occurred, the Commission would not substitute its judgment for that of another agency with jurisdiction, e.g., FERC. The Commission could make its own determination of a violation only if the responsible agency did not or will not make a finding, as might be the case if the agency adopted a settlement among the parties. The effect of the misconduct on wholesale prices and retail rates can be determined in two ways. First, the effect of the specific illegal trades could be traced. Second, some parties in the FERC proceedings have argued that if a utility was engaged in illegal trading activities, it could be considered, along with all others who participated in abusive practices that raised wholesale power prices, jointly and severally liable. The utility's involvement in the overall pattern of abuse would have to be significant for it to be considered jointly and severally liable. In that case the utility would be responsible, with those other parties, for all of the harm to its customers from the higher wholesale prices. Any rate reduction to compensate for the harm from misconduct, however, could not be so large as to make it impossible for the utility to continue to provide safe and adequate service. Furthermore, the Commission would be able to order the utility to reduce rates for its retail customers, but it would not be able to order compensation for the customers of any other utility.  29   Draft  Mismanagement of trading activity Utility customers are paying rates that include compensation for good management. If a company was negligent in managing a key area of its business--by failing to use due care in its trading activity--then a rate reduction to compensate customers because they did not get the management they paid for could be justified. A mismanagement case requires a showing that customers could have been harmed by the company's actions, not that they actually were harmed. Even if the company is required to hold customers harmless, e.g., by absorbing any penalty associated with its actions, the issue remains that customers paid more for management services than was reasonable. customers or to the amount of manager and officer compensation included in rates. We now address whether the trading activities of each of the utilities violated these requirements. If mismanagement occurred, then a rate reduction could be linked to the harm to  PGE We examined whether PGE violated conditions adopted by the Commission in its order approving the Enron merger, as well as requirements for filing transactions with affiliates. In addition, we considered whether a reduction in rates is justified in order to compensate customers for the company's misconduct or mismanagement. Merger conditions When the Commission approved the merger of Enron and Portland General Corporation (PGC) in 1997 (Order No. 97-196), it adopted a stipulation signed by the applicants and other parties to the proceeding. The stipulation set forth a number of conditions, two of which relate to the trading activities at issue here. Condition 10 of the stipulation states:  30   Draft  Enron guarantees that the customers of PGE shall be held harmless if the merger between Enron and PGC results in a higher revenue requirement for PGE than if the merger had not occurred. Under Condition 21 of the stipulation, the Commission can impose the penalty set out in ORS 756.990 if Enron violates the hold harmless condition. Condition 21 also provides that: 1) the Commission can impose the penalty directly, without first obtaining an order of the Circuit Court, and 2) the monies are to be placed in a deferred account (for customers), instead of being sent to the General Fund. Staff's counsel advises, however, that the Commission would have to go to Circuit Court and the penalty would go to the General Fund, because these Condition 21 provisions conflict with the language and interpretation of ORS 756.990 and cannot trump the statute. ORS 756.990(2) allows a penalty of up to $10,000 for each time that a person fails to comply with a Commission order. The Commission may be able to impose a higher penalty if needed to match the harm to customers by treating violation of Condition 10 as a continuing violation and imposing the $10,000 penalty each day. from Enron for violating the condition because the company is bankrupt. Concluding that Enron, through the trading with PGE described in Section 3, violated Condition 10 requires all of the following four findings: 1) the trading would not have occurred absent the merger, 2) the trading caused wholesale market prices to be higher by some amount, 3) PGE's retail rates are higher because of the effect on wholesale prices, and 4) the harm from this trading activity exceeds the net of any other costs and benefits of the merger. Determining the effect of the trading activity on wholesale market prices--the second finding needed for a violation of Condition 10--is problematic. It should be possible to trace any effect of the Enron-PGE Death Star deals on the market, but that effect is likely to be very small, for three reasons: the deals involved less than 2500 MWh, Enron did not collect much--less than half a million dollars--for congestion relief from this type Condition 10, however, is written as a guarantee by Enron. It may not be possible to collect a penalty  31   Draft  of Death Star transaction in the entire 1998-2001 period, and the congestion relief payments were apparently not included in published index prices. Furthermore, as An explained by PGE in the testimony it submitted in its FERC case (EL02-114-000), Death Star may have actually relieved congestion and reduced costs in California. alternative theory about the effect of the Enron trading strategies and other abusive practices on the market is that there was a ""snowball"" effect, i.e., those practices created uncertainty about the workings of the market, which caused buyers to panic and bid prices up even higher. 18  This snowball effect, however, is difficult to prove, and it is  implausible that the small volume of Enron-PGE Death Star trades had any significant effect on it. PGE's posting errors may have allowed EPMI to obtain service that was not available to others, but, as noted in Section 3, the errors apparently had no adverse effect on the market. The fourth element of a Condition 10 violation--that the harm from the trading activity causes PGE's revenue requirement to be higher than if the merger had not occurred-would require an assessment of other costs and benefits of the merger. This ""but for"" test would be difficult to conduct at this point, almost six years after the merger was approved. Since we believe it is unlikely that the Commission will be able to make two of the necessary findings, we do not recommend pursuing a violation of Condition 10. Condition 15 of the Enron merger stipulation states, in part: PGE shall not give its affiliates preferential access through any prearranged, formal or informal, agreement with any of its affiliates regarding PGE's power or natural gas assets.19  In its Initial Report in FERC's Fact-Finding Investigation, the agency's investigative staff concluded that the Enron trading strategies ""adversely affected the confidence of markets far beyond their dollar impact on spot prices."" 19 We believe ""power"" here includes transmission as well as generation, so that the condition applies to PGE's use of its transmission facilities and rights in trading with EPMI. Because of FERC's open access  18  32   Draft  The penalty provisions described above for Condition 10 also apply to Condition 15. A decision by FERC in its PGE investigation (EL02-114-000) that the company violated the code of conduct and tariff provisions governing dealings with affiliates would be clear evidence that PGE violated Condition 15. If FERC makes no findings on whether PGE gave preference to EPMI (if the case is settled, for example), the Commission could open its own investigation into possible violation of Condition 15. The case that PGE did violate the condition would most likely focus on transactions that were not posted properly and on Death Star deals. PGE's admitted failure to post transactions correctly does not prove that PGE gave EPMI preferential access to its transmission. It only demonstrates that PGE could have given such preference. We would need to examine the transactions that were posted improperly for some advantage for EPMI and address PGE's argument that EPMI did not benefit because it could have obtained the same service from others at lower cost. The Death Star transactions may be evidence that PGE gave preference to EPMI because, as discussed below, the deals should have raised red flags about their purpose because they were more complicated than they needed to be. PGE may have turned a blind eye to a deal with EPMI that it would have questioned and maybe rejected if offered by anyone else. Affiliated interest requirements ORS 757.495 requires PGE to file with the Commission any contract to buy power from Enron within 90 days of execution in order for the company to include the purchase costs in retail rates. OAR 860-027-0040(3)(b)(A) allows an exemption from this filing requirement for transactions carried out under the terms of a FERC tariff. operated under this exemption in 2000-01. PGE  requirements, the power or generation side of the business is often distinguished from the transmission side, but that distinction was not common when the merger stipulation was signed in 1997.  33   Draft  It could be argued that if PGE was not complying with FERC requirements (e.g., it violated the code of conduct), then it was not entitled to the filing exemption and was operating without the necessary approvals. In that case, PGE would not be able to recognize the costs of purchases from Enron in rates. This argument has two serious shortcomings. First, almost all of PGE's purchases from EPMI were priced at a market index (usually mid-Columbia). If PGE had filed a contract to buy power on those terms for review under ORS 757.495, the Commission would probably have approved the contract as ""fair and reasonable and not contrary to the public interest"" because the purchases were at published market prices. It would not have detected that the purchases were part of a deceptive trading strategy or that EPMI was afforded any preference. Second, none of the Enron purchases are recognized in PGE's current base rates. Customers are still paying excess net power costs deferred in the first nine months of 2001, but removing any purchases from Enron at index rates from the deferral mechanism (and replacing them with other market purchases) would have no effect on the calculated rate adjustment. ORS 756.040 As discussed above, the Commission can reduce rates prospectively to compensate customers for the effects of past misconduct or mismanagement by PGE. The two key elements of a misconduct case are 1) whether PGE was engaged in illegal trading activities, and 2) whether the activities contributed to higher costs and retail rates for the company. With respect to the first element, FERC at this point has not ruled that PGE broke any federal laws or requirements. FERC's trial staff has argued in EL02-114-000 that the company violated the Federal Power Act and provisions of its market-based rate authority, but the case is ongoing. FERC investigative staff alleges that PGE engaged in other trading practices that violate the ISO and PX tariffs, but FERC has not yet issued the show cause orders requested by the staff. On the second element of a misconduct case, the effect of the Death Star deals and posting errors on  34   Draft  wholesale market prices apparently was small (and in the case of Death Star may have been a benefit, not a harm), as discussed above. The effect on market prices does not come close to the threshold for PGE to be considered jointly and severally liable for the harm to its customers from abusive market practices. We believe, however, there is a prima facie case that PGE mismanaged its trading activities with Enron, based on the following:  PGE failed to properly post 65 percent of its transactions with EPMI in 1999-2001. This apparent violation of its FERC tariff jeopardized PGE's ability to sell excess power at market prices. Without its market-based rate authority, the company would be limited to charging a rate based on its costs, which could be less than prevailing market prices. Since wholesale sales margins are credited to customers, either on an expected basis in estimating base power costs or on an actual basis in a power cost adjustment, PGE's retail customers could have been harmed by the loss of market-based rate authority. The company failed to have management controls in place to ensure it was posting its trades with EPMI in accordance with the requirements of its FERC tariff or to catch any errors after the fact. (PGE discovered the errors when it started to review its transactions with affiliates after FERC opened its Fact-Finding Investigation in early 2002.)  PGE should have questioned the ""17 day"" transactions. o PGE is subject to regulatory requirements (in the merger conditions adopted by the Commission in Order 97-196 and in the company's FERC tariffs, for example) that prohibit it from giving undue preference to its Enron affiliates. with Enron. o PGE rejected Enron's request for it to assist in another trading strategy less than a year before the 17 day transactions began. In 1999, EPMI devised a plan that These requirements should have made PGE more vigilant and cautious in its dealings  35   Draft  started with it prescheduling (i.e., scheduling in the day-ahead market) transmission for a large block of power to flow north in California for delivery at COB or elsewhere in the Northwest. EPMI would then cancel the deal at the last minute, forcing the ISO to buy power from EPMI and other suppliers to rebalance the system. In order to reserve the transmission capacity in the day-ahead market, EPMI needed to identify a sink for the power in the Northwest and approached PGE to play that role. PGE declined to participate, and it obtained legal advice that it would have run the risk of paying more for ancillary services, violating consumer protection laws in California, and losing its market-based rate authority. However, there is no evidence that anyone at PGE scrutinized the 17 day transactions anywhere near as much as the 1999 proposal by EPMI. o PGE's managers and traders knew or were told that the 17 day transactions were being done to get around the ISO's prohibition on scheduling reversals at COB and that no power was actually flowing. o The convoluted nature of the deal should have raised red flags about its purpose. Avista appears as a ""sleeve"" between EPMI and PGE twice, first at COB (Steps 2 and 3 in Table 1) and then again at PGE System (Steps 5 and 6). A ""sleeve"" is an intermediary who steps between two parties, usually because they cannot deal directly for credit or affiliate reasons. Without Avista, Steps 2-9 reduce to PGE buying from EPMI at COB and selling back to EPMI at John Day. The reason for using Avista as a sleeve may have been to move PGE's posted buy from EPMI from COB to PGE System. Since PGE System is a much less active trading point than COB, the shift in posting made the deal less visible and less attractive to traders.  These points indicate that PGE was negligent in managing its trading with Enron. case for mismanagement, however, is not open-and-shut. PGE has argued that: 20  20  The  We also believe PGE's use of its AC Intertie and IR contracts should be examined further. The AC Intertie agreement provides PGE with both northbound and southbound transmission rights. The company has reserved the northbound rights, from COB to PGE's system, for its native load customers  36   Draft    The error rate for its postings was 3 percent, not 65 percent. Most of the alleged errors involved a difference between the posted offer and acceptance, but in those cases the deal with Enron was still visible and available to others.    The 1999 episode shows that PGE was careful in its dealings with Enron.  In  addition, the deal proposed by EPMI in 1999 was deceptive (in that EPMI never intended to complete the scheduled transaction), but the 17 day transactions appeared legitimate.  PGE's traders were confused about the 17 day transactions, the transcripts of their conversations do not contain any clear statements that they thought the deals were illegal or improper, and their much-publicized use of terms like ""bogus"" and ""scam"" was just an expression of their frustration at having to complete a complicated transaction on a tight deadline.  It was well known (but undocumented) that the ISO required energy delivered at COB to sink in the Northwest before being imported back into California, and PGE had provided a similar service to an unaffiliated party on at least one occasion (to Modesto Irrigation District in early 1999) before the 17 day transactions began.  PGE's traders and managers were unaware that EPMI was running Death Star because they could not see the Mead to COB portion of the loop. The portion of the deal they saw appeared to be legitimate and earned the company a reasonable margin.  and therefore has not offered to sell these rights under its FERC open access tariff. By using these rights in the Death Star transactions (Step 4 in Table 1), PGE may have given EPMI preferential access to its transmission assets. In effect, PGE provided wheeling services to EPMI that it failed to make available to others. The IR agreement gives PGE firm transmission rights from its generating plants to its system and to the John Day substation. The agreement allows dynamic scheduling and provides PGE with non-firm flexibility. However, it prohibits third party wheeling, and PGE's use of the transmission rights on behalf of EPMI might have violated the terms of the agreement and jeopardized its continued use. According to the Bonneville Power Administration (BPA), PGE could not have violated its IR agreement because it did not use those rights to move power from its system to John Day (Step 8 in Table 1). BPA claims that it provided the transmission on an hourly non-firm point-to-point basis. PGE, however, has repeatedly stated that it used its IR contract rights, so the issue is unresolved.  37   Draft    The main purpose of real-time trading was to balance PGE's loads and resources. Real-time trading was not as big a money-maker for the company as other trading activities, and the volume of Death Star trades (15 days, 2,500 MWh) was not otherwise large enough to catch management's attention.    The Avista sleeve that complicates the transaction existed only because PGE could not figure out how to post the buy-sell with EPMI otherwise.    Even if the 17 day transactions were part of a Death Star strategy, customers were not harmed and may in fact have benefited.  PGE argues that it did not knowingly participate in Death Star, and there is, in fact, no direct evidence at this point that it knew the purpose of the transactions. The mismanagement case, however, does not rest on PGE knowing that the 17 day transactions were illegal. Instead, it is based on the argument that the company should have looked more carefully at the deal EPMI brought to it. Furthermore, while PGE may now argue that its posting requirement is vague and that it met the intent of the requirement in almost all cases, we are not aware that it has any response to the argument that the company mismanaged the task of ensuring that it posted its trades in accordance with the terms of its FERC tariff.  PacifiCorp Nothing in PacifiCorp's response in FERC's Fact-Finding Investigation suggests that the company violated any FERC or OPUC requirements for dealings with affiliates. The company admitted to Export of California Power, but we are not aware of any tariff it violated 21  and its Oregon customers probably benefited from the transactions.  22  FERC  21  FERC staff's Final Report in the Fact-Finding Investigation does not cite Export of California Power as a potential violation of the ISO and PX tariffs.  38   Draft  investigative staff believes that other PacifiCorp trades may have violated the ISO and PX tariffs, but FERC has not directed the company to respond. A FERC finding that the company violated the ISO or PX tariffs would be evidence of misconduct. However, we do not have enough information at this time to determine whether the company engaged in misconduct or mismanaged its trading activities.  Idaho Power Idaho Power has denied involvement in any of the Enron trading strategies, and the affiliate issues under review at FERC and the Idaho PUC appear unrelated. FERC investigative staff argues that some of Idaho Power's bidding and trading activities violated the ISO and PX tariffs, but FERC has not directed the company to respond. A FERC finding that Idaho Power violated the ISO or PX tariffs would be evidence of misconduct. However, we do not have enough information at this time to determine whether the company engaged in misconduct or mismanaged its trading activities.  Oregon customers were exposed to excess power costs through a deferral mechanism beginning November 1, 2000.  22  39   Draft  5. Recommendations for Commission Action  We present one overall recommendation and then one recommendation for each of the three utilities.  Overall Recommendation Affirm that the Commission will hold customers harmless for any penalties imposed by FERC or any other authority.  PGE Based on the available evidence, we believe that a formal investigation of PGE's trading activity in 2000-01 is warranted and that parties should be allowed to argue before the Commission whether PGE is guilty of misconduct and/or mismanagement. The key question in deciding how to proceed is whether to wait for FERC to complete its investigations into possible tariff violations by PGE. Commission action. Option 1: Open a two-stage proceeding now on PGE's trading activity in 2000-01. The first stage would address whether PGE is guilty of misconduct and/or mismanagement. The second stage, if needed, would determine what relief is appropriate. Under Option 1, parties would be allowed early in the first stage of the proceeding to argue for expanding the scope of the investigation beyond the 17 day transactions and the posting violations. A party could make its case in two ways. The first is to introduce evidence of other possible misconduct by PGE that is produced if FERC issues the We present three options for  40   Draft  show cause orders requested by its staff.  Second, a party could identify trading  practices it considers illegal and propose ways to screen or sort PGE's trading data to determine whether the company engaged in those practices (like PGE did to search for Death Star transactions). PGE would be able to respond to the parties' proposals. If FERC declines to issue the show cause orders or otherwise limits the scope of its further investigation of the Enron trading strategies, PGE might argue that FERC has concluded that certain trading activities are legal and therefore that they should not be addressed in the OPUC's proceeding. The company could also argue that the The proposed screens are impractical or not likely to reveal new information.  Commission would then decide whether to consider evidence from any new FERC show cause proceeding or require PGE to conduct any of the screens. We believe this scoping step can be completed within 90 days after the start of the investigation. Parties would then be able to develop evidence (through data requests, for example) on the trading activities included in the scope of the proceeding. We believe the opportunity to argue for expanding the scope of the investigation beyond the 17 days and the posting violations should be limited in this way because substantial work has already been done by FERC staff and others to identify PGE involvement in illegal trades. FERC trial staff in EL02-114-000 listened to tapes and followed up with data requests on 20 other days of trades and found no evidence that PGE participated in other Death Star deals or in any of the other Enron trading strategies. Similarly, the depositions of PGE traders we participated in revealed no further PGE involvement in the Enron strategies. FERC investigative staff has issued its Final Report on the Enron trading strategies, and FERC itself will decide soon whether to issue show cause orders. As a result, we do not believe that open-ended discovery, e.g., demanding and then reviewing tapes or transcripts of all PGE trader conversations in 2000-01, would be productive. With the exception noted below, the scope of the investigation should not be expanded unless FERC pursues other potential tariff violations or a more focused search for trading practices the Commission considers illegal uncovers further PGE involvement.  41   Draft  The exception is that if Tim Belden (or any other Enron trader) provides evidence that PGE participated in other allegedly illegal trading practices, then the Commission would again consider expanding the scope of the investigation. As noted above, Belden is very knowledgeable about EPMI's trading with PGE but has not been available for questioning. We will continue our efforts to question him. Since we cannot be sure when parties will have access to Belden, we recommend that the ability to ask to expand the scope of the investigation based on his comments not be limited to the 90day period outlined above. The first stage of the proceeding should have a firm end date, that would be allowed to slip only if solid evidence of additional PGE participation in illegal trading strategies surfaces (through disclosures by Belden, for example) and requires further investigation. We suggest an end date 90 days after FERC issues its decision in its PGE investigation (EL02-114-000). The presiding judge in the case intends to issue an initial decision in mid-July. We expect a FERC ruling shortly thereafter, since FERC has indicated that it wants to wrap up its western market investigations as soon as possible. If the Commission concludes in the first stage of the proceeding that PGE engaged in misconduct and/or mismanaged its trading activities, then a second stage to consider relief would begin. If PGE is guilty of misconduct, we recommend that the Commission decide early in the second stage the nature of the relief it believes is appropriate, since some of the options would require further discovery and analysis to apply. There appear to be two options for dealing with misconduct. First, the Commission could choose to compensate customers for the harm caused by the specific transactions that constitute the misconduct. Second, if the misconduct is based on a FERC finding that PGE gave EPMI undue preference, the Commission could find that PGE violated Condition 15 (no preferential access for affiliates) of the Enron merger stipulation and go to court for the associated fines. The first of these options would require further work to determine the effect of specific transactions on PGE customers.  42   Draft  If PGE is guilty of mismanagement, some discovery on management compensation included in rates might be necessary. Once the Commission has any information it needs on the effects of mismanagement or on management compensation, it would pursue the appropriate rate reduction for customers through a general rate case under ORS 756.515. Option 2: Open a two-stage proceeding now to address whether PGE mismanaged its trading activities in 2000-01. Delay any decision on a misconduct case until FERC completes its investigations. Option 1 presumes that FERC will decide the current PGE case (EL02-114-000) shortly after the initial decision scheduled for mid-July and expedite any proceedings resulting from its staff's request for show cause orders. But that timing is not certain, and it may be inefficient to open a misconduct case now and expand and contract its scope as FERC makes decisions in its various cases. Any misconduct case will most likely be based on a FERC decision that PGE violated tariff requirements. Option 2, therefore, addresses mismanagement now but delays any misconduct case until FERC finishes its work. The first stage of the mismanagement case would develop evidence that PGE failed to post its trades with EPMI properly and that it should have questioned the 17 day transactions more closely. Since PGE could be guilty of mismanagement even if it did not violate its tariffs, the case can proceed before FERC completes its investigations. With the record developed in EL02-114-000, we believe that the investigation into possible mismanagement can be conducted expeditiously. If the Commission finds that PGE mismanaged its trading activities, the second stage of the proceeding would address relief, e.g., a rate reduction to compensate customers because they paid for good management but did not get it. The Commission could pursue a rate reduction through a rate case initiated under ORS 756.515.  43   Draft  Option 3: Delay any decision on opening a formal investigation of possible misconduct or mismanagement by PGE until FERC completes its proceedings. As explained above for Option 2, it may make sense to delay any misconduct case until FERC wraps up its investigations. The FERC proceedings may also provide evidence of possible mismanagement beyond the instances of the 17 day transactions and the posting errors. Further evidence of misconduct may itself be considered evidence of mismanagement. Option 3, therefore, delays any Commission action on possible misconduct or mismanagement by PGE. Recommendation We recommend the Commission pursue Option 2, by opening an investigation into possible mismanagement by PGE related to the 17 day transactions and the posting errors. We believe there is enough information available on these events to proceed now. If the FERC investigations, when completed, point to other areas of possible mismanagement, the Commission can open further proceedings at the time.  PacifiCorp Recommendation Direct staff to examine further PacifiCorp's trading activities in 2000-01 and report back in 90 days whether the Commission should open a formal investigation into misconduct or mismanagement. Discussion We limited our review for this report to information available from PacifiCorp's response to FERC's May 8, 2002 request. activities. As noted above, we cannot determine from this information whether the company engaged in misconduct or mismanaged its trading We propose to obtain further information from PacifiCorp (e.g., through informal data requests and meetings), mainly with respect to the ""Transmission  44   Draft  Transactions."" We also expect that if FERC decides to issue the show cause orders requested by its staff, PacifiCorp's response will be available soon enough for us to report back to the Commission in 90 days with a recommendation on how to proceed.  Idaho Power Recommendation Direct staff to examine further Idaho Power's trading activities in 2000-01 and report back in 90 days whether the Commission should open a formal investigation into misconduct or mismanagement. Discussion Idaho Power informs us that it is close to resolving its affiliate issues with FERC. In addition, we expect that if FERC is going to issue a show cause order (on the company's possible involvement in some of the Enron trading strategies and in economic withholding), it will act quickly and that Idaho Power's response will be available soon after.  45"

""California consumers, taxpayers and businesses were victmized by a coordinated, pervasive $9 billion get -rich-quick scheme conducted under cover of darkness,"" said Lockyer.  ""Today, finally, Californians will be able to see first hand the overwhelming evidence we have developed that shows how the energy companies ripped us off.""   The Attorney General's Office posted on its Website 1,770 pages of testimony and evidence from California parties' March 3 filing to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) in the state's refund case.  Lockyer's action followed FERC's decision to unseal the filing and evidentiary documents.   The state's March 3 filing provided compelling new evidence of widespread withholding of power and Enron-type manipulation that affected 85 percent of the wholesale electricity market.  The California parties – including the Attorney General's Office, Southern California Edison, Pacific Gas & Electric Co. the California Public Utilities Commission and the Electricity Oversight Board – submitted the evidence at the end of a 100-day discovery process.   The documents unsealed by FERC include: the state parties' legal brief, including the proposed findings of fact, and request for refunds and other relief; the executive summary of the legal brief; experts' testimony; and exhibits.

Oregon Public Utility Commission Staff June 12, 2003  On May 6, 2002, Enron Corporation turned over to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) three memos describing some of the company's trading strategies in California wholesale power markets in 2000. The trading strategies--with colorful names like Fat Boy, Ricochet, and Death Star--were designed to exploit loopholes in California's market design. Disclosure of the memos jump-started FERC's investigation of market abuses as a cause of the explosion of wholesale prices in West Coast markets in 2000-01. Since the memos surfaced, FERC has focused on who participated in the so-called Enron trading strategies and whether those participating violated any FERC requirements, such as codes and standards of conduct. Our report examines trading in western markets in 2000-01 from a different perspective: it addresses whether the activities of Oregon's three investor-owned electric utilities-Portland General Electric (PGE), PacifiCorp, and Idaho Power Company--violated any Oregon statutes or Commission rules or orders. It is based on our review of the information available from the current FERC investigations, and it presents our preliminary conclusions and recommendations for Commission action. This report is organized as follows. Section 1 describes the Enron trading strategies, why they are claimed to be illegal or improper, and what is known about their effect on the market. Section 2 summarizes ongoing FERC proceedings and criminal and civil investigations into trading practices and market prices during the 2000-01 crisis. Section 3 discusses the evidence from these cases about the involvement of PGE, PacifiCorp, and Idaho Power in suspect trading activities. Section 4 examines whether  1   the utilities violated any of the laws, rules, or orders administered or issued by the Commission. Finally, Section 5 presents our recommendations for Commission action.  2   1. The Enron Trading Strategies  The Enron memos discuss ten trading strategies, and several variants of them have been identified since the memos were released. This section describes the strategies, why they are allegedly illegal or improper, and what is known about their effect on market prices. 1  We divide the trading strategies into three categories: inc-ing load, arbitrage, and congestion payment strategies.  Inc-ing load This strategy, called Fat Boy in the Enron memos, was a response to the common practice by California's investor-owned utilities of significantly underscheduling load, i.e., understating expected need, in the day-ahead market operated by the California Power Exchange (PX). The California utilities did this because any load not scheduled in the day-ahead market would be served in the real-time market by the California Independent System Operator (ISO), which had tighter price caps than the PX and lower expected prices. The utilities' strategy of underscheduling load in the day-ahead market meant that the ISO had to find a way to serve the excess load when it appeared in the real-time market. The ISO met the excess load by calling on supplemental energy offered by suppliers or by offsetting it with unexpected generation.  This section is based primarily on the Enron memos and on: Falk, Jonathan, ""Substituting Outrage for Thought: The Enron `Smoking Gun' Memos,"" The Electricity Journal, August/September, 2002; Kee, Edward, ""Direct Testimony Before the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission,"" Docket No. EL02-26-000 et al., August 27, 2002; McCullough, Robert, Direct Testimony Before the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission,"" Docket No. EL02-26-000 et al., July 2, 2002; McCullough, Robert, ""Congestion Manipulation in ISO California,"" Memorandum, McCullough Research, June 5, 2002; Chandley, John, ""The Enron Trading Practices: How They Worked, Why They Occurred, What They Teach Us,"" Presentation at EUCI Conference on Market Design, Atlanta, GA, September 23-24, 2002, California ISO, ""Analysis of Trading and Scheduling Strategies Described in Enron Memos,"" October 4, 2002, and FERC Staff, ""Final Report on Price Manipulation in Western Markets,"" Docket No. PA02-2-000, March, 2003.  1  3   Enron and other suppliers quickly recognized the California utilities' strategy and saw an opportunity to serve the excess load in the real-time market. Enron used Fat Boy as a way to send additional generation to the real-time market. It overscheduled (""inc-ed"") load, with matching generation, in the day-ahead market so that it would have surplus generation available in the real-time market. Enron's expectation was that the ISO would use the excess generation to serve the excess load that appeared in the real-time market. Fat Boy depended on Enron purposefully submitting false schedules to the PX. This deception was clearly improper and may have violated the ISO tariff and constituted unjust and unreasonable practices under the Federal Power Act.2 However, because Fat Boy offset the effect of underscheduling by the California utilities, the strategy apparently had little adverse impact on western markets in 2000-01 and may even have reduced prices. 3  Arbitrage Most of these strategies took advantage of different prices for the same product. One obtained a higher price by misrepresenting the product sold. Export of California Power was a strategy to buy power in the California market at or below the price cap and then resell it outside the state at a higher (uncapped) price. It had the potential to increase prices in California and reduce them in the export markets.  FERC investigative staff concluded in its Final Report in Docket No. PA02-2-000 that almost all of the Enron strategies violated the antigaming or anomalous market behavior provisions of the ISO and PX tariffs. FERC trial staff in Docket No. EL02-114-000 claimed that other allegedly false schedules submitted by Enron were unjust and unreasonable practices under Sections 205 and 206 of the Federal Power Act (Commission Staff's Revised Statement of Asserted Violations, Item No. II.A, December 10, 2002). 3 Chandley, p. 14.  2  4   Ricochet took advantage of the fact that imports into California could be priced above the caps. Enron would buy power in the California day-ahead market and sell it to an entity outside the state. It would then repurchase the power from the out-of-state entity and sell the imported power in the California real-time market at a price above the cap. Enron would make money if the real-time price paid for out-of-state supplies exceeded the day-ahead purchase price and the real-time price for in-state supplies. The success of the strategy depended on there being excess demand in the real-time market, which often occurred because California utilities underscheduled load in the day-ahead market (as discussed above). Profitable execution of Ricochet raised overall market prices in California, because it scheduled power transfers simply to obtain a higher price. Get Shorty involved selling ancillary services in the day-ahead market and covering the obligation with a purchase in the real-time market.4 This strategy was profitable when the day-ahead sale price exceeded the real-time purchase price. Since Enron was required to identify the source of the ancillary services (e.g., a specific generation unit) when it made the sale in the day-ahead market, it may have submitted false information to the ISO. Selling ancillary services without having the physical assets to provide them may have posed a threat to system reliability. Non-firm as Firm was a strategy to avoid providing or paying for operating reserves. Operating reserves represent generating capacity that can be called into service quickly when other plants experience unexpected outages. Suppliers selling non-firm energy in the California market were charged by the ISO for the costs of procuring operating reserves. Those selling firm energy were presumed to be providing their own reserves and were not charged. The Non-firm as Firm strategy involved buying non-firm power outside of California and then selling it in the state and representing it as firm to the ISO. The strategy was profitable because it avoided the cost of obtaining operating reserves. The ISO now requires verification that imports said to be firm actually are firm.  The practice of making a forward sale and then meeting the commitment with a purchase in the realtime market is commonly known as selling short.  4  5   Except for Export of California Power, these arbitrage strategies may have violated the ISO and PX tariffs and been unjust and unreasonable practices under the Federal Power Act. According to FERC staff, Ricochet was not legitimate arbitrage, and Get Shorty and Non-firm as Firm were illegal gaming because they were based on submitting false information to the ISO.  Congestion payment strategies These strategies took advantage of the ISO's rules for paying for relief of transmission paths that were scheduled to their full capacity. Users could get paid for reducing flows in the direction of the congestion or by increasing flows in the opposite direction. Several of the Enron strategies were designed to collect these payments from the ISO without actually relieving any congestion (i.e., falsely relieving congestion), while at least one other strategy created phony congestion and then relieved it (i.e., relieving false congestion). The Enron memos describe Death Star as a strategy that falsely relieved congestion. Enron would schedule a northbound counterflow on congested paths in California to collect congestion relief payments from the ISO, while simultaneously scheduling a return southbound flow on paths outside the control of the ISO. With the same amount of power scheduled to flow north and then south back to the point of origin, power did not actually flow and no congestion was relieved.5 Death Star was profitable as long as the congestion relief payments from the ISO exceeded the cost of the scheduled transmission. Three other strategies falsely relieved congestion. Non-firm Export involved scheduling a counterflow out of the ISO's control area, collecting the congestion relief payment, and then withdrawing the schedule. The ISO prohibited Non-firm Export in a market notice  As discussed in Section 3, PGE argues that these transactions did in fact relieve congestion even though power did not flow.  5  6   issued July 21, 2000. Scheduling Energy to Collect the Congestion Charge II worked by scheduling a counterflow on a congested path, receiving the congestion relief payment, and then not delivering the energy in real time. The ISO would charge the trader the cost of supplying the missing power. This strategy was profitable if the congestion relief payment was more than the replacement energy cost, which could occur because the price for replacement energy in the ISO real-time market was capped, but the congestion relief payment was not. Wheel Out exploited a loophole allowing market participants to schedule transmission on lines that were out of service. Enron would schedule an export on an out-of-service line, and then if the export proved to be a counterflow that relieved congestion in the hour-ahead market, it would earn a congestion relief payment. Since the line was out-of-service, the ISO would cancel the schedule in real time, but Enron would keep the congestion relief payment. The ISO eventually put an end to Wheel Out by refusing to accept schedules across lines that were not in service. Load shift was a plan to relieve false congestion. Enron would intentionally  underschedule load in one zone in California and overschedule load in another, thereby increasing congestion in the direction of the overscheduled zone. The relief occurred when Enron later adjusted the two schedules to reflect actual expected loads. The adjustment created a counterflow toward the underscheduled zone, earning Enron a congestion relief payment from the ISO. Enron needed to have firm transmission rights (FTRs) in the direction of the overscheduled zone to cover its exposure to ISO congestion charges, but any of its FTRs that were not used may have earned artificially high FTR payments from the ISO. FERC staff found that this strategy was not very successful, in that Enron was not able to affect the price paid for congestion management. As they are described in the Enron memos, these congestion payment strategies were clearly deceptive and therefore may have violated the ISO tariff and constituted unjust and unreasonable practices under the Federal Power Act. However, since congestion relief payments are not included in reported market prices and price indexes (which are  7   used to price many other transactions), the strategies probably had little impact on energy prices in western markets in 2000-01.  8   2. Investigations of the Western Electricity Crisis  Several federal and state authorities are investigating trading activity and pricing in western markets in 2000-01. Some cases focus on whether any trading practices were used to game or manipulate the market. Others address whether market prices were in and of themselves unjust or unreasonable. proceedings. This section summarizes the major  FERC proceedings Fact-Finding Investigation of Potential Manipulation of Electric and Natural Gas Prices In an order issued on February 13, 2002, FERC directed its staff to investigate whether any entity manipulated short-term prices for electricity or natural gas or otherwise exercised undue influence over wholesale electric prices in western markets in the period beginning January 1, 2000.6 On May 8, 2002, right after the Enron memos came to light, the FERC staff asked companies who sold electricity or ancillary services in wholesale markets in the West during 2000-01 to admit or deny engaging in the Enron trading strategies. PGE, PacifiCorp, and Idaho Power all responded. FERC, however, concluded that PGE and three other companies did not provide complete and accurate responses to the May 8 request and, on June 4, 2002, directed the four to show cause why their market-based rate authority should not be revoked. PGE answered on June 14, 2002, and later provided two supplemental responses. Based on its staff's findings, FERC opened a separate investigation into possible misconduct by PGE and Enron Power Marketing, Inc. (EPMI) on August 13, 2002. 7  FERC cited preliminary evidence of possible violations by PGE and EPMI of their codes  6 7  The proceeding is docketed as PA02-2-000. Docket No. EL02-114-000  9   of conduct and FERC's standards of conduct. Codes of conduct govern the relationship between a public utility and an affiliated power marketer, while standards of conduct require that a transmission provider not discriminate in favor of its merchant side or its marketing affiliates at the expense of other users. misconduct. At the same time, FERC initiated separate proceedings on trading activity by Avista and El Paso Electric. The Avista case focuses on the company's role as an intermediary in Death Star transactions with Enron and PGE. Under the terms of a settlement with FERC trial staff, Avista would agree to certain record keeping and training requirements but would be cleared of charges that it knowingly participated in any improper trading strategies or failed to provide relevant information in the Fact-Finding Investigation. Other parties in the Avista case, however, oppose the settlement. In the other case, FERC alleges that El Paso gave preferential transmission access and control of its trading desk to Enron. El Paso has settled its case with FERC trial staff, the California Attorney General, and the California Electricity Oversight Board, agreeing to refund $15.5 million to California and give up its market-based rate authority until the end of 2004. The FERC administrative law judge (ALJ) for the case has certified the settlement to the Commissioners for approval. FERC trial staff submitted direct testimony in PGE's case on December 10, 2002. Citing the company's role in Death Star transactions and its failure to post deals with Enron properly (discussed in Section 3, below), FERC staff concluded that PGE violated the code of conduct and other provisions in its market-based rate tariff and engaged in practices that are unjust and unreasonable under Sections 205 and 206 of the Federal Power Act. FERC staff recommended that PGE's market-based rate authority be revoked for two years and that the company revise its training, monitoring and other procedures to ensure that the violations do not occur again. In its direct testimony, filed on February 24, 2003, PGE explained that the transactions challenged by FERC staff appeared to the company to be legitimate and of a type familiar to utilities in the FERC identified refunds and revocation of market-based rate authority as possible remedies for any demonstrated  10   Northwest. PGE argued that Death Star transactions actually relieved congestion and benefited electricity customers in California. The company also stated that most of its posting errors should not be considered errors or tariff violations at all, because the posting requirement is vague and the deals with Enron were still visible and available to other market participants. In rebuttal testimony filed on May 12, 2003, FERC staff disputed PGE's arguments and reaffirmed its original findings. On May 23, 2003, the ALJ for the PGE case extended the schedule to allow consideration of Enron data tapes just released by the U.S. Department of Justice. After further rounds of testimony, hearings will begin on October 21, 2003, and the ALJ is scheduled to issue an initial decision on December 19, 2003. PGE is discussing settlement of the case with FERC staff and other parties to the proceeding. The other parties include the OPUC, the Industrial Customers of Northwest Utilities, Blue Heron Paper Company, the City of Tacoma, and several California agencies and utilities. On January 31, 2003, FERC approved a settlement between its staff and Reliant Energy in the Fact-Finding Investigation. The settlement requires Reliant to pay $13.8 million to PX customers because the company limited the amount of power it offered to the PX for delivery on June 21-22, 2000, in an attempt to increase prices. On March 26, 2003, FERC investigative staff issued its Final Report in the Fact-Finding Investigation. The staff found that most of the Enron trading strategies violated the antigaming or anomalous market behavior provisions of the Market Monitoring and Information Protocol (MMIP) in the FERC-approved ISO and PX tariffs. 8  ""Gaming""  means taking unfair advantage of ISO or PX rules and procedures, or system conditions, to the detriment of market efficiency and consumers. It also includes actions that make the system vulnerable to price manipulation. Market behavior is ""anomalous"" if it is significantly different from normal behavior in competitive markets or leads to unusual or unexplained market outcomes. The staff recommended that 38 utilities and  11   marketers (including PGE, PacifiCorp, and Idaho Power) identified by the ISO as participating in the suspect trading activities be directed to show cause why they should not be found in violation of the tariffs and required to give back all the related profits. 9  FERC staff also found that nine companies (including Idaho Power) submitted bids to the ISO between May and October 2000 that exceeded $250 per megawatt-hour (MWh), well beyond the cost of generation. The staff recommended that the companies be required to show cause why they should not be found to have engaged in economic withholding or inflated bidding in violation of the ISO tariff and required to give back unjust profits. FERC invited comment on its staff's interpretation of the MMIP provisions, and it has not yet issued the requested show cause orders. Other FERC staff recommendations in the Final Report and FERC's response are discussed below. Idaho Power Company Settlement On May 16, 2003, FERC issued an order approving a stipulation and consent agreement that its staff signed with Idaho Power Company and its parent (IDACORP, Inc.) and affiliate (IDACORP Energy, L.P.) after a preliminary, non-public investigation. The agreement settles issues regarding improper access to Idaho Power's transmission system, the company's failure to file contracts signed with or assigned to its affiliate, and its violation of standards and codes of conduct. Under the terms of the agreement, Idaho Power and IDACORP Energy will refund profits they earned by falsely claiming native load priority for non-firm transmission on the company's system between January 1, 2000 and April 17, 2002. The refund (about FERC staff stated that the following strategies violated the antigaming or anomalous market behavior provisions of the MMIP: Non-firm Export, Death Star, Wheel Out, Load Shift, Get Shorty, Non-firm as Firm, Ricochet and Fat Boy. 9 In a report issued on October 4, 2002 (""Analysis of Trading and Scheduling Strategies Described in Enron Memos"") and supplemented on January 17, 2003, the ISO assessed the extent and impact of participation in the various Enron strategies. The ISO described how it screened its transactions data to identify trades or schedules of each type, but it noted that in some cases its methods were imperfect (e.g., incorrectly classifying some transactions as Death Star deals, but overlooking others). 8  12   $203,000) will be paid to transmission customers whose requests for non-firm transmission were denied because of the false claims. Idaho Power, however, does not admit or deny that the use of native load priority was improper. The company also failed to file contracts to provide ancillary services to IDACORP Energy for resale to others. IDACORP Energy will transfer to Idaho Power its net revenue on the resale ($5.8 million) to the extent it has not already done so. Idaho Power did not notify FERC as required that it assigned 1,182 other contracts to IDACORP Energy in 2001 and will refund $100 to the counterparty in each of the contracts. Finally, the company violated its standards of conduct (relating to separation between merchant and transmission functions) and codes of conduct (by failing to charge IDACORP Energy for services) and will adopt procedures to ensure compliance in the future. Refund cases FERC is considering refunds on transactions during the western electricity crisis in two proceedings, known as the California and Northwest refund cases. The California case opened with a complaint filed by San Diego Gas & Electric on August 2, 2000. On November 1, 2000, FERC concluded that the market structure and rules for wholesale electricity sales in California were seriously flawed and contributed to unjust and unreasonable rates. After attempts to settle the case were unsuccessful, FERC ordered evidentiary hearings on the use of a mitigated market clearing price (MMCP) to determine refunds. The MMCP is based on the marginal cost of the last unit dispatched to meet load. The order also established a refund period beginning October 2, 2000 (sixty days after San Diego's filing) and ending June 20, 2001 (when price caps were imposed). On December 12, 2002, the FERC ALJ in the California case issued a proposed finding for refunds of about $1.8 billion to the California ISO and PX. This amount would be netted against the roughly $3 billion still owed to suppliers by the ISO and PX. It is substantially less than the $8.9 billion sought by California parties.  13   FERC initiated the Northwest refund case in an order issued on July 25, 2001.  10  FERC  directed the ALJ for the case to determine whether rates for spot market sales in the region were unjust and unreasonable during the potential refund period of December 25, 2000, through June 20, 2001, and it set an expedited schedule for the proceeding. On September 24, 2001, the ALJ concluded that spot market prices in the Northwest were not unjust and unreasonable during the refund period and recommended that the case be closed. On August 21, 2002, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals directed FERC to allow parties to submit evidence on market manipulation in the California refund case. FERC responded on November 20, 2002, with an order giving parties until February 28, 2003 (later extended to March 3, 2003) to conduct discovery, introduce evidence, and recommend findings with respect to market manipulation. On December 19, 2002, it issued a similar order, with the same deadline, in the Northwest refund case. On March 3, 2003, refund proponents submitted filings in the two cases that 1) summarized evidence of market manipulation from other FERC cases, 2) offered new evidence of such activity, and 3) charged specific suppliers and utilities with engaging in abusive practices. Other parties responded on March 17, 2003. In its Final Report in the Fact-Finding Investigation, FERC staff concluded that spot gas prices in California were artificially high during the refund period, due in part to manipulation of gas price indices and other market abuses. On March 26, 2003, FERC adopted its staff's recommendation to use producing area prices plus transportation as a proxy for competitive gas prices in computing the MMCP in the California refund case. In calculating refunds, however, generators would be compensated for their actual gas expenses. Replacing published natural gas prices with the lower proxy prices is FERC staff also expected to increase the refund amount by about $1.5 billion.  concluded that spot prices in the Northwest during the refund period were excessive, i.e., not based on cost, and recommended that the finding be referred to the ALJ in the The docket for the case (EL01-10-000) was opened on October 26, 2000, when Puget Sound Energy petitioned FERC to cap wholesale prices for energy and capacity in the Northwest. As a result, the 10  14   Northwest refund case for consideration. days or less in duration).  At its March 26, 2003 meeting, FERC  indicated that any refunds in the Northwest case will be limited to spot purchases (30  The OPUC has been an active participant in the Northwest refund case. not unjust and unreasonable during the refund period.  The  Commission disagreed with the ALJ's finding that spot market prices in the region were The Commission, however, opposed refunds as a general remedy, arguing that only those who manipulated the market or otherwise exercised market power at the expense of others should be required to make refunds. Ordering refunds by all parties who sold in the spot market at more than some reference price would be inequitable, because it would favor buyers who relied on the spot market over those who purchased in the forward market and because some market participants are not subject to FERC's jurisdiction. The Commission also filed comments in the California refund case outlining principles for any refunds ordered. The principles are that: past due bills for wholesale purchases should be paid before refunds occur; refunds should be ordered only for utilities that were substantially harmed, in percentage terms; refunds should cover market index transactions of any term and bilateral deals with terms up to thirty days; refunds should be limited to a specific time period for the entire western market; sellers should not be required to refund more than their net margins on sales; and regulated Oregon utilities with an obligation to serve should not be required to make refunds, because they do not have market power and they resell power they purchased in advance to serve their retail customers only when it turns out to be surplus to customers' needs. Contract cases Once wholesale prices fell in mid-2001, many forward contracts signed during the western electricity crisis looked uneconomic. Some purchasers filed complaints asking  Northwest refund case is also known as the Puget investigation, although Puget itself opposes refunds.  15   FERC to modify the contracts. In setting the complaints for hearing, FERC stated that the petitioners had a heavy burden of proving that the agreements should be revised. Two of the contract cases involve Northwest utilities. Snohomish County PUD filed a complaint against Morgan Stanley Capital Group that was consolidated with several others. On December 19, 2002, the FERC ALJ for the proceeding issued an initial decision denying the requests for contract modification. The ALJ ruled that the standard for FERC to reform a contract is that it is contrary to the public interest, i.e., that the contract would bankrupt the company, cause undue discrimination, or impose an excessive burden on its customers. The judge rejected the claim that a lesser standard, that the contract rates are not just and reasonable, applies. The ALJ concluded that, under the public interest test, the petitioners failed to show that faults in the ISO and PX spot markets adversely affected the long-term markets. On May 2, 2002, PacifiCorp filed complaints against four suppliers, requesting modification of contracts for delivery of energy during the three months beginning July 1, 2002. PacifiCorp argued that the contract rates were not just and reasonable and/or contrary to the public interest as a result of market failure in California and the imposition of price caps after the contracts were signed. The caps were lower than the contract rates and remained in effect through the term of the contracts. Therefore, unlike the longer-term deals at issue in the other contract cases, PacifiCorp's contracts were necessarily out-of-market. On February 26, 2003, however, the FERC ALJ issued an initial decision rejecting PacifiCorp's request, finding that the company did not meet the public interest standard for modifying the contracts. On March 13, 2003, PacifiCorp asked FERC to reopen the case to consider the evidence from the Fact-Finding Investigation that Reliant (one of the four counterparties) withheld power to increase prices. On April 17, 2003, the OPUC sent FERC a letter supporting refunds in the PacifiCorp dockets. Noting the link between California spot market prices and forward market prices established by FERC staff in the Fact-Finding Investigation, the OPUC argued that the PacifiCorp contracts should be reformed because FERC ordered  16   refunds in the California spot market because the market was dysfunctional and was manipulated. Finally, in a complaint filed on February 25, 2002, the California Public Utilities Commission and Electricity Oversight Board challenged 32 of the contracts signed by the state during the electricity crisis. They claimed that the contract rates exceed just and reasonable levels by about $14 billion. Since the complaint was filed, the state has reached settlement on 21 of the contracts, saving $5.1 billion. FERC staff concluded in its Final Report in the Fact-Finding Investigation that market abuses caused spot market prices to be higher than justified by supply and demand conditions during the western electricity crisis and that spot market prices influenced forward prices negotiated during the crisis. The staff recommended that its analysis be considered in the contract cases if the just and reasonable standard applies. At its March 26, 2003 meeting, however, FERC signaled that it will apply the stricter public interest standard and that it will not abrogate contracts with terms of more than 30 days that were signed during the crisis.  Criminal and civil proceedings On October 17, 2002, Tim Belden, the former head of western energy trading for Enron, pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud. Belden admitted to submitting false information to the ISO and PX and implementing other fraudulent schemes in order to boost Enron's revenues. The plea came in connection with a continuing probe into manipulation of California's energy markets being conducted by the U.S. Attorney's Office in San Francisco, the U.S. Department of Justice, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Belden is apparently cooperating with the investigation and may implicate other individuals and companies. The U.S. Attorney has kept Belden under wraps since he pleaded guilty, and we have not been able to question him. On February 4, 2003, Jeffrey Richter, who was head of short-term energy trading in  17   California for Enron and reported to Belden, pleaded guilty to wire fraud and lying to federal investigators. Richter admitted involvement in designing and running the Get Shorty and Load Shift strategies. Belden and Richter have reportedly implicated John Forney, who was arrested on June 3, 2003 on charges of wire fraud and conspiracy to manipulate California's energy market during the electricity crisis in 2000-01. Forney, who managed Enron's real-time trading desk and reported to Belden, is said to have devised the Death Star strategy. On another front, the attorneys general of California, Oregon, and Washington began a joint investigation into possible price manipulation and antitrust violations in western power markets in early 2001. On November 11, 2002, the three states announced a settlement with the Williams Companies. Williams will pay Oregon $15 million over three years and cooperate in the states' scrutiny of the trading practices of other market participants, and Oregon will drop its investigation of Williams. On March 21, 2003, the three states, along with Nevada and other parties, announced an agreement in principle with El Paso Corporation, under which Oregon will receive $17 million in damages. The OPUC and the Oregon Office of Energy assisted the Oregon Department of Justice in identifying possible misconduct and estimating the harm to Oregon consumers.  18   3. PGE, PacifiCorp, and Idaho Power Trading Activity  This section describes the involvement of PGE, PacifiCorp, and Idaho Power in questionable trading activities during the western electricity crisis. It is based largely on information developed in the FERC investigations. We also requested information from PGE on several occasions, and the company cooperated in responding. We requested only limited information from PacifiCorp or Idaho Power in preparing this report.  PGE In its response to the May 8, 2002 data request in FERC's Fact-Finding Investigation, PGE identified 17 days during April, May, and June of 2000 when it may have been used as an intermediary in Death Star transactions. PGE has reported separately that it may have failed to properly post a large majority of its transactions with Enron in 19992001. PGE also stated in its response to the May 8 request that for more than 30 years it has purchased power from California to meet its retail customers' expected needs and then resold any surplus in the wholesale market. In late 2000 and early 2001 in particular, PGE bought power in the day-ahead market in California to insure it would have enough power to serve its customers and to avoid the greater price volatility of the real-time market. The purchases became part of the company's resource portfolio, and any subsequent resale of power in excess of its actual needs cannot be traced to a specific source. PGE also stated that others may have used its ""parking"" service to engage in Ricochet deals. 11  PGE later found that Enron used its parking service only once during  the western electricity crisis and that the transaction was not a Ricochet.  11  ""Parking"" is a service that allows a marketer to buy power in the day-ahead market for later resale in the real-time market. It is available from several other utilities in the western market.  19   In preparing its response to the May 8 FERC request, PGE interviewed employees involved in trading activities and directed them to gather relevant documents. The company also searched computer and e-mail files using keywords describing the Enron trading strategies. The company, however, does not have complete electronic files before December 11, 2000 because the tapes for backing up the data were periodically overwritten until then. PGE identified the 17 days of potential Death Star trades through a computer search of trading records based on details of the transaction recalled by Bill Casey, a manager on the trading floor. The company later conducted a more detailed examination of its transmission and trading records (by searching for hours in which the necessary steps for a Death Star transaction occurred on PGE's system and then reviewing trading in those hours in detail) and reduced the count to 15 days. During the course of the FERC investigations, PGE provided transcripts of trader telephone conversations occurring on more than 50 days in 2000-01. PGE's traders ordinarily arrange transactions with others over the phone, and the company has trading floor voice recordings for all of 2000-01 except for a few hours in May and June of 2001, when the recording system failed. The transcripts do not indicate that PGE participated in any of the Enron trading strategies beyond the 15 days of potential Death Star transactions. FERC trial staff asked for all the recordings of conversations between PGE's marketing and transmission traders but later narrowed its request to 20 specific days. FERC staff listened to the recordings and found no evidence of PGE involvement in any of the other Enron trading strategies. In early December 2002, several PGE real-time and transmission traders were deposed (in EL02-114-000) at the request of the City of Tacoma. The OPUC participated in the questioning. Most of the traders knew very little about Death Star and the other Enron trading strategies. They appear to focus on getting the job done (balancing loads and resources each hour or scheduling transmission) and then moving on to the next hour or the next transmission request. The depositions did not reveal any significant new information about PGE's involvement in Death Star or other Enron strategies.  20   On March 26, 2003, FERC staff for the Fact-Finding Investigation recommended that PGE and others identified as participating in Enron trading strategies be directed to show why they should not be found to have violated the antigaming and anomalous market behavior provisions of the ISO and PX tariffs and required to return the related profits. FERC staff claimed that PGE was involved in potential Ricochet deals and referenced ISO findings that the company was engaged in the Get Shorty strategy (selling ancillary services short). orders requested by its staff. Death Star As discussed briefly in Section 1, Death Star was a strategy to collect congestion relief payments without adjusting loads or resources. Enron scheduled power to flow north on transmission paths in California that were congested north-to-south and collected congestion relief payments from the ISO, while at the same time scheduling southbound flows on paths outside the control of the ISO. In the transactions involving PGE, power was scheduled to flow in a loop, entering the transmission system in southern California, flowing north to PGE's system and then back south, leaving the system in southern California. With the same amount of power scheduled to flow north and south, no additional power was generated or consumed, and no power actually flowed. Since no power flowed, FERC staff has concluded that no congestion was relieved. As noted above, PGE identified 15 days during April, May, and June of 2000 when it may have been used as an intermediary in Death Star transactions. steps in most of the transactions are shown in Table 1. 13 12  FERC, however, has not yet issued the show cause  The specific  PGE, however, was not very active in selling ancillary services short. The ISO reported that PGE had a net loss of $250 (on $1,095 in gains and $1,345 in losses). 13 The company reduced its original estimate of 17 days because the southbound flow was scheduled with the ISO on two of the days. It is not able to verify the southbound flow on one other day but cannot rule it out as a Death Star transaction.  12  21   Table 1: The Death Star Transactions Northbound 1.

EPMI schedules transmission from COB to Mead on paths not controlled by the ISO  PGE does not concede that any of the transactions were Death Star deals because its records do not show the northbound leg in California (Step 1). FERC staff concluded that they were part of a Death Star strategy, based on 1) internal Enron documents describing how to run Death Star, and 2) a matching of the PGE and EPMI transaction databases and comments in the EPMI logs identifying at least some of the deals with PGE as Death Star. EPMI could not implement Death Star by simply scheduling transmission north to COB and then south on a path outside the ISO's control area (i.e., skipping a northwest loop  22   like the one in Steps 2-10) because the ISO prohibited this type of flow reversal at COB. PGE provided scheduling and control area services EPMI needed to side step this prohibition on flow reversals at COB. First, PGE scheduled transmission north from COB to its system (Step 4). PGE's control area became the ""sink"" on the northbound leg of Death Star. In transmission scheduling, the ""sink"" is the utility control area at the end of a transmission path, where the power leaves the transmission system. Second, PGE scheduled transmission from its own generators to the John Day substation (Step 8). PGE became the ""source"" on the southbound leg of Death Star. The ""source"" is the control area at the beginning of a transmission path, where power enters the transmission grid. In effect, PGE took power with an ISO source from EPMI and returned it to EPMI with a PGE source. This change in source tag helped EPMI get around the ISO's ban on flow reversals at COB. Any other Northwest utility able to sink the power could have provided the services EPMI needed. PGE's compensation for providing these services was minimal. In most instances, the premium in the sale price at John Day (Step 9) was $0.90 per MWh, and less than 2,500 MWh were sold. The ISO has estimated that Enron collected about $484,000 in congestion relief payments from this type of Death Star transaction in 1998-2001, but we do not know how much Enron made on the deals involving PGE.14 The last Death Star transaction with PGE occurred on June 6, 2000. EPMI may have halted the activity because PGE told its own traders (and presumably, EPMI) on June 6 that it would impose higher wheeling costs on EPMI because Bonneville was planning to charge PGE more for transmission from COB to PGE's system. The additional charges may have made running Death Star through PGE uneconomic for EPMI. PGE has consistently stated that it did not knowingly participate in any deceptive or misleading trading strategies. It asserts that it was unaware that EPMI was executing a California ISO, ""Analysis of Trading and Scheduling Strategies Described in Enron Memos,"" October 4, 2002. The report also states that Enron earned about $2.8 million in congestion payments from ""circular scheduling"" overall. Death Star is a specific type of circular schedule. In the Addendum issued on 14  23   Death Star strategy because it did not know about the Mead to COB flow that initiated the cycle shown in Table 1. PGE says that the portion of the deal its traders saw appeared to be legitimate and was attractive because it allowed PGE to earn a fee for a buy-sell transaction that did not require it to assume any market risk. The company has also claimed that the Death Star transactions did not harm the market but instead actually relieved congestion and reduced costs to California consumers. According to PGE, when the ISO's lines were congested north-to-south, an EPMI counterflow (Step 1) of, say, 10 megawatts (MW), enabled the ISO to schedule another 10 MW south. EPMI was able to schedule the counterflow even though it did not have a 10 MW load to serve in the north because it used its north-to-south transmission rights on lines outside the ISO's control to create a circular path with no power actually flowing. In effect, EPMI used its non-ISO rights to give the ISO an equivalent amount of additional north-to-south capacity, i.e., to relieve congestion. The additional transfer capability allowed low-cost generation in the north to displace high-cost generation in the south, thereby reducing overall costs in California. The ISO does not know about available transmission capacity on non-ISO lines until 40 minutes before the hour. Before that time, the ISO may see congestion on its lines even though the entire system has additional transfer capability. PGE concedes that the congestion Death Star relieved on the ISO's lines on a preschedule basis would have been relieved anyway in real time (when the available transmission on non-ISO lines became visible to the ISO), but it argues that making the capacity available in advance reduced uncertainty for the ISO. FERC investigative staff nevertheless considers Death Star to be a violation of the antigaming provisions of the MMIP provisions of the ISO and PX tariffs. In its Final Report in the Fact-Finding Investigation, the staff characterizes Death Star as an ""imaginary"" transaction designed to capture congestion relief payments by ""fooling"" the  January 17, 2003, the ISO upped the congestion payments to Enron from circular scheduling to $5.3 million but did not address the $484,000 attributed to Death Star in the initial report.  24   ISO's congestion management computer program. The Final Report does not address whether Death Star actually relieved congestion. Posting errors Under the terms of its market-based rate authority, when PGE offers to buy from or sell to an affiliated power marketer, it must simultaneously make the same offer to all others on an electronic bulletin board. PGE is also required to post the actual price charged when an affiliate accepts an offer. The purpose of the posting requirement is to ensure that PGE does not favor its affiliates by buying at a higher price or selling at a lower price than it is willing to offer others. After FERC opened its Fact-Finding Investigation on February 8, 2002, PGE began to review its transactions with affiliates and discovered a large number of errors in posting transactions with EPMI.15 From 1999 through 2001, PGE made posting errors in 65 percent of its transactions with EPMI (1,290 out of 1,979 total trades). Trading with EPMI during this time accounted for 11 percent of PGE's wholesale sales revenues and 10 percent of its wholesale purchase costs. Almost all of the trades were buy-sell transactions, in which PGE bought power from EPMI at one location and simultaneously sold the same amount of power back at another location at a small profit. EPMI was in effect moving its power from one point to another to advance or complete a sale (although PGE often accomplished the transfer by cutting the power received from its own resources at the buy location and increasing it at the sell location, rather than actually scheduling transmission of the power between the two points). other utilities (such as Chelan PUD) offered the same service. Most of the errors involved a difference in what was offered and what was accepted (with both the offer and the acceptance posted). PGE usually offered a flat product (the EPMI accounted for the vast majority of PGE's buy-sell transactions, but PGE claims that  15  PGE self-reported its findings to FERC on April 15, 2002 (term transactions, which are a month or more in duration) and on August 1, 2002 (daily and hourly trades).  25   same amount of power in all hours), but in these cases EPMI accepted and received a shaped product (different amounts of power in on- and off-peak hours). 16  In other  cases, PGE failed to post the offer to EPMI, erred in posting EPMI's acceptance, was unable to confirm it had posted an offer or acceptance, or made miscellaneous or multiple posting mistakes. FERC trial staff has concluded that PGE violated its market-based rate authority by failing to post its transactions with EPMI properly. PGE claims that the posting requirement in its FERC tariff is vague and subject to interpretation and that a difference between the posted offer and acceptance (which accounted for most of the errors) shouldn't be considered an error at all because other parties knew from the posted offer or acceptance what PGE was willing to buy or sell. Furthermore, PGE argues that EPMI did not get an unfair advantage from the posting errors because EPMI could have obtained the same service from others at lower cost. PGE also states that the errors had no effect on market prices because almost all the deals were priced at index (i.e., at posted market prices).  PacifiCorp In its response to FERC's May 8, 2002 ""admit or deny"" request, PacifiCorp admitted to Export of California Power. The company bought energy in the California market in 2000-01 mainly to serve its retail customers but also to resell at a higher price outside California. PacifiCorp noted that it has historically purchased energy from California in order to serve its customers and balance its system. In its response to FERC, PacifiCorp denied initiating any Ricochet trades but stated that it was an intermediary in Ricochet transactions with Enron. During a five-month period starting in July 2000, PacifiCorp entered into 767 buy-sell transactions with EPMI,  PGE asserts that all parties knew that PGE's posting of a flat product meant it would accept shaped deals.  16  26   Aquila, Sempra, and Williams. These deals involved a total of 40,376 MWh, less than one percent of the company's wholesale purchases or sales for 2000. PacifiCorp stated that the trades at first looked the same as other buy-sell transactions using its transmission system. As the number of transactions increased, however, the company became increasingly aware that they were limited to a single point of delivery, and it grew concerned that the deals were a form of megawatt laundering (another term for Ricochet). As a result, PacifiCorp stopped doing these buy-sell deals in mid-November 2000. PacifiCorp also denied engaging in a Death Star trading strategy but noted that it circulated energy in a similar manner at the ISO's request to relieve congestion on the ISO's lines. 1998). The ISO has reported that PacifiCorp collected about $250,000 in congestion relief payments in 1998-2002 (with almost 60 percent of the payments in The company stated that these circulating trades were not Death Star transactions because in all circumstances energy was actually put onto and taken off the ISO grid. PacifiCorp also described certain transactions involving the use of its transmission system or rights and a buy-sell with a counterparty as ""PacifiCorp Transmission Transactions."" PacifiCorp used its transmission rights to move energy between the Malin and Captain Jack substations at COB. Malin is a terminus for two high-voltage transmission lines that are in the ISO's control area, and Captain Jack is a terminus for another line that is outside the ISO's control. PacifiCorp explained that it was using its transmission rights at COB to assist other entities in using their own transmission assets and rights. We cannot determine from the information in the company's FERC response whether another party could have used these ""Transmission Transactions"" to implement any of the Enron trading strategies. In its Final Report in the Fact-Finding Investigation, FERC staff argued that PacifiCorp and others identified by the ISO as participants in the Enron trading strategies should be directed to show cause why they should not be found in violation of the ISO and PX  27   tariffs and required to give back the related profits.  FERC staff cited PacifiCorp's  involvement in potential Ricochet deals, while the ISO has reported that the company collected congestion revenues from circulating trades (discussed above) and from counterflows that were later cancelled. requested show cause orders. FERC, however, has not yet issued the  Idaho Power In its response to FERC's ""admit or deny"" request, Idaho Power denied participating in any of the Enron trading strategies. However, in the course of winding down the power marketing activities of its IDACORP Energy subsidiary in mid-2002, the company discovered and disclosed possible violations of FERC requirements, including 1) preferential transmission access for IDACORP Energy trades, 2) unapproved electricity transactions between IDACORP Energy and the utility, and 3) the unauthorized assignment of the utility's power marketing contracts to IDACORP Energy. These activities do not appear to be related to implementation of the Enron trading strategies. Idaho Power has settled the matter with FERC (as discussed above at page 12) and is working to resolve related ratemaking issues with the Idaho PUC. On March 26, 2003, FERC investigative staff recommended that Idaho Power be directed to show why its bidding activity between May and October of 2000 and its participation in Enron trading strategies did not violate the ISO and PX tariffs and why it should not be required to return the associated profits. The staff's Final Report in the Fact-Finding Investigation notes that Idaho Power submitted bids to the ISO at the prevailing price cap ($750, $500, or $250 per MWh) on 23 days in mid-2000 and that the bids cannot be justified by the cost of generation. FERC staff calls this behavior economic withholding or inflated bidding. The staff's report also describes the company's involvement in potential Ricochet trades and points to the ISO's finding that it collected congestion revenues from circulating trades and from counterflows that were later cancelled. FERC, however, has not issued the requested show cause orders yet.  28   4. Potential Violations of Oregon Laws, Rules, and Orders  In this section, we discuss whether trading activities by PGE, PacifiCorp, and Idaho Power in 2000-01 violated any Oregon laws administered by the Commission or any of the Commission's own rules and orders. We believe that three types of Oregon provisions are relevant here. The first two-merger conditions and affiliated interest requirements--are discussed below for PGE in the context of its dealings with EPMI. Trading by PacifiCorp and Idaho Power during the western energy crisis does not appear to raise the affiliate issues covered by these requirements. The third provision--the Commission's responsibility and authority under ORS 756.040 to protect customers--pertains to the trading activities of all three utilities in 2000-01.  ORS 756.040 ORS 756.040 sets out the Commission's general powers. It states that the Commission shall protect utility customers from ""unjust and unreasonable exactions and practices"" and ""obtain for them adequate service at fair and reasonable rates."" Staff's counsel advises that the Commission has the authority under ORS 756.040 to reduce rates prospectively to ""compensate"" customers for the effects of past utility misconduct or mismanagement. If the Commission finds in a formal investigation that a utility engaged in misconduct or mismanaged key activities, it can initiate a rate case to determine the appropriate level of expenses to include in revenue requirement. It could conclude that certain expenses projected for the test period are too high because of the continuing effects of past misconduct or mismanagement. The Commission would have  29   to consider the utility's other costs in the rate case and set rates that are reasonable overall. 17  We address the misconduct and mismanagement cases in turn. Misconduct contributing to higher costs and rates If a utility was involved in illegal trading activities and those activities contributed to higher wholesale prices in western markets and higher retail prices for the utility's customers, then a rate reduction to remove the effect of the higher costs going forward could be justified. A trading activity is illegal if it violates a law, tariff, or other legal requirement. In  deciding whether a violation occurred, the Commission would not substitute its judgment for that of another agency with jurisdiction, e.g., FERC. The Commission could make its own determination of a violation only if the responsible agency did not or will not make a finding, as might be the case if the agency adopted a settlement among the parties. The effect of the misconduct on wholesale prices and retail rates can be determined in two ways. First, the effect of the specific illegal trades could be traced. Second, some parties in the FERC proceedings have argued that if a utility was engaged in illegal trading activities, it could be considered, along with all others who participated in abusive practices that raised wholesale power prices, jointly and severally liable. The utility's involvement in the overall pattern of abuse would have to be significant for it to be considered jointly and severally liable. In that case the utility would be responsible,  The Commission can take this action without violating either the filed rate doctrine or limits on retroactive ratemaking. The filed rate doctrine is that as long as a rate is in effect consistent with Commission action, it is for all purposes the legal rate. Under the filed rate doctrine, a court cannot require refunds or reduce rates claimed to be excessive because of utility misconduct or mismanagement, but a commission can reduce rates to recognize the effect of past misconduct or mismanagement on costs going forward. This rate reduction would not be prohibited as retroactive ratemaking because it would be based on the effect of the misconduct or mismanagement, not on the extent to which past earnings were higher than expected.  17  30   with those other parties, for all of the harm to its customers from the higher wholesale prices. Any rate reduction to remove the effect of misconduct going forward, however, could not be so large as to make it impossible for the utility to continue to provide safe and adequate service. Furthermore, the Commission would be able to order the utility to reduce rates for its retail customers, but it would not be able to order compensation for the customers of any other utility. Mismanagement of trading activity Utility customers are paying rates that include compensation for good management. If a company was negligent in managing a key area of its business--by failing to use due care in its trading activity--then a rate reduction to reflect a lower quality of management and lower compensation for it going forward could be justified. A mismanagement case requires a showing that customers could have been harmed by the company's actions, not that they actually were harmed. Even if the company is required to hold customers harmless, e.g., by absorbing any penalty associated with its actions, the issue remains that customers paid more for management services than was reasonable. to customers or to the amount of manager and officer compensation included in rates. We now address whether the trading activities of each of the utilities violated these requirements. If mismanagement occurred, then a rate reduction could be linked to any continuing harm  PGE We examined whether PGE violated conditions adopted by the Commission in its order approving the Enron merger, as well as requirements for filing transactions with affiliates. In addition, we considered whether a reduction in rates is justified in order to compensate customers for the company's misconduct or mismanagement.  31   Merger conditions When the Commission approved the merger of Enron and Portland General Corporation (PGC) in 1997 (Order No. 97-196), it adopted a stipulation signed by the applicants and other parties to the proceeding. The stipulation set forth a number of conditions, two of which relate to the trading activities at issue here. Condition 10 of the stipulation states: Enron guarantees that the customers of PGE shall be held harmless if the merger between Enron and PGC results in a higher revenue requirement for PGE than if the merger had not occurred. Under Condition 21 of the stipulation, the Commission can impose the penalty set out in ORS 756.990 if Enron violates the hold harmless condition. Condition 21 also provides that: 1) the Commission can impose the penalty directly, without first obtaining an order of the Circuit Court, and 2) the monies are to be placed in a deferred account (for customers), instead of being sent to the General Fund. Staff's counsel advises, however, that the Commission would have to go to Circuit Court and the penalty would go to the General Fund, because these Condition 21 provisions conflict with the language and interpretation of ORS 756.990 and cannot trump the statute. ORS 756.990(2) allows a penalty of up to $10,000 for each time that a person fails to comply with a Commission order. The Commission may be able to impose a higher penalty if needed to match the harm to customers by treating violation of Condition 10 as a continuing violation and imposing the $10,000 penalty each day. from Enron for violating the condition because the company is bankrupt. Concluding that Enron, through the trading with PGE described in Section 3, violated Condition 10 requires all of the following four findings: 1) the trading would not have occurred absent the merger, 2) the trading caused wholesale market prices to be higher Condition 10, however, is written as a guarantee by Enron. It may not be possible to collect a penalty  32   by some amount, 3) PGE's retail rates are higher because of the effect on wholesale prices, and 4) the harm from this trading activity exceeds the net of any other costs and benefits of the merger. Determining the effect of the trading activity on wholesale market prices--the second finding needed for a violation of Condition 10--is problematic. It should be possible to trace any effect of the Enron-PGE Death Star deals on the market, but that effect is likely to be very small, for three reasons: the deals involved less than 2,500 MWh, Enron did not collect much--less than half a million dollars--for congestion relief from this type of Death Star transaction in the entire 1998-2001 period, and the congestion relief payments were apparently not included in published index prices. Furthermore, as explained by PGE in the testimony it submitted in its FERC case (EL02-114-000), Death Star may have actually relieved congestion and reduced costs in California. An alternative theory about the effect of the Enron trading strategies and other abusive practices on the market is that there was a ""snowball"" effect, i.e., those practices created uncertainty about the workings of the market, which caused buyers to panic and bid prices up even higher. 18  This snowball effect, however, is difficult to prove, and it is  implausible that the small volume of Enron-PGE Death Star trades had any significant effect on it. PGE's posting errors may have allowed EPMI to obtain service that was not available to others, but, as noted in Section 3, the errors apparently had no adverse effect on the market. The fourth element of a Condition 10 violation--that the harm from the trading activity causes PGE's revenue requirement to be higher than if the merger had not occurred-would require an assessment of other costs and benefits of the merger. This ""but for"" test would be difficult to conduct at this point, almost six years after the merger was approved.  In its Initial Report in FERC's Fact-Finding Investigation, the agency's investigative staff concluded that the Enron trading strategies ""adversely affected the confidence of markets far beyond their dollar impact on spot prices.""  18  33   Since we believe it is unlikely that the Commission will be able to make two of the necessary findings, we do not recommend pursuing a violation of Condition 10. Condition 15 of the Enron merger stipulation states, in part: PGE shall not give its affiliates preferential access through any prearranged, formal or informal, agreement with any of its affiliates regarding PGE's power or natural gas assets.19 The penalty provisions described above for Condition 10 also apply to Condition 15. A decision by FERC in its PGE investigation (EL02-114-000) that the company violated the code of conduct and tariff provisions governing dealings with affiliates would be clear evidence that PGE violated Condition 15. If FERC makes no findings on whether PGE gave preference to EPMI (if the case is settled, for example), the Commission could open its own investigation into possible violation of Condition 15. The case that PGE did violate the condition would most likely focus on transactions that were not posted properly and on Death Star deals. PGE's admitted failure to post transactions correctly does not prove that PGE gave EPMI preferential access to its transmission. It only demonstrates that PGE could have given such preference. We would need to examine the transactions that were posted improperly for some advantage for EPMI and address PGE's argument that EPMI did not benefit because it could have obtained the same service from others at lower cost. The Death Star transactions may be evidence that PGE gave preference to EPMI because, as discussed below, the deals should have raised red flags about their purpose because they were more complicated than they needed to be. PGE may have turned a blind eye to a deal with EPMI that it would have questioned and maybe rejected if offered by anyone else.  We believe ""power"" here includes transmission as well as generation, so that the condition applies to PGE's use of its transmission facilities and rights in trading with EPMI. Because of FERC's open access requirements, the power or generation side of the business is often distinguished from the transmission side, but that distinction was not common when the merger stipulation was signed in 1997.  19  34   Affiliated interest requirements ORS 757.495 requires PGE to file with the Commission any contract to buy power from Enron within 90 days of execution in order for the company to include the purchase costs in retail rates. OAR 860-027-0040(3)(b)(A) allows an exemption from this filing requirement for transactions carried out under the terms of a FERC tariff. operated under this exemption in 2000-01. It could be argued that if PGE was not complying with FERC requirements (e.g., it violated the code of conduct), then it was not entitled to the filing exemption and was operating without the necessary approvals. In that case, PGE would not be able to recognize the costs of purchases from Enron in rates. This argument has two serious shortcomings. First, almost all of PGE's purchases from EPMI were priced at a market index (usually mid-Columbia). If PGE had filed a contract to buy power on those terms for review under ORS 757.495, the Commission would probably have approved the contract as ""fair and reasonable and not contrary to the public interest"" because the purchases were at published market prices. It would not have detected that the purchases were part of a deceptive trading strategy or that EPMI was afforded any preference. Second, none of the Enron purchases are recognized in PGE's current base rates. Customers are still paying excess net power costs deferred in the first nine months of 2001, but removing any purchases from Enron at index rates from the deferral mechanism (and replacing them with other market purchases) would have no effect on the calculated rate adjustment. ORS 756.040 As discussed above, the Commission can reduce rates prospectively to compensate customers for the effects of past misconduct or mismanagement by PGE. PGE  35   The two key elements of a misconduct case are 1) whether PGE was engaged in illegal trading activities, and 2) whether the activities contributed to higher costs and retail rates for the company. With respect to the first element, FERC at this point has not ruled that PGE broke any federal laws or requirements. FERC's trial staff has argued in EL02-114-000 that the company violated the Federal Power Act and provisions of its market-based rate authority, but the case is ongoing. FERC investigative staff alleges that PGE engaged in other trading practices that violate the ISO and PX tariffs, but FERC has not yet issued the show cause orders requested by the staff. On the second element of a misconduct case, the effect of the Death Star deals and posting errors on wholesale market prices apparently was small (and in the case of Death Star may have been a benefit, not a harm), as discussed above. The effect on market prices does not come close to the threshold for PGE to be considered jointly and severally liable for the harm to its customers from abusive market practices. We believe, however, there is a prima facie case that PGE mismanaged its trading activities with Enron, based on the following:  PGE failed to properly post 65 percent of its transactions with EPMI in 1999-2001. This apparent violation of its FERC tariff jeopardized PGE's ability to sell excess power at market prices. Without its market-based rate authority, the company would be limited to charging a rate based on its costs, which could be less than prevailing market prices. Since wholesale sales margins are credited to customers, either on an expected basis in estimating base power costs or on an actual basis in a power cost adjustment, PGE's retail customers could have been harmed by the loss of market-based rate authority. The company failed to have management controls in place to ensure it was posting its trades with EPMI in accordance with the requirements of its FERC tariff or to catch any errors after the fact. (PGE discovered the errors when it started to review its transactions with affiliates after FERC opened its Fact-Finding Investigation in early 2002.)  PGE should have questioned the ""17 day"" transactions.  36   o PGE is subject to regulatory requirements (in the merger conditions adopted by the Commission in Order 97-196 and in the company's FERC tariffs, for example) that prohibit it from giving undue preference to its Enron affiliates. with Enron. o PGE rejected Enron's request for it to assist in another trading strategy less than a year before the 17 day transactions began. In 1999, EPMI devised a plan that started with it prescheduling (i.e., scheduling in the day-ahead market) transmission for a large block of power to flow north in California for delivery at COB or elsewhere in the Northwest. EPMI would then cancel the deal at the last minute, forcing the ISO to buy power from EPMI and other suppliers to rebalance the system. In order to reserve the transmission capacity in the day-ahead market, EPMI needed to identify a sink for the power in the Northwest and approached PGE to play that role. PGE declined to participate, and it obtained legal advice that it would have run the risk of paying more for ancillary services, violating consumer protection laws in California, and losing its market-based rate authority. However, there is no evidence that anyone at PGE scrutinized the 17 day transactions anywhere near as much as the 1999 proposal by EPMI. o PGE's managers and traders knew or were told that the 17 day transactions were being done to get around the ISO's prohibition on scheduling reversals at COB and that no power was actually flowing. o The convoluted nature of the deal should have raised red flags about its purpose. Avista appears as a ""sleeve"" between EPMI and PGE twice, first at COB (Steps 2 and 3 in Table 1) and then again at PGE System (Steps 5 and 6). A ""sleeve"" is an intermediary who steps between two parties, usually because they cannot deal directly for credit or affiliate reasons. Without Avista, Steps 2-9 reduce to PGE buying from EPMI at COB and selling back to EPMI at John Day. The reason for using Avista as a sleeve may have been to move PGE's posted buy These requirements should have made PGE more vigilant and cautious in its dealings  37   from EPMI from COB to PGE System. Since PGE System is a much less active trading point than COB, the shift in posting made the deal less visible and less attractive to traders.  These points indicate that PGE was negligent in managing its trading with Enron. case for mismanagement, however, is not open-and-shut. PGE has argued that:   20  The  The error rate for its postings was 3 percent, not 65 percent. Most of the alleged errors involved a difference between the posted offer and acceptance, but in those cases the deal with Enron was still visible and available to others.    The 1999 episode shows that PGE was careful in its dealings with Enron.  In  addition, the deal proposed by EPMI in 1999 was deceptive (in that EPMI never intended to complete the scheduled transaction), but the 17 day transactions appeared legitimate.  PGE's traders were confused about the 17 day transactions, the transcripts of their conversations do not contain any clear statements that they thought the deals were illegal or improper, and their much-publicized use of terms like ""bogus"" and ""scam"" was just an expression of their frustration at having to complete a complicated transaction on a tight deadline.  20  We also believe PGE's use of its AC Intertie and IR contracts should be examined further. The AC Intertie agreement provides PGE with both northbound and southbound transmission rights. The company has reserved the northbound rights, from COB to PGE's system, for its native load customers and therefore has not offered to sell these rights under its FERC open access tariff. By using these rights in the Death Star transactions (Step 4 in Table 1), PGE may have given EPMI preferential access to its transmission assets. In effect, PGE provided wheeling services to EPMI that it failed to make available to others. The IR agreement gives PGE firm transmission rights from its generating plants to its system and to the John Day substation. The agreement allows dynamic scheduling and provides PGE with non-firm flexibility. However, it prohibits third party wheeling, and PGE's use of the transmission rights on behalf of EPMI might have violated the terms of the agreement and jeopardized its continued use. According to the Bonneville Power Administration (BPA), PGE could not have violated its IR agreement because it did not use those rights to move power from its system to John Day (Step 8 in Table 1). BPA claims that it provided the transmission on an hourly non-firm point-to-point basis. PGE, however, has repeatedly stated that it used its IR contract rights, so the issue is unresolved. In testimony filed in EL02-114-000, FERC trial staff concluded that the 17 day transactions did violate provisions of the IR agreement.  38     It was well known (but undocumented) that the ISO required energy delivered at COB to sink in the Northwest before being imported back into California, and PGE had provided a similar service to an unaffiliated party on at least one occasion (to Modesto Irrigation District in early 1999) before the 17 day transactions began.    PGE's traders and managers were unaware that EPMI was running Death Star because they could not see the Mead to COB portion of the loop. The portion of the deal they saw appeared to be legitimate and earned the company a reasonable margin.    The main purpose of real-time trading was to balance PGE's loads and resources. Real-time trading was not as big a money-maker for the company as other trading activities, and the volume of Death Star trades (15 days, 2,500 MWh) was not otherwise large enough to catch management's attention.    The Avista sleeve that complicates the transaction existed only because PGE could not figure out how to post the buy-sell with EPMI otherwise.    Even if the 17 day transactions were part of a Death Star strategy, customers were not harmed and may in fact have benefited.  PGE argues that it did not knowingly participate in Death Star, and there is, in fact, no direct evidence at this point that it knew the purpose of the transactions. The mismanagement case, however, does not rest on PGE knowing that the 17 day transactions were illegal. Instead, it is based on the argument that the company should have looked more carefully at the deal EPMI brought to it. Furthermore, while PGE may now argue that its posting requirement is vague and that it met the intent of the requirement in almost all cases, we are not aware that it has any response to the argument that the company mismanaged the task of ensuring that it posted its trades in accordance with the terms of its FERC tariff.  39   PacifiCorp Nothing in PacifiCorp's response in FERC's Fact-Finding Investigation suggests that the company violated any FERC or OPUC requirements for dealings with affiliates. The company admitted to Export of California Power, but we are not aware of any tariff it violated 21  and its Oregon customers probably benefited from the transactions.  22  FERC  investigative staff believes that other PacifiCorp trades may have violated the ISO and PX tariffs, but FERC has not directed the company to respond. A FERC finding that the company violated the ISO or PX tariffs would be evidence of misconduct. However, we do not have enough information at this time to determine whether the company engaged in misconduct or mismanaged its trading activities.  Idaho Power Idaho Power has denied involvement in any of the Enron trading strategies. FERC investigative staff argues that some of Idaho Power's bidding and trading activities violated the ISO and PX tariffs, but FERC has not directed the company to respond. A FERC finding that Idaho Power violated the ISO or PX tariffs would be evidence of misconduct. The affiliate issues that Idaho Power reported to and then settled with FERC appear to be unrelated to the Enron strategies. However, the company's admission in the settlement that it violated certain affiliate requirements indicates that it may have engaged in misconduct or mismanaged its trading activities. We do not have enough information at this time to determine the effect of these violations on Idaho Power retail rates or to know why the violations occurred.  FERC staff's Final Report in the Fact-Finding Investigation does not cite Export of California Power as a potential violation of the ISO and PX tariffs. 22 Oregon customers were exposed to excess power costs through a deferral mechanism beginning November 1, 2000.  21  40   5. Recommendations for Commission Action  We present one overall recommendation and then one recommendation for each of the three utilities.  Overall Recommendation Affirm that the Commission will hold customers harmless for any penalties imposed by FERC or any other authority.  PGE Based on the available evidence, we believe that a formal investigation of PGE's trading activity in 2000-01 is warranted and that parties should be allowed to argue before the Commission whether PGE is guilty of misconduct and/or mismanagement. The key question in deciding how to proceed is whether to wait for FERC to complete its investigations into possible tariff violations by PGE. Commission action. Option 1: Open a two-stage proceeding now on PGE's trading activity in 2000-01. The first stage would be a formal investigation under ORS 756.515 to determine whether PGE is guilty of misconduct and/or mismanagement. The second stage, if needed, would determine what relief is appropriate. Under Option 1, parties would be allowed early in the first stage of the proceeding to argue for expanding the scope of the investigation beyond the 17 day transactions and the posting violations. A party could make its case in two ways. The first is to introduce We present three options for  41   evidence of other possible misconduct by PGE that is produced if FERC issues the show cause orders requested by its staff. Second, a party could identify trading practices it considers illegal and propose ways to screen or sort PGE's trading data to determine whether the company engaged in those practices (like PGE did to search for Death Star transactions). PGE would be able to respond to the parties' proposals. If FERC declines to issue the show cause orders or otherwise limits the scope of its further investigation of the Enron trading strategies, PGE might argue that FERC has concluded that certain trading activities are legal and therefore that they should not be addressed in the OPUC's proceeding. The company could also argue that the The proposed screens are impractical or not likely to reveal new information.  Commission would then decide whether to consider evidence from any new FERC show cause proceeding or require PGE to conduct any of the screens. We believe this scoping step can be completed within 90 days after the start of the investigation. Parties would then be able to develop evidence (through data requests, for example) on the trading activities included in the scope of the proceeding. We believe the opportunity to argue for expanding the scope of the investigation beyond the 17 days and the posting violations should be limited in this way because substantial work has already been done by FERC staff and others to identify PGE involvement in illegal trades. FERC trial staff in EL02-114-000 listened to tapes and followed up with data requests on 20 other days of trades and found no evidence that PGE participated in other Death Star deals or in any of the other Enron trading strategies. Similarly, the depositions of PGE traders we participated in revealed no further PGE involvement in the Enron strategies. FERC investigative staff has issued its Final Report on the Enron trading strategies, and FERC itself will decide soon whether to issue show cause orders. As a result, we do not believe that open-ended discovery, e.g., demanding and then reviewing tapes or transcripts of all PGE trader conversations in 2000-01, would be productive. With the exception noted below, the scope of the investigation should not be expanded unless FERC pursues other potential tariff violations or a more focused search for trading practices the Commission considers illegal uncovers further PGE involvement.  42   The exception is that if Tim Belden (or any other Enron trader) provides evidence that PGE participated in other allegedly illegal trading practices, then the Commission would again consider expanding the scope of the investigation. As noted above, Belden is very knowledgeable about EPMI's trading with PGE but has not been available for questioning. We will continue our efforts to question him. Since we cannot be sure when parties will have access to Belden, we recommend that the ability to ask to expand the scope of the investigation based on his comments not be limited to the 90day period outlined above. The first stage of the proceeding should have a firm end date, that would be allowed to slip only if solid evidence of additional PGE participation in illegal trading strategies surfaces (through disclosures by Belden, for example) and requires further investigation. We suggest an end date 90 days after FERC issues its decision in its PGE investigation (EL02-114-000). The presiding judge in the case intends to issue an initial decision in mid-December. We expect a FERC ruling shortly thereafter. If the Commission concludes in the first stage of the proceeding that PGE engaged in misconduct and/or mismanaged its trading activities, then a second stage to consider relief would begin. If PGE is guilty of misconduct, we recommend that the Commission decide early in the second stage the nature of the relief it believes is appropriate, since some of the options would require further discovery and analysis to apply. There appear to be two options for dealing with misconduct. First, the Commission could choose to reduce rates in a rate case for the harm going forward caused by the specific transactions that constitute the misconduct. Second, if the misconduct is based on a FERC finding that PGE gave EPMI undue preference, the Commission could find that PGE violated Condition 15 (no preferential access for affiliates) of the Enron merger stipulation and go to court for the associated fines. The first of these options would require further work to determine the effect of specific transactions on PGE customers.  43   If PGE is guilty of mismanagement, some discovery on management compensation included in rates might be necessary. Once the Commission has any information it needs on the effects of mismanagement or on management compensation, it would pursue the appropriate rate reduction for customers through a general rate case under ORS 756.515. Option 2: Open a two-stage proceeding now to address whether PGE mismanaged its trading activities in 2000-01. Delay any decision on a misconduct case until FERC completes its investigations. It may be inefficient to open a misconduct case now (as proposed in Option 1) and expand and contract its scope as FERC makes decisions in its various cases. Any misconduct case will most likely be based on a FERC decision that PGE violated tariff requirements. Option 2, therefore, addresses mismanagement now but delays any misconduct case until FERC finishes its work. The first stage of the mismanagement case would develop evidence that PGE failed to post its trades with EPMI properly and that it should have questioned the 17 day transactions more closely. Since PGE could be guilty of mismanagement even if it did not violate its tariffs, the case could proceed before FERC completes its investigations. With the record developed in EL02-114-000, we believe that the investigation into possible mismanagement could be conducted expeditiously. If the Commission finds that PGE mismanaged its trading activities, the second stage of the proceeding would address relief, e.g., a potential rate reduction to reflect a lower quality of management and lower compensation for it going forward. The Commission could pursue a rate reduction through a rate case initiated under ORS 756.515. Option 3: Delay any decision on opening a formal investigation of possible misconduct or mismanagement by PGE until FERC completes its proceedings.  44   As explained above for Option 2, it may make sense to delay any misconduct case until FERC wraps up its investigations. The FERC proceedings may also provide evidence of possible mismanagement beyond the instances of the 17 day transactions and the posting errors. Further evidence of misconduct may itself be considered evidence of mismanagement. Option 3, therefore, delays any Commission action on possible misconduct or mismanagement by PGE. Recommendation While we believe there is a prima facie case that PGE mismanaged its trading activities with EPMI, we recommend the Commission pursue Option 3. Since the process for a misconduct or mismanagement case--a formal investigation and possibly a general rate case--would be complicated and time-consuming, we believe it would be more efficient for the Commission to hold off on any PGE investigation until FERC completes the FactFinding Investigation and PGE case (EL02-114-000). At that point, the Commission would have the full record of FERC's findings available in considering and undertaking a misconduct or mismanagement case. An investigation could more likely proceed without mid-course corrections to account for continuing developments at FERC. We propose to provide the Commission a status report on the FERC case at the end of the year, shortly after the initial decision in EL02-114-000 is scheduled for release.  PacifiCorp Recommendation Delay any decision on opening a formal proceeding on possible misconduct or mismanagement by PacifiCorp until FERC completes its Fact-Finding Investigation. Discussion We limited our review for this report to information available from PacifiCorp's response to FERC's May 8, 2002 request. As noted above, we cannot determine from this information whether the company engaged in misconduct or mismanaged its trading  45   activities. We believe the Commission should wait until it has the benefit of FERC's findings (if any) on PacifiCorp before deciding whether to open an investigation. In the meantime, we plan to obtain further information from PacifiCorp (e.g., through informal data requests and meetings), mainly with respect to the ""Transmission Transactions."" We also propose to report back to the Commission within 60 days of the close of the Fact-Finding Investigation with a recommendation on how to proceed with PacifiCorp. If the Fact-Finding Investigation is not completed by the end of 2003 (at least with respect to PacifiCorp), we will provide a status report at that time.  Idaho Power Recommendation Delay any decision on opening a formal proceeding on possible misconduct or mismanagement by Idaho Power until FERC completes its Fact-Finding Investigation. Discussion Idaho Power has admitted to violations of FERC requirements for affiliate transactions, so there are grounds for opening a formal investigation into possible misconduct and mismanagement by the company. However, we believe it would be more efficient for the Commission to put off a decision on opening an investigation until FERC completes its review of the company's trading activities in the Fact-Finding Investigation. While that case proceeds, we will obtain further information from Idaho Power about the affiliate transactions covered by its settlement with FERC. We will to report back to the Commission within 60 days of the close of the Fact-Finding Investigation with a recommendation on how to proceed with Idaho Power. If the Fact-Finding Investigation is not completed by the end of 2003 (at least with respect to Idaho Power), we will provide a status report at that time.  46"

Massey, and Nora Mead Brownell.  Investigation of Terms and Conditions of Public Utility Market-Based Rate Authorizations  Docket Nos. EL01-118-000 and EL01-118-001  ORDER SEEKING COMMENTS ON PROPOSED REVISIONS TO MARKET-BASED RATE TARIFFS AND AUTHORIZATIONS (Issued June 26, 2003) 1. In an order dated November 20, 2001, the Commission, acting pursuant to Section 206 of the Federal Power Act (FPA),1 proposed to condition all new and existing marketbased rate tariffs and authorizations to include a provision prohibiting the seller from engaging in anticompetitive behavior or the exercise of market power.2 This market behavior standard, we indicated, was intended to establish a clear benchmark governing market participant conduct, with the penalties for violations clearly spelled out. 2. Commenters in this proceeding argued that the Commission's proposed tariff provision was overly-proscriptive or vague and would, if implemented, create uncertainty in the marketplace. Others argued that the tariff provision did not go far enough in protecting against the unjust and unreasonable rates that may result from anticompetitive behavior or the exercise of market power. To address these concerns, Commission Staff convened a public conference in this proceeding to determine whether, and how, the tariff provision proposed in the November 20 Order could, or should, be modified. 3. In the meantime, in conjunction with its investigation of the Western energy markets, in Docket No. PA02-2-000, Commission Staff issued its Final Report on Price  1  16 U.S.C.  824e (2000). 97 FERC  61,220 (2001) (November 20 Order).  2   20030626-3041 Issued by FERC OSEC 06/26/2003 in Docket#: EL01-118-000  Docket No. EL01-118-000, et al.  -2-  Manipulation in Western Markets (Western Markets Report).3 Among other things, Staff recommended that the Commission condition all electric market-based rate tariffs and authorizations (and all natural gas blanket marketing certificates) to prohibit a number of specifically-enumerated transactions and market behaviors. Staff also recommended that the Commission provide for the imposition of penalties for violations of these market behavior rules. 4. Since our November 20 Order, the Commission has been informed not only by the comments received from the public in this proceeding, but also by what we have learned about the types of behavior that occurred in the Western markets during 2000 and 2001. We also have gained additional experience in other competitive markets, particularly those with organized spot markets in the East. 5. As part of our ongoing responsibility to provide regulatory safeguards to ensure that customers are protected from potential market abuses, we believe it is important to take steps within our statutory authority that balance three goals: first, the need to provide for effective remedies on behalf of customers in the event anticompetitive behavior or other market abuses occur; second, the need to provide clearly-delineated ""rules of the road"" to market-based rate sellers while, at the same time, not impairing the Commission's ability to provide remedies for market abuses whose precise form and nature cannot be envisioned today; and third, the need to provide reasonable bounds within which conditions on market conduct will be implemented, so as not to create unlimited regulatory uncertainty for individual market participants or harm to the marketplace in general. A stable marketplace with clearly defined rules benefits both customers and market participants and creates an environment that will attract muchneeded capital. 6. Based on these three objectives, we propose to modify the tariff provision set forth in the November 20 Order by identifying more precisely and comprehensively than we did in the November 20 Order the transactions and practices that would be prohibited under sellers' market-based rate tariffs and authorizations. We propose six specific rules relating to: (1) unit operation; (2) market manipulation; (3) communications;  Final Report on Price Manipulation in Western Markets: Fact-Finding Investigation of Potential Manipulation of Electric and Natural Gas Prices, Docket No. PA02-2-000 (March 2003). The Western Markets Report is available on the Commission's website.  3   20030626-3041 Issued by FERC OSEC 06/26/2003 in Docket#: EL01-118-000  Docket No. EL01-118-000, et al.  -3-  (4) reporting; (5) record retention; and (6) related tariffs.4 Should a seller be found to have engaged in the transactions or behavior prohibited under our proposed market behavior rules, it would be subject to disgorgement of unjust profits obtained in contravention of the seller's tariff, and appropriate non-monetary remedies such as revocation of seller's market-based rate authority and revisions to seller's code of conduct. We seek comments on these proposed market behavior rules and related matters, as discussed below.5 7. The balance struck in formulating these proposed market behavior rules has presented a difficult task. We have been required to make judgments, for example, which necessarily include trade-offs  between broad and unlimited rights of parties to allege violations and obtain financial remedies, on the one hand, while at the same time providing transaction finality to sellers and the market in general. While our proposal represents our best judgment of the proper balance between these competing interests, we hope and expect that, in addition to the specifics of our proposal, commenters will fully address whether we have achieved the appropriate balance. 8. We also note that the market behavior rules we are proposing would apply to any market-based sale, whether in the bilateral market or in an organized market, i.e., in the markets administered by a regional transmission organization (RTO) or by an independent system operator (ISO). These market behavior rules would be intended to complement any RTO or ISO tariff conditions and market rules that may apply to sellers in these markets.  In a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking being issued today, in Docket No. RM0310-000, we are also proposing, consistent with the recommendations made by Staff in the Western Markets Report, to modify natural gas market blanket certificates under subpart G of Part 284 of the Commission's regulations, to contain many of the standards proposed herein, where applicable. Because the proposals made herein would have the effect of revising sellers' market-based rate tariffs, and thus would not constitute an amendment to the Commission's regulations, we are proposing to proceed in this forum rather than in a rulemaking proceeding governed by the Administrative Procedures Act, 5 U.S.C.  553 (2000). However, in doing so, we are mindful of the generic effect that our proposal will have on the industry as a whole, and the importance of seeking full public input regarding our proposal. In this regard, we seek comments from all interested entities on a broad range of issues, as discussed below, and are directing that this order be published in the Federal Register. 5  4   20030626-3041 Issued by FERC OSEC 06/26/2003 in Docket#: EL01-118-000  Docket No. EL01-118-000, et al. Background The November 20 Order  -4-  9. In the November 20 Order, we instituted a proceeding pursuant to Section 206 of the FPA, in which we proposed to condition our grant of market-based rate authority to public utilities that sell electric energy and ancillary services at wholesale in interstate commerce, by expressly prohibiting sellers from engaging in anticompetitive behavior or abuses of market power.6 We found that the implementation of this market behavior standard was made necessary, in part, by the lessons learned from the California energy crisis and our on-going investigation of that market in the California Refund Proceeding.7 10. In a series of orders issued in the California Refund Proceeding, we had determined, prior to our issuance of the November 20 Order, that the electric market structure and market rules for wholesale sales of electric energy in California were seriously flawed, and that these market flaws had created an environment ripe for anticompetitive conduct and the abuse of market power. We noted in the November 20 Order that as a response, we had, among other things, established market behavior conditions applicable to the Western markets, including refund liability, on sellers' market-based rate authority to prevent anticompetitive bidding behavior.8  The November 20 Order proposed to include the following provision in all market-based rate tariffs and authorizations: ""As a condition of obtaining and retaining market-based rate authority, the seller is prohibited from engaging in anticompetitive behavior or the exercise of market power. The seller's market-based rate authority is subject to refunds or other remedies as may be appropriate to address any anticompetitive behavior or exercise of market power."" See November 20 Order, 97 FERC at 61,976. See, e.g., San Diego Gas & Electric Company v. Sellers of Energy and Ancillary Service, et al., 97 FERC  61,275 (2001).

In the November 20 Order, however, we also noted that this potential for market manipulation was not limited to the California market.9 In fact, the potential for market abuse and the exercise of market power may exist in any region where the evolution towards a competitive market is not yet complete; or where the design structure of the market is otherwise ill-equipped to promote competition; or where the supply/demand imbalance causes the market to be in disequilibrium.10 In the November 20 Order, therefore, we proposed to apply to all public utilities authorized to sell energy and ancillary services at market-based rates, the same conditions we had applied to marketbased rate sellers in the western markets. Hearing Procedures and Responsive Pleadings 12. The November 20 Order established paper hearing procedures to address the Commission's proposed tariff provision, with interested entities invited to file comments and reply comments. Numerous responsive pleadings were filed. In addition, a public conference was convened in this proceeding on March 11, 2002, to discuss issues raised in the comments and reply comments. Comments on the technical conference were filed on March 22, 2002. Staff's Investigation of Market Manipulation in the Western Markets 13. Commission Staff addressed a broad range of market power issues and the need for market behavior rules, in its investigation of the Western energy markets, in Docket No. PA02-2-000.11 In Staff's Initial Report, issued in August 2002, Staff made a number of findings regarding, among other things, the possible misconduct by Enron Corporation (Enron) and its affiliates, and the use, by Enron and its affiliates, of the so-called Enron  9  Id. at 61,975-76.  In addition, sellers may have the opportunity to exercise market power even in markets which are typically (and on most occasions) competitive. For example, extreme supply or demand conditions to which the market cannot quickly adapt, such as the loss of significant hydropower capacity because of drought, or force majeure events such as a major transmission line outage could provide opportunities to exercise market power even in a market that is normally workably competitive. Staff's investigation was initiated pursuant to our February 13, 2002 order in Fact-Finding Investigation of Potential Manipulation of Electric and Natural Gas Prices, 98 FERC  61,165 (2002). 11  10   20030626-3041 Issued by FERC OSEC 06/26/2003 in Docket#: EL01-118-000  Docket No. EL01-118-000, et al.  -6-  trading strategies.12 These trading strategies, Staff found, included efforts to game the market in ways that were either fraudulent or otherwise anticompetitive. Moreover, Staff found that similar trading strategies were being utilized by a broad cross-section of the industry. 14. Subsequently, in the Western Markets Report, Staff recommended that the Commission condition all electric market-based rate tariffs and authorizations and all natural gas blanket marketing certificates on specific market behavior rules.13 Staff proposed that market-based rate sellers be required by their tariffs to: (1) provide complete, accurate, and honest information to any entity that publishes price indices; (2) retain all relevant data and information needed to reconstruct a published price index for a period of 3 years; (3) explicitly prohibit the use of false information as a condition for granting all market-based rate authorizations; (4) require that data sent to firms publishing price indices be provided by the risk management office of the company, not the trading desk or a trader, and be certified by the chief risk officer; (5) ban any form of prearranged wash trading and prohibit the reporting of any affiliate trading activities through industry indices; (6) require that sellers who use trading platforms use only those trading platforms that agree to provide the Commission with full access to trade reporting and order book information for the trading systems and agree to adhere to appropriate monitoring requirements; and (7) prohibit the submission of false information or the omission of material information to the Commission or to an entity such as an independent system operator, a regional transmission organization, or an approved market monitor. Discussion Procedural Issues See Initial Report on Company-Specific Separate Proceedings and Generic Reevaluations; Published Natural Gas Price Data; and Enron Trading Strategies: FactFinding Investigation of Potential Manipulation of Electric and Natural Gas Prices, Docket No. PA02-2-000 (August 2002). The Final Report also recommended that several entities participating in the California market (including Enron) be required to show cause why their authority to sell power at market-based rates should not be revoked by the Commission in light of their apparent involvement in market manipulation and gaming activities. Orders directed to these issues were subsequently issued by the Commission on March 26, 2003. See Enron Power Marketing, Inc., et al., 102 FERC  61,316 (2003); Reliant Energy Services, Inc., et al., 102 FERC  61,315 (2003). 13 12   20030626-3041 Issued by FERC OSEC 06/26/2003 in Docket#: EL01-118-000  Docket No. EL01-118-000, et al.  -7-  15. A number of entities request rehearing of the November 20 Order. However, rehearing may not be sought in this case until the Commission issues a final decision or other final order.14 Because the November 20 Order initiated an investigation and thus was not a final order, we will not consider requests for rehearing of the November 20 Order. However, we will treat these requests as comments to the degree they are relevant to our current proposal. Proposed Tariff Revisions 16. Consistent with the findings and recommendations of the Western Markets Report and the comments filed in this proceeding, we propose new market behavior rules applicable to all market-based rate tariffs and authorizations. As set forth in the Attachment to this order, these market behavior rules would prohibit market manipulation and more clearly outline sellers' responsibilities and duties with respect to communications to regulatory authorities and market operators. Should a seller be found to have engaged in the transactions or behavior prohibited under our proposed market behavior rules, it would be subject to disgorgement of unjust profits obtained in contravention of the seller's tariff, and appropriate non-monetary remedies such as revocation of seller's market-based rate authority and revisions to seller's code of conduct. 17. As noted above, in proposing these market behavior rules we have attempted to strike a careful balance. On the one hand, it is essential, for all the reasons outlined in the November 20 Order and in the Western Markets Report, that our market behavior rules be clear and enforceable. Market conduct which is anticompetitive or which constitutes an abuse of market power must be prohibited and made subject to remedial action under the circumstances outlined herein. On the other hand, transactions and practices which are consistent with the normal operation of supply, demand, and true scarcity, or which otherwise have a legitimate business purpose, should neither be discouraged nor impeded. Further, while our proposal is designed to give the Commission and interested parties an enhanced ability to undertake effective enforcement and to require appropriate remedies, we understand that market participants need some level of certainty, that is, they need to know that they will not be exposed to open-ended uncertainty. Our proposal attempts to balance these two valid concerns by proposing appropriately-tailored complaint procedures and by providing clarity regarding sellers' potential liability.15  See Rule 713 of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure, 18 C.F.R.  385.713 (2003). 15  14  See supra PP. 37-42 (complaint procedures and scope of liability).   20030626-3041 Issued by FERC OSEC 06/26/2003 in Docket#: EL01-118-000  Docket No. EL01-118-000, et al. Market Behavior Rule # 1: Unit Operation  -8-  Seller will operate and schedule generating facilities, undertake maintenance, declare outages, and commit or otherwise bid supply in a manner that complies with the rules and regulations of the applicable power market. 18. The integrity of an organized market operated by an RTO or ISO and the integrity of other markets as well, depends in part upon generators and other sellers fully and accurately providing all information to market operators and complying with market rules, particularly those relating to bidding. In Market Behavior Rule # 1, therefore, the Commission proposes to require that Sellers operate and schedule generating facilities, undertake maintenance, declare outages, and commit or otherwise bid supply in a manner that complies with the rules and regulations of the applicable power market. This requirement contemplates that sellers will follow these rules and regulations by providing complete and honest information, as may be required.16 Market Behavior Rule # 1 is consistent with our view that ex ante rules are superior to ex post regulatory action. 19. While we understand that market participants may become subject to additional requirements through tariff service agreements and other market participation agreements, we believe that a specific requirement in each seller's market-based rate tariff addressing unit operation issues is necessary in order to give the Commission and interested parties direct remedial authority for violations that may not exist without such a condition. We request comment on the inclusion of this condition in market-based tariffs. Market Behavior Rule # 2: Market Manipulation Actions or transactions without a legitimate business purpose which manipulate or attempt to manipulate market prices, market conditions, or market rules for electric energy, or result in market prices for electric energy and/or electric energy products which do not reflect the legitimate forces of supply and demand, are prohibited. Prohibited actions and transactions include, but are not limited to: (A) pre-arranged offsetting trades of the same product among the same parties, which trades involve no economic risk, and no net change in beneficial ownership (sometimes called ""wash trades""); (B) transactions predicated on submitting false  We note that EPSA, in its code of ethics and sound trading practices, has developed a standard which includes elements of Market Behavior Rule # 1.  16   20030626-3041 Issued by FERC OSEC 06/26/2003 in Docket#: EL01-118-000  Docket No. EL01-118-000, et al.  -9-  information to transmission providers or other entities responsible for operation of the transmission grid (such as inaccurate load or generation data; scheduling non-firm service or products sold as firm; or conducting ""paper trades"" where an entity falsely designates resources and fails to have those resources available and feasibly functioning); (C) transactions in which an entity first creates artificial congestion and then ""relieves"" such artificial congestion; (D) collusion with another party for the purpose of creating market prices at levels differing from those set by market forces; and (E) bidding the output of or misrepresenting the operational capabilities of generation facilities in a manner which raises market prices by withholding available supply from the market. 20. Our reliance upon competitive markets to establish just and reasonable rates requires that we have the tools necessary to ensure that prices created in these markets continue to fall within a just and reasonable zone. The tools we have relied upon include non-discriminatory transmission access, an efficient and pro-competitive wholesale market platform, and effective market monitoring and enforcement. 21. In formulating the conditions to be added to public utility sellers' tariffs, the Commission is fulfilling its obligation to appropriately monitor markets and is thus taking steps to ensure that market-based rates remain within the zone of reasonableness required by the FPA. In a market-based rate regime, this means that public utility sellers will not be permitted to exercise market power or take anti-competitive actions that may increase market prices and that the Commission will take appropriate remedial steps. Such steps may include market rules designed to prevent exercises of market power as well as conditions placed on market-based rate authorizations to prohibit conduct that adversely affects competitive market outcomes.17  The Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit has held that, while the Commission ""enjoys substantial discretion in ratemaking determinations . . . by the same token, this discretion must be bridled in accordance with the statutory mandate that the resulting rates be 'just and reasonable.'"" Farmers Union Cent. Exch. Inc. v. FERC, 747 F.2d 1486 at 1501 (D.C. Cir. 1984). In addition, the regulatory regime itself must contain some form of monitoring to ensure that rates remain within a zone of reasonableness and to check rates that depart from this zone. Id. at 1509. See also Louisiana Energy and Power Authority v. FERC, 141 F.3d 364 (D.C. Cir. 1998); Elizabethtown Gas Co. v. FERC, 10 F.3d 866 (D.C. Cir. 1993).  17   20030626-3041 Issued by FERC OSEC 06/26/2003 in Docket#: EL01-118-000  Docket No. EL01-118-000, et al.  -10-  22. Accordingly, we propose in Market Behavior Rule # 2 to prohibit activities that adversely affect competitive outcomes, that is, that result in rates that do not reflect legitimate market forces. Such rates would fall outside the zone of reasonableness.18 In making this proposal, we note that just and reasonable rates created through competitive markets is our goal. We believe that by providing further clarity concerning prohibited actions and transactions, and by undertaking judicious enforcement of these standards, we will help to enhance confidence in, and the integrity of, our jurisdictional markets for both customers and market participants. 23. In crafting Market Behavior Rule # 2, we have also attempted to provide specificity by including a non-exclusive list of prohibited activities that illustrates the types of activities that adversely affect competitive market outcomes. However, we have also included a generic standard which will allow us to take remedial action if we discover additional activities of a seller taken in contravention of our market behavior rules affecting the justness and reasonableness of rates. In the event that Staff, or a third party in a timely complaint, demonstrates that a transaction or behavior not expressly prohibited in our market behavior rules appears to be in violation of this rule (i.e., that a given transaction or behavior is causing prices to reflect outcomes not reflective of market forces), we will require the identified seller to show cause why it should not be required to disgorge unjust profits obtained through such transaction or behavior, or and be subject to appropriate non-monetary remedies. In evaluating responses to such show cause orders, we will take into account such matters as whether the seller can establish a legitimate business purpose consistent with prices set by market forces relative to its conduct.19 24. Our market behavior rules would not supersede or replace parties' rights under Section 206 of the FPA to file a complaint contending that a contract should be revised by the Commission (pursuant to either the"" just and reasonable"" or ""public interest"" test as required by the contract). Rather, any party seeking contract reformation or abrogation In prohibiting transactions such as those involving false congestion, the Commission does not intend to prohibit transactions taken consistent with market rules in ISO or RTO markets such as virtual bidding or day ahead markets where ""simulated"" congestion may be reflected in pricing as part of market design. The Commission considers a legitimate business purpose to be an action consistent with behavior in a competitive market which is taken to further a firm's business objectives without engaging in manipulative, illegal, or otherwise anticompetitive acts. Engaging in manipulation, for example, in order to maximize profits, is not a legitimate business purpose. 19 18   20030626-3041 Issued by FERC OSEC 06/26/2003 in Docket#: EL01-118-000  Docket No. EL01-118-000, et al.  -11-  based on a violation of one or more of the market behavior rules would be required to demonstrate that such a violation had a direct nexus to contract formation and tainted contract formation itself. If a jurisdictional seller enters into a contract without engaging in behavior that violates its tariff with respect to the formation of such contract, we do not intend to entertain contract abrogation complaints predicated on our market behavior rules. 25. Finally, in undertaking our enforcement decisions, we will focus on the best outcome for assuring just and reasonable rates in our jurisdictional markets. In some instances, significant remedial action may be warranted. In other instances, we may use a specific set of facts and circumstances to clarify our requirements for acceptable public utility activities. As such, it is our expectation that through this proposed tariff revision, we will appropriately balance our need to remedy anticompetitive behavior with the legitimate needs of market participants for clear rules. We seek comment on these issues and any other issues of concern relating to Market Behavior Rule # 2. Market Behavior Rule # 3: Communications Seller will provide complete, accurate, and factual information, and not submit false or misleading information, or omit material information, in any communications with the Commission, market monitors, regional transmission organizations, independent system operators, or similar entities. 26. In the Western Markets Report, Staff proposes that all market-based rate tariffs include a specific prohibition against the submission of false information or the omission of material information to the Commission or to an entity such as an ISO, an RTO, or an approved market monitor.20 27. Based on Staff's recommendation, we propose and seek comment on Market Behavior Rule # 3. Specifically, we seek comment on whether this proposed rule would be sufficient in its scope and breadth to cover any and all matters relevant to  See Western Markets Report at ES-17. In this regard, EPSA, in its code of ethics and sound trading practices, requires its members to ""provide market and transaction information to regulators and market monitors in compliance with all applicable rules and requirements and [to] continue to cooperate with regulators and market monitors as reasonably necessary to assist in their understanding of market operations.""  20   20030626-3041 Issued by FERC OSEC 06/26/2003 in Docket#: EL01-118-000  Docket No. EL01-118-000, et al.  -12-  wholesale markets, including maintenance and outage data, bid data, price and transaction information, and load and resource data. In addition, we seek comment on whether this remedial authority would serve as a useful and appropriate tool in ensuring just and reasonable rates. Market Behavior Rule # 4: Reporting To the extent Seller engages in reporting of transactions to publishers of electricity or natural gas price indices, Seller shall provide complete, accurate and factual information to any such publisher. Seller shall notify the Commission of whether it engages in such reporting for all sales. In addition, the seller shall adhere to such other standards and requirements for price reporting as the Commission may order. 28. In the Western Markets Report, Staff proposes that all tariffs and authorizations be conditioned to expressly require complete, accurate, and honest information to any entity that and to require that data sent to firms publishing price indices management office of the company, not the trading desk or a the chief risk officer.21 electric market-based rate that sellers provide publishes price indices be provided by the risk trader, and be certified by  29. Based on Staff's recommendation, we propose and seek comment on Market Behavior Rule # 4. In the Western Markets Report, Staff found that the markets for natural gas and electricity in California are inextricably linked, that there were dysfunctions in these markets that fed off each other, and that the dysfunctions in the natural gas market appear to have stemmed, at least in part, from efforts to manipulate price indices compiled by trade publications  by fabricating trades, inflating the volume of trades, omitting trades, and adjusting the price of trades.22 30. Staff further found that the predominant motives for reporting false information were to influence reported gas prices, to enhance the value of financial positions or purchase obligations, and to increase reported volumes to attract participants by Id. Similarly, EPSA, in its code of ethics and sound trading practices, requires its members to ""ensure that any information disclosed to the media, including market publications and publishers of surveys and price indices, is accurate and consistent."" Id. at III-2 (noting that, to date, five major traders  Wiliams, Dynegy, AEP, CMS, and El Paso Merchant Energy  have admitted that their employees falsified information provided to compilers of natural gas price indices). 22 21   20030626-3041 Issued by FERC OSEC 06/26/2003 in Docket#: EL01-118-000  Docket No. EL01-118-000, et al.  -13-  creating the impression of more liquid markets. In light of these findings, we seek comment on whether Market Behavior Rule # 4, as proposed, would remedy the abuses outlined by Staff in the Western Markets Report by ensuring that published price indices represent a fair and accurate measure of actual prices and trading volumes. 31. With regard to standards and requirements for price reporting, on April 24, 2003, we convened a public conference in Docket No. AD03-7-000, together with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), to consider natural gas price formation issues, including the development of alternative index formation models. At that conference and from comments submitted thereafter, we have received valuable input helping us refine the options available. To that end, we have conducted a followup conference, also with CFTC participation, for both natural gas and electricity indices. 32. While we are considering requiring jurisdictional entities to report transactions to an entity responsible for index creation, we note that our efforts towards resolution of this issue will be in Docket No. AD03-7-000. Market Behavior Rule # 4 states that sellers will be required to adhere to other standards or requirements as the Commission may order. Based upon our review of the record developed in Docket No. AD03-7-000, we may issue such an order to be implemented at the same time as the market-based tariff rules proposed herein. Market Behavior Rule # 5: Record Retention Seller will retain all data and information necessary for the reconstruction of energy or energy products prices it charges, or the prices it reports for use in published price indices, for a period of three years. 33. In the Western Markets Report, Staff recommends that all electric market-based rate tariffs and authorizations be expressly conditioned to require sellers to retain data and information needed to reconstruct a published price index for a period of three years.23  See Western Markets Report at ES-14 and III-52. EPSA, in its code of ethics and sound trading practices, requires its members to ""maintain documentation on all transactions for an appropriate period of time as required under applicable laws and regulations.""  23   20030626-3041 Issued by FERC OSEC 06/26/2003 in Docket#: EL01-118-000  Docket No. EL01-118-000, et al.  -14-  34. Based on Staff's recommendation, we propose and seek comment on Market Behavior Rule # 5. In the Western Markets Report, Staff found that companies had little, if any, formal procedures in place to ensure the accuracy of the data reported to the trade press. Staff also found that companies had reported inaccurate information. Staff found that these inaccuracies were attributable to unstructured or nonexistent processes for reporting (e.g., taking the simple arithmetic average of the high and low trades), making up trades to come up with an average that was the midpoint of the traders' perceived range, and entering fictitious trades (both prices and volumes) to replicate prices reported to trading platforms. We seek comments on whether Market Behavior Rule # 5, as proposed, would ensure that companies adopt suitable retention policies that would permit the Commission and interested entities to better monitor these transactions and practices, to the extent necessary and appropriate. Market Behavior Rule # 6: Related Tariffs Seller shall not violate or collude with another party in actions that violate Seller's code of conduct or Order No. 889 standards of conduct. 35. In the Western Markets Report, Staff found that sellers had failed to abide by their market-based rate codes of conduct and their Order No. 889 standards of conduct. These tariff provisions, among other things, require the functional separation of transmission and wholesale merchant personnel. In one case, Staff found that a power marketer used a third party to circumvent the Commission's prohibition on affiliate sales.24 36. To better monitor and deter these tariff violations, we propose and seek comment on Market Behavior Rule # 6. Specifically, we seek comment on whether the standard as proposed is sufficient in its scope and breadth to cover any and all matters relating to violations of the market-based rate codes of conduct and the Order No. 889 standards of conduct. We seek comment on whether this compliance rule would be an effective way for the Commission to better ensure that the conduct of public utilities is consistent with the public interest. Complaint Procedures and Limitations on Disgorgement Liability 37. As noted above, in crafting the market behavior rules proposed herein, we have attempted to balance our interest in providing adequate certainty for market participants  24  See also Idaho Power Company, et al. (Docket No. IN03-9-000).   20030626-3041 Issued by FERC OSEC 06/26/2003 in Docket#: EL01-118-000  Docket No. EL01-118-000, et al.  -15-  to encourage fair, robust competition, with our equal commitment to protecting customers from the abuses of market power and other anticompetitive behavior. Looking ahead, we want to formalize both our market rules and their consequences for greater market certainty. Accordingly, we further seek comment on the procedural limitations proposed below. 38. First, we propose to limit the applicability of potential disgorgement of unjust profits exposure by requiring that any violation alleged by a market-participant be made on a transaction-specific basis and that any market participant request for such a remedy be made no later than 60 days after the end of the calendar quarter in which the violation is alleged to have occurred. If a market participant can show that it did not know and should not have known of the behavior which forms the basis for the complaint, within the period proscribed above, then the 60-day period will run from the time when the market participant knew or should have known of the behavior. In addition, we propose to restrict remedies sought in market participant complaints to the specific transactions which are the subject of these complaints.25 39. For example, the backward-looking scope of remedial action due to an allegation made by a market participant concerning a violation of the behavioral rules contained in a market-based rates tariff would be limited to the period reaching to the beginning of the calendar quarter referenced above. Thus, an allegation could be made up to 60 days after March 31 of a calendar year seeking disgorgement of unjust profits for a transaction taking place in the quarter ending March 31. Any other action taken by the Commission on the basis of such allegation would be prospective only. 40. These time limits will apply to complaints initiated by market participants and not to those initiated by the Commission. The Commission has broad remedial authority to act in the event of violations of statutory or regulatory requirements or rules in applicable tariffs.26 Where there is a violation of the market behavior rules that are adopted for all new and existing market-based rate tariffs and authorizations, the Commission is proposing to retain the full scope of its authority to provide remedies upon its own motion. Thus, the Commission and its staff will not be subject to the time limitation on allegations of tariff violations. The Commission believes that this properly balances the  Such claims, moreover, would be required to comply with the Commission's revised complaint procedures in 18 C.F.R.  385.206 (2003). See Lester C. Reed v. Georgia Power Co., 94 FERC  61,100 (2001). San Diego Gas & Electric Co., 96 FERC  61,120 at 61,507-08 (2001), citing Washington Water Power Co., 83 FERC  61,282 (1998). 26  25   20030626-3041 Issued by FERC OSEC 06/26/2003 in Docket#: EL01-118-000  Docket No. EL01-118-000, et al.  -16-  interest of market participants in finality with the need to be able to take action against tariff violations. 41. Other limitations proposed by commenters in this proceeding have not been included in our proposal. For example, while several commenters have argued that sales into markets with Commission-approved market monitoring and mitigation should be exempt from any market behavior rules approved herein we are not including this limitation in our proposal. The findings made by Staff in the Western Markets Report illustrate that organized, bid-based markets, even those with approved market monitoring and mitigation procedures, remain vulnerable to anticompetitive behavior and the exercise of market power. Accordingly, Staff thus recommended that market behavior rules be adopted for all markets without exception. 42. Other commenters have suggested that entities such as power marketers and small generators should be exempted from our market behavior rules because entities such as these are unable to exercise market power in the markets in which they operate. We disagree. In the Western Markets Report, Staff found that power marketers and small generators can and have engaged in practices and transactions which our proposed market behavior rules are designed to prohibit. Accordingly, we propose to apply our market behavior rules to all sellers with market-based rate tariffs and authorizations. Additional Tariff Revisions Proposed By Staff 43. In addition to the tariff revisions discussed above, Staff, in the Western Markets Report, also proposed tariff revisions relating to a seller's use of trading platforms, based on Staff's review of Enron's trading platform, Enron Online. Staff found that Enron Online lacked transparency and was subject to manipulation by Enron.27 Accordingly, Staff recommended that future trading platforms be designed to provide a sufficient level of transparency to enable users to understand the movements of the market. Staff also recommended that the Commission condition electric power market-based rate tariffs and authorizations to require that sellers who use trading platforms use only those trading platforms that employ a ""credit change monitor,"" i.e., a monitor that could be used to evaluate unusual patterns in credit changes in the platform. Staff found that without these safeguards, the credit structure could be used to manipulate access to other traders and the perceived market price. 44. Staff also recommended conditioning electric power market-based rate tariffs and  27  See Western Markets Reports at ES-17.   20030626-3041 Issued by FERC OSEC 06/26/2003 in Docket#: EL01-118-000  Docket No. EL01-118-000, et al.  -17-  authorizations to require that sellers who use trading platforms use only those trading platforms that agree to provide the Commission with full access to trade reporting and order book information for the trading systems and agree to adhere to appropriate monitoring requirements. To the extent the Commission promulgates standards for trading platforms, the Commission is considering conditioning electric power marketbased rate sellers to use only those platforms that meet certain standards. The Commission seeks comment on this issue. We will not propose a market behavior rule relating to this recommendation at this time, however, pending our further review of this matter. Legal Authority 45. A number of commenters in this proceeding have challenged the Commission's legal authority under the FPA to condition sellers' market based rate tariffs and authorizations, as proposed in the November 20 Order. These commenters have asserted, among other things, that the potential financial consequences for sellers found to be in violation of their market-based rate tariffs, as revised, would violate the filed rate doctrine and the refund limitations set forth in Section 206(b) of FPA.28 46. For the reasons discussed below, we reject these challenges to the Commission's authority. We have initiated this proceeding under Section 206, for the purpose of examining whether sellers' market-based rate tariffs are just and reasonable, or whether, conversely, they should be revised as proposed herein. Should we determine that sellers' currently effective tariffs are unjust and unreasonable or may lead to unjust and unreasonable rates without the inclusion of the market behavior rules we propose, we will require that these tariffs be revised to include the rules prospectively, as Section 206 requires.29 Thus, these tariff revisions, if approved, would not violate the filed rate  Section 206(b) requires that any refunds made in a Section 206 proceeding initiated by the Commission on its own motion, be based on a refund effective date no earlier than 60 days after the publication by the Commission of notice of its intent to initiate such a proceeding, or, in the case of a complaint, no earlier than 60 days after the complaint was filed. Section 206(b) also limits the refund effective period to 5 months after the expiration of the such 60-day period. The Commission would intend to make the behavioral rules effective no earlier than the date of issuance of an order revising market-based rates tariffs to include new behavioral rules. 29  28   20030626-3041 Issued by FERC OSEC 06/26/2003 in Docket#: EL01-118-000  Docket No. EL01-118-000, et al.  -18-  doctrine.30 47. Nor would the refund limitations of Section 206(b) of the FPA bar the Commission from enforcing the tariff revisions proposed herein. Rather, any remedies stemming from a violation of our proposed tariff provisions would be based on the tariff conditions themselves, as approved herein. It is well settled that the Commission may take actions and impose remedies when tariffs are violated. These actions, moreover, would be fully consistent with the oversight responsibilities implicit in our market-based rates program. 48. Sellers' authorizations, in this regard, rely upon the existence of competitive markets. As illustrated by the Western Markets Report, it is possible for actions to be taken by sellers that can affect whether the prices charged in such markets are at competitive levels. Conditioning market-based rate authority to require sellers to comply with market behavior rules will help ensure that sellers do not engage in anti-competitive behavior and that just and reasonable rates will be achieved. By imposing actionable behavioral rules conditioned upon the risk of material remedial action, the Commission can further the goal of competition while protecting consumers and other market participants who do not engage in anti-competitive behavior. 49. Thus, while we are undertaking a Section 206 investigation to determine whether market-based rate tariffs must be revised to include the proposed market behavior rules to be just and reasonable, the potential remedies resulting from violations of such rules will flow from our conditioning such tariffs to provide, as a component of the tariff, a clear right for the Commission to enforce its standards and for affected parties to be compensated for violations.31 Such actions would be in the nature of a proceeding to Commenters also assert that the filed rate doctrine would be violated in this case because the behavioral standard, as proposed in the November 20 Order, failed to provide adequate notice regarding the conduct it would prohibit. However, we will not address these allegations here, given the significant revisions to the market behavior rules we propose to adopt here. In fact, the ""filed rate,"" in this case, would include a set of specific behavioral standards voluntarily accepted by the seller, the meaning and intent of which will be fully aired in this proceeding. In addition, the filed rate would make explicit that any violation of our market behavior rules would potentially result in financial consequences, as discussed herein. Under these circumstances, our market behavior rules would provide the necessary predictability required by the filed rate doctrine. 31 30  We imposed a similar obligation, pursuant to our conditioning authority, in the (continued...)   20030626-3041 Issued by FERC OSEC 06/26/2003 in Docket#: EL01-118-000  Docket No. EL01-118-000, et al.  -19-  determine whether there has been a tariff violation, not a complaint that rates, terms or conditions were unjust and unreasonable under Section 206. 50. The Commission has ample authority to condition market-based rate tariffs in this fashion.32 Here, these conditions are both necessary and appropriate to ensure that rates charged by sellers in the wholesale market will be based on, and influenced by, competitive factors. We do not intend for these tariff provisions to supercede or replace in any way any party or the Commission's rights under Section 206 to file a compliant asserting that any rates, term or condition or service are unjust and unreasonable and requires revision as we are proposing with market-based tariffs herein. 51. Finally, we reject commenters' assertion that the initiation of a rulemaking proceeding would be required to implement the tariff provisions proposed in this proceeding. As we noted above, the Commission is making its proposed revisions to sellers' market-based rate authorizations in this proceeding, because these proposals would embody tariff revisions applicable to individual sellers, not rule changes. As we also noted, however, we are taking this action in the context of an investigation with comment procedures designed to implement full public input. The Commission, moreover, is not limited to notice and comment rulemaking in developing policy. Agencies generally are permitted considerable discretion to choose whether to proceed by rulemaking or by adjudication. Our decision to act in this proceeding pursuant to Section 206 is clearly within our authority. Comment Procedures 52. We will provide interested entities an opportunity to file comments and reply 31  (...continued) California Refund Proceeding. See San Diego Gas & Electric Company v.

In fact, nothing in the Regulatory Fairness Act (RFA) (modifying FPA Section 206) or its legislative history suggests that Congress intended to address or limit the Commission's authority to condition market-based rate authorizations. Congress passed the RFA, which established the 15-month refund effective period, to give the Commission authority to order rate reductions for the period before the conclusion, but after the start, of Section 206 proceedings.

Unit Operation: Seller will operate and schedule generating facilities, undertake maintenance, declare outages, and commit or otherwise bid supply in a manner that complies with the rules and regulations of the applicable power market. Market Manipulation: Actions or transactions without a legitimate business purpose which manipulate or attempt to manipulate market prices, market conditions, or market rules for electric energy and/or energy products, or result in market prices for electric energy and/or electric energy products which do not reflect the legitimate forces of supply and demand, are prohibited. Prohibited actions and transactions include, but are not limited to: A. pre-arranged offsetting trades of the same product among the same parties, which trades involve no economic risk and no net change in beneficial ownership (sometimes called ""wash trades""); transactions predicated on submitting false information to transmission providers or other entities responsible for operation of the transmission grid (such as inaccurate load or generation data; scheduling non-firm service or products sold as firm; or conducting ""paper trades"" where an entity falsely designates resources and fails to have those resources available and feasibly functioning); transactions in which an entity first creates artificial congestion and then ""relieves"" such artificial congestion; collusion with another party for the purpose of creating market prices at levels differing from those set by market forces; and bidding the output of or misrepresenting the operational capabilities of generation facilities in a manner which raises market prices by withholding available supply from the market.  2.

Reporting: To the extent Seller engages in reporting of transactions to publishers of electricity or natural gas price indices, Seller shall provide complete, accurate and factual information to any such publisher. Seller shall notify the Commission of whether it engages in such reporting for all sales. In addition, the seller shall adhere to such other standards and requirements for price reporting as the Commission may order. Record Retention: Seller will retain all data and information necessary for the reconstruction of the electric energy or electric energy products prices it charges or of the prices it reports for use in published price indices for a period of three years.

UNITED STATES OF AMERICA FEDERAL ENERGY REGULATORY COMMISSION Investigation of Terms and Conditions of Public Utility Market-Based Rate Authorizations  -24-  Docket Nos. EL01-118-000 and EL01-118-001  (Issued June 26, 2003) MASSEY, Commissioner, concurring in part: I wholeheartedly support conditions to all market-based tariffs that declare manipulation off limits. Such outrageous behavior has cast a pall over the promise of energy markets and has brought some companies to dire financial straits. These tariff conditions should deter bad behavior in the future. If they fail to do so, then at least the Commission will have industry wide legal tools to provide appropriate remedies. I commend Chairman Wood's strong leadership in developing this proposal. I am writing separately to express my concern with one aspect of today's proposal. I would not limit the monetary penalty for tariff violations to disgorgement of unjust profits. Market manipulation can raise the market prices paid by all market participants and collected by all sellers. The Federal Power Act requires that all rates and charges be just and reasonable. Where the market has been manipulated so as to affect the market price, that price is not just and reasonable and is therefore unlawful. Simply requiring that bad actors disgorge their individual profits does not make the market whole because all sellers received the unlawful price caused by the manipulation. The narrow remedy of profit disgorgement is not an adequate remedy for the adverse effect of the bad behavior on the market price, and may not be an adequate deterrent to future behavior. The appropriate remedy may be that the manipulating seller makes the market whole.33 Unfortunately, today's order appears to take this remedy off of the table. I would prefer to tailor the remedy to the circumstances of each case. I encourage comments on this issue. For these reasons, I concur in part with today's order.  The Commission has accepted the make the market whole remedy as part of a settlement for withholding generation from the California PX market. See 102 FERC  61,108 (2003).  33   20030626-3041 Issued by FERC OSEC 06/26/2003 in Docket#: EL01-118-000  William L. Massey Commissioner   20030626-3041 Issued by FERC OSEC 06/26/2003 in Docket#: EL01-118-000  UNITED STATES OF AMERICA FEDERAL ENERGY REGULATORY COMMISSION  Investigation of Terms and Conditions of Public Utility Market-Based Rate Authorizations  Docket Nos. EL01-118-000 and EL01-118-001  (Issued June 26, 2003)  BROWNELL, Commissioner, concurring: 1. Today we issue an order proposing to place conditions on sellers of power that have been granted market based rate authority. This proposal, coming 18 months after the Commission first launched the idea of conditioning sellers' market-based rate authorities, builds on industry events of the last few years. I have spoken about the need for the ""10 commandments"" and am encouraged that we are taking this step. Importantly, the proposal attempts to balance three goals:    effective remedies on behalf of customers in the event anti-competitive behavior or other market abuses occur; clearly delineated ""rules of the road"" to market-based rate sellers while, at the same time, not impairing the Commission's ability to provide remedies for market abuses whose precise form and nature cannot be envisioned today; and, reasonable bounds within which conditions on market conduct will be implemented so as not to create unlimited regulatory uncertainty for individual market participants or harm to the marketplace in general.      2. I appreciate the need to balance these goals but have a fundamental concern that we've allowed markets to form without a full appreciation of what constitutes a market let alone the market dynamics that foster a truly competitive market. For example, what defines a competitive market and what constitutes scarcity pricing? These questions remain largely unanswered. I also fear that as the precise definition of manipulation develops over time, we will end up with overly proscriptive ""rules of the road"" that will dampen innovative, legitimate business tools. Finally, I am concerned about the applicability of behavioral rules to only one market segment - sellers. This troubles me equitable rules should apply to all industry segments. I encourage and look forward to   20030626-3041 Issued by FERC OSEC 06/26/2003 in Docket#: EL01-118-000  Docket No. EL01-118-000, et al.  27 2  -27-  meaningful comments from all market segments. If we've learned nothing else, we've learned that rules are critical.

GX263-75-3657602	1/I/f I  VERMONT ENVIRONMENTAL BOARD 10 V.S.A. Chapter 151 Re: Cabot Creamery Cooperative, Inc. Application #5 WO870- 13-EB  ENVWI  I II //  SUPPLEMENTAL MEMORANDUM OF DECISION This decision pertains to preliminary issues raised in an appeal of a permit issued for land application of dairy processing wastewater and washwater resulting from the operation of a cheese production plant located in Cabot.  II!!  I.  BACKGROUND The background of this matter is set forth in the Environmental Board's decision issued December 23, 1992. That decision addressed various preliminary issues, is supplemented and revised by today's decision, and is incorporated by reference. The December 23 decision discussed but did not decide a petition by Richard Scheiber (the Appellant) for party status and therefore appeal rights with respect to 10 V.S.A. 8 6086(a)(9)(K) (public investments and facilities). The decision stated that the Board would deliberate further on the Appellant's request and issue a supplemental memorandum of decision.  Ii / /I :I 1:  /  !  The Board deliberated on December 30 by teleconference call. Members 1 participating were Chair Elizabeth Courtney, Ferdinand Bongartz, Terry Ehrich, {I Lixi Fortna, Arthur Gibb, Samuel Lloyd, and William Martinez. Chair Courtney i !i and Members Bongartz and Ehrich voted in favor of granting the Appellant party :j `1 status and appeal rights on Criterion 9(K). Members Fortna, Gibb, Lloyd, and / Martinez voted against such a grant. Accordingly, pursuant to 1 V.S.A. 9 172 and ;I i 10 V.S.A. 9 6021(a), the Appellant's request fails for lack of a majority (five ii members) of the Board. Since the District #5 Commission denied the Appellant party status on Criterion 9(K), that denial stands. The results of the Board's deliberation were orally communicated to the Appellant and the Applicant on January 4, 1993. Ii On January 4, 1993, the Appellant filed a motion to alter and clarify the Board's decision of December 23, 1992. Also on that date, Jessica Miller filed a memorandum seeking clarification of that decision. On January 7, Ms. Miller filed a memorandum further explaining her earlier memorandum and a request for party status on Criterion 9(K). On January 8, the Appellant filed a memorandum asking the Board to reconsider his request for party status on Criterion 9(K) and to delay taking evidence until a ninth Board member is  I  . -.  ,   Cabot Creamery Cooperative, Inc. Supplemental Memorandum of Decision Application #5W0870-13-EB Pape 2 appointed. Also on that date, the Applicant filed a Memorandum in Response to Submissions of Richard Scheiber and Jessica Miller and in Support of Motion to Alter. On January 12, 1993, the Appellant and Ms. Miller filed additional submissions. On January 14, the Applicant filed a Memorandum Requesting Extension of Deadline for Filing of Prefiled Testimony and Responding to Party Status Request of Jessica Miller. The Board deliberated by teleconference call on January 14 and January 19.' DECISION  I4  I/  The issues raised by the various submissions made since the December 23 decision, and our decisions concerning them, are as follows: A. Reconsideration of the Elements of Collateral EstoDDel  The Applicant asks us to reconsider the conclusion in our December 23 decision that the elements of collateral estoppel are met by that portion of this application which seeks to delete a condition in a prior permit requiring the Applicant to construct a waste treatment facility. The Applicant contends that a i! permit amendment is always allowed for a substantial change in a permitted project. During our January 14 deliberation, we unanimously declined to reconsider our conclusion that the elements of collateral estoppel are met. Board Rule 34 requires a permit amendment for a substantial or material change in a permitted project but does not state that all such changes must be allowed. If the doctrine of collateral estoppel, which encourages finality in judicial and administrative litigation, is to have any meaning, it must operate to bar some substantial and material changes to permitted projects. We discuss immediately below what types of change should be allowed. '  `The Board initially was scheduled to deliberate during a meeting which took place on January 13 but decided not to do so because, due to a heavy snowstorm on that date, only five members were able to attend the meeting, and three members unable to attend had participated in the December 23 decision.   /i , I  Cabot Creamery Cooperative, Inc. Supplemental Memorandum of Decision Application #SW0870-13-EB Page 3 B. Reconsideration of Additional Burden of Proof  All parties ask us to reconsider and clarify an additional burden of proof placed on the Applicant in our December 23 decision as a condition of waiving the doctrine of collateral estoppel. During our January 19 deliberation, we reconsidered the additional burden of proof. We conclude that the Applicant is required to show, during the evidentiary hearings scheduled in this matter, that certain types of changes have occurred and that the current application is a direct outgrowth of such changes. The allowable types of changes are-those that preclude the need for, or construction of, a waste treatment facility. Such changes may consist only of: (a) changes in factual or regulatory circumstances beyond the control of the Applicant; (b) changes in the construction or operation of its cheese production plant, not reasonably foreseeable at the time the Permit was issued; or (c) improvements in technology or treatment methodology for dairy wastes. r These limitations are necessary to uphold the finality of Act 250 decisions while at the same time allowing some flexibility in the Act 250 process. Thus, the limitations seek to ensure that collateral estoppel is waived only where changes occur that are beyond an applicant's control or based on good faith actions, and not based on applicant's desire to do away with a condition which it simply does not wish to fulfill. In this regard, we do not believe that a permissible change can include the Applicant's desire merely to delete the condition requiring a waste treatment facility, without the justifications described above, because that effectively would mean that conditions can always be re-litigated. Our December 23 decision included language regarding comparing the impacts of a waste treatment facility with the impacts of the proposed project before us. However, in that decision, we also noted that the District Commission had not approved a final design for that facility. Thus, the referenced comparison is not practical and we will delete such discussion from the decision. Pursuant to our reconsideration of the additional burden of proof imposed in the December 23 decision, we issue revised pages 11 through 13 to that decision In addition, in response to a request made by the Appellant, we clarify that the proof shall be made to us through testimony offered during the hearings scheduled in this matter for February 24 and 25, 1993, and that we will decide  // t   Cabot Creamery Cooperative, Inc. Supplemental Memorandum of Decision Application #5 W0870-13-EB Page 4 whether the burden has been met. However, we will not require the Applicant to meet its additional burden of proof prior to taking testimony on whether the criteria at issue are met. Instead, we will take all testimony at the same time.  C.  Party Status on Criterion 9(K)  The Appellant asks us to reconsider his request for party status on Criterion 9(K). During our January 14 deliberation, we decided not to reconsider that request because such reconsideration will not result in a change to our vote of December 30. Accordingly, pursuant to our vote of that date, the District Commission's decision on this issue stands, and Criterion 9(K) is dismissed from the Appellant's appeal for lack of party status. During our January 14 deliberation, we also decided to deny Ms. Miller's request for party status on that criterion. As evidenced by the District Commission's final decision on this application, Ms. Miller had party status before the District Commission only on Criterion 8 (aesthetics) and did not seek party status before the District Commission on Criterion 9(K). She also did not file an appeal with respect to Criterion 9(K) within 30 days pursuant to 10 V.S.A. 0 6089(a). Moreover, while the Appellant did timely file an appeal with respect to that criterion, the criterion is no longer part of his appeal. Even if it were, Ms. Miller's party status request would be untimely under Board Rule 14(B)(2) because it was not made on or before the date of the prehearing conference held in this matter on November 2, 1992. D. Delav of Taking Evidence/Filing Prefiled Testimonv  The issues discussed below were decided during our January 19 deliberation. The Appellant asks us to delay taking evidence because there are presently only eight members appointed to the Board. The Board does consist of nine members. 10 V.S.A. 8 6021(a). Presently the ninth seat is vacant and the Governor is considering who should fill it. However, under 1 V.S.A. 9 172, only five members of the Board are required for a quorum, and we will proceed with the hearings as scheduled.   I  #+-  Cabot Creamery Cooperative, Inc. Supplemental Memorandum of Decision Application #5 W0870-13-EB Page 5 The Applicant requests that we allow more time for filing prefiled testimony. Our December 23 decision set a deadline of January 22, 1993 for filing such testimony. In view of the timing of today's decision and the changes we are making to the Applicant's additional burden of proof, the schedule for filings before the hearing is revised in accordance with the order below. ORDER 1. The Applicant's request to reconsider the applicability of the elements of collateral estoppel is denied. 2. The requests of the Appellant and the Applicant to reconsider the additional burden of proof imposed on the Applicant are granted. On reconsideration, the Board issues revised pages 11 through 13 to its December 23 decision (enclosed). To the extent that parties request alterations in that decision different from the alterations the Board is actually making, said requests are denied. 3. The Appellant's requests regarding clarification of how and when the Applicant's burden of proof shall be met, and who shall decide whether it is met, are granted as discussed above. 4. The Appellant's request that the Board require the Applicant to meet its additional burden of proof prior to taking evidence on the application's compliance with the Act 250 criteria is denied. The Appellant's request that the Board reconsider his petition for 5. party status on Criterion 9(K) is denied. Criterion 9(K) is dismissed from this appeal for lack of party status. 6. Jessica Miller's petition for party status on Criterion 9(K) is denied.  7. The Appellant's request that the Board delay the taking of evidence in this appeal until a ninth member is appointed is denied. 8. The Applicant's request to change the dates for filing testimony is granted as follows: a. P  The deadline contained in paragraph 4 of the November 10, 1992 prehearing order is extended to February 4, 1993.   Cabot Creamery Cooperative, inc. Supplemental Memorandum of Decision Application #5 WO870- 13-EB Page 6 b. C.  The deadline contained in paragraph 5 of the November 10, 1992 prehearing order is extended to February 18, 1993. The deadline contained in paragraph 6 of the November 10, 1992 prehearing report is changed to February 18, 1993, and modified to apply only to objections to initial prefiled testimony. Objections to prefiled rebuttal testimony may be made orally during the hearings scheduled for February 24 and 25, 1993.

On  February 15, 2002, a       letter was issued to Enron  [TIF] requesting variety     of data from Enron and its affiliates.                                           >  Data Requests             >  Data  Release             >  Settlements               >  Major & Show Cause Orders                                                                                                                                                                                                            Important Items:                    Final Report on Price Manipulation In Western Markets (March 2003)          >  Summary of Findings  [PDF]          >  Part 1  [PDF]          >  Part 2  [PDF]         >  Part 3  [PDF]         Information Released in Investigation                                          Enron OnLine Report  [PDF] (August 2001)        Enron Trading Memos          >  December 6, 2000  [PDF]         >  December 8, 2000  [PDF]               >  Status Report  [PDF]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Predefined Search of  eLibrary                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Contact                     Information:                                         To report any type of concern, please e-mail the  Enron                   Team .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Updated:        November 12, 2003                                                              Disclaimers         |  Privacy Policy  |  Ethics         |  Accessibility  |  Webmaster         |  FirstGov         |  Adobe

Bill Lockyer, Attorney General (""Attorney General""), the California Electricity Oversight Board (""EOB""), the California Public Utilities Commission (""CPUC"") and Southern California Edison Company (""Edison"")1, respectfully request that the Commission make public all exhibits filed in the 100 Day Proceeding on March 3, 2003 and those to be filed on March 20, 2003. Pacific Gas and Electric Company (""PG&E"") takes no position on making the filing public at this time but understands that the Commission may make this information public after having time to review the evidence. 1   The public interest requires that all evidence in the 100 Day Proceeding concerning the manipulation of the California markets should be made available for public review. The importance of this proceeding to California's citizens cannot be overstated. Umbrella protective orders of the type in place here are designed to facilitate discovery, during the designated discovery period, by avoiding disputes over release of alleged commercially sensitive information. Now that the discovery period the Commission permitted is concluded, the evidence gleaned from discovery that is being filed with the Commission in the form of exhibits should be publicly available. The California Parties know of no legitimate claim that could credibly be advanced to justify refusal to disclose publicly the exhibits contained in the evidentiary submissions that are being made in this case. The information in question dates back to January 2000, over three years ago  if the concern is competitive harm, it is difficult to imagine that any of this information could cause it  it is very stale. Even if there were a basis for protecting the information that might be colorable under other circumstances, the balance here weighs in favor of disclosure. The public has a right to know the truth about what caused the California energy crisis. This information cannot be kept under wraps any longer.2  2  Indeed, in PEPCO Energy Co., the Commission found that a system that fails to provide information to customers, even if such information is provided to the Commission, fails to comport with the requirements of open government. The Commission said, ""providing the data only to the Commission, and to no others (including customers) would not be a satisfactory resolution. Commission evaluation of rates . . . based on data known only to the utility charging the rates . . . and the Commission . . . and not to the customer who is being charged the rates . . . would hardly comport with the core purposes of FOIA."" 88 FERC  61,330 at 62,019 n.13 (1999) (emphasis in original.)  2   BACKGROUND The filing of additional testimony and evidence of market manipulation by the California Parties (""100 Day Filing"") marks an important milestone in a journey that has to date, lasted nearly three years. The complaint filed by San Diego Gas & Electric  Company on August 2, 2000, seeking Commission action to abate the abnormally increasing prices in California's electricity market, triggered an ""informal investigation"" and a series of Commission orders,3 the majority of which are now on appeal in the Ninth Circuit. Over the course of the Commission's orders up through the July 25 Order  commencing the refund proceeding, the Commission concluded that it lacked the evidence necessary to file that any seller in the California markets manipulated the markets or violated tariffs. No discovery had ever been allowed to occur on these issues, however, and no evidentiary hearing was permitted  the Commission asserted that, ""a trial-type hearing is not necessary to resolve the matters.""4 The July 25th Order, as modified on December 19, 2001, instituted and governed a proceeding designed solely to arrive at refunds for the charging of unjust and unreasonable rates charged in California, pursuant to the Commission's preordained refund formula. While discovery was allowed to proceed in that narrow context and an evidentiary hearing permitted, the scope was strictly limited to the application of the methodology directed by the Commission, and nothing more. These orders include, but are not limited to: San Diego Gas & Elec. Co., 92 FERC  61,172 (2000) (August 23rd Order); San Diego Gas & Elec. Co., 93 FERC  61,121 (2000) (November 1st Order); San Diego Gas & Elec. Co., 93 FERC  61,294 (2000) (December 15th Order); San Diego Gas & Elec. Co., 94 FERC  61,245 (2001) (March 9th Order); San Diego Gas & Elec. Co., 95 FERC  61,115 (2001) (April 26th Order); San Diego Gas & Elec. Co., 95 FERC  61,418 (2001) (June 19th Order); San Diego Gas & Elec. Co., 96 FERC  61,120 (2001) (July 25th Order); San Diego Gas & Elec. Co., 97 FERC  61,275 (2001) (December 19th Order). 4 November 1st Order, 93 FERC at 61,373. 3  3   It was not until February 13, 2002, in response to requests from Congress, that the Commission directed a Staff fact-finding investigation into whether any entity manipulated short-term prices in electric energy or natural gas markets in the West in a manner that impacted long-term contracts.5 On May 6, 2002, the Commission posted the now-infamous Enron memoranda that describe in great detail the market manipulation games engaged in by Enron and other sellers, in a deliberate attempt to increase wholesale power prices in California for their own profit. Data requests by the Staff apparently yielded further evidence, all of which is not fully known due to the nonpublic nature of the Staff investigation, that other and further market games were being played during critical periods of California's energy crisis. On the basis of the limited information that began to come to light, on June 5, 2002, the California Parties filed a motion with the Ninth Circuit under Section 313(b) of the Federal Power Act (""FPA"") for leave to adduce additional evidence before the Commission regarding sellers' market manipulation. The Ninth Circuit was persuaded that indeed, as had been pointed out by the California Parties, the ""investigation"" by the Commission had fallen short and that the parties should be permitted to obtain further evidence of market manipulation.6 In fact, in order to grant the California Parties' Section 313(b) motion, the Ninth Circuit had to find that the evidence that the California Parties sought to adduce was the sort of evidence that  had it been available at the time the Commission issued its orders  would clearly have persuaded or compelled the Fact-Finding Investigation of Potential Manipulation of Electric and Natural Gas Prices, 98 FERC  61,165 (2002) (February 13th Order), Docket No. PA02-2. 6 California Public Utilities Commission v. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 9th Circuit Case No. 0171051, et al. (consolidated cases), (9th Cir. August 21, 2002.) 5  4   Commission to reach different decisions concerning the scope of and methodology for establishing refunds.7 The manner in which new evidence would be adduced was left to the Commission. Consequently, on September 6, 2002, the California Parties filed a motion for discovery to implement the 9 th  Circuit's Order.8  On November 20, 2002, the  Commission issued an Order on Motion for Discovery Order, granting the California Parties 100 days in which to conduct discovery for a period covering back to January 1, 2000, and to file additional evidence and findings of fact procured.9 The Honorable H. Peter Young was appointed the Discovery Master and, as in all cases, a protective order (the same one that governed the refund proceeding before Judge Birchman) was adopted for use in the 100 Day Proceeding.10 The California Parties request that the Commission set aside the protective order so that all of the exhibits filed by the California Parties and all other parties in the 100  In Rocky Mountain Power Company v. FPC, 409 F.2d 1122, 1128, n. 21 (D.C. Cir. 1969), the D.C. Circuit explained that in order to persuade a court, pursuant to section 313(b) of the FPA, to allow a party to adduce new evidence, the party must show that it ""clearly appear[s] that the new evidence would compel or persuade to a contrary result."" (citing, Louisville Gas & Elec. Co. v. FPC, 129 F.2d 126, 134 (6th Cir. 1942), cert. denied, 318 U.S. 761 (1942), reh'g denied, 318 U.S. 800 (1942). 8 The California Parties asked for three things: (1) to conduct discovery to obtain evidence of market manipulation by sellers; (2) that the Commission appoint an ALJ as Discovery Master; and (3) that they file, after the 100 days of discovery, additional evidence found along with recommendations concerning the need for additional procedures. 9 101 FERC  61,186. 10 San Diego Gas & Electric Co., et al., Order of Chief Judge Adopting Protective Order, Docket Nos.

The truth should be laid bare for all to see, most especially given the health, safety, and welfare consequences endured by California's citizens as a result of such conduct.12  THE CONTENT OF THE EVIDENCE UPON WHICH THIS COMMISSION WILL ACT MUST BE MADE PUBLIC There is indeed a great public interest in administrative proceedings such as the one now pending before this Commission, since it is the public who are most impacted. As the Supreme Court has stated, ""[p]eople in an open society do not demand infallibility from their institutions, but it is difficult for them to accept what they are prohibited from observing.""13 The Commission itself has long been attuned to the need for public access  to its processes  the need for ""sunshine"" in decision making  and has been loath to keep important information secret absent a truly compelling need to deny public access. In  11  The Protective Order prescribes a procedure for contesting a producing party's designation of materials as ""protected materials,"" and generally contemplates a process under which the Presiding Judge will decide whether materials should remain protected. Protective Order, P 11. However, the Protective Order also provides that any party may ask the Commission to find that the Protective Order should not apply to all or any materials previously designated as Protected Materials pursuant to the Protective Order. Id. at P 14. The California Parties are invoking this latter provision of the Protective Order concerning materials produced in the 100 Days Proceeding and used in the Exhibits filed with the Commission because of the exigency and importance of this issue and because the discovery period has now ended so that the matter is now before the Commission, not Judge Birchman or Judge Young. 12 The California Parties would also point the Commission to a letter sent to Chairman Pat Wood by California Senator Dianne Feinstein on February 6, 2003, also asking the Commission to lift the protective order. 13 Richmond Newspapers, Inc. v. Virginia, 448 U.S. 555, 572 (1980).  6   proceedings before this agency, it has been recognized that, ""the public sector is not present; it is only tangentially represented by the interventions of State regulatory and environmental bodies, and, therefore, the public can only apprehend the nature and conduct of an agency's adjudicatory process through the information made available by the agency to the public."" 14  Consequently, ""in camera reviews and determinations at  regulatory agencies such as this Commission are antithetical to the paramount desideratum of the public's right to know not merely what was the judgment of the ultimate decisional body, but more importantly, what was the content of the evidence upon which it reached that judgment.""15 The principles outlined above are the very principles that should guide the Commission here in setting aside the protective order as to the 100 Day Proceeding. There can be no clearer case where the public has the right to know. California's citizens need to know the truth  they cannot find satisfaction simply in a final decision by the Commission  they should and must know the evidence upon which the Commission ultimately reaches its decision. The Commission's guideline for lifting protective orders is found in Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Corporation, 40 FERC  61,023 (1987). There, the Commission stated that it does not promote closed administrative proceedings.16 Especially in the case of umbrella protective orders of the type at issue here  where there has never been a decision by the Commission or a Presiding Judge that particular 14 15 16  Southern California Edison and San Diego Gas and Electric Company, 49 FERC  63,029 at 65,127 (1989) Id. (emphasis in original). Id. at 61,066.  7   materials subject to the protective order are worthy of secret treatment  it should not be presumed that all (or even any) materials designated by a producing party as protected will remain hidden from the public view once they become the focus of testimony, evidence, and Commission decision making. If documents do not qualify as confidential or commercially sensitive, then either the protective order should be dissolved or all of the documents that cannot qualify as deserving of protection should be removed from the scope of the order. 17  The California Parties believe, and ask the Commission to find,  that none of the materials that are being filed as evidence in this proceeding merit protection from public disclosure. In cases concerning the lifting of protective orders, the Commission has balanced competitive harm against the public interest. 18  Where the potential harm in disclosure is  minimal (such as where it is stale through the passage of time), the information has been deemed to lose its commercial sensitivity and thus, the public's right to know has won out.19 First and foremost, while the California Parties recognize that there is validity in some situations to protecting one party from benefiting from the business secrets of another, the balance here weighs heavily in favor of disclosure. The right and need of the public to know is paramount. Those whose conduct is revealed in the 100 Day  17 18  Id. Buckeye Pipe Line Company, 44 FERC  61,066 (1988); Panhandle Ea 61,246 (1988); Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Corporation, 40 FERC California Edison and San Diego Gas and Electric Company, 49 FERC Transmission Corporation, 20 FERC  61,047 (1982). 19 See, Panhandle Eastern Pipe Line Company, 44 FERC  61,246 at 61,917  stern Pipe Line Company, 44 FERC   61,023 (1987); see also, Southern  63,029 (1989); and Columbia Gas (1988).  8   Proceeding as unlawful, fraudulent and manipulative, should be forced to face the scrutiny of those they injured  the public. Second, the information at issue here is not competitively sensitive. The time period covered by this 100 Day Proceeding is January 1, 2000 through June 20, 2001. Information that is 2  to 3 years old is stale and no longer has any competitive value20, particularly in an industry in which historical business practices already have changed dramatically during that same time period  in part because of the energy crisis and the admitted manipulative seller behavior that caused it. This is buttressed by the fact that similar data for the most recent portion of the time period (October 2, 2000 through June 20, 2001), has already been made subject to public disclosure because all evidence filed in the underlying Refund Proceeding went into the record without a protected designation, and thus is available for the public to see. There is no basis for treating similar information that is from a time period that is even more remote any differently. Third, some of the information that is being presented (or information like it, in the case of the notorious Enron memoranda) is already in the public realm. Countless newspapers, radio, and television reports have provided accounts of unscrupulous tactics employed by Enron and others in manipulating California's electric and gas markets, all for profit. In addition, information such as heat rates of generating units, mitigated  market clearing prices, and NOx emissions costs have already been publicized as a result  20  Id.  9   of the lifting of the protective order in the Refund Proceeding. Clearly, information that is already in the public domain cannot be subject to a protective order.21 Fourth, umbrella-type protective orders such as the one here, serve as an administrative convenience, primarily designed to facilitate discovery. In Southern  California Edison and San Diego Gas and Electric Company,22 ALJ Lewnes discusses the Commission's utilization of the protective order process to expedite discovery and to avoid a cumbersome and time-consuming process of assessing each individual piece of information for isolated determinations on protection. Given the very limited amount of time afforded the California Parties here, it was imperative to expedite discovery  hence the protective order. Now, however, continuing to keep ""secret"" the types of information at issue, would not serve any purpose save permitting wrongdoers to shield themselves from public scrutiny and embarrassment. To prevent disclosure of commercially  sensitive information is one thing  it is quite another to prevent disclosure of information that is not competitively sensitive merely because of a preference that the public not know the nature and extent of impermissible manipulation. There is no justification either legally or morally - for preventing those affected by such conduct from knowing the truth.  21  The California Parties note in this regard that, because most of the sellers in the 100 day Proceeding marked most of their data productions as ""protected,"" and because those materials have been incorporated into exhibits that contain evidence that already is in the public domain or is otherwise undeserving of protected status, the California Parties have been forced to designate all of the Exhibits they are filing on March 3, 2003, and even the indices that summarize those exhibits, as ""protected."" 22 49 FERC  63,029 at 65,126.  10   CONCLUSION Unquestionably, the citizens and businesses of California suffered great harm during 2000 and 2001  we now know why. The reasons for rolling blackouts, massive increases in the prices of electricity, the financial collapse of two major utilities, and the substantial impact to California's budget must not be available to only a select few. The public's right to know outweighs any other considerations here and warrants that all Exhibits be made public. Respectfully submitted, Vickie P.

Davis) 916-445-4571   Tom Dressler (AG Lockyer) 916-324-5500   Terrie Prosper (CPUC) 415-703-2160     March 3, 2003 A coalition of California government agencies and the state's two largest utilities today submitted to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) compelling new evidence that generators, traders and municipal power entities withheld significant amounts of electricity, engaged in collusion and pervasive Enron-type market manipulation, and should be compelled to return $7.5 billion in profits to the state.   The filing by the coalition  which includes Southern California Edison (SCE), Pacific Gas and Electric Company, the California Attorney General's Office, the California Public Utilities Commission, and the California Electricity Oversight Board  presents to FERC the results of over three months of investigation into why the state's wholesale power costs skyrocketed during the recent energy crisis.    The filing includes evidence supporting consumer refunds of more than $7.5 billion. However, it does not diminish the state's overall claim for refunds to buyers of approximately $9 billion. It provides strong contrasts to the $1.8 billion refund order under consideration by FERC, which resulted from a case in which the judge was precluded by FERC from considering market manipulation or from ruling on most of the transactions in which the state contends it occurred.   ""The massive coverup by generators is unraveling. The evidence of manipulation unearthed is so overwhelming even FERC can't hide from it,"" said Gov. Davis. ""To date, FERC has not returned a single dollar in refunds from the generators. It has a moral and legal responsibility to correct this outrage.""   ""This evidence should force FERC to recognize, at long last, just how egregiously and extensively California was plundered, defrauded and ripped off by the energy pirates,"" said Attorney General Bill Lockyer, ""FERC can no longer avoid providing California the long-overdue justice it deserves.""   The over 1,000 page filing cites evidence of widespread market manipulation by merchant generators and marketers including withholding available power at times when additional supplies were needed, thereby artificially driving up prices, and illegally gaming various power markets. The illegal gaming revelations include evidence that sellers coordinated some of their market manipulation activities. For example, many generators shared non-public outage information. Additionally, the California parties uncovered profit sharing agreements between traders and public power entities to sell non-existent services.     Unfortunately, the vast majority of today's over 1,000 page filing is subject to a FERC protective order that requires the California parties to keep the newly-discovered evidence confidential. However, they will be asking FERC to make all of the information in the filing public  as they believe the public has a right to know what really happened in California. They will counter the sellers' efforts to keep the information confidential by pointing out that most of the information is outdated and cannot possibly be competitively sensitive.   In addition to fighting off sellers' attempts to keep this information confidential, constant false statements by sellers before Congress, before FERC, and to the public have made the process of arriving at the truth difficult. Further ""gaming"" of the system  whether through withholding of documents or other legal strategies - will continue to be a problem. For example, while sellers are also required to present their cases to FERC on the same day as the California parties, Duke  one of the largest sellers  has already informed the California parties that it intends to wait until March 20, 2003, the date for replies, to make its preliminary filing, depriving the California parties of an opportunity to respond.   The California parties believe that their filing reveals ""just the tip of the iceberg"" of the evidence that sellers manipulated the California power markets. However, the evidence they are presenting in this filing today is substantial enough to warrant the remedy California is requesting.   # # #       Link to filing                     Back To Last Page Visited          Modified: 3/12/2003                               Back to Top of Page                                                                                                                                         This Site     My CA                                                                                                                                                                         How Do I Find.......

GX260-21-11065455	FEDERAL ENERGY REGULATORY COMMISSION WASHINGTON, D.C. 20426  NEWS RELEASE NEWS MEDIA CONTACTS: FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Barbara Connors, Celeste Miller, Hedley Burrell, Bryan Lee (202) 502-8680  March 26, 2003 Docket Nos.EL03-59-000, EL0360-000, EL03-77-000, and RP03-311-000  SHOW CAUSE ORDERS ADDRESS MANIPULATION, GAMING IN WESTERN POWER MARKETS; MARKET-BASED RATES THREATENED The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission moved aggressively today to launch enforcement actions in show cause orders that could ultimately lead to some energy companies losing their market-based rate authority. The enforcement actions respond to findings and recommendations in a final staff report on its yearlong investigation into manipulation in the western markets in 2000 and 2001 (Docket No. PA02-2-000). In an order based on the report, Enron Power Marketing Inc. and Enron Energy Services Inc. were told to justify why they should retain their market-based rates in the face of allegations of gaming. They were also told to explain why they failed to disclose to the Commission changes in their market share. In both cases, the companies must respond within 21 days. They could also face of loss of market-based rates for this alleged violation. A Section 206 proceeding, which could lead to refunds, will also be started to look into actions by these companies. In addition to these two companies, this order also directs eight others to show why they should not lose their blanket marketing certificates which allow them to make sales for resale at negotiated rates in interstate commerce which fall under the Commission's Natural Gas Act (NGA) jurisdiction. The companies have 21 days in which to respond. The Commission will also initiate a proceeding under the NGA similar to a Section 206. (more)   (2) The eight companies, all Enron connected, are: Bridgeline Gas Marketing LLC; Citrus Trading Corp.; ENA Upstream Co., LLC; Enron Canada Corp.; Enron Compression Services Co.; Enron Energy Services, Inc.; Enron MW LLC; and Enron North America Corp. In a second order, the Commission said there is evidence indicating that Reliant Energy Services, Inc., and BP Energy Company engaged in coordinated efforts to manipulate energy prices. The Commission gave Reliant and BP Energy (Docket No. EL03- ) 21 days to show cause why their market-based rate authority should not be revoked. BP Energy and Reliant, in transactions identified in phone conversations and transcripts, appear to have manipulated electricity prices at Palo Verde, an important Arizona trading hub, the Commission said.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  THURSDAY, AUGUST 3, 2000            WWW.USDOJ.GOV/ATR    AT  (202) 514-2007  TDD: (202) 514-1888                      FRENCH EXECUTIVE INDICTED FOR BRIDGE PROJECTS SCHEME    Bridges in Georgia, Kentucky, Massachusetts, Ohio Affected          WASHINGTON, D.C. -- A federal grand jury in Boston today indicted an executive of a French construction firm -- Freyssinet International et Cie -- for conspiring to rig bids and allocate contracts for the sale of materials and supplies used in the construction of three cable-stayed bridge projects in the United States, the Department of Justice's Antitrust Division and the U.S. Attorneys Office for the District of Massachusetts announced.  The three bridges are:  Charles River in Massachusetts, Maysville in Kentucky and Ohio, and Sidney Lanier in Georgia.     The one-count felony indictment charged Jean Pierre Cagnat, the former chief executive officer of Freyssinet, with conspiring to rig bids in violation of the Sherman Act from September 1996 until December 1997.   The indictment charges that in carrying out the conspiracy, Cagnat and co-conspirators met in London, England and agreed to participate in a bid rotation scheme.  They carried out the conspiracy by exchanging price information for upcoming stay cable system bids, and submitting noncompetitive, rigged bids on the projects.       Freyssinet was awarded the stay cable construction contract for the Charles River bridge which is part of the Boston Central Artery Project, known as the ""Big Dig.""     ""Road and bridge construction represents a significant part of federal and state budgets,"" said Joel I. Klein, Assistant Attorney General in charge of the Department's Antitrust Division.     ""The Antitrust Division will prosecute vigorously anyone who defrauds American taxpayers by dividing market shares, fixing prices, and rigging bids.""     Construction of cable-stayed bridges is a form of specialty construction.  The roadway of a cable-stayed bridge is suspended from cables attached to load-bearing towers.     This is the fourth case brought in the Department's ongoing antitrust investigation of the cable-stayed bridge construction industry.         In September 1999,  Freyssinet International et Cie pleaded guilty to rigging bids on cable-stayed  bridge projects and was fined $720,000.  Dywidag-Systems International USA Inc. and its former President and CEO, John H. Browning, also pleaded guilty and were fined $571,000 and $25,000, respectively, for their participation in the bridge construction conspiracy.      Cagnat is charged with violating Section One of the Sherman Act, which carries a maximum penalty of three years imprisonment and a $350,000 fine for individuals.  The maximum fine may be increased to twice the gain derived from the crime or twice the loss suffered by the victims of the crime, if either of those amounts is greater than the statutory maximum fine.       The ongoing investigation involving the specialty construction industry is being conducted by the Antitrust Division's San Francisco Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Department of Transportation, Office of Inspector General in San Francisco.     ###     00-451"

It is noted that neither City of Tacoma, Washington (""Tacoma"") nor the California State Parties (the People of the State of California, ex rel. Bill Lockyer, Attorney General, the California Public Utilities Commission, and the California Electricity Oversight Board) were notified of the meetings between the Trial Staff and Avista Utilities and Avista Energy, nor were they given an opportunity to attend the meetings, review the materials examined, or to comment. On April 9, 2003 the Chief Judge held a further prehearing conference in 2. this case where he ruled that the Proposed Agreement filed on January 31, 2003, could not be certified to the Commission because it appears to be in conflict with the Commission's Final Report--pages ES16 and VI-17 and VI-18--and pages 20, 21, 22, 33, and 34 of the California ISO Report (CAISO Report) of October 4, 2002, Analysis of Trading and Scheduling Strategies Described in Enron Memos. Among other things, the proposed Agreement provides that the Trial Staff investigation found no evidence that any executive or employee of Avista knowingly engaged in or facilitated improper trading strategies, that it found no evidence that Avista engaged in any effort to manipulate the western markets during the year 2000 and 2001, etc., while the March 26, 2003 Final Report and the October 4, 2002 CAISO Report indicated possible misconduct in three areas, ratchet or megawatt laundering, sell back of ancillary services (""get shorty""), and counter-flow revenues from cut schedules in real time. The Chief Judge directed that the Trial Staff file on or before May 15, 2003, a supplement to its investigation report addressing the three issues set forth above and present evidence on the scope of its investigation. He also scheduled a further prehearing conference on May 20, 2003, to discuss whether the settlement, as supplemented, can be certified to the Commission by the Chief Judge. 3. On May 15, 2003 the Trial Staff submitted a Supplemental Report to its investigation report filed as Appendix A (Trial Staff's Initial Report) to the Agreement in Resolution of Section 206 Proceeding filed on January 30, 2003. The Trial Staff's Supplemental Report performed additional analysis with respect to the issues raised by the Chief Judge at the April 9, 2003, further prehearing conference and at the conference on May 20, 2003, and presented testimony describing the scope and extent of its investigation. The Supplemental Report does not alter the Trial Staff's conclusions set forth in the Initial Report appended to the January 30 proposed Agreement. The Trial Staff along with Avista Utilities and Avista Energy strongly urged the Chief Judge to certify the proposed Agreement and the Commission to approve it. 4. The Chief Judge on June 25, 2003, denied the request to certify the settlement to the Commission because there appeared to be unresolved issues of   Docket No. EL02-115-000  3  material fact. However, on July 24, 2003, the Chief Judge granted reconsideration of June 25th earlier ruling and upon reconsideration found that there were no longer any pending unresolved issues of material fact and that the record in this proceeding is sufficient for the Commission to base a determination on the merits of the settlement. A copy of the July 24, 2003 Order of Chief Judge Granting Reconsideration, Denying Motion for Leave to Take Interlocutory Appeal as Moot, and Cancelling Procedural Schedule is attached hereto and made a part hereof by reference.  Background On August 13, 2002, the Commission initiated a section 206 proceeding to investigate Avista Utilities and Avista Energy's activities over the 2000-2001 period for instances of possible misconduct by Avista Utilities, Avista Energy, and two affiliates of Enron Corporation: Enron Power Marketing, Inc. (EPMI), and Portland General Electric Corporation (Portland) (collectively, Enron) to determine whether the misconduct occurred and if so to determine remedies, including possibly refunds and/or revocation of Avista Utilities and Avista Energy's and/or Enron's marketbased rate authority (100 FERC  61,187). The Commission's August 13, 2002 order set for hearing the following three issues: 5. i.  Whether, and if so the extent to which, Avista Utilities or Avista Energy engaged in or facilitated the trading strategies identified in the Enron Corporation (""Enron"") memoranda released by the Commission on May 6, 2002. Whether, and if so the extent to which, Avista Utilities or Avista Energy engaged in trading activities that violated the Commission's prohibitions on affiliate sales. Whether Avista Utilities and Avista Energy provided all relevant information in the Commission's investigation in Docket No. PA022-000.  ii.  iii.  On September 5, 2003, the Chief Judge designated himself as the presiding judge in this case, established Track II procedures, and scheduled a prehearing conference to be held on September 12, 2003. On December 20, 2002, the Chief Judge suspended the established procedural schedule in this proceeding in order to allow the Trial Staff and Avista Utilities and Avista Energy to execute an agreement that would settle the issues relating to Avista Utilities and Avista Energy that were 6.   Docket No. EL02-115-000  4  set for hearing herein. The Chief Judge on the same date severed the non-Avista third-party transaction issues dealing with market manipulation by Enron Power Marketing, Inc., and Portland General Electric Corporation from this proceeding and consolidated these issues into the proceeding in Portland General Electric Company and Enron Power Marketing, Inc., Docket No. EL02-114-000 for hearing and decision. The Chief Judge further ordered that these issues be heard under Docket No. EL02-115-001.  The Proposed Agreement Trial Staff Investigation Section II of the proposed Agreement provides an overview of the investigation undertaken by the Trial Staff after the issuance of the August 13, 2003 Order. Section II states that the Trial Staff engaged in an analysis of all of the facts and circumstances surrounding the transactions that were the subject of the Commission's June 4, 2002 Order To Show Cause Why Market-Based Rate Authority Should Not Be Revoked, 99 FERC  61,272 (""Show Cause Order""), including, as to those transactions, a review of all relevant trading tapes and accounting documents, and interviews with Avista Utilities personnel. Section II also states that the Trial Staff adopted an expansive view of its investigative mandate with respect to affiliate transactions, and that the Trial Staff examined all transactions in which Avista Utilities or Avista Energy had dealt with Enron or Portland General Electric Company (""PGE""), as well as information on all transactions in which Avista Utilities or Avista Energy engaged in simultaneous buy/sell transactions between other sets of affiliated companies during 2000 and 2001. 7.  The proposed Agreement states that the Trial Staff's investigation was 8. conducted in a manner calculated to elicit as much relevant information from Avista Utilities and Avista Energy as possible. The proposed Agreement also states that the investigation began with several informal meetings between the Trial Staff and representatives of both Avista Utilities and Avista Energy, including management and trading personnel, to discuss the operations of both companies, and to answer questions by the Trial Staff in preparation for more formal discovery. As outlined by the proposed Agreement, after the prehearing conference on September 12, 2002, the Trial Staff issued to both Avista Utilities and Avista Energy several detailed discovery requests, which produced a significant amount of information for review by the Trial Staff. Those discovery requests were supplemented by a four-day Field Audit undertaken by the Trial Staff at the corporate offices of Avista Utilities and the corporate offices of Avista Energy, both of which are in Spokane, Washington.   Docket No. EL02-115-000 Findings of the Investigation 9. Section III of the proposed Agreement, and Appendix A of the proposed Agreement, set forth in detail the findings of the Trial Staff's investigation. Specifically, Section III of the proposed Agreement enumerates the following findings:  The Trial Staff's investigation found no evidence that any executives or employees of Avista Utilities or Avista Energy knowingly engaged in or facilitated any improper trading strategies.  The Trial Staff's investigation found no evidence that Avista Utilities or Avista Energy engaged in any efforts to manipulate the Western energy markets during 2000 and 2001.  The responses of Avista Utilities and Avista Energy to the Trial Staff investigation indicated an overall cooperative attitude and response. The Trial Staff did not find that Avista Utilities or Avista Energy withheld relevant information from the Commission's inquiry into the Western energy markets for 2000 and 2001 in Docket No. PA02-2000.  5  Appendix A, which is cross referenced by Section III of the proposed Agreement, provides a detailed explanation of the basis for the Trial Staff's findings, including an extensive set of citations to information provided to the Trial Staff by Avista Utilities and Avista Energy during the discovery process. Appendix A begins with an explanation of the Trial Staff's conclusion that its investigation found no evidence that any executives or employees of Avista Utilities or Avista Energy knowingly engaged in or facilitated any improper trading strategies or engaged in any efforts to manipulate the Western energy markets during 2000 and 2001. That explanation provides a description of the information examined and the conclusions reached by the Trial Staff with respect to the Enron trading strategies, particularly the ""Deathstar"" trading strategy, the ""Big Foot"" trading strategy, and the ""Get Shorty"" trading strategy, the core business practices of Avista Utilities and Avista Energy, the relationship between Avista Energy and Turlock Irrigation District, the participation by Avista Utilities and Avista Energy in the congestion management markets, the participation by Avista Utilities and Avista Energy in the energy options markets. That part of Appendix A also provides a description of the information examined and the conclusions reached by the Trial Staff with respect to various internal Avista Utilities and Avista Energy operations issues, including the 10.   Docket No. EL02-115-000  6  maintenance of daily transaction logs by Avista Utilities and Avista Energy, the telephone taping system used by the two companies, the account settlement processes used by Avista Utilities and Avista Energy, the revenues earned by Avista Utilities in the transactions specified by the Show Cause Order, and affiliate transaction questions raised by certain Avista Utilities transactions with Enron. 11. The next part of Appendix A provides an explanation of the Trial Staff's conclusions that neither Avista Utilities nor Avista Energy engaged in any trading activities that violated the Commission's prohibitions on affiliate transactions. That part of Appendix A provides a description of the practice of ""sleeving"" energy in the Western power markets, outlines the potential concerns about sleeving transactions on the part of the Trial Staff, and concludes that neither Avista Utilities nor Avista Energy engaged in any simultaneous buy/sell transactions with affiliates during the relevant period that circumvented the Commission's rules on affiliate transactions. That part of Appendix A also notes that the Trial Staff examined the separation of functions practices of Avista Utilities and Avista Energy, and that the Trial Staff found that the corporate separations required by the Commission are clear and enforced at the two companies.  The final part of Appendix A explains the basis for the Trial Staff's conclusion that there was no evidence that Avista Utilities or Avista Energy withheld relevant information from the Commission's inquiry into the Western energy markets for 2000 and 2001 in Docket No. PA02-2-000. This part of Appendix A also explains that during the investigation in Docket No. EL02-115000, the responses of both Avista Utilities and Avista Energy indicated an overall cooperative attitude and response. 12.  The Trial Staff's Supplemental Report The Trial Staff's Supplemental Report, which included the affidavits of Trial Staff witnesses Patrick R. Crowley with accompanying Exhibits S-7 through S14 (Crowley Affidavit) and Andrew M. Bieltz, addresses the three issues of concern set forth by the Chief Judge. With respect to these issues, the Trial Staff reviewed thousands of calls and hundreds of hours of energy trader recordings. The affidavits explain the complexities of the listening devices, the rationale for selection of certain time periods for review, the amount of time spent listening to these tapes and lists the specific time periods reviewed. The Trial Staff's Supplemental Report, as well as the Initial Report, point out that while confusion was apparent during the conversations related to the Enron-PGE-Avista Utilities transactions, no conversations indicated that Avista Utilities or Avista Energy knowingly colluded with Enron or PGE in any Enron-defined energy trading scheme. Further, with respect to the three schemes addressed in the Supplemental Report and attached 13.   Docket No. EL02-115-000 affidavits, the Trial Staff did not find any conversations of Avista Energy traders related thereto. Recommendations and Future Actions The Trial Staff, Avista Utilities, and Avista Energy recommend that the 14. Chief Judge certify the instant proposed Agreement, including the Supplemental Report, to the Commission. They believe that it represents a reasonable resolution of the issues herein.  7  Section IV of the proposed Agreement states that based on the findings of its investigation into the issues set for hearing, Trial Staff does not recommend or advocate any remedial measures be taken against Avista Utilities or Avista Energy under Section 206 of the Federal Power Act, and does not recommend any remedy involving payment of refunds, relinquishment or modification of market-based rate authority, or assessment of penalties. The proposed Agreement also identifies certain other concerns on the part of the Trial Staff, as well as Staff recommendations, and responses on the part of Avista Utilities and Avista Energy. The Trial Staff, Avista Utilities, and Avista Energy have agreed that Avista Utilities and Avista Energy will, inter alia, continue to tape record energy trader conversations, develop further documentation for resolution of accounting disputes with counterparties, and maintain a training program on the applicable FERC Code of Conduct. 15.  The Trial Staff recommends that Avista Utilities undertake certain improvements in its taping system. If the industry standard with respect to taping changes, Avista Utilities shall provide 60 days' notice to the Commission if it intends to change to that new industry standard. With regard to electronic transaction recordation in archivable data files, Avista Utilities states that it began to supplement its CASSO accounting system with a double-entry system of recording all transactions entered in both CASSO and RiskWorks, an in-house data collection software package, and that it has just transitioned (as of November 20, 2002) to a more powerful and more accessible data recordation software package called ""Nucleus,"" which replaces the RiskWorks package. 16.  The Trial Staff also expresses certain concerns about the Avista Utilities account settlement process. Avista Utilities agrees that it will continue to resolve disputes in accord with the Western Systems Power Pool tariff, document the chain of command for accounting dispute resolution, and develop an internal tracking mechanism for auditing such adjustments. Finally, Avista Utilities and Avista Energy commit to maintaining an annual training program on the applicable FERC 17.   Docket No. EL02-115-000  8  Code of Conduct for all employees engaged in the trading of electric energy and capacity, and maintaining records of successful completion of each training session.  Comments to the Proposed Agreement Initial comments to the January 30, 2003, proposed Agreement were filed on February 19, 2003 by the City of Tacoma, Washington (Tacoma) (Tacoma attached the affidavit of Philip J. Movish), the People of the State of California, ex rel. Bill Lockyer, Attorney General (""California AG""), the California Public Utilities Commission (""CPUC"") and the California Electricity Oversight Board (""EOB"") (collectively ""California State Parties""), and by Portland General Electric Company (Portland General). Tacoma and the California State Parties oppose the settlement and request that it be rejected on the grounds that the factual assertions on which the settlement is predicated are unsupported by any witness under oath; that the FERC's Trial Staff had incomplete access to evidence in the custody of the Commission; that it is unclear whether the Trial Staff examined all available evidence; that interveners had no access to certain information in the custody of the Commission and/or the Trial Staff; that the Trial Staff's refusal to provide the results of discovery to other parties denied the participants of due process and equal protection of law; that the absence of Commission published rules and regulations that adequately describe the role of interveners in a Section 206 proceeding initiated by the Commission has resulted in the denial of due process to participants; and that these are these are issues of material fact for which an evidentiary hearing is required. Portland General supports the proposed Agreement and recommends that the Chief Judge certify it to the Commission for approval, but takes issue with the Trial Staff's characterization of circular transactions as either contrary to or potentially contrary to the California Independent System Operator's (""ISO"") rules and anti-gaming tariff provisions. 18.  19. Reply Comments were filed on March 3, 2003, by Avista Utilities and Avista Energy (jointly), and by the Trial Staff. The Trial Staff attached the affidavit of Patrick R. Crowley to its reply comments. 20. On April 1, 2003, counsel for Tacoma filed a motion for leave to supplement its comments to include the Commission Investigative Staff's Final Report. On April 8, 2003, Counsel for Avista Utilities and Avista Energy filed an answer to Tacoma's motion. Avista Utilities and Avista Energy do not object to Tacoma submitting this additional material. On April 9, 2003, the Chief Judge made the Final Report an exhibit in the case (Chief Judge's Exhibit 1). 21. As indicated before herein the Chief Judge ruled on April 9, 2003, that the proposed settlement could not be certified because it was in conflict with the   Docket No. EL02-115-000  9  Commission investigative staff's Final Report. The Chief Judge pointed out that the Final Report found possible misconduct by Avista Utilities and Avista Energy with regard to megawatt laundering or ""Ricochet"", the sell back of ancillary services or ""get shorty"", and counterflow revenues from cut schedules in realtime, while the proposed agreement finds that no executive or employee of Avista Utilities or Avista Energy knowingly engaged in or facilitated improper trading strategies or engaged in the manipulation of the Western Markets during the years 2000 and 2001. Under the circumstances the Chief Judge directed the Trial Staff to supplement the Trial Staff Investigative Report and describe the scope of its investigation. The Trial Staff filed a supplement to its investigation report attached to the proposed settlement with affidavits of Andrew Bieltz and Patrick Crowley which were admitted into evidence as Chief Judge exhibits. The Trial Staff presented Mr.Crowley as a witness at the conference before the Chief Judge on May 20, 2003, to summarize the supplement and answer clarifying questions. The Chief Judge gave the parties an opportunity to file comments and reply comments on the said supplement. Comments were filed by Tacoma and by the California State Parties, and reply comments were filed by the Trial Staff and by Avista Utilities and Avista Energy. The California State Parties argue that the Trial Staff supplement does not support the Trial Staff's conclusions that Avista Utilities and Avista Energy did not engage in the three Enron trading strategies in issue herein, and, in general that the Trial Staff's review was inadequate. Tacoma asserts that there are genuine issues of material fact that remain unresolved in this case pointing out the direct contradiction between Trial Staff's unsupported conclusions regarding taped conversations and the specific examples from the transcripts cited in Mr. Movish's affidavit, an opportunity to attend the meetings, review the materials examined, or to comment. The Trial Staff in its reply comments asserts that Tacoma and the California 22. State Parties in their replies to the Staff's Supplemental Report failed to provide any evidence of a genuine issue of material fact supported by an affidavit. The Trial Staff further argues that the comments of Tacoma and the California State Parties are just a baseless attack on the sufficiency of the Trial Staff's review. The Trial Staff again states that the proposed settlement is fair and reasonable and should be certified to the Commission for approval. Avista Utilities and Avista Energy allege that the comments of the California State Parties and Tacoma merely resurrect arguments already made which were discredited by the Trial Staff's investigation and should not be a basis for rejecting the proposed Agreement.  Discussion 23. The Chief Judge, after a thorough review of Chief Judge exhibits 1 through 7; transcripts of the five prehearing conferences, Tr. Pages 1  299; the proposed Agreement, the comments and reply comments thereto; the Trial Staff's supplement to the proposed Agreement; the explanatory hearing on the supplemental filing; the   Docket No. EL02-115-000  10  comments and reply comments of the parties on the supplemental filing, the Trial Staff's July 10, 2003, motion for reconsideration and the Avista Utilities and Avista Energy July 10, 2003, motion for leave to file an interlocutory appeal finds that there are no longer any unresolved issues of material fact remaining in this proceeding; that the Commission Trial Staff's investigation was as thorough and complete as it could possibly be under the circumstances of this case and the other pending Enron cases; that every effort was made to uncover any possible wrongdoing; and that Avista cooperated to the maximum extent in providing information and data. The Chief Judge further finds that the proposed settlement disposes of all issues set for hearing in this proceeding, that it is just, reasonable, and in the public interest.  Certification 24. Pursuant to 18 C.F.R.  385.602(g), I hereby certify the following for consideration by the Commission: i. The Agreement in Resolution of this Section 206 Proceeding, with the attached FERC Trial Staff Investigation Report, including attachments, filed on January 30, 2003, by the Commission Trial Staff and Avista. ii.

Curtis L. Wagner, Jr. Chief Administrative Law Judge   UNITED STATES OF AMERICA FEDERAL ENERGY REGULATORY COMMISSION Avista Corporation Avista Energy, Inc. Portland General Electric Company Enron Power Marketing Inc.  Docket No. EL02-115-000  ORDER OF CHIEF JUDGE GRANTING RECONSIDERATION, DENYING MOTION FOR LEAVE TO TAKE INTERLOCUTORY APPEAL AS MOOT, AND CANCELLING PROCEDURAL SCHEDULE (Issued July 24, 2003) 1. On July 10, 2003, the Commission trial staff filed a motion for reconsideration of the Chief Judge's June 25, 2003, order denying the request to certify a contested settlement in this proceeding. On the same date Avista Corporation and Avista Energy, Inc.'s (Avista) filed a motion for leave to take an interlocutory appeal of the Chief Judge's June 25, 2003 order. On July 17, 2003, Avista filed an answer supporting the Commission trial staff's motion for reconsideration. It is noted that answers to requests for rehearings/reconsideration are not permitted under the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure (Rule 213(a) (2)). 2. On June 25, 2003, the Chief Judge issued an order denying the Commission trial staff's and Avista's request to certify a contested settlement to the Commission and reinstating hearing procedures (103 FERC  63,058). That denial was based upon his finding that at that point in time there were unresolved genuine issues of material fact. The Chief Judge found that there was a dispute between the parties over the definition of the Enron practices of ricochet, get shorty, and counterflow revenues from cut schedules in real time that would be applied to the facts in this case. The Chief Judge was concerned whether the allegations of wrongdoing raised by the City of Tacoma, Washington (Tacoma), based on transcripts of telephone conversations set forth by Tacoma witness Movish, were contrary to the conclusions reached by the trial staff in its investigation raised unresolved issues of material fact. The Chief Judge also had questions regarding whether Avista facilitated the circumvention of prohibitions on affiliate sales. The Chief Judge was troubled by the allegations of Tacoma and the California Parties (the People of the State of California, ex rel. Bill Lockyer, Attorney General, the California Public Utilities Commission, and the California Electricity Oversight Board) that they were not permitted to participate in the   Docket No. EL02-115-000 settlement discussions, that they were not notified of meetings between the trial staff and Avista, and that they were not given an opportunity to review materials examined or to comment.  2  3. Later on the same date the Commission issued orders to show cause in American Electric Power Service Corporation, et al. (103 FERC  61,345), and in Enron Power Marketing, Inc., 103 FERC  61,346, in which it provided clarification and clear definitions of the gaming practices which are in dispute in this proceeding as indicated above. There is no question concerning the fact that the issues in those cases are identical with the issues addressed in this proceeding and that the definitions would directly cover the allegations concerning Avista here. These orders dispose of the dispute in this proceeding regarding the definition of ricochet transactions, get shorty, and deathstar. 4. The Commission trial staff in its motion for reconsideration pointed out that the dispute over definitions of ricochet, get shorty, and cournterflow revenues from cut schedules in real time were resolved by the Commission in the show cause orders referred to above. The trial staff in its motion for reconsideration demonstrated that it had used the exact definitions in conducting its investigation and that its investigation complied in every respect with the definitions set forth in the Commission's show cause orders. The trial staff's motion for reconsideration established, through citations and references to data obtained from Avista in discovery, that other than broker-arranged transactions (in which the counterparties are unknown to each other until the deal is consummated), the only affiliated entities for which Avista served as an intermediary during 2000 and 2001 are Enron Power Marketing, Inc. (Enron) and Portland General Electric Company (PGE), and that during the entire period Avista in its motion for leave to take interlocutory appeal pointed out that it did not facilitate the contravention of any affiliate transaction bar between PGE and Enron in the relevant transactions because no such bar existed. Avista further pointed out that in a December 28, 1998, Commission letter order accepting Enron's market-based rate schedule and Code of conduct, Enron was given authority to sell power to PGE. In addition, the Commission trial staff investigation found that with respect to Avista, all but one of the more than 200 transactions in which Avista served as a sleeve between affiliated companies during 2000 and 2001, were arranged by brokers without the knowledge or direct involvement of the affiliated parties. 5. The trial staff's motion for reconsideration set forth the fact that the Chief Judge had been mislead concerning the City of Tacoma's and the California Parties' assertion that they were never given notice nor permitted to participate in settlement discussions. The trial staff enumerated the notices given for every meeting and the opportunity for the City of Tacoma and the California Parties to participate.   Docket No. EL02-115-000  3  6. With regard to the Chief Judge's concerns about contrary conclusions between Tacoma's Witness Movish in his affidavit and the Commission trial staff's conclusion reached in its investigation, both Avista in its motion for interlocutory appeal, and the trial staff in its motion for reconsideration point out that the transcripts cited by Mr. Movish are the same transcripts referenced by the Commission in its August 13, 2002 (100 FERC  61,187), order setting this case for hearing. The Commission trial staff and Avista point out that Avista's response to the August 13, 2003, order offered extensive review of the transcripts and associated transactions. Further, the trial staff conducted an extensive review of the involved transactions, including a review of documents, correspondence, accounting records, internal reports, transaction logs, and a review of the actual tapes and found that no executive or employee of Avista engaged in or knowingly facilitated any of the Enron trading strategies. A description of the Commission trial staff's investigation was provided under oath by a trial staff witness at a prehearing conference held on May 20, 2003. Tacoma and the California parties were permitted to question the trial staff's witness. The Chief Judge is convinced that there is no longer any question of material fact concerning the transcripts of the tapes relied upon by Mr. Movish. In view of the foregoing and the record to date in this proceeding and a 7. review of all comments and reply comments on the settlement filed in this proceeding, the Chief Judge hereby finds that there are no unresolved issues of material fact and that the record is sufficient for the Commission to make a determination on the merits of the settlement involved herein. The Chief Judge hereby grants the Commission trial staff's motion for reconsideration of his June 25, 2003, order and will certify the settlement reached by the Commission trial staff and Avista to the Commission for its consideration. 8. In reaching his conclusion herein, the Chief Judge considered the extensive and convincing motion of Avista for leave to take an interlocutory appeal of his June 25, 2003, order. However, the motion is hereby denied as being moot in view of the granting of the trial staff's motion for reconsideration. The current procedural scheduled established in this case, including the 9. hearing scheduled to convene on October 27, 2003 is cancelled.  Curtis L. Wagner, Jr. Chief Administrative Law Judge"

The filing by the coalition - which includes Southern California Edison (SCE), Pacific Gas and Electric Company, the California Attorney General's Office, the California Public Utilities Commission, and the California Electricity Oversight Board - presents to FERC the results of over three months of investigation into why the state's wholesale power costs skyrocketed during the recent energy crisis.    The filing includes evidence supporting consumer refunds of more than $7.5 billion. However, it does not diminish the state's overall claim for refunds to buyers of approximately $9 billion. It provides strong contrasts to the $1.8 billion refund order under consideration by FERC, which resulted from a case in which the judge was precluded by FERC from considering market manipulation or from ruling on most of the transactions in which the state contends it occurred.   ""The massive cover-up by generators is unraveling. The evidence of manipulation unearthed is so overwhelming even FERC can't hide from it,"" said Gov. Davis. ""To date, FERC has not returned a single dollar in refunds from the generators. It has a moral and legal responsibility to correct this outrage.""   ""This evidence should force FERC to recognize, at long last, just how egregiously and extensively California was plundered, defrauded and ripped off by the energy pirates,"" said Attorney General Bill Lockyer, ""FERC can no longer avoid providing California the long-overdue justice it deserves.""   The over 1,000-page filing cites evidence of widespread market manipulation by merchant generators and marketers including withholding available power at times when additional supplies were needed, thereby artificially driving up prices, and illegally gaming various power markets. The illegal gaming revelations include evidence that sellers coordinated some of their market manipulation activities. For example, many generators shared non-public outage information. Additionally, the California parties uncovered profit sharing agreements between traders and public power entities to sell non-existent services.     Unfortunately, the vast majority of today's filing is subject to a FERC protective order that requires the California parties to keep the newly discovered evidence confidential. However, they petitioned FERC to make all of the information in the filing public - as they believe the public has a right to know what really happened in California. They will counter the sellers' efforts to keep the information confidential by pointing out that most of the information is outdated and cannot possibly be competitively sensitive.   In addition to fighting off sellers' attempts to keep this information confidential, constant false statements by sellers before Congress, before FERC, and to the public have made the process of arriving at the truth difficult. Further ""gaming"" of the system - whether through withholding of documents or other legal strategies - will continue to be a problem. For example, while sellers are also required to present their cases to FERC on the same day as the California parties, Duke - one of the largest sellers - has already informed the California parties that it intends to wait until March 17, 2003, the date for replies, to make its preliminary filing, depriving the California parties of an opportunity to respond.   The California parties believe that their filing reveals ""just the tip of the iceberg"" of the evidence that sellers manipulated the California power markets. However, the evidence they are presenting in this filing today is substantial enough to warrant the remedy California is requesting.

GX264-48-3843181	"Arizona General Stream Adjudication Bulletin OFFICE OF THE SPECIAL MASTER May June 1999  San Carlos Apache Settlement Proceedings Challenged The proposed San Carlos Apache Tribe Water Rights Settlement ran into trouble shortly after it was submitted to Judge Susan R. Bolton on March 30, 1999 (see March-April 1999 Bulletin). Soon after Judge Bolton had ordered the commencement of special proceedings to consider the proposed settlement, the cities of Globe and Safford, joined by the Central Arizona Water Conservation District, filed a motion with Judge Bolton to vacate the proceedings. Part of their challenge is that the agreement submitted to the court for review is different from the 1992 settlement agreement approved by Congress. The earlier agreement, the challengers argue, includes the cities of Safford and Globe as signatories. These municipalities were unable to come to agreement with the Apache Tribe on more specific provisions of the settlement before it was submitted to Superior Court. Disagreements include City of Safford's use of Bonita Creek and whether the City of Globe will have to discontinue groundwater pumping near the tribal boundary and construct a pipeline from Roosevelt Lake. The dispute has received an amount of public attention that is uncharacteristic of prior settlement proceedings. The Arizona Republic has carried several editorials on the matter as well as a Steve Benson cartoon satirizing the parties as children unable to play together in a wading pool. The motion to discontinue the settlement approval process was heard by Judge Bolton at a previously scheduled hearing on May 14. At that time, the challengers argued that all the parties to the 1992 agreement would have had to concur on the details before it was submitted to Superior Court and that the Tribe and other major parties were attempting to ""roll"" these small cities. The Tribe and the Salt River Project argued that the challenge should be framed as an objection to the proposed settlement and considered as part of the established approval process. They reminded the Court that two of the previous water continued on page 2...

While this change, adopted on February 22, 1999, applies to trial and appellate judges throughout the state, it appears to have resulted from the problems the Supreme Court itself has encountered when hearing appeals and other proceedings involving general stream adjudications. The previous version of Canon 3(E) barred a judge from hearing a case in which a lawyer, with whom the judge had practiced in the past, had been involved as a lawyer. Thus, a judge could not hear a case if the judge had practiced with an attor ney who was still appearing in the case. The judge could also not hear the matter if the judge had practiced with a lawyer who had been an attorney in the matter in the past, even though new lawyers were now involved.  continued on page 6...   San Carlos Apache Settlement cont ... rights settlements approved by the Court (Fort McDowell Indian Community and Salt River PimaMaricopa Indian Community) also contained some unresolved items when they were submitted to the Court for consideration. The argument concluded with a request from Ti m Delaney, Chief Deputy Attorney General, appearing specially for Governor Jane Hull, who requested the Court to hold a decision in abeyance for at least two weeks to allow the Governor an opportunity to mediate this dispute. Judge Bolton agreed that she would not decide the matter for at least two weeks. Technical Assessment and Other Matters In other matters concerning the proposed settlement, the Department of Water Resources has filed its court-ordered assessment of the proposed settlement. The report is divided into seven chapters: 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7. Introduction Summary of Adjudication Claims Review of Terms of the Settlement Water Use Water Resources Impacts on Water Resources and Claimants Summary irrigable acreage standard commonly used for Indian lands. The Department indicated that almost 65,000 acres of land are arable, but not all this land could be irrigated due to economic or technical limitations. If fifty percent of the arable land were practicably irrigable, then the water right claimed might range between 129,000 acre-feet and 193,000 acre-feet per year. Such an award, if made, would come from the water sources available to the Tribe. Under the proposed settlement agreement, the San Carlos Apache Tribe is entitled to an annual diversion of 67,965 acre-feet, of which 60,665 acre-feet is to be supplied through the Central Arizona Project and the remaining 7,300 acre-feet would be diverted from the Black and Salt Rivers. If the Tribe is limited to this amount from the Black and Salt Rivers, the Department concludes that the depletion of these rivers would have minimal effect on other users. Additionally, the Department indicates that there may be some impacts on other parties: upon Phelps Do dge Corporation if the Tribe engages in large-scale diversions from the Black River; upon the City of Safford if the Tribe diverts storage water along Bonita Creek; and upon the City of Globe, as the settlement agreement affects the city's right to use groundwater beneath the reservation. The technical report may be inspected at DWR or at the office of every Superior Court Clerk in Arizona. It is also available on DWR's website: www.adwr.state.az.us. The report can be purchased from DWR for $45. Public Meeting The settling parties held a court-ordered public meeting on June 2 to describe the settlement and answer questions. Approximately 90 people attended the meeting at the Department of Water Resources. Objections to be Filed Unless Judge Bolton grants the motion to stop the approval process, the next important date in the proceeding is July 1 when any objections to the settlement must be filed with the Court. Thereafter, the settling parties have an opportunity to reply to the objections, file motions, and the Special Master will schedule proceedings to hear those objections and motions.

Volume 7 Number 3 John E. Thorson, Special Master Kathy Dolge, Assistant to Special Master EM E C OU PR  The Department reports that the maximum number of acres ever irrigated on the reservation was 3,000 acres in 1901. In 1988, the Department had identified almost 500 acres that were being irrigated. At present, the Department estimates the reservation's existing water use at 11,323 acre feet per year. The Department also suggested a range of values that might represent the water right the Tribe could possibly prove, if based on the practicably  5  5  E  Z O F ARI  Office of Special Master 1501 W.

Dawson, a Superior Court Judge in Gila County who sits in Globe, was appointed by the Arizona Supreme Court to the adjudication on January 28, 1999. Continuing the practice in use previously, Judge Dawson asked for statements from representatives of the actively negotiating parties. Both the Hopi Tribe and Navajo Nation reported that most of the issues between them had been resolved, although the Hopi Tribe is seeking additional funds through the settlement in order to bring a water pipeline to Third Mesa. Similarly, the attorney for the State Land Department and State Game and Fish Department reported that the resolution of their remaining issues was on schedule. The attorney for Phelps Dodge Corporation briefly described for Judge Dawson the settlement that has been worked out with the Gila River Indian Community, thus allowing Phelps Dodge to contribute Show Low Lake and Blue Ridge Reservoir to the Little Colorado settlement. The overall cost of the settlement is of concern to some of the parties, such as the Salt River Project whose attorney counseled that all main points of the agreement need to be resolved for the costly settlement to be approved by 3 Yuma Congress. The attorney for the Pueblo of Zuni reported that her client needs more time to work with the other parties in developing a water acquisition plan that will allow the restoration of land having religious importance for the Pueblo. The attorney for the National Park Service, Forest Service, and other federal land management agencies indicated that he has been successful in negotiating separate agreements with many of the major water users. The attorney for the Department of Water Resources, however, indicated that the Department needs to scrutinize these agreements to insure consistency with other aspects of state water law and policy. Some of the attorneys were hopeful that an aggressive negotiating schedule could lead to an agreement  3  Kykotsmovi  3  3 3 Prescott  Window Rock  Flagstaff  3 Snowflake 3 3 Show Low 3 Pinetop  Saint Johns  3  Phoenix  3  Tucson  by the end of June, which would be followed by the introduction of a bill by the Arizona Congressional delegation in July, and Congressional hearings in the fall. Other attorneys indicated they believe most of the summer will be necessary to reach an agreement on the remaining issues. Judge Dawson concluded the hearing by urging the parties to redouble their efforts, with the assistance of Settlement Judge Mike Nelson, and to recognize that they should reach an agreement soon as events do not remain ""frozen in time."" Judge Dawson allowed the settlement processes to continue and set another status conference in St. Johns for 9:30 a.m. on Thursday, July 15, 1999.  M AY- J U N E 1 9 9 9    Arizona General Stream Adjudication Bulletin    Page 3   Gila River Proceedings May 14 Hearing Judge Susan R. Bolton held a hearing on May 14, 1999, to take up pending motions and other matters concer ning the Gila River adjudication. In addition to the challenge to the special proceedings involving the San Carlos Apache water rights settlement ( see lead article), the judge hear d matters concerning the water right claims of the Gila River Indian Community and possible proceedings concerning the Globe Equity Decree and its impact on the San Carlos Apache Tribe. The Gila River Indian Community and the United States have requested of the court a 60-day delay in the filing of responses to the major motions for summary judgment that have been filed in the case. These motions addr ess the question of whether the water rights of the Gila River Indian Community have been deter mined by a federal court proceeding known as Globe Equity 59 ( see Aug.-Oct. 1998 Bulletin , p. 4). The Gila River Indian Community and the United States argued that there is an accelerated ef fort to reach a settlement concerning the Indian Community's water rights and that Senator Jon Kyl, who is aiding these discussions, has set a deadline of June 30, 1999, for their conclusion. If a settlement is reached, a bill may be introduced into Congress in July with Congressional hearings in the fall. Judge Bolton granted the motion and ordered that responses to the motions for summary judgment are now due on August 2, 1999, and replies to these pleadings are due on September 3, 1999. Delay in Scheduling Other Threshold Issues The Gila River Indian Community, the United States, and the Salt River Project had earlier agreed on a schedule to file and respond to motions concer ning what other decrees or proceedings might have already deter mined the Indian Community's water rights. Judge Bolton modified the schedule for these motions by ordering that the opening 3 Yuma motions be filed on August 2, 1999, with responses on September 30, 1999, and replies on October 29, 1999. Judge Bolton also ordered that any other parties seeking to file motions according to this schedule indicate, in a preliminary fashion, their intent to do so. Following Judge Bolton's hearing, ASARCO, Inc. and the San Carlos Irrigation and Drainage District identified additional legislation, contracts, agreements, and proceedings that they may use in their motions. Globe Equity Impact on San Carlos Apache Tribe The Gila Valley Irrigation District and Franklin Irrigation District have requested that the Court take up the possible impact of the Globe Equity 59 Decree on the water rights of the San Carlos Apache T ribe. The impact of this federal court decree on the Gila River Indian Community has already been raised in issues pending before the Court. These districts argue that the decree may  3 3 Prescott  Flagstaff  3  Phoenix  3  San Carlos  3  3 Sells  Tucson  3 3  Benson Sierra Vista 3 Bisbee  affect the San Carlos Apache Tribe as well, and that it would be more ef ficient to take up this question now than to wait several years for it to come up in the context of the hydrographic survey report for the area. Judge Bolton indicated she will further address this matter at her next hearing. Other Matters Several of the water users in the Santa Cruz watershed asked the Court for an order instructing the Department of Water Resources to provide technical assistance in reaching a settlement in that region. The judge ordered the parties to consult with the Department, and the matter will be taken up at the next hearing. The Department was also requested to report on the continued on page 5...

The Court deferred indefinitely the scheduling of proceedings on the Special Master's report on cases involving stockwatering, stockponds, and domestic uses in the San Pedro watershed. The Special Master was requested to work with the Steering Committee and DWR in attempting to improve the accuracy of names and addresses for claimants in the Gila River adjudication. The next hearing is scheduled for 9:00 a.m. on Tuesday, June 29, 1999 (note that the hearing time is earlier in the day than usual).  The Chattmans allege they are entitled to attor neys fees because they believe the dispute arose from a contract. They claim attor neys fees in the amount of $118,000, plus $49,000 in taxable costs. The Chattmans indicate that the attorneys fees and costs are attributable to the water law-related aspects of the civil case in Superior Court, as well as proceedings in the adjudication court. The attorneys fees represent more than 730 hours of time. The T rimbles, as would be expected, oppose the fee and cost request, arguing that the dispute did not arise in contract, that it is difficult to separate the water law from the other matters in the overall litigation, and that the Trimbles have prevailed on most of the issues when the outcomes of all of the many proceedings are considered. The Special Master hear d oral arguments on the request on June 8. He took the matter under advisement and a decision is expected shortly.

Chattman The litigation between neighbors north of Cave Creek over a small spring has resulted in a request for a very large award of attorneys fees and costs. On March 3, 1999, Judge Susan R. Bolton filed an order approving the Special Master's report which concluded that the water source in question is not appropriable water under Arizona law and, thus, the claims of both parties had to be dismissed from the adjudication. This resulted in the inability of the Trimbles, who had brought the case in the Gila River adjudication, to continue to use water from the spring on the Chattmans' property. The Trimbles have reportedly drilled a well and found water on their land. On April 19, attor neys for the Chattmans filed an application for attor neys fees and costs, the latest phase in litigation that extends back four years and has involved trials and hearings before three Superior Court judges and justice court before the matter was referred to the adjudication court.

The original court files for both cases will remain as part of the Arizona History and Archives collection.  Judicial Canons... continued from page 1 While the reasons for Supreme Court justices removing themselves from cases are not usually disclosed, three of the justices have recused themselves from recent water adjudication proceedings, apparently because they have practiced with firms that remain active in the cases. The new amendment to Canon 3(E) removes the indefinite reach of the previous language. Now, judges must wait seven years before hearing a case in which a former partner or associate was involved. This change may result in at least some of the justices, who have recused themselves in the past, hearing water adjudication proceedings in the future. When the proposed rule was first circulated by the court, the San Carlos, Tonto, and YavapaiApache T ribes lodged comments, as did the Navajo Nation and Hopi Tribe. Their comments may have had some impact, as the Court extended the time period fr om five to seven years in the final version which went into ef fect on June 1.  Li t tle Colorado Humor When negotiations get tense in the Little Colorado River discussions, the judge and parties apparently turn to humor. The following aside recently leaked from those highly confidential sessions: Conventional wisdom says that when you discover you are riding a dead horse, the best strategy is to dismount. However, in water negotiations we often try other strategies with dead horses, including: Sending a delegation to W ashington to see how ver y dead horses are ridden. Assigning a ""Plain Language Committee"" to redefine the horse. Consulting with the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service  they have never seen a dead horse. Harnessing several dead horses together for increased speed. Providing additional funding to increase the horse's performance. Say this horse was procured with 1995 dollars. Declaring that ""No horse is too dead to beat.""

PA02-2-000, EL02-113-000, EL02-114-000, EL02-115-000, EL00-95-045 and EL00-98-042  COMMISSION TAKES ENFORCEMENT ACTION AGAINST SIX COMPANIES After six months into a staff probe into behavior that may have distorted electric and natural gas prices in Western energy markets, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission today launched formal investigations into instances of possible misconduct by Avista Corporation and Avista Energy, Inc., El Paso Electric Company, and three Enron corporate affiliates -- Enron Power Marketing, Inc., Enron Capital and Trade Resources Corporation and Portland General Electric Corporation. Today's Commission actions stem from findings in an interim FERC Staff Report, also issued today, on potential manipulation of short-term electric and natural gas prices in the West. Key findings and recommendations in the staff fact-finding investigation are:  there exists sufficient evidence to warrant formal investigations of possible violations of the Federal Power Act by Portland General Electric Company, Enron Power Marketing, Inc., Enron Capital Trade Resources Corporation, El Paso Electric Company and Avista Corporation and Avista Energy. historically, the spot prices for natural gas at the California delivery points highly correlate with prices at producing basins and Henry Hub. During the months of October 2000 to July 2001  the refund period in the California refund proceeding  the correlation was abnormally low. Since that time, the high correlation has resumed. (More)    R-02-31   (2)   given the abnormal correlation for this isolated period, staff attempted to independently verify the price data to assure that it is statistically valid, reliable and free from the effects of price manipulation. the published natural gas spot prices at the California borderCalifornia delivery pointsused as a basis for refunds in the pending California refund proceedings (Docket Nos. EL00-95-045 and EL00-98-042) cannot be independently verified and may have been manipulated. Enron's trading strategies, described in the previously released Enron memos, used false information in an attempt to manipulate prices. staff recommends that the Commission require that all market-based rate tariffs include language specifically prohibiting misleading or false misinformation. This will allow refunds for any revenues obtained in violation of the tariff. staff recommends that the Commission reevaluate the ""simultaneous offer"" rule that it uses to discipline affiliate transactions to ensure that it is effective and verifiable. staff endorses expanded civil penalty authority applicable to jurisdictional companies that violate Commission orders and regulations.       On February 13, the Commission directed staff to begin a fact-finding investigation into whether any entity, including Enron, manipulated short-term prices in electric or natural gas markets in the West or unduly influenced wholesale prices since January 1, 2000. In conducting this broad investigation, staff was directed to ""obtain information on any and all matters relevant to potential market manipulation in the West...."" The Commission moved quickly in the wake of Enron's declared bankruptcy in December 2001 and allegations that Enron Corporation, through its affiliates, used its market position to distort electric and gas markets in the West. Electric prices in the California markets skyrocketed in the summer of 2000, exacerbated by an inadequate infrastructure and insufficient energy supplies, staff reports. In addition, poor market rules within California provided fertile ground for potential manipulation. In a series of actions taken today, the Commission initiated three separate investigations into possible violations of FERC regulations. In the first instance, the Commission ordered a hearing to look into whether Enron and El Paso Electric may have: adversely affected prices; failed to file rates; and disposed of jurisdictional assets without prior approval, among other things (EL02-113-000). El Paso Electric is not affiliated with El Paso Corp., a natural gas pipeline company engaged in energy trading. R-02-31 (More)   (3) The Commission also ordered an investigation and hearing into possible trading strategies employed by Avista and Enron that were identified in a widely-reported Enron memo as a means to ""game"" the energy trading markets (EL02-115-000). Avista admits that it acted as middleman to facilitate certain transactions between Enron and Portlandan Enron affiliate. The investigation will look into Avista's activities over the 2000-2001 period and address the extent to which Avista engaged in or facilitated certain trading strategies as well as the circumvention of prohibitions on affiliate sales. In a third action, based on the preliminary evidence obtained in the staff investigation of questionable transactions between Enron and Portland, the Commission ordered a hearing and investigation (EL02-114-000) into whether the companies violated their codes of conduct and the Commission's standards of conduct. Codes of conduct govern, among other things, a power marketer's relationship with its traditional public utility and include limitations on its ability to sell at market-based rates to its affiliate with captive customers. Standards of conduct generally require that employees involved in transmission functions operate independently from employees working in the wholesale merchant operations. The report noted that historically, the spot prices for natural gas at the California delivery points highly correlate with prices at the producing basins and Henry Hub. During the refund periodOctober 2000 to July 2001the correlation was abnormally low. The high level of correlation has since resumed. The report found that natural gas spot prices at the California border, during the refund period noted above, had limited internal verification and no external validation; may have been manipulated; and, there were incentives for market participants to manipulate reported prices. Refunds are tied to the mitigated market clearing price (MMCP), whose formula relies on published gas spot prices in California or at the California border. In light of these staff findings, the Commission is asking for comment on the method for determining natural gas prices in order to calculate refunds. The separate notice issued today gives parties to the proceeding 30 days to file comments with the Commission (EL00-95-045 and EL00-98-042). If the Enron companies, El Paso Electric, or Avista are found to have violated federal law, the Commission could revoke their market-based rate authority. If any of the companies are found to have violated a FERC rule, regulation, tariff or order, they may be ordered to disgorge any profits obtained while engaging in the prohibited activities.

Commission staff will continue to investigate the trading operations in the Western markets and said that in addition to other potential lines of inquiry that may develop, the final report will contain:  an explanation of Enron OnLine (EOL) operations and the role it played in the energy markets, including a discussion of staff coordination with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and other agencies, and interviews with former Enron employees; an analysis of selective sales data from short-term, seasonal and long-term forward contracts staff collected from information requests. Staff will explain the results of the statistical analysis of such data, including findings of how, and to what extent, forward prices directly correlate with spot energy prices; an analysis of wash trades in electricity and natural gas markets in the West; a discussion of staff's findings from its investigation into allegations that Williams Co. had attempted to manipulate natural gas markets in the West. Williams invited FERC staff to investigate these allegations. an analysis of the relationship between physical and financial natural gas and electric products; recommended standards and protocols for dealing with physical withholding.

GX019-05-5604585	"Washington          Asks FERC for Fairness in Western Power Market          Olympia - The Attorney General's Office filed papers today asking federal          regulators to look at new evidence that supports granting refunds to Northwest          utilities that were charged unjustly inflated prices by power suppliers          during 2000-2001.         The filing with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) asserts          that new evidence provided by Pacific Northwest utilities shows that the          Western electricity market was not competitive and prices were unjustly          inflated during a crisis in 2000-2001.         A FERC administrative          law judge issued a preliminary ruling in October 2001 that Northwest electricity          prices - hundreds of times higher than normal - were the product of a          fair market. In California, FERC ruled that the same prices were unjust          and allowed the buyers to seek refunds.         Prices spiked as high as $3,000 per megawatt-hour during the crisis and          were persistently several hundred dollars per megawatt-hour. Historically,          prices have been below $50 per megawatt-hour.         ""The Western power markets are connected, integrated, and interdependent,""          Attorney General Christine Gregoire said. ""We don't think the same          excessive price can be considered unjust in California and fair and reasonable          here.""         In December FERC granted Northwest utilities' requests to present new          proof that the market was not competitive during the crisis.         ""Many pieces of evidence came to light after the judges preliminary          ruling,"" Gregoire said. ""Seattle City Light and Tacoma Power          have worked diligently to gather supporting information that rates were          not reasonable. Their customers deserve equitable treatment.""         Some of the new information came from memos released by FERC indicating          that Enron, and possibly other sellers may have manipulated energy markets          throughout the West, causing Northwest utilities and their customers to          pay inflated power rates. FERC has recently required other sellers, including          Reliant and El Paso Electric, to pay millions for their roles in the crisis.          FERC has indicated it would like to resolve many outstanding issues          surrounding the energy crisis as early as this spring.          -30-                            Index"

This order addresses the requests for rehearing filed by Enron Corporation (Enron) and jointly by Citrus Corporation (Citrus) and Northern Border Partners, L.P. (NBP) of the Commission's September 15, 2003 order in Docket No. PA02-2-000 (September 15 Order), which directed the re-release of documents submitted in Docket No. PA02-2-000.1 No other parties filed requests for rehearing of the September 15 Order.2 This order also addresses the motion filed by the California Attorney General, the California Electricity Oversight Board, the Cal ifornia Public Utilities Commission, Southern California Edison Company, and Pacific Gas and Electric Company (collectively, the California Parties), which requested that the Commission identify the universe of documents in the above captioned proceedings, and to explain what documents have not been made public and why. Background 2. On March 5, 2003, the Commission issued a notice that it intended to release to the public information collected in its investigation into manipulation of energy prices in the West, and sought, by March 12, 2003, comments from those companies and individuals who submitted information during the course of the investigation. Eighteen companies or organizations, as well as the United States Attorney for the Southern District of Texas, filed comments or otherwise responded. On March 21, 2003, the Commission issued an order addressing the comments and responses to its March 5, 2003 notice, and further announced that it would release the information, except as noted in the order, in no less than five days after issuance of the order. 102 FERC  61,311 (March 21 Order). One exception to the release was personal personnel information that was raised by three of the commenters. In this regard, the Commission asked that compani es or individuals provide specifics by March 24, 2003, so that such information  Fact Finding Investigation of Potential Manipulation of Electric and Natural Gas Prices, 104 FERC  61,294 (2003). HGP, Inc. (HGP) filed comments on the September 15 Order, but did not seek rehearing. HGP's concerns were adequately addressed in prior Commission orders issued in this proceeding. See, e.g., 1 04 FERC  61,294 at P 10. 2  1   Docket No. PA02- 2- 000, et al.  -3-  could be excluded from the public release. One company provided such details. Thereafter, on March 26, 2003, the Commission released the remaining information. 3. Subseque nt to the release of the information, on March 28, 2003, the Commission received the first of seven motions from Enron asking that certain parts of the released information be removed from public access. These motions in particular attempted to identify Enron employees' personal information. The Commission also received calls on its Enforcement Hotline from Enron employees who were concerned about their personal information being available on the internet. As quickly as possible, the Commission staff accommodated these requests in keeping with the Commission's stated concerns in the March 21 Order about releasing certain personal data. 4. Further, on April 7, 2003, the Secretary of the Commission issued a notice (April 7 Notice) that the Commission wo uld remove temporarily, until April 24, 2003, Enron e -mails that had been placed on the agency's web site pursuant to the March 21 Order. The notice indicated that during that time the Commission would consider any requests that certain personal and other information be permanently removed from public accessibility. 5. In the meantime, on April 4, 2003, Enron filed a petition for writ of mandamus and an emergency motion to stay the March 21 Order in the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, Enron Corp. v. FERC, No. 03-60295, requesting that all Enron e -mails posted on the Commission's web site be removed. No other party filed a motion in court requesting a stay of the March 21 Order. On April 7, 2003, the court denied Enron's petition f or writ of mandamus, and granted the stay request, but only to the extent that it directed the Commission to remove all Enron e -mails from its web site until further order of the court. The court also directed the Commission to file a response in this proceeding by close of business April 11, 2003. Subsequently, in light of the Commission's removal of the Enron e -mails from its web site on April 7, the court granted Enron's motion to hold the case in abeyance and to defer the need for the Commission to file a response by April 11, 2003, until April 24, 2003. Accordingly, the Commission's April 7 action removing the Enron e -mails from its web site coincided exactly with the Fifth Circuit's stay of the March 21 Order to the extent the stay action implicated the withdrawal of Enron e -mails from the agency's web site. 6. On April 22, 2003, the Commission issued an Order on Re -Release of Data Removed from Public Accessibility on April 7, 2003. 103 FERC  61,077 (2003) (April 22 Order). In the April 22 Or der, the Commission stated that it would not re-release any of the documents that respondents sought to be withheld with specificity until the Commission had reviewed those documents and given the respondents and the   Docket No. PA02- 2- 000, et al.  -4-  public notice of its intent t o re-release specific documents. Id. at P 7 -8. As the Commission directed in its April 22 Order, its staff is currently reviewing the data proffered for removal to ascertain whether indeed it should be in the public domain. No one sought rehearing of the April 22 Order. 7. With respect to the data that was removed from the Commission's web site pursuant to the April 7 Notice but that was not identified by any company or individual for permanent removal, as directed by the Commission, Commission staff returned that data to the agency's web site. See 103 FERC  61,077 at P 9. 8. On September 15, 2003, the Commission issued its first order on the re-release of documents in accord with the April 22 Order. 104 FERC  61,294. The September 15 Order identified 12,057 documents as appropriate for re-release and 5,128 documents as appropriate for permanent removal because the y contain information not relating to the investigation including social security numbers, home telephone numbers, employee performance evaluations, personal photographs, and spam. Requests for Rehearing 9. On October 15, 2003, Enron filed a request for rehearing of the September 15 Order, contending that the Commission acted arbitrarily and capriciously when it directed the release of information that is exempt from disclosure by law and unrelated to the investigation in this proceeding. Enron further asserts that the release of such information will cause irreparable harm to Enron and others. Enron specifically seeks rehearing of the decision to release 255 documents, which Enron claims contain personal information. 10. Also, o n October 15, 2003, Citrus and NBP jointly filed a request for rehearing of the September 15 Order.3 Citrus and NBP contend that: (1) they may not be deemed to have had notice that its documents would be released; (2) the Commission acted arbitrarily and capriciously when it directed the release of information that is protected by law or unrelated to the investigation in this proceeding; and (3) the release of information will cause irreparable harm to the m. Citrus and NBP assert that 1,061 documents which relate to Citrus and NBP and were identified for re-release are unrelated to the 3  Enron is a joint venture partner in Citrus and NBP.

Motion and Answers Regarding the Release of Information 11. On September 30, 2003, the California Parties filed a motion that the Commission: (1) ensure a full and fair disclosure of all documents and data received by the Commission in Docket No. PA02-2-000, et al., as well as the full disclosure of all responses to data requests; (2) direct sellers to submit working papers for the March 20, 2003 filings and the May 12, 2003 gas cost allowance filings; and (3) provide an index of all documents pro vided to the Commission in Docket No. PA02-2-000, and related proceedings . 12. Timely answers to the California Parties' motion were filed by: Enron; Citrus and NBP ; the City of Burbank, California (Burbank), the City of Glendale, Californi a (Glendale), and Turlock Irrigation District (Turlock); Reliant Energy Power Generation, Inc., Mirant California, LLC, Mirant Delta, LLC, and Mirant Potrero, LLC., Dynegy Power Marketing, Inc., El Segundo Power LLC, Long Beach Generation LLC, Cabrillo Power I LLC and Cabrillo Power II LLC, and Williams Power Company, Inc., formerly known as Williams Energy Marketing & Trading Company (collectively, the California Generators); Duke Energy North America, L.L.C. and Duke Energy Trading and Marketing, L.L.C. ( collectively, Duke Energy); and El Paso Merchant Energy, L.P. (El Paso Merchant). 13. In their answers, t wo of the respondents contend that the Commission is appropriately ensuring a full and fair disclosure of all documents obtained in Docket No. PA02-2-000 through its current review process. Enron, at p. 5; Citrus and NBP at pp. 2 -5. Several respondents express concern that the release of the information at issue could jeopardize ongoing investigations, and have a chilling effect on companies complying with future investigations. California Generators, at pp. 4-6; El Paso Merchant, at pp. 5 -6. Respondents also remark that the release of documents that were submitted to the Commission staff in confidence in connection with on- going investigations would be inappropriate because it could interfere with the Commission staff's ability to complete its investigations adequately and may discourage parties from entering into settlement negotiations . El Paso Merchant , at pp. 7 -9; Duke Energy, at p. 2; California Generators, at pp. 6 -8. Respondents also contend that the California Parties failed to take advantage of the appropriate discovery period to obtain the working papers at issue. Duke Energy, at pp. 2-3; California Generators, at p. 9. One r espondent in particular asserts that the request 14.   Docket No. PA02- 2- 000, et al.  -6-  for working papers was untimely as it related to both the March 20, 2003 and May 12, 2003 filings. Duke, at pp. 2 -3. Noting that the California P arties did not provide to all other parties the work papers of its March 20, 2003 filing, another respondent o bjects to the California Parties' demand that parties claiming fuel cost offsets provide working papers for those filings , and argue s that all parties had the opportunity to obtain the information through discovery. California Generators, at pp. 9-10. 15. Three respondents express concerns with the California Parties' request that Commission staff compile an index of all PA02-2-000 documents, as well as other relevant materials received by the Commission in proceedings that grew out of that docket. Burbank, Glendale, and Turlock, at pp. 5 -6; Citrus and NBP , at pp. 5 -6; Enron, at p. 7. Enron does not object to such an index if it does not publicly divulge sensitive personal and commercial information. Enron, at p. 7. However, Citrus and NBP , and Burbank, Glendale, and Turlock contend that the creation of such an index in itself would be unreasonable and unduly burdensome under the circumstances. Citrus and NBP , at p. 6 ; Burbank, Glendale, and Turlock, at pp. 5 -6. Citrus and NBP , in particular, express concern that compiling such an index could detract from Commission staff's current effort to review the remaining non- public documents in Docket No. PA02-2-000. Citrus and NBP , at p. 6. Discussion 16. Enron's contention that a relatively small number of documents identified for re-release contain personal information is correct. In its review of the massive number of documents identified for permanent removal, Commission staff inadvertently identified some documents containing personal information for re-release. As the Commission has previously ordered that such documents not be returned to public access, see 103 FERC  61,077 P 7, the Commission grants Enron's request for rehearing as to those documents that contain personal information. However, some documents identified by Enron as containing personal information actually contain information that is appropriate for rerelease because they do not contain the personal information alleged, and t hey do not fall within the categories identified by the Commission as appropriate for permanent removal . See id. at P 7 -8. The refore, the Commission denies Enron's request for rehearing as to these documents, which are identified in Appendix A to this order. 17. On March 5, 2003, at the latest, Enron and others were put on notice of the Commission's intent to release documents obtained during the investigation conducted in this proceeding. Eighteen companies and individuals responded to the March 5 Notice. Enron, Citrus , and NBP did not respond to that notice or to the March 21 Order that provided further opportunity to bring personal information to the Commission's attention.   Docket No. PA02- 2- 000, et al.  -7-  As described supra note 3 , Enron is a parent corporation of Citrus and NBP. Although there is no argument that Enron was put on notice of the Commission's intent to release documents, Citrus and NBP ma ke a colorable argument that they did not receive such notice. Therefore, the Commission grants for now the ir request not to re-release the documents identified in their request for rehearing. Within seven days from the date of this order, Citrus and NBP must identify for the Commission the 1,061 documents, as well as any others that are not currently publicly available, alleged to be their documents. 18. Under these circumstances, t he Commission hereby gives notice that it intends to release to the public any of Citrus' and NBP 's documents that relate to the Commission's investigation into manipulation of energy prices in the West, including information that led to any of the show cause orders issued in related proceedings or that illustrate the corporate relationship of Enron with its affiliates.4 Written comments are due within seven days from the date of this notice, and should c learly explain any opposition to or support of the release of these documents, or portions thereof, and the rationale for that position. All comments filed in response to this notice must be detailed and specific. The Commission will not be persuaded by conclusory statements as to why the information deserves protection. 19. Once Commission staff receives the identity of the documents, review will be undertaken to determine which of the identified e -mails, if any, contain personal information that has nothing to do with the Commission's investigation. None of those e-mails will be re-released. Nevertheless, as the Commission has previously stated, the Commission intended to release as much information as possible to enable the public to understand better the bases for its determinations in the report on the Enron investigation issued the same day as the information was released and other decisions that might flow from that report. See, e.g., 103 FERC  61,077 at P 7. The Commission clarifies here that such information includes evidence discussed in the Final Staff Report issued in Docket No. PA02-2-000 that Enron and its affiliates may have acted inconsistently with their market-based rate authority, not only by engaging in gaming, but also by failing to inform the Commission in a timely manner of changes in their market shares by gaining influence or control over others' facilities in violation of their market-based rate authority.  As the Commission finds that Citrus and NBP may not have adequately received notice that the Commission would release documents obtained in Docket No. PA02-2000, and is giving such notice here, Citrus and NBP's remaining arguments on rehearing are dismissed as untimely.  4   Docket No. PA02- 2- 000, et al.  -8-  20. The Commission denies the California Parties' motion as administratively unnecessary and burdensome . First, as detailed above, the Commission currently has a process in place to review the remaining non-public documents obtained in Docket No. PA02-2-000.5 See 104 FERC  61,294 at P 8. 21. Second, preparing an inde x of the documents obtained in PA02-2-000 and related proceedings would create an undue burden on Commission staff which is currently in the process of determining which of the 141,379 documents are appropriate for re-release, i.e., all documents containing information related to the Commission's completed investigation in Docket No. PA02-2-000. Preparing such an index would also slow the re-release of the documents. Moreover, the Commission is under no obligation pursuant to the Federal Power Act, 16 U.S .C.  792-823c, or the Natural Gas Act, 15 U.S.C.  717-717w, to create such an index. 22. Third, the Commission cannot allow the California Parties' motion to circumvent the procedures already established by the Commission or the Administrative Law Judges in the relevant proceedings that grew out of Docket No. PA02-2-000 or involve Western market issues. 23. Finally, the California Parties have included in the coverage of their motion documents in ""other undocketed investigations . "" By definition, s uch investigations would generally be conducted under Section 1b of the Commissions regulations, 18 C.F.R.  1b, and be non-public investigations in two senses of the word ""non-public."" Unless announced or publicly discussed by the Commission, such investigations are not known to the general public.6 Furthermore, such investigations are not open to the 5  As detailed in the March 21 Order, the record in Docket No. PA02-2-000 intended for release amounted to over 2 terabytes of information, which would fill 1.5 million floppy diskettes or 3, 341 compact diskettes. 102 FERC  6 1,311 at n.1. Ultimately, after the steps taken in response to the reaction of Enron, its current and former employees, and others to the actual release of information on March 26, see supra P 3 -6, the Commission withdrew 141,379 emails, which are now the subject of review by Commission staff. As the Commission previously described the matter, these documents, which amount to approximately eight percent of the Enron e -mails removed from public access on April 7, 2003, fill no more than one compact diskette out of 3,341 compact diskettes of information released on March 26, 2003. 103 FERC & 61,077 at n.3. For example, the Commission publicly discussed an undocketed investigation into the physical withholding of capacity at its March 26, 2003 meeting. 6   Docket No. PA02- 2- 000, et al.  -9-  public; participation is limited to the Commission's investigative staff and the companies or individuals contacted by staff. See Fact Finding Investigation of Potential Manipulation of Electric and Natural Gas Prices, et al., 105 FERC  61,063; see also Baltimore Gas & Electric Co. v. FERC, 252 F.3d 456 (D.C. Cir. 2001). 24. Against this backdrop, the Commission denies the California Parties' r equest for non-public information in ""other undocketed proceeding,"" as inconsistent with the purposes of the non- public treatment of investigatory records. First, non-public treatment of investigative information minimizes the potential destruction of evi dence, loss of information and witness collusion that might occur if such information became public before the investigation were to end. Non-public treatment of investigative information also protects persons or companies that provide information from unfair, adverse publicity or financial repercussions that could follow public disclosure of information during an investigation. Next, public disclosure of investigative information could make companies less likely to cooperate in future investigations. This cooperation is an important component in performing investigations on a reasonable timeline and in negotiating settlements. Finally, keeping investigative information non-public protects the integrity of ongoing investigations into related matters. The Commission is not conceding that such records actually exist, only that such records may exist. In the event such records exist, their release or identification is not appropriate at this time as such release or identification could jeopardize the Commission's ability to complete any investigations. The Commission orders: (A) Enron's request for rehearing is granted in part and denied in part as described above. (B) (C) Citrus and NBP's request for rehearing is granted as described above. California Parties' motion is denied.  (D) Staff is directed to return data not identified by any respondent, as discussed in this order, to the agency's web site. (E) Notice is hereby given that pursuant to the Commission's regulations, 18 C.F.R. ' 388.112(d) (2003), the Commission intends to release Citrus' and NBP's documents submitted in Docket No. PA02-2-000 that relate to the Commission's investigation in that proceeding.

GX117-02-9569945	"News From   Congressman Dennis Cardoza 18th Congressional District of California             Cardoza Continues Fight For California Ratepayers                         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE January 9, 2003     CONTACT: JENNIFER WALSH (202) 225-6131               WASHINGTON    Congressman Dennis Cardoza (D-Atwater) today stood strong with the California Congressional Delegation in calling on Patrick Wood, III, Chairman of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, to substantially increase the refund amount proposed on December 12, 2002, by Administrative Law Judge Bruce L. Birchman in the California Refund Case (EL00-95-045). (see letter attached below)   ""The gouging has got to stop. I have been involved in this fight from day one and Californians have waited entirely too long to be repaid for the illegal actions of the companies responsible for the energy crisis in California,"" stated Cardoza in response to Birchmans proposed refund.   As a Member of the California Legislature, Cardoza led the State Assembly in testifying before FERC regarding the manipulation of Californias energy market and served as one of the Assemblys chief advocates for California ratepayers.           January 9, 2003   The Honorable Patrick Wood, III, Chairman   Federal Energy Regulatory Commission   888 First Street, NE   Washington, D.C. 20426   Dear Chairman Wood,   We write to urge you to increase substantially the refund amount which was proposed by FERC Administrative Law Judge Bruce L. Birchman in the California refund case (EL00-95-045) on December 12, 2002.    Judge Birchman found that suppliers overcharged California power purchasers by $1.8 billion during the 2000-2001 energy crisis. The judge also reported that California power buyers  owe  $3 billion to suppliers, so if the Commission approves Judge Birchmans proposed findings, Californians will owe $1.2 billion. In our view, given the manipulation of energy supplies and prices in the West, it is unacceptable for the Commission to approve findings that will leave Californians in debt to the energy suppliers that gouged them.    At the very least, Judge Birchmans proposed findings are incomplete because they do not reflect consideration of the full scale of corruption in the California energy market. The judge was constrained by the instructions the Commission provided when it initiated the refund proceedings on July 25, 2001. The Commissions instructions failed to allow the consideration of information that was discovered  after  the instructions were handed down.    Since July 2001, weve learned (and we continue to learn) a great deal about the malfeasance that influenced the price of energy in California and the West. If this information had been a factor in Judge Birchmans findings, it would have led to a higher proposed refund. Specific allegations and admissions of market manipulation include, among others:     May 6, 2002  - The release of internal Enron documents, describing how the company manipulated the California electricity market to increase prices artificially.      September 17, 2002  - The release of a California Public Utilities Commission study indicating five major generators withheld power, causing rolling blackouts in California.     September 23, 2002  - Administrative Law Judge Curtis Wagners finding that El Paso Corp. withheld natural gas capacity during the California energy crisis.     September 24, 2002  - The Securities and Exchange Commission fine of Dynegy for $3 million for illegal round-trip trades and other illegal activities.     October 17, 2002  - The guilty plea of former Enron energy trader Timothy Belden on wire fraud charges in connection with his actions to manipulate prices in the California electricity market.     November 18, 2002  - The testimony of Michelle Markey, former director of energy research at  Gas Daily  before a California State Senate committee, stating that energy companies made false submissions about the price they purchased and sold gas for.     December 3, 2002  - The indictment of a former El Paso Corporation gas trader on charges that he fabricated natural gas transactions and reported them to a price index publisher.     January 6, 2003  - The release of a report from the California Independent System Operator, identifying companies that followed the deceptive practices described in the Enron memos.   These allegations and admissions, particularly the manipulation of natural gas price indices, should have been part of the record and the basis for Judge Birchmans proposed findings. They were not.    In determining refunds, Judge Birchman estimated the fair price of electricity in large part on the cost of natural gas, which is used to fuel many power plants. In so doing, he relied on industry- compiled indices. The manipulation of these indices described above creates serious doubts about the accuracy of Judge Birchmans proposed findings.    We also think that Judge Birchmans proposed findings unfairly exclude the overcharges suffered by the California Department of Water Resources. Since retail consumers in California ultimately pay these overcharges, its irrelevant which agency or utility served as the purchaser and distributor of power. Consumers should be made whole by the Commissions decision.   Finally, were concerned that Judge Birchmans proposed findings rely heavily upon data provided by energy suppliersthe very suppliers who have been accused of and in some cases admitted to wrongdoing in the California energy market. Their submissions are tainted by their actions. Even if there isnt an alternative source for the data, the Commission should consider the information with a grain of salt.    Again, we urge the Commission in the strongest way possible to increase substantially the refund recommendation before it and we ask for a timely response to our call for this policy direction. Thank you for your attention.

The Attorney General last week sent a team from his Energy Task Force to Enron's west coast energy trading office in Portland, Ore., to speed retrieval of subpoenaed documents and computer files.     ""Instead of being able to quickly pack up materials, my Energy Task Force found a near-useless index to more than 940 boxes in Portland and even had to sift through ‘recycling' boxes that contained crusted food containers, food residue, discarded Kleenex, mail order catalogs and personal mail,"" Lockyer said. ""Enron has been equally contemptible in failing to turn over subpoenaed materials from its offices in California and Texas.""   The Attorney General filed his renewed demand with the San Francisco Superior Court, which set a hearing for March 28.  The San Francisco Superior Court had delayed a contempt ruling after ordering the company to comply by March 13 and furnish documents and computer files not specifically protected by attorney-client privilege.   ""Each time we've gotten close to court sanctions, Enron's backed down and said it would turn over the materials we want,"" Lockyer said. ""Despite being ordered five months ago to comply with our subpoenas, Enron made little or no effort to produce the materials we want for the state's investigation into possible misconduct during California's energy crisis. We'll accept no more excuses from Enron.""   Lockyer said the aim is to get information from the company for the state's investigation into potential unfair and illegal business practices by power generators and other companies.    The Attorney General last year warned Enron against the destruction of subpoenaed materials and reinforced protection of the documents through a court order issued January 23 by Judge A. James Robertson.       # # # #   BACK                                                                                          OFFICE OF THE AG  |  PROGRAMS & SERVICES  |  NEWS & ALERTS  |  PUBLICATIONS  |  CONTACT US  |  SEARCH REGISTERING WITH US  |  CAREER OPPORTUNITIES  |  LINKS TO STATE SITES Privacy Policy  |  Terms & Conditions  |  © 2001 DOJ"

Lockyer called on FERC to reopen its hearing on the refund request in a petition filed Wednesday, submitting new evidence showing attempts by power companies to manipulate electricity prices in the West. The evidence included documents obtained under subpoena from Enron's Portland trading office that note other sellers active in the Pacific Northwest as having engaged in similar strategies, including Powerex, Williams, Portland General, Coral and Bonneville Power Authority.   ""These new Enron documents, taken together with the Enron memos released by the Commission on May 6, 2002, further indicate that Enron (and perhaps numerous other suppliers) engaged in attempts to manipulate the electricity markets in the western United States, including the Pacific Northwest and in California, beginning at least in June 2000,"" the Attorney General told FERC.  ""The Commission should reopen the evidentiary record in this case in order to provide the opportunity of parties to explore these issues and demonstrate that manipulation occurred, that it occurred at a date far earlier than December 25, 2000, and that it occurred not only in California but in the Pacific Northwest as well.""   California and the City of Tacoma had asked FERC last year to grant refunds for unjust and unreasonable rates charged for spot market electricity sales in the Pacific Northwest from December 25, 2000 through June 20, 2001. California is seeking refunds of some $1.5 billion in overcharges.  After asking for quick submissions of evidence in the case, FERC received proposed findings from the administrative law judge who concluded that the market was ""competitive and functional"" and that she saw ""no evidence of the exercise of market power."" FERC has not acted on the findings received in late October.

""To date, Enron has produced only a single document,"" the court was told. ""Enron clearly has no intention of complying fully with the Attorney General's subpoenas, which were issued months ago. Enron's refusal to produce the subpoenaed documents violates the terms of the court's first order and is contrary to law.""   Enron and Enron Energy Services Inc. were served with subpoenas by the Attorney General in June and July 2001. Failing to receive documents being sought,  the Attorney General obtained a court order on October 17, 2001, requiring Enron to comply.   The Attorney General today demanded that Enron stop stonewalling and cooperate in the California Department of Justice's investigation of the power company.  The Attorney General further demanded assurances again from Enron that the documents being sought would not be shredded or otherwise destroyed in light of reports that the company's accounting firm has been destroying records. Enron was admonished a year ago by the Attorney General's office against destroying e-mails or other documents subpoenaed.   The San Francisco Superior Court ordered Enron to appear at a hearing February 20 to show cause why it should not be held in contempt.         # # # #   BACK                                                                                          OFFICE OF THE AG  |  PROGRAMS & SERVICES  |  NEWS & ALERTS  |  PUBLICATIONS  |  CONTACT US  |  SEARCH REGISTERING WITH US  |  CAREER OPPORTUNITIES  |  LINKS TO STATE SITES Privacy Policy  |  Terms & Conditions  |  © 2001 DOJ"

GX048-11-11032951	"Gregoire        to FERC: Reopen Northwest Electrical Refund Case          OLYMPIA - Citing new evidence of unfair market manipulation by Enron          Corp. during last year's power crisis, Attorney General Christine Gregoire          today asked federal regulators to reopen the Northwest electrical refund          case.         In papers filed with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC)          today, the Attorney General's Office challenged an administrative law          judge's ruling last year that the Northwest power market during the crisis          was competitive, and that rates charged by power generators and distributors          were just and reasonable.         ""Given the nature of the new market manipulation information that          is coming to light, those findings … are no longer supportable,""          Gregoire asserts in the papers.          Memos recently released by FERC indicate that Enron, and possibly other          sellers, may have manipulated energy markets throughout the West, causing          Pacific Northwest utilities - and their customers - to pay inflated power          rates.         ""Those memos show that even Enron's own attorneys had serious questions          about the company's behavior,"" Gregoire said.         Last summer, FERC established a formal process for California state agencies          and other parties to show they were entitled to refunds. Hearings on those          requests are currently underway.         In a separate case involving Pacific Northwest utilities that sought          refunds, however, a FERC administrative law judge found that the Pacific          Northwest power market was not subjected to unfair manipulation during          the crisis and recommended against refunds.          In the legal documents filed today, Gregoire notes that even FERC Chairman          Patrick Wood believes that there's evidence of unfair market manipulation          throughout the West, not just in California.         ""Chairman Wood obviously recognizes that this new evidence paints          a much more complete picture of what likely happened in the marketplace,""          Gregoire said. ""Electric utilities throughout the West -- not just          California -- suffered because of Enron's manipulative tactics. As a matter          of fairness, Pacific Northwest utilities should be allowed to make a case          as to why they are entitled to recover those costs.""          -30-                         Index"

In this Memorandum  Opinion and  Order (``Order''),  we    grant in  part a  petition for  reconsideration filed  February    22,   2001  by   Atlantic  Telecommunications   (``Atlantic'').     Atlantic seeks reconsideration of the January 23, 2001,  letter    decision  of the  Deputy  Chief, Technical  and  Public  Safety    Division,  which denied  Atlantic's request  that a  Notice  of    Violation and  Order to Discontinue  Unauthorized Operation  be    issued to Elmont  Trans Med Corporation (``Elmont''),  licensee    of Station WIL722.  2.        In a complaint  filed March 8,  2000, Atlantic  alleged    that  Elmont did  not  timely  construct its  station  and  was    operating at  an unauthorized site  in violation of  Commission    rules.  The complaint  alleged that Elmont's failure to  timely    construct was  verified by monitoring  of the shared  frequency    pair on which Station WIL722 is licensed to operate1  conducted    by New  York Radio Service, Inc.  (``New York Radio'')  between    January  13, 1996  and  February  1, 1997,  and  by  subsequent    conversations  with Elmont  personnel.  The  complaint  further    alleged  that  in December  1998,  New  York  Radio  determined    through subsequent  monitoring that Elmont  had placed  Station    WIL722 into  operation, and  that in September  1999, New  York    Radio  determined  through direction  finding  techniques  that    Elmont  was  operating   Station  WIL722  at  an   unauthorized    location  in the  vicinity  of Queens  Boulevard,  Queens,  New    York.   The January  23, 2001,  letter decision  noted that  in    March  2000,  after  Atlantic's  complaint  was  filed,  Elmont    contacted the  FCC's New York  Field Office to  advise the  FCC    that its  radio equipment  associated with  Station WIL722  had    been  inadvertently placed  in operation  at Queens  Boulevard,    the location for Elmont's other station, WIL708.  The New  York    Field Office  instructed Elmont to move  Station WIL722 to  its    authorized  location  in order  to  correct  the  problem.   On    August  10, 2000,  the  New  York Field  Office  verified  that    Elmont was operating Station WIL722 at its authorized  location    in  North  Shore  Towers, Queens,  New  York.   Based  on  this    information, the letter decision concluded that no  enforcement    action was warranted.    3.        In its  petition for  reconsideration, Atlantic  argues    that  the  letter   decision  incorrectly  concluded  that   no    enforcement  action was  warranted.   Atlantic states  that  it    provided  extensive  evidence  that  Station  WIL722  was   not    operational for more than  a year and that when it did  operate    it did so  at an unauthorized location.  Citing Section  90.157    of the  Commission's Rules (``Rules''),2  Atlantic states  that    it  appears   that  Station  WIL722  permanently   discontinued    operations   and   that  its   associated   license   cancelled    automatically.  4.        Section 1.903(a) of  the Rules  provides, in  pertinent    part,  that stations  in the  Wireless Radio  Services must  be    used   and  operated   only   in  accordance   with   a   valid    authorization  granted  by the  Commission.3   Elmont  admitted    that  it  placed  Station  WIL722  into  operation  at   Queens    Boulevard, rather than  its authorized location in North  Shore    Towers.   We  admonish Elmont  for  its  operation  of  Station    WIL722 from  an unauthorized location  in violation of  Section    1.903(a).4    5.        Whether Elmont's  license  cancelled  automatically  in    1996 or 1997  due to discontinuance of operation under  Section    90.157 of  the Rules is  a separate licensing  issue, which  we    are  hereby   referring  to  the  Wireless   Telecommunications    Bureau.   Because we  are  referring the  license  cancellation    issue to  the Wireless Telecommunications  Bureau, we  conclude    that no enforcement action  on this issue is warranted at  this    time.  6.        Accordingly, IT IS ORDERED, pursuant to Section 405  of    the Communications  Act of 1934, as  amended, 47 U.S.C.   405,    and Section  1.106 of the  Rules, 47 C.F.R.   1.106, that  the    petition  for  reconsideration  filed  February  22,  2001,  by    Atlantic Telecommunications IS GRANTED to the extent  indicated    herein and IS OTHERWISE DENIED.  7.        IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Elmont Trans Med Corporation    IS   ADMONISHED   for  operating   Station   WIL722   from   an    unauthorized location in  violation of Section 1.903(a) of  the    Rules. 8.        IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that a copy of this Order be sent    Certified  Mail  Return   Receipt  Requested  to  counsel   for    Atlantic  Telecommunications, Marilyn  S.

INTRODUCTION       1.   In this  Notice of  Apparent Liability  for  Forfeiture  (``NAL''), we find that Horizon Communications (``Horizon'')  has  apparently violated Section 1.903(a) and Section 90.425(a) of the  Commission's Rules (the  ``Rules'').1  These violations  occurred  because Horizon  operated  stations  WPMT622 and  WPMM811  at  an  unauthorized location  and  failed  to  transmit  the  call  sign  identification on stations WPMT622 and WPMM811.  We conclude that  Horizon is apparently liable  for a forfeiture  in the amount  of  ten thousand dollars ($10,000).                            II.  BACKGROUND       2.   By letter dated July 17, 2002, Westchester County,  the  licensee  of  station   WQR620,  filed  a   complaint  with   the  Enforcement Bureau  alleging  that it  was  experiencing  harmful  interference on  the frequencies  452.700  MHz and  452.725  MHz.   Westchester County  stated  that  interference,  which  had  been  occurring for more than  a year, was from  two taxi companies  in  the New  York City  area.  Westchester  County alleged  that  the  interference was  so  severe  that its  mobile  units  could  not  communicate in the southern area of Westchester County, New York.       3.   On July  29,  2002,  agents  David  Dombrowski  of  the  Philadelphia Office  and  Emil Cherian  of  the New  York  Office  investigated the complaint.   During the  investigation, the  FCC  agents used direction-finding techniques to determine that  radio  transmitting equipment  was positively  being operated  from  the  Cadman Towers,  101  Clark Street,  Manhattan,  New York  on  the  frequencies 452.725 MHz and 462.200 MHz. The FCC agents monitored  radio communications from a taxi company on each frequency.       4.   During further  investigation,  the agents  found  that  Horizon had relocated stations WPMT622 and WPMM811 to the  Cadman  Towers, 101 Clark  Street, Manhattan, New  York to provide  radio  communication service for Eastland  Car Service on the  frequency  452.725 MHz  and  Lower Eastside  Car  Service on  the  frequency  462.200 MHz.  At the time of the investigation, Horizon was  only  authorized to operate  station WPMT622 on  the frequency  462.200  MHz at 1500  Palisade Avenue,  Fort Lee, New  Jersey and  station  WPMM811 on the frequency 452.725 MHz at 195 First Street, Newark,  New Jersey.        5.   On July 29, 2002 between 10:45 a.m. and 11:50 a.m., the  FCC agents monitored the  radio transmissions on the  frequencies  462.200 MHz and 452.725 MHz.  During that period, Horizon  failed  to transmit the call sign identification WPMT622 for the  462.200  MHz station  and the  call sign  identification WPMM811  for  the  452.725 MHz station.  Employees of Eastland Car Service and Lower  Eastside Car Service confirmed that the call sign  identification  was not transmitted by the stations.        6.   On August  5, 2002,  the Philadelphia  Office issued  a  Notice of Violation to Horizon for operating stations WPMT622 and  WPMM811 at  an unauthorized  location,  in violation  of  Section  1.903(a) of  the Rules,  and for  failure to  transmit call  sign  identification for stations WPMM811 and WPMT622, in violation  of  Section 90.425(a) of the Rules.                          III.      DISCUSSION       7.   By letter dated  August 14, 2002,  Horizon submitted  a  response to the Notice of Violation with the Philadelphia Office.   In  the  response,  Horizon  stated  that  it  was  applying  for  authorization from  the  Commission for  Eastland  Car  Service's  operation on the  frequency 452.725  MHz and  Lower Eastside  Car  Service's operation on the  frequency 462.200 MHz.  Horizon  also  agreed to  take  corrective actions  to  transmit the  call  sign  identification on  the  radio  transmitting  equipment  of  Lower  Eastside Car Service and Eastland Car Service.         8.   Based on the evidence before  us, we find that  Horizon  willfully2 and  repeatedly3  violated  Section  1.903(a)  of  the  Rules.   The   Commission's  Forfeiture   Policy  Statement   and  Amendment of  Section  1.80  of  the  Rules  to  Incorporate  the  Forfeiture Guidelines,  12 FCC  Rcd 17087,  17113 (1997),  recon.  denied, 15 FCC Rcd 303(1999) (``Forfeiture Policy  Statement''),4  sets the base  forfeiture amount for  Horizon' operation of  each  station at an unauthorized location at $4,000 and for its failure  to transmit  the  call sign  identification  on each  station  at  $1,000.  In  assessing the  monetary forfeiture  amount, we  must  take into  account the  statutory factors  set forth  in  Section  503(b)(2)(D) of the Communications  Act of 1934,5 (the  ``Act''),  as amended, which include the nature, circumstances, extent,  and  gravity of the violation, and  with respect to the violator,  the  degree of culpability, any history of prior offenses, ability  to  pay, and other such matters as justice may require. Applying  the  Forfeiture Policy  Statement and  the  statutory factors  to  the  instant case and applying  the inflation adjustments, we  believe  that a  ten  thousand  dollar ($10,000)  monetary  forfeiture  is  warranted.                         IV.  ORDERING CLAUSES       9.   Accordingly, IT IS  ORDERED THAT,  pursuant to  Section  503(b) of the  Act,6 and Sections  0.111, 0.311 and  1.80 of  the  Rules,7 Horizon is hereby NOTIFIED of its APPARENT LIABILITY  FOR  A FORFEITURE in the amount of ten thousand dollars ($10,000)  for  its operation of stations WPMT622 and WPMM811 at an  unauthorized  location and its failure to transmit the call sign identification  on stations WPMT622 and WPMM811.          10.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED THAT, pursuant to Section 1.80 of  the Rules, within thirty days of the release date of this  NOTICE  OF APPARENT LIABILITY, Horizon SHALL  PAY the full amount of  the  proposed forfeiture  or SHALL  FILE a  written statement  seeking  reduction or cancellation of the proposed forfeiture.       11.  Payment of  the forfeiture  may be  made by  mailing  a  check or similar instrument, payable to the order of the  Federal  Communications Commission, to the Forfeiture Collection  Section,  Finance  Branch,  Federal  Communications  Commission,  P.O.  Box  73482, Chicago, Illinois 60673-7482.  The payment should note the  NAL/Acct. No. 200332400002 and FRN: 0003-4622-31.         12.  The  response,  if  any,  must  be  mailed  to  Federal  Communications  Commission,  Enforcement  Bureau,  Technical  and  Public Safety Division, 445  12th Street, S.W., Washington,  D.C.  20554 and MUST  INCLUDE THE NAL/Acct.  No. 200332400002 and  FRN:  0003-4622-31.        13.  The Commission will not consider reducing or  canceling  a forfeiture in response  to a claim of  inability to pay  unless  the petitioner  submits: (1)  federal tax  returns for  the  most  recent  three-year  period;  (2)  financial  statements  prepared  according to generally accepted accounting practices  (``GAAP'');  or (3)  some  other  reliable and  objective  documentation  that  accurately reflects  the petitioner's  current financial  status.   Any claim  of inability  to pay  must specifically  identify  the  basis for the claim by  reference to the financial  documentation  submitted.         14.  Requests for payment of the full amount of this  Notice  of Apparent Liability  under an installment  plan should be  sent  to: Chief,  Revenue and  Receivables Operations  Group, 445  12th  Street, S.W., Washington, D.C. 20554.8       15.

INTRODUCTION       1.   In this Notice of Apparent Liability for Forfeiture, we  find that  Manuel M.  Vzquez willfully  and repeatedly  violated  Section 301  of  the  Communications  Act  of  1934,  as  amended  (``Act''),1 by operating a radio  station on the frequency  103.3  MHz without Commission authorization. We conclude that Manuel  M.  Vzquez is apparently liable for forfeiture in the amount of  ten  thousand dollars ($10,000).                           II.  BACKGROUND       2.  On  April 19,  2002, while  investigating complaints  of  unlicensed broadcast activity in the Naples, Florida area, agents  from the Commission's  Tampa Field  Office detected  an FM  radio  station on the frequency  103.3 MHz.  Using electronic  direction  finding techniques, the agents traced the signals on 103.3 MHz to  a commercial  building located  at 2408  Linwood Avenue,  Naples,  Florida.  The  agents observed  an antenna  on the  building  and  transmission cable  connected  to  the antenna  on  one  end  and  entering the  building's wall  into  Suite F.   Standing  outside  Suite F, the agents heard  music and voices that matched  exactly  the programming simultaneously broadcast by the station on  103.3  MHz.  Based on field strength measurements taken by the agents of  the station's signal, this station required a license to operate.   FCC records showed no license issued for operation of an FM radio  station on  this frequency  in or  near Naples,  Florida.   While  still  at  the  building  at  2408  Linwood  Avenue,  the  agents  interviewed a man  who refused  to identify  himself, but  stated  that he was an  operator of the radio  station.  The agents  hand  delivered to  the  man  a warning  letter  for  unlicensed  radio  operation that advised that unlicensed operation violated Section  301 of the Act, listed the penalties for violation, and  directed  the man to  terminate the unlicensed  operation.  The man  stated  that his station  would continue  to operate  until either  other  unlicensed radio stations  were shut  down or  the radio  station  equipment was seized by  the police.  The  agents later spoke  to  the building owner who visually identified the man claiming to be  the operator  of the  radio station  as Manuel  M. Vzquez.   The  building owner  also stated  that Manuel  M. Vzquez  leased  the  space in Suite F.   The radio station on  103.3 MHz continued  to  broadcast as the agents left the area.        3.  On April  20, 2002, agents  from the Commission's  Tampa  Field Office again detected an FM radio station on the  frequency  103.3 MHz.  Using  electronic direction  finding techniques,  the  agents traced the  signals on  103.3 MHz to  the same  commercial  building located at 2408 Linwood Avenue, Naples, Florida.   While  at that location,  the same  man interviewed the  day before  who  admitted to operating the station  and who was identified by  the  building manager as Manuel M. Vzquez, arrived.  The agents again  interviewed Mr. Vzquez and warned him about the unlicensed radio  operation.  The radio station on 103.3 MHz continued to transmit,  except with no audio, as the agents left the area.                          III.  DISCUSSION       4.   Section 301  of the  Act sets forth  generally that  no  person shall use or operate any apparatus for the transmission of  energy of communications  or signals by  radio within the  United  States except under  and in accordance  with the Act  and with  a  license.  On April 19  and 20, 2002,  Manuel M. Vzquez  operated  radio transmission equipment on  the frequency 103.3 MHz  without  benefit of the required Commission license.       5.   Based on the evidence before us, we find that on  April  19  and  April  20,  2002,  Manuel  M.  Vzquez  willfully1   and  repeatedly2 violated Section  301 of the  Act by operating  radio  transmission apparatus without a license.       6.   Pursuant  to  Section 1.80(b)(4)  of  the  Commission's  Rules, the base forfeiture amount  for the violation(s) cited  in  this notice  is  $10,000.3    Section  503(b)(2)(D)  of  the  Act  requires us to take into account ``... the nature, circumstances,  extent, and gravity  of the  violation, and with  respect to  the  violator,  the  degree  of  culpability,  any  history  of  prior  offenses, ability to pay, and  other such matters as justice  may  require.''4  Considering  the  entire  record  and  applying  the  statutory factors  listed above,  this  case warrants  a  $10,000  forfeiture.                        IV.  ORDERING CLAUSES       7.  Accordingly,  IT IS  ORDERED THAT,  pursuant to  Section  503(b) of  the  Communications  Act of  1934,  as  amended,5  and  Sections 0.111, 0.311 and 1.80 of the Commission's Rules,6 Manuel  M. Vzquez is  hereby NOTIFIED  of his APPARENT  LIABILITY FOR  A  FORFEITURE in the  amount of ten  thousand dollars ($10,000)  for  willful  and   repeated  violation   of   Section  301   of   the  Communications Act of 1934, as amended.        8.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED THAT, pursuant to Section 1.80  of  the Commission's Rules, within thirty days of the release date of  this NOTICE OF  APPARENT LIABILITY, Manuel  M. Vzquez SHALL  PAY  the full  amount  of the  proposed  forfeiture or  SHALL  FILE  a  written  statement  seeking  reduction  or  cancellation  of  the  proposed forfeiture.       9.  Payment of the forfeiture may be made by mailing a check  or similar  instrument,  payable  to the  order  of  the  Federal  Communications Commission, to the Forfeiture Collection  Section,  Finance  Branch,  Federal  Communications  Commission,  P.O.  Box  73482, Chicago, Illinois  60673-7482.  The  payment must  include  the FRN and NAL/Acct. No. referenced in the letterhead above.       10.  The  response,  if  any,  must  be  mailed  to  Federal  Communications Commission,  Office  of the  Secretary,  445  12th  Street, SW,  Washington,  DC  20554,  Attn:  Enforcement  Bureau- Technical  &  Public  Safety  Division,  and  MUST  INCLUDE   THE  NAL/Acct. No. and FRN referenced in the letterhead above.       11.  The Commission will not consider reducing or  canceling  a forfeiture in response  to a claim of  inability to pay  unless  the petitioner  submits: (1)  federal tax  returns for  the  most  recent  three-year  period;  (2)  financial  statements  prepared  according to generally accepted accounting practices  (``GAAP'');  or (3)  some  other  reliable and  objective  documentation  that  accurately reflects  the petitioner's  current financial  status.   Any claim  of inability  to pay  must specifically  identify  the  basis for the claim by  reference to the financial  documentation  submitted.       12.

INTRODUCTION       1.  This is a Notice of Apparent Liability for Forfeiture   pursuant to Section 503(b) of the Communications Act of 1934, as   amended (the ``Communications Act''),1 and Section 1.80 of the   Commission's Rules,2 against Robert L. Meyers (``Meyers''),   licensee of Amateur Radio Station N5WLY, Houston, Texas.  We find   that Meyers operated his Amateur Radio station so as to willfully   and maliciously cause interference to radio communications in   apparent willful violation of Section 333 of the Communications   Act3 and Section 97.101(d) of the Commission's Rules,4 and   transmitted unidentified communications in apparent willful   violation of Section 97.119(a) of the Commission's Rules.5  For   the reasons discussed below, we conclude that Meyers is   apparently liable for a forfeiture in the amount of $8000.                            II.  BACKGROUND       2.  From 1993 through 1999, the Commission's Houston Office   received complaints of alleged intentional interference to users   of the Memorial Emergency Repeater Association's 145.470/144.870   MHz repeater in Houston, Texas (``MERA repeater'').  The   interference was allegedly caused by stations transmitting   unidentified tones, inflammatory or derogatory remarks, and   unmodulated signals, none of which were identified with an FCC-  assigned call sign.       3.  On February 24, 1999, a Commission agent, using a mobile   automatic direction finding (``MADF'') vehicle to monitor the   MERA repeater, observed a radio signal consisting of unidentified   derogatory remarks being transmitted on the input frequency of   the MERA repeater.  The agent simultaneously monitored the output   frequency of the MERA repeater and observed that this signal   would transmit immediately after other stations would commence   transmitting, resulting in interference to communications already   in progress on the MERA repeater.  At about 6:45 a.m., using the   MADF equipment and direction-finding techniques, the agent   determined that the source of the unidentified interfering   transmissions was a red Jeep Cherokee bearing Texas license plate   C39CYK.  This vehicle was registered to Robert L. Meyers, license   holder of Amateur Radio Service license N5WLY.       4.  On June 1, 1999, two Commission agents visited Meyers   and conducted an administrative inspection of the red Jeep   Cherokee.  Meyers admitted owning the vehicle and admitted to   being the licensee of Amateur Radio Station N5WLY.  Meyers was   issued an Official Notice of Violation citing violation of 47   U.S.C.  333 and 47 C.F.R.  97.101(c) (willful or malicious   interference), and 47 C.F.R.  97.119 (failure to identify   amateur communications).6       5.  On June 8, 1999, the Commission's Houston Office   received a letter from Meyers dated June 7, 1999, in response to   the Official Notice of Violation.  In the response letter, Meyers   denied the violations and denied any operation at the times   cited.  Meyers' response letter also stated that Meyers would   take precautionary steps to insure that no accidental   transmissions would occur from his station.                           III.  DISCUSSION       6.  Section 333 of the Communications Act and Section   97.101(d) of the Commission's Rules both prohibit willful or   malicious interference to radio communications.  Section   97.119(a) of the Commission's Rules prohibits the transmission of   unidentified communications in the Amateur Radio Service.       7.  Section 503(b) of the Communications Act and Section   1.80(a) of the Commission's Rules both state that any person who   willfully or repeatedly fails to comply with the provisions of   the Communications Act or the Commission's Rules shall be liable   for a forfeiture penalty.  For purposes of Section 503(b) of the   Communications Act, the term ``willful'' means that the violator   knew that it was taking the action in question, irrespective of   any intent to violate any provision of the Communications Act or   the Commission's Rules.7       8.  Based on the evidence before us, we find that on   February 24, 1999, Robert L. Meyers did use his Amateur Radio   Station N5WLY to transmit radio communications and, in so doing,   willfully and maliciously interfere with Amateur Radio   communications already in progress, in apparent willful violation   of Section 333 of the Communications Act and Section 97.101(d) of   the Commission's Rules; and failed to identify those   communications, in apparent willful violation of Section   97.119(a) of the Commission's Rules.  The interference was   willful and malicious in that Meyers timed his transmissions to   commence just after other stations had begun transmitting,   resulting in harmful interference to communications already in   progress.  Also, both violations were willful in that Meyers   sought to conceal his identity by altering the sound of his   normal voice and omitting the required identification.       9.  The Commission's Forfeiture Policy Statement, which   became effective October 14, 1997, sets a base forfeiture amount   of $7000 for intentional interference and $1000 for failure to   identify.8  In assessing the monetary forfeiture amount, we must   also take into account the statutory factors set forth in Section   503(b)(2)(D) of the Communications Act,9 that include the nature,   circumstances, extent, and gravity of the violation(s), and with   respect to the violator, the degree of culpability, any history   of prior offenses, ability to pay, and other such matters as   justice may require.  Applying the Policy Statement and statutory   factors to the instant case, a monetary forfeiture in the amount   of $8000 is warranted.                         IV.  ORDERING CLAUSES       10.  Accordingly, IT IS ORDERED, pursuant to Section 503(b)   of the Communications Act and Sections 0.111, 0.311 and 1.80 of   the Commission's Rules,10 that Robert L. Meyers is hereby   NOTIFIED of his APPARENT LIABILITY FOR MONETARY FORFEITURE in the   amount of EIGHT THOUSAND DOLLARS ($8000) for the willful   violation of Section 333 of the Communications Act, Section   97.101(d) of the Commission's Rules, and Section 97.119(a) of the   Commission's Rules.       11.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED, pursuant to Section 1.80 of the   Commission's Rules, that WITHIN THIRTY (30) DAYS of the release   of this Notice, ROBERT L. MEYERS SHALL PAY to the United States   the full amount of the monetary forfeiture11 OR SHALL FILE a   written statement showing why the forfeiture should be reduced or   cancelled.12  The payment or statement should be marked with   NAL/Acct. No: X3254-001.       12.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that this notice shall be sent,   by certified mail, return receipt requested, to Robert L. Meyers,   7358 Crownwest Drive, Houston, TX 77072.                           FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION                             Loyd P.

On August 28, 2003, agents of the Commission's New York       Office  inspected   radio  station,   WPTH937,  located   at       Brooklyn, New York, and observed the following violation(s):    2.a.      47  C.F.R. 90.403(a)(2):  ``licensees of  radio              stations  in  the  private  land  mobile   radio              services shall  be directly responsible for  the              proper  operation and  use of  each  transmitter              for   which   they  are   licensed.    In   this              connection,   licensees  shall   exercise   such              direction and control as is necessary to  assure              that  all  authorized  facilities  are  employed              only  in a  permissible manner.''   The  station              was operating  with effective radiated power  of              267  watts  which is  in  excess  of  the  power              stated in the station license.     2.b.      47  C.F.R. 90.403(a)(2):  ``licensees of  radio              stations  in  the  private  land  mobile   radio              services shall  be directly responsible for  the              proper  operation and  use of  each  transmitter              for   which   they  are   licensed.

During  the              times  of  monitoring, it  was  noted  that  the              station   did    not   transmit   the    station              identification.    3.

INTRODUCTION       1.   In this Notice of Apparent Liability for Forfeiture, we  find that Richard Muoz willfully and repeatedly violated Section  301 of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended (``Act'').1  On  April 20 and May 14, 2002, Richard Muoz operated a radio station  on 105.1 MHz without  Commission authorization. We conclude  that  Richard Muoz is apparently liable  for forfeiture in the  amount  of ten thousand dollars ($10,000).                           II.  BACKGROUND       2.   On April 20, 2002,  agents from the Commission's  Tampa  Field Office investigated  a complaint of  an alleged  unlicensed  radio station operating on the frequency 105.1 MHz in the Naples,  Florida area.  The agents detected an FM radio station  operating  on 105.1  MHz.  Using  direction finding  techniques, the  agents  traced the  signal on  105.1  MHz to  a  church located  at  2132  Shadowlawn Drive,  Naples,  Florida.   Based  on  field  strength  measurements taken by  the agents of  the station's signal,  this  station required a license  to operate.  Immediately  thereafter,  the agents  inspected the  radio station  inside the  church  and  found studio and transmitting equipment in operation.  The agents  interviewed several witnesses who  provided information that  Mr.  Muoz operated the  radio station.   The agents  were provided  a  business card with Mr. Muoz' name and the name of his  ministry,  ``Ministerio Mision Posible.''   A brochure found  in the  church  promoted a radio program called ``Mision Posible 105.1 FM.''  The  agents interviewed Mr. Muoz who admitted responsibility for  the  station's operation and  to owning the  radio station  equipment.   The agents  hand delivered  to  Mr. Muoz  a warning  letter  for  unlicensed radio operation that advised that unlicensed operation  violated Section  301  of  the  Act,  listed  the  penalties  for  violation, and  directed Mr.  Muoz to  terminate the  unlicensed  operation.  Mr. Muoz then directed another person to  deactivate  the transmitter.       3.   On April 30,  2002, the Tampa  Field Office received  a  complaint from  a Naples,  Florida area  broadcast station.   The  complaint stated  that an  unlicensed radio  station operated  on  105.1 MHz from  the ``Tree  of Life Church''  at 2132  Shadowlawn  Drive,  Naples,  Florida,   and  that   the  unlicensed   station  interfered with the reception of authorized FM broadcasts.       4.   On May 14,  2002, agents  from the  Tampa Field  Office  again detected an FM radio signal  on the frequency 105.1 MHz  in  Naples, Florida,  and traced  the signal  to the  church at  2132  Shadowlawn Drive, Naples, Florida.  This is the same location  as  the unlicensed station operating on 105.1 MHz on April 20,  2002.   Based on field strength measurements  taken by the agents of  the  station's signal, this station required a license to operate.       5.   On May  24, 2002,  the Tampa  Field Office  received  a  letter from Andrew DeLong, Head Pastor of the Tree of Life Church  at 2132 Shadowlawn  Drive, Naples, Florida.   In the letter,  Mr.  DeLong identified  Richard Muoz  as the  Pastor of  the  ""Mision  Posible'' ministry and operator of the radio station, and  stated  that Mr.  Muoz  leased space  for  the radio  station  from  the  church.                          III.  DISCUSSION       6.   Section 301 of  the Act  sets forth  generally that  no  person shall use or operate any apparatus for the transmission of  energy of communications  or signals by  radio within the  United  States except under  and in accordance  with the Act  and with  a  license.  On April 20  and May 14,  2002, Richard Muoz  operated  radio transmission equipment on  the frequency 105.1 MHz  without  benefit of a license required for such operation.       7.   Based on the evidence before us, we find that, on April  20 and May  14, 2002,  Richard Muoz  willfully2 and  repeatedly3  violated Section 301 of the  Act by operating radio  transmission  apparatus without a license.       8.   Pursuant to  Section  1.80(b)(4)  of  the  Commission's  Rules, the base forfeiture amount  for the violation(s) cited  in  this notice  is  $10,000.4    Section  503(b)(2)(D)  of  the  Act  requires us to take into account ``... the nature, circumstances,  extent, and gravity  of the  violation, and with  respect to  the  violator,  the  degree  of  culpability,  any  history  of  prior  offenses, ability to pay, and  other such matters as justice  may  require.''5  Mr.  Muoz'  unlicensed  operation  continued  after  verbal  and  written  warnings   to  terminate  such   operation.   Considering the entire record and applying the statutory  factors  listed above, this case warrants a $10,000 forfeiture.                        IV.  ORDERING CLAUSES       9.   Accordingly, IT IS  ORDERED THAT,  pursuant to  Section  503(b) of the  Act,6 and Sections  0.111, 0.311 and  1.80 of  the  Commission's Rules,7  Richard Muoz  is  hereby NOTIFIED  of  his  APPARENT LIABILITY FOR A FORFEITURE in the amount of ten thousand  dollars ($10,000) for willful  and repeated violation of  Section  301 of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended.        10.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED THAT, pursuant to Section 1.80 of  the Commission's Rules, within thirty days of the release date of  this NOTICE OF  APPARENT LIABILITY, Richard  Muoz SHALL PAY  the  full amount of the  proposed forfeiture or  SHALL FILE a  written  statement seeking  reduction  or  cancellation  of  the  proposed  forfeiture.       11.  Payment of  the forfeiture  may be  made by  mailing  a  check or similar instrument, payable to the order of the  Federal  Communications Commission, to the Forfeiture Collection  Section,  Finance  Branch,  Federal  Communications  Commission,  P.O.  Box  73482, Chicago, Illinois  60673-7482.  The  payment must  include  the FRN and NAL/Acct. No. referenced in the letterhead above.       12.  The  response,  if  any,  must  be  mailed  to  Federal  Communications Commission,  Office  of the  Secretary,  445  12th  Street, SW,  Washington,  DC  20554,  Attn:  Enforcement  Bureau- Technical  &  Public  Safety  Division,  and  MUST  INCLUDE   THE  NAL/Acct. No. and FRN referenced in the letterhead above.       13.  The Commission will not consider reducing or  canceling  a forfeiture in response  to a claim of  inability to pay  unless  the petitioner  submits: (1)  federal tax  returns for  the  most  recent  three-year  period;  (2)  financial  statements  prepared  according to generally accepted accounting practices  (``GAAP'');  or (3)  some  other  reliable and  objective  documentation  that  accurately reflects  the petitioner's  current financial  status.   Any claim  of inability  to pay  must specifically  identify  the  basis for the claim by  reference to the financial  documentation  submitted.       14.  Requests for payment of the full amount of this  Notice  of Apparent Liability  under an installment  plan should be  sent  to:  Federal  Communications   Commission,  Chief,  Revenue   and  Receivables Operations Group, 445 12th Street, S.W.,  Washington,  D.C. 20554.8        15.  IT IS FURTHER  ORDERED THAT  a copy of  this NOTICE  OF  APPARENT LIABILITY shall be sent by Certified Mail Return Receipt  Requested to  Richard  Muoz  at 2132  Shadowlawn  Drive  Naples,  Florida 34112.

In the earlier action, Plaintiffs’ claims focused on the Census Bureau’s partial, selective enumeration of the overseas population, alleging that this partial count was unlawful under the Census Act, the Apportionment Clause, RFRA and the Free Exercise Clause, and the Administrative Procedure Act.    (The earlier action, D.C. Ut. No. 2:01-CV-23B, is referred to hereafter as the “Overseas Action.”)    In light of the importance of these issues and of the need for the states to proceed with redistricting as soon as possible, the parties in the Overseas Action entered into a Stipulation and Agreement regarding an expedited schedule.    Under the stipulated schedule, Plaintiffs were to file their Motion for Summary Judgment by January 30, 2001; Defendants were to file their opposing Memoranda and to file Cross-Motions for Summary Judgment by February 21, 2001; Plaintiffs were to file their Reply Memoranda and Opposing Memoranda by March 2, 2001; and Defendants were to file their Reply Memoranda by March 13, 2001.    The parties in the Overseas Action submitted their briefs in accordance with this schedule.    Plaintiffs also submitted written discovery requests, which Defendants answered at about the same time the Defendants filed their own Motion for Summary Judgment.    In Plaintiffs’ Reply Memorandum, Plaintiffs then supplemented the facts they submitted to the Court with documents produced by Defendants.    The three-judge Court heard the parties’ Motions for Summary Judgment on March 28, 2001.    After that hearing, Plaintiffs learned of an additional claim arising out of the Census Bureau’s enumeration of the  domestic  population.    Specifically, they discovered that the Census Bureau’s decision to supplement the domestic count by means of a statistical sampling technique known as “imputation” independently deprived Utah of its fourth seat in Congress.    On April 9, 2001, Plaintiffs’ legal team verified for the first time, using data disclosed by the House Subcommittee on the Census, that if the Census Bureau had limited its apportionment count to those persons  actually enumerated  ( i.e. , by the mail-in questionnaire or by a personal or telephone contact with a census enumerator), and had not supplemented that count by adding persons who were never actually counted but only “imputed” by application of a statistical sampling technique, the State of Utah would have been entitled to a fourth representative in the U.S. House of Representatives, North Carolina would not have received its 13 th  representative in the House, and no other state’s apportionment would have been affected. [1]    In light of this new evidence, on April 13, 2001, Plaintiffs filed a Motion for leave to amend their Complaint in the Overseas Action to add a challenge to the Census Bureau’s use of the imputation method of statistical sampling.    Specifically, Plaintiffs proposed to file a Third Amended Complaint asserting a challenge to the Bureau’s use of statistical imputation on the ground that it violates the Census Act and the Apportionment Clause, as recently interpreted by the Supreme Court in  Dept. of Commerce v. United States House of Representatives , 525 U.S. 316 (1999).    At that time, Plaintiffs attached their proposed Third Amended Complaint and set forth their essential arguments on the merits of those claims.    See  Overseas Action, Docket Entry No. 94-1.    In  House of Representatives , the Supreme Court held that the Census Act requires an actual enumeration and thus “directly prohibits the use of sampling in the determination of population for purposes of apportionment.”    Id . at 338.    Imputation is indisputably a form of statistical sampling that cannot be reconciled with the requirement of an actual enumeration.    Indeed, the Census Bureau itself has characterized imputation as a method of “sampling.”    See United States Department of Commerce, Report to Congress—The Plan for Census 2000 (“Census 2000 Report”) at x.    And one of the dissenting opinions in  House of Representatives  acknowledged that imputation is a “sampling technique[]” invalidated by the majority’s holding.    House of Representatives , 525 U.S. at 352 (Breyer, J., dissenting).    On April 17, 2001, the three-judge Court in the Overseas Action granted Defendants’ Motions for Summary Judgment, holding that Defendants were entitled to judgment as a matter of law on Plaintiffs’ challenge to the Census Bureau’s partial, selective enumeration of the overseas population.  See  Overseas Action, Docket Entry No. 96-1.    In a separate  per curiam  Order entered the same day, the Court also denied Plaintiffs’ Motion for Leave to file the Third Amended Complaint.  See  Overseas Action, Docket Entry No. 95-1.    In denying Plaintiffs’ leave to amend, the Court concluded that Plaintiffs’ imputation claim was factually unrelated to the pending overseas claims and thus would “change the entire character of this lawsuit on one fundamental issue.”    Order at 6.    In a subsequent Order, the three-judge Court also clarified that its denial of Plaintiffs’ Motion for leave to amend was not on the merits and was without prejudice to Plaintiffs’ right to file their statistical imputation claim as a separate action.  See  Overseas Action, Docket Entry No. 100-1. Plaintiffs then filed their Complaint in is action, and now move for a Scheduling Order similar to the one stipulated to in the Overseas Action.    DISCUSSION    Plaintiffs respectfully move for a Scheduling Order on their claims challenging Defendants’ use of statistical imputation in the apportionment count in the 2000 census.    Such an Order is necessary at this early stage of this case in order to comply with the requirement of the governing statute, which provides that “[i]t shall be the duty of a United States district court hearing an action” challenging the use of a “statistical method” in the apportionment of congressional districts to “advance on the docket and to expedite to the greatest possible extent the disposition of . . . such matter.”    Pub. L. 105-119, Title II, § 209(b) & (e)(2).    To fulfill this requirement, Plaintiffs seek a Scheduling Order that would adopt a timeframe similar to that agreed upon by the parties in the Overseas Action.    In addition, Plaintiffs request that the Court immediately convene a telephonic hearing involving all parties to discuss the proposed Scheduling Order.    First, Plaintiffs seek leave to file a Motion for Summary Judgment immediately, notwithstanding the presumptive 20-day moratorium set forth in Rule 56(a).    The purpose of “the 20-day period” is to “give[] the defendant an opportunity to secure counsel and determine a course of action.”    Advisory Committee Note to Rule 56(a), 1948 Amendment;  see also  10A Wright & Miller,  Federal Practice and Procedure  § 2717, at 297.    This purpose is simply not implicated here.    Defendants obviously already have counsel and have had notice of Plaintiffs’ imputation claims since at least April 13, when Plaintiffs filed their Motion for leave to amend.    Moreover, the imputation claims turn on straightforward legal arguments that do not merit any further delay.    If the statutory requirement of expediting this case “to the great possible extent” is to be followed, Plaintiffs should be granted leave to file their Motion for Summary Judgment immediately and without regard to the 20-day moratorium under Rule 56(a).    Second, Plaintiffs seek an expedited briefing schedule that follows the timeframe agreed to in the Overseas Action.    Specifically, Plaintiffs should file their Motion for Summary Judgment by April 30; Defendants should file their Memoranda in Opposition and any Cross-Motions by May 21; Plaintiffs should file their Reply Memorandum and Memorandum in Opposition to Defendants’ Motions by June 1; Defendants should file their Reply Memoranda by June 12; and a hearing should be scheduled as soon thereafter as possible.    This schedule is necessary to assure that the case is “expedite[d] to the greatest possible extent,” as required under Pub. L. 105-119, Title II, § 209(e)(2).    There can be no doubt that this expedited schedule is “possible.”    The parties complied with a similar schedule in the Overseas Action, and that case presented factual and legal complexities that are not presented in this straightforward action.    Finally, Plaintiffs seek an Order requiring Defendants to respond on an expedited basis to the limited written discovery requests that are attached hereto as Exhibit “A.”    Those requests include three straightforward document requests and three straightforward interrogatories.    An expedited response to these limited requests is necessary to enable Plaintiffs and this Court to evaluate the Census Bureau’s own internal documents and policies regarding statistical imputation.    Again, Plaintiffs seek a Scheduling Order patterned after the schedule agreed to in the Overseas Action.       Accordingly, Defendants should be required to respond to the attached discovery requests by May 21—at the same time Defendants file their Cross-Motions for Summary Judgment.    Plaintiffs should then be permitted to submit any documents produced by Defendants in Plaintiffs’ Reply Memorandum and Memorandum in Opposition to be filed by June 1.    A similar schedule was followed in the Overseas Action, and should likewise be implemented here in order to comply with the statutory requirement of expedited this matter to the “greatest possible extent.”    Pub. L. 105-119, Title II, § 209(e)(2).         CONCLUSION                 For the foregoing reasons, the Court should enter a Scheduling Order (a) permitting Plaintiffs leave to file their Motion for Summary Judgment immediately; (b) requiring that Plaintiffs file their Motion for Summary Judgment by April 30, 2001; that Defendants file their Memoranda in Opposition and any Cross-Motions by May 21, 2001; that Plaintiffs file their Reply Memorandum and Memorandum in Opposition to Defendants’ Motions by June 1, 2001; that Defendants file their Reply Memoranda by June 12, 2001; and that a hearing should be scheduled as soon thereafter as possible; and (c) requiring Defendants to respond to Plaintiffs’ First Set of Interrogatories and Requests for Production of Documents on or before May 21, 2001.    In addition, Plaintiffs respectfully request that the Court immediately convene a telephonic hearing involving counsel for all parties to discuss the Scheduling Order.    DATED this _____ day of April, 2001.                                      Respectfully submitted,    ______________________________    Mark L. Shurtleff    Attorney General of Utah    Raymond A.

INTRODUCTION       1.   In this Memorandum  Opinion and  Order (``Order''),  we  cancel the  proposed monetary  forfeiture in  the amount  of  ten  thousand dollars  ($10,000),  issued to  Amethyst  International,  Inc. (``Amethyst'') for its apparent willful violation of Section  301 of the  Communications Act  of 1934,  as amended  (``Act'').1   However, we  admonish Amethyst  for  the violation  which  caused  harmful interference to the Coast Guard.         2.   On  June  5,   2002,  the  Commission's   Philadelphia,  Pennsylvania, Field  Office  (``Philadelphia Office'')  issued  a  Notice  of  Apparent  Liability  for  Forfeiture  (``NAL'')2   to  Amethyst  in  the  amount  of  ten  thousand  dollars  ($10,000).   Amethyst filed a response to the NAL on July 8, 2002.                        II.       BACKGROUND       3.   On February  25,  2002,  a Commission  agent  from  the            Philadelphia Office  received a  call from  the  United            States Coast Guard advising him that a constant  signal            was being transmitted on  VHF Marine Channel 16  (156.8            MHz).  The  signal,  which  had been  on  the  air  for            approximately   two   hours,   was   causing    harmful            interference, affecting  the  ability  of  Coast  Guard            Stations Manasquan and Barnegat  Light, New Jersey,  to            monitor channel 16  for transmissions  from vessels  in            distress.        4.   On February 25,  2002 at approximately  8:45 p.m.,  two         agents from the Philadelphia office located the source  of         the  signal transmitting  on  156.8 MHz  by  using  mobile         direction finding techniques.  The agents determined  that         the  signal was  emanating from  the  Beach Motel  at  202         Arnold Avenue, Point  Pleasant Beach, New Jersey.   Inside         the motel  lobby, the agents  discovered a Realistic  MTX-        100 marine  radio and  noted that it  was transmitting  on         Marine Channel 16 (156.8 MHz).  The microphone was  wedged         between the body of  the radio and the counter, causing  a         constant  signal.  At  approximately 9:00  p.m., Mr.  John         Fernicola,  the   owner  of  the   motel,  arrived.    Mr.         Fernicola  disconnected   and  removed  the  radio.    Mr.         Fernicola acknowledged that neither he nor Amethyst had  a         license to operate  a coast station in the Maritime  Radio         Service.              5.   On February  26,  2002, the  Philadelphia  Office  sent         Amethyst a warning  letter which explained that  operation         of the unlicensed marine coast station on frequency  156.8         MHz at  the Beach Motel violated  Section 301 of the  Act.          The  letter  also outlined  the  potential  penalties  for         operating the  unlicensed station, which included  seizure         of the  equipment, fines, and  imprisonment.  On March  4,         2002,  Amethyst  submitted  a  response  to  the   warning         letter.         6.   On June 5, 2002, the  Philadelphia Office issued a  NAL         to  Amethyst for  its  unlicensed operation  of  a  marine         coast  station on  VHF Marine  Channel 16  (156.8 MHz)  in         violation of  Section 301 of  the Act.  On  July 8,  2002,         Amethyst filed a response to the NAL in which it  requests         cancellation or reduction of the proposed forfeiture.                        III.           DISCUSSION            7.   The forfeiture amount in this case was proposed in  accordance with Section 503(b) of  the Act,3 Section 1.80 of  the  Commission's Rules (``Rules''),4 and The Commission's  Forfeiture  Policy Statement and Amendment  of Section 1.80  of the Rules  to  Incorporate the Forfeiture Guidelines,  12 FCC Rcd 17087  (1997),  recon. denied, 15  FCC Rcd 303  (1999).  In examining  Amethyst's  response, Section 503(b) of the Act requires that the  Commission  take into account the  nature, circumstances, extent and  gravity  of the violation and, with respect to the violator, the degree of  culpability, any history of prior  offenses, ability to pay,  and  other such matters as justice may require.5       8.   Section 301 of the Act  sets forth the general  mandate  that no  person  shall  use  or operate  any  apparatus  for  the  transmission of  energy or  communications  or signals  by  radio  within the United States except under and in accordance with  the  Act and  with a  license.  Further,  Section 80.13  of the  Rules  requires that any  land station operating  in the Maritime  Radio  Service be licensed.6  On February 25, 2002, Amethyst operated  a  marine coast  station  on Marine  Channel  16 (156.8  MHz)  which  adversely affected  the  Coast  Guard's ability  to  monitor  for  transmissions from vessels in distress,  and it did so without  a  license.         9.   In its response, Amethyst states that, contrary to what         is stated in the  NAL, it did not admit responsibility  or         guilt in its response  to the warning letter and that  its         response clearly denies any willful intent to violate  the         rules.   In  fact,  Amethyst  posits  that  this  singular         incidence   of  interference   resulted  from   a   purely         accidental  and   inadvertent  activation  of  the   radio         transmitter, that Amethyst  did not install the  equipment         and that it did not even intend its presence at the  Beach         Motel.    Amethyst  also   asserts  that   it  has   never         authorized the  use of the equipment  by any employee  for         any purpose, that the equipment was in existence as  found         when Amethyst assumed operations of the Beach Motel,  that         it  believed  the  power supply  to  the  radio  had  been         disconnected and that  any operation of the equipment  was         impossible.   Amethyst further  asserts that  it  provides         each front desk clerk and manager with a published set  of         rules  specifically   disallowing  the  use  of   cellular         phones, personal  communications equipment, radios or  any         other equipment  other than  the front  desk switch  board         and  reservation system.   Additionally,  Amethyst  points         out that  there is  no allegation that  this was  anything         but a singular  event or that the transmission alleged  to         have emanated from  the Beach Motel contained any  audible         transmissions.   Furthermore,  Amethyst  asserts  that  it         immediately removed  the equipment, that  it has no  prior         history  of  violations   with  the  FCC,  and  that   the         forfeiture amount is excessive.  Finally, Amethyst  states         that it was never its intention to maintain a  transmitter         at  this location  for  any purpose  and  that  Amethyst's         previous statement, that the equipment was for  monitoring         purposes only,  reflected the inferences  made by the  two         field  agents  about  why  the  previous  owner   probably         installed the  equipment and  that the  statement did  not         represent  Amethyst's purpose  or  motive in  leaving  the         equipment as found.       10.  After considering the totality of Amethyst's response  to the NAL, specifically the good faith steps taken by Amethyst  to ensure that the radio was not used, we believe that  cancellation of the forfeiture is appropriate.  Nevertheless, we  find that it is also appropriate to admonish Amethyst for its  violation of Section 301 of the Act, which caused harmful  interference to Coast Guard operations.                      IV.       ORDERING CLAUSES      11.  Accordingly, IT IS  ORDERED THAT,  pursuant to  Section  0.111, 0.311, and 1.80(f)(4) of the Rules,7 the forfeiture in the  amount of ten thousand dollars ($10,000) proposed in the June  5,  2002 NAL issued to Amethyst International, Inc. IS CANCELLED.       12.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED  that Amethyst IS ADMONISHED  for  its unlicensed operation of a marine coast station on VHF  Marine  Channel 16 (156.8  MHz) from  the Beach Motel  in Point  Pleasant  Beach, New  Jersey on  February 25,  2002, which  caused  harmful  interference to the Coast Guard.               13.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that  a copy of this Order  shall  be  sent  by  first  class  and  Certified  Mail  Return  Receipt  Requested to  Amethyst International,  Inc., 202  Arnold  Avenue,  Point Pleasant Beach, New Jersey 08742.
