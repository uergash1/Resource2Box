GX015-32-13860313	[DOP Brochure]    [Subsidence]    [Historical Images]     History    The State of California granted the City its tidelands properties in the early 1900's for development of commerce, navigation, and recreation.   When oil was discovered in adjacent lands in the 1930's, the City realized it needed to protect its assets.    In 1939, the Harbor Department created a Petroleum Division to  provide technical assistance and advice to the Harbor Commission on all matters pertaining to oil operations in the Harbor District.  It ensured compliance with operating agreements and the use of sound engineering in oil field practices.    In 1958, as a result of the devastating effects of subsidence during the 1940's and 1950's, the Harbor Department created a Subsidence Control Division to manage subsidence control and prevention.  These divisions were combined into the Petroleum and Subsidence Control Division in 1960.    The City Council created the Petroleum Properties Administration in 1962 to oversee all oil operations outside the Harbor District.   The DOP, which supplanted both organizations through City Charter Amendment in 1965, coordinates all oil operations and subsidence control activities throughout the entire City.  The DOP is composed of approximately thirty-six City employees.   Most of the twenty engineers, geologists and managers, hold advanced degrees and/or California professional licenses.  The average experience level per employee exceeds 20 years in engineering, geology and subsidence control.

GX119-81-0492659	STATEMENT OF P. DANIEL SMITH, SPECIAL ASSISTANT TO THE DIRECTOR, NATIONAL PARK SERVICE, DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR, BEFORE THE HOUSE RESOURCES COMMITTEE, SUBCOMMITTEE ON NATIONAL PARKS, RECREATION AND PUBLIC LANDS, ON H.R. 1521, A BILL TO PROVIDE FOR ADDITIONAL LANDS TO BE INCLUDED WITHIN THE BOUNDARY OF THE JOHNSTOWN FLOOD NATIONAL MEMORIAL IN THE STATE OF PENNSYLVANIA, AND FOR OTHER PURPOSES.         June 24, 2003                 Mr. Chairman, thank you for the opportunity to present the views of the Department of the Interior on H.R. 1521, a bill to provide for additional lands to be included within the boundary of the Johnstown Flood National Memorial in the State of Pennsylvania.            The bill would add seven parcels of land to the boundary of the park to provide permanent protection for resources that are integral to the historic events that the park was established to commemorate.    Six of the parcels, totaling 2.33 acres, are approximately three miles from the park in the  village  of  Saint Michael  where the former South Fork Fishing and Hunting Club was located.    The seventh parcel, comprising approximately 12 acres, is adjacent to the current boundary.    Recently, a property owner of a 0.18-acre parcel has indicated that he does not wish to sell his property.    We ask the Committee to amend the map reference in the bill to reflect this change of only six parcels being added to the park.    Land acquisition costs for these six parcels are approximately $805,000.    All parcels are for sale by willing sellers.         The Department supports the President’s Initiative to address the deferred maintenance backlog and taking care of our current responsibilities.    In this instance, we are faced with a unique situation concerning this boundary adjustment.    The historic structures central to this acquisition have always been considered key components of the park, but were to be protected, maintained, and interpreted through a public-private partnership.    However, the partner can no longer perform this function, based on financial problems.    For this reason, the Department believes it is appropriate to move forward with this bill at this time.            Johnstown Flood National Memorial comprises nearly 165 acres in western  Pennsylvania .    The park’s mission is to tell the stories of the events leading up to the  Johnstown  flood, of the flood itself, and of its effects on  Johnstown  and the nation.    The addition of the South Fork Fishing and Hunting Club properties would significantly increase the park’s capability to interpret the important events surrounding the  Johnstown  flood and the individuals associated with it.           On May 31, 1889, a poorly maintained earthen dam breeched, sending 20 million tons of water down the Little Conemaugh Valley into Johnstown and other surrounding communities.     A 36-foot wall of water rolled over the town at 40 miles per hour, flattening houses, trees, locomotives, and everything else in its path.    By the disaster’s end, 2,209 people had perished in the flood, another 40 died in the weeks after from typhoid, and property damage was estimated at $17 million.    It was the worst inland flood in the nation’s history and the first test of the newly formed American Red Cross, headed up by Clara Barton.         A pivotal part of the story revolves around the South Fork Fishing and Hunting Club, located in Saint Michael, which in 1879 had purchased an abandoned reservoir, repaired the old dam, and created a private lake and recreational area for its members.     Because the dam was not properly constructed or maintained, it gave way after heavy rains pounded the area, overtaxing the Lake Conemaugh dam spillway and eventually causing the dam to fail.            In 1986, the South Fork Fishing and Hunting Club Historic District was listed on the National Register of Historic Places at the state level of significance.            In 1989, the Park Service and residents of Saint Michael undertook a joint planning effort, which produced the  Preservation and Interpretation Plan for the South Fork Fishing and Hunting Club Historic District.    This plan outlined concepts and guidance for basic visitor services, interpretation, cultural resource preservation and maintenance.    As a result of the plan, there developed a structured partnership between the village of Saint Michael and the Park Service, designed to protect, maintain and manage the South Fork Fishing and Hunting Club clubhouse and other significant cottages in the historic district.    The 1889 South Fork Fishing and Hunting Club Historical Preservation Society was formed to be the principal community body working with the Park Service in the implementation of the plan.    Since the original planning efforts, the Society has obtained ownership of the Clubhouse, the Annex, the Moorehead Cottage, and the Brown Cottage.    These properties were not originally included within the boundary of the park because it was understood that a local entity could adequately provide for their protection and interpretation.         Unfortunately, the Society lacks the resources to continue to maintain the properties they own, let alone preserve and develop them according to approved plans.    The Society is struggling to make mortgage payments, and while they are desperately seeking a solution, the properties are deteriorating and losing historic integrity.    In 2000, the Society worked with a private, non-profit historic property development company to try and obtain private sector interest in purchasing the properties, but was not successful.    There is an imminent threat to the protection of these resources.    The private owner has already listed these historic structures and properties for sale on the open market.         In 2001, the National Park Service completed a special resource study and environmental assessment to evaluate options for protection and interpretation of the additional parcels of land.    Based upon the report, the Park Service proposed to add these parcels of land to the boundary of the park and to acquire the parcels in fee simple.    Within the village of Saint Michael, four historically significant properties would be acquired.    These structures include the former clubhouse of the South Fork Fishing and Hunting Club, the Clubhouse Annex, and two cottages built by club members.    One undeveloped parcel, the Clubhouse Side-yard that sits between the Clubhouse and the Clubhouse Annex, would also be added.    The final parcel would protect the historic viewshed of the park, preserving the rural character of the Unger House property (Elias Unger was president of the South Fork Fishing and Hunting Club), owned by the National Park Service.         If the Park Service acquired the historic buildings, we would explore the option of a public-private partnership to lease the buildings to the private sector for commercial and residential use. Through our historic leasing program, the private sector could sign a long-term lease with the Park Service that would cover a portion of the operations and maintenance costs of the properties, which ranges from $75,000 to $310,000.    In addition, the private sector could rehabilitate the buildings, estimated to cost upwards of $2.9 million, using private funds in return for federal historic preservation tax credits.    This would decrease the financial burden placed on the Park Service by the addition of these properties to the park. There has already been interest expressed by local businesses in this proposal.         The proposal to add these properties to the boundary of the park has widespread support among the property owners, state and local governments, and the public who attended a public meeting in July 2001 in Saint Michael.    Public comments received were unanimous in support of the proposal.         We look forward to working with the local communities in Saint Michael and Johnstown to acquire these historically significant properties that will help tell the entire story of the events of the 1889 Johnstown Flood, from the actions leading up to the flood through its devastating aftermath.         Thank you for the opportunity to comment.    This concludes my prepared remarks.    I would be glad to answer any que stions that you or the members of the committee may have.

As a ""short form"" charter, it sets forth the institutions and processes of the City's political system and defines the authority and responsibilities of elected officials --the Mayor, Council, Comptroller, Borough Presidents, and Public Advocate --and City agencies in broad strokes, while leaving the details of operation to local law and agency rulemaking. Unlike the United States  Constitution, which is amended rarely, the City's Charter is a fluid document that is amended often. Indeed, while the U.S. Constitution has been amended only 27 times in its 215 year history, the Charter has been amended more than 100 times since 1989. In the United States, city governments receive their legal authority from the states in which they are located. In the State of New York, municipalities have broad authority to structure how they operate by virtue of the Home Rule provisions of the State Constitution and the Municipal Home Rule Law. The City's Charter, along with the State Constitution, the Municipal Home Rule Law and other State statutes, provides the legal framework within which it may conduct its affairs. Under State law, charter revision may occur as an ongoing process through the passage of local laws. There are limitations on that authority;  however; for example, there can be no curtailment of powers of an elected  -1-   official. A charter can also be revised pursuant to a State or City charter revision commission, which has the authority to put proposals before the voters. A  charter revision commission may put proposals before the voters regarding all elements of a charter, including the curtailment of powers of an elected official, as well as provisions that could also be adopted through loca l law. Municipal Home Rule Law (""MHRL"")  36(4) permits the Mayor to establish a ""charter commission"" in New York City. The composition of a mayoral charter  commission must consist of nine to fifteen members. The members must be City residents and may hold other public offices or employment. The Mayor  designates the chair, vice-chair and secretary of the commission pursuant to MHRL  36(4) and (6)(d). Charter commissions are not permanent commissions. MHRL  36(6)(e) limits the term of a charter commi ssion. A commission expires on the day of the election at which a proposed new charter or amendments prepared by a commission are submitted to the voters. However, if a commission fails to  submit a new charter or any amendments to the voters, the commission expires on the day of the second general election following the commission's creation. There are no prohibitions against the reappointment of a commission or appointment of a new commission upon the expiration of an existing commission. A charter commission may propose a broad set of amendments that essentially ""overhauls"" the entire charter, or may narrowly focus upon certain areas and explain why such an approach is preferable in a report to the public. MHRL  36(5)(a); see Matter of Cruz v. Deierlein, 84 N.Y.2d 890, 892-893  -2-   (1994). The proposed amendments must be consistent with general State laws and can only effect changes that are otherwise within the City's local legislative powers as set forth in the State Constitution and the MHRL. The proposed amendments must be filed with the City Clerk for action by the voters no later than the second general election after the commission's creation, and must be voted on at a general or special election held at least sixty days after the filing. The proposed amendments may be submitted to voters as one question, or a series of questions or alternatives. MHRL  36(5)(b). The Commission's Membership In July 2002, Mayor Michael R.

He has served on the legal staffs of the 1999 and 2001 Charter Revision Commissions. He has extensive City legal experi ence and has served in executive level capacities at the Loft Board. He has also been a Legal Aid attorney. Other members of the staff are from the City's Law Department (which is a professional, independent law office that has represented, among others , the Mayor, the Public Advocate, the Comptroller, and the City Council), the Departments of Finance and Probation, the Business Integrity and Anti Corruption Commission and the Mayor's Office. They include: Deputy General Counsel Elisabeth Palladino; Special Counsels Dara Jaffee and Florence Hutner; Assistant General Counsels Mark Tyler and Coleen Chin; Research Director -9-   Anne Fitzgibbon; Analyst Talya Sheinkman, and Administrative Aides Renee Wortham, Ivonne Sierra and Oscar Camacho. Most of these staff members served on the staffs of the 1999 and 2001 Charter Revision Commissions. PROPOSALS This report summarizes proposals and issues presented to the Commission by City agencies the public for review and possible inclusion on the ballot. Under separate cover, the staff has also presented the Commission with proposals and issues reviewed by the 1999 and 2001 Charter Revision Commissions that were ultimately deferred for study by future Commissions. As the Commission reviews these sets of proposals and issues, the staff will accordingly summarize for the Commission all new City agency and public proposals as they are submitted.  CITY AGENCY SUBMISSIONS DEPARTMENT OF BUILDINGS  Clarify DOB's Subpoena Power  Issue: Should the Charter be amended to clarify the Department of Building's (""DOB"") subpoena power so that it is not limited only to cases ""where the public safety is involved""? Relevant Charter Provision:  646. Discussion: Charter  646 provides that the Buildings Commissioner ""shall have the power and duty to conduct such inquiries as may assist him in the performance of the functions of the department where the public safety is  - 10 -   involved and for such purpose he shall have subpoena power to compel the attendance of witnesses, to administer oaths, examine witnesses and to compel the production of books, papers and documents."" The Department of Buildings has proposed removing the requirement that the subpoena power be available to the Commissioner only when performing the functions of the Department that involve public safety. Under the current Charter provision, subpoenaed parties have questioned DOB's authority to demand certain records which, on their face, do not appear to relate to public safety. For example, the Department's Investigations and Discipline Unit may seek to subpoena the telephone records of a contractor or professional in the course of an investigation. While this may not at first appear to be a public safety issue, where the underlying investigation concerns unsafe or illegal work, t here may in fact be important public safety issues and concerns that exist. To address such concerns, DOB has proposed removing the public safety limitation to allow it to perform its investigations without unnecessary delay and without being subject to legal challenges concerning subpoena authority.  CONFLICTS OF INTEREST BOARD  Assured Funding  Issue: Should the Charter be amended to assure funding for COIB? Relevant Charter Provision:  2602.  - 11 -   Discussion: The City's Conflicts of Interest Board (""COIB ""), established in Charter Chapter 68, proposes that its independence be established explicitly in the Charter by providing for an assured source of funding. As an independent ethics agency, COIB has no natural constituency and no source of revenue. This position is complicated by the fact that it regulates the very people who set its budget. Thus, it could be argued that COIB's continued survival requires a source of assured financing. There are several options to be considered that could provide assured funding. One possibility is making the agency self-funding, for example, by  charging all 12,000 financial disclosure filers a filing fee or by requiring short form disclosure by all 300,000 public servants, accompanied by a nominal filing fee. The Ohio Ethics Commission receives substantial funds in this manner, although most of the filing fees are paid by the filer's agency. Another possibility is a guaranteed minimum budget. Such a provision might read: ""The appropriations available to pay for the expenses of the board during each fiscal year shall not be less than six one thousandths of one percent of the net total expense budget of the city."" See the provisions for the  Independent Budget Office (Charter  259(b)), whose budget must be at least 10% of the budget of the Office of Management and Budget. See also Mich. Const. art. xi,  5 (requiring that the legislature appropriate to the Michigan Civil Service Commission ""a sum not less than one percent of the aggregate payroll of the classified ser vice for the preceding fiscal year""). Under that proposal, every billion-dollar decrease in the City's budget would decrease the Board's budget by  - 12 -   $60,000; and the City's Fiscal Year 2003 budget would yield a COIB budget of about $2.5 million. Another for m of a guaranteed budget could provide a specific amount, adjusted for inflation. Such a provision might read: ""The appropriations available to pay for the expenses of the conflicts of interest board during each fiscal year shall not be less than two million five hundred thousand dollars, which amount shall be adjusted annually to reflect changes in the consumer price index for the metropolitan New York region published by the United States bureau of labor statistics."" The adjustment language in that alte rnative provision is taken from current Charter  2603(a) (adjustment to threshold for ""ownership interest""). See, e.g., Calif. Gov't Code  83122 (guaranteeing a budget of $1,000,000 for fiscal year 1975-1976, adjusted for cost-of-living changes during each fiscal year thereafter, for the California Fair Political Practices Commission). COIB argues that such an increase in its budget, prudently spent, could cover the additional responsibilities given to the Board under Charter amendments presently being considered by the Board. It should be emphasized that such a provision would set only a guaranteed minimum budget; the City could adopt a larger budget for the Board in any particular year. Likely, the most desirable option for COIB would be an option that provides for submission of the Board's proposed budget to the Council, without amendment by the administration. This proposal is identical to the budget scheme adopted for the Campaign Finance Board in Charter  1052(12)(c), with the addition of a provision governing mid-year modifications to the Board's budget. The Board's  - 13 -   proposed budget would be public and any reductions would require affirmative action, reducing the likelihood of ill-advised cuts, while preserving the budget authority established b y Chapter 10 of the Charter.  The COIB Member Nomination Process  Issue: Should the Charter be amended to give the City Council and the Mayor more parity in the nomination process for the members of the Conflicts of Interest Board? Relevant Charter Provision:  2602. Discussion: To further insure impartiality and independence COIB has  addressed the issue that the City Council and the Mayor have greater parity in the nomination process for the members of the Conflicts of Interest Board. Presently the Mayor appoints the five members of the Board ""with the advice and consent of the council"" ( 2602 (a)). It should be noted that the former Council Speaker had recommended that the Council make some of the appointments to the Board. However, split  appointments  some by the mayor and some by the Council - present the danger of politicizing Board appointments and undermining accountability, a charge often leveled at the Board of Education prior to the recent amendments, largely as a result of its split appointment process. As an alternative, appointments could be made only upon the recommendation of an independent body, similar to a judicial screening committee. For example, commissioners of the Hawaii State Ethics Commission are appointed by the governor from a panel of ten persons nominated by the judicial council, an  - 14 -   advisory body appointed by the Hawaii Supreme Court.  See Hawaii Revised  Statutes  84-21(a) and 601-4. Such a screening committee could be established for appointments to the Board and to other similar non-mayoral boards and commissions; the members of such a body could be appointed by each citywide elected official (mayor, speaker, comptroller, and public advocate), perhaps with two mayoral appointments, one of whom would be the chair of the committee. Clarifying Amendments .  COIB Clarifying Amendments  Issue: Should the Charter be amended to clarify that (1) a COIB member can act as lobbyist on his or her behalf before the City; and (2) the staff director should be known as the executive director instead of counsel? Relevant Charter Provision:  2602. Discussion: COIB proposes that the Charter  2602(b) be amended to clarify  that a Board member cannot act as a paid lobbyist on behalf of someone else but may act as a lobbyist on his or her own behalf, but not before the Board in violation of  2604(b)(6). COIB also proposes that the term ""counsel,"" which was carried over to COIB from its predecessor, the Board of Ethics, be replaced with the term ""executive director,"" as the person who shall serve as the staff director. First, the amendment reflects that the size and mission of the Conflicts of Interest Board are larger than that of the Board of Ethics. Second, it gives the Board the freedom to hire a qualified non-lawyer for the p osition of executive director.  - 15 -   DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE  Uniform Right to Appeal from Determinations of the Tax Appeals Tribunal Issue: Should the Charter be amended to permit appeals from the tax appeals tribunal by both the taxpayers and the Commissioner o f Finance? Relevant Charter Provision:  171. Discussion: Charter  168 provides for an independent Tax Appeals Tribunal within the Department of Finance. The Charter specifies that the ""powers, functions, duties and obligations of the tribunal shall be separate from and independent of the authority of the commissioner of finance."" The Charter establishes that the Tribunal has jurisdiction to hear and determine cases initiated by the filing of petitions protesting notices issued by the Finance Commissioner for which taxpayers have the right to a hearing, including ""any notice of determination of a tax due, a tax deficiency, of a denial of a refund or credit application"" that relate to excise taxes, vault charges and taxes other than taxes on real property s uch as the City's business taxes. Charter 171 provides that decisions of the Tribunal are final and specifies that such Tribunal decisions are subject to judicial review pursuant to Article 78 of the Civil Practice Law and Rules. However, this right to judicial review is inequitably afforded only to the taxpayer and not to the Commissioner of Finance. Specifically, Charter 171(b) provides that ""each decision of the tribunal, shall finally and irrevocably decide all the issues raised in the proceedings before it, unless the petitioner who commenced the proceeding  - 16 -   seeks judicial review of any such decision in the manner provided in article seventy-eight of the civil practice law and rules within four months after the giving of the notice of such decision."" (emphasis added). Because the Charter specifies that the opportunity to appeal is limited to the petitioner who commenced the proceeding, which in such proceedings is the taxpayer, the City is left without any opportunity to challenge decisions of the ind ependent tribunal. As the Tribunal is an independent entity, in order to ensure fairness, both parties should have the same right to appeal. The ability to appeal such decisions is necessary for the Department of Finance to fairly administer and properly implement the City's tax laws on behalf of the many taxpayers of the City of New York. To remedy this inequity, the Department of Finance has proposed amending Charter 171 to provide that both the Commissioner of Finance as well as the petitioner may seek judicial review of determinations. It is important to note that when the voters originally approved the creation of the Tax Appeals Tribunal to hear City excise tax appeals in the 1988 referendum, Charter 171 as approved explicitly permitted both the  Commissioner of Finance and the taxpayer to appeal tribunal decisions. In 1992, however, when the Tribunal's jurisdiction was expanded to include City business taxes, Charter 171 was legislatively amended to limit the right to appeal to the petitioner who commenced the proceeding, thus preventing the Commissioner of Finance from appealing Tribunal determinations (Ch. 808 L. 1992). This inequity prevents the City of New York from adequately defending the interests of all the City's taxpayers. Therefore, it is proposed that Charter 171 be amended to  - 17 -   allow the Commissioner of Finance to also appeal determinations of the independent Tribunal.  Administration and Enforcement of the Payment made by NonResident City Employees as a Condition of City Employment Issue: Should the Charter be amended in relation to the administration and enforcement of the payment that nonresident City employees make as a condition of their employment? Relevant Charter Provision:  1127. Discussion: Charter  1127 provides in relevant part that ""every person seeking employment with the city of New York or any of its agencies regardless of civil service classification or status shall sign an agreement as a condition precedent to such employment to the effect that if such person is or becomes a nonresident individual . . . during employment by the city, such person will pay to the city an amount by which a city personal income tax on residents computed and determined as if such person were a resident individual, as defined in such section, during such employment, exceeds the amount of any city earnings tax and city personal income tax imposed on such person for the same taxable period.""1 This amount is not a tax but a contractual obligation from which the City derived more than $60 million in revenue under this provision in 2001. Since the Department of Finance has administered the  1127 program, it has been the subject of much debate, confusion and litigation in a number of areas including its applicability to certain classes of public servants. Thus, the 1  Added by Local Law No. 2 of 1973, employees hired prior to and continuously employed since January 4, 1973 are exempted.  - 18 -   Department has requested the Commission determine whether a clarification of this section of the Charter is necessary regarding its application and enforcement.  DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND MENTAL HYGIENE  Establish a Consistent Uniform Maximum Penalty for the  Enforcement of Violations of the Various Public Health Laws Issue: Should the Charter be amended to establish a consistent uniform  maximum penalty for violations of the various public health laws and regulations by increasing from $1,000 to $2,000 the maximum penalty that may be imposed by the Commissioner of Health and Mental Hygiene for the violation of any provision of Chapter 22 of the Charter or any notice, order or regulation issued pursuant such provision? Relevant Charter Provision:  555(b)(2). Discussion: There does not currently exist a consistent uniform maximum  penalty applicable to the various provisions of law enforced by the Commissioner of Health and Mental Hygiene. Pursuant to  12(1) of the New York State Publi c Health, violations of the New York State Sanitary Code, much of which is enforced in the City by the Commissioner of Health and Mental Hygiene, may be penalized by fines up to a maximum amount of two thousand dollars. Pursuant to Section 3.12(a) of the New York City Health Code, as amended by a resolution of the Board of Health on April 26, 1994, violations of the New York City Health  - 19 -   Code may also be penalized by fines up to a maximum amount of two thousand dollars. However, Charter 555(b)(2) provides that the regulations promulgated by the Commissioner of Health and Mental Hygiene to implement requirements found in the Charter and the New York City Administrative Code can only be enforced by penalties of up to one thousand dollars. The regulations of the  Commissioner of Health and Mental Hygiene, which currently number more than twenty, are contained in Title 24 of the Rules of the City of New York and relate to subjects as varied as window guard enforcement, enforcement of the Smoke Free Air Act and mobile food vendor regulation. To remedy this problem of not having a consistent uniform maximum penalty applicable to the various laws and regulations enforced by the Commissioner of Health and Mental Hygiene, the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene has proposed amending Charter  555(b)(2) to increase from $1,000 to $2,000 the maximum amount which may be imposed for the violation of regulations promulgated by the Commissioner to implement requirements of the Charter and the New York City Administrative Code. The $1,000 maximum has been in effect since 1977 (Local Law 25 of 1977).  - 20 -   DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING PRESERVATION AND DEVELOPMENT  Deputy Commissioners  Issue: Should the Charter be amended to provide HPD the authority to appoint deputy commissioners as needed? Relevant Charter Provision:  1801. Discussion: Charter  1801 limits to five the number of deputy commissioners that may be appointed at HPD. HPD proposes that the language be made less limiting to reflect the flexibility needed to operate a large agency with many discrete functions. HPD would like to appoint deputy commissioners ""as may be necessary.""  Jurisdiction  Issue: Should the Charter be amended to clarify HPD's jurisdiction? Relevant Charter Provision:  1802. Discussion: Charter  1802(3) gives HPD ""all powers, rights and duties as provided by any federal, state or local law or resolution, relating to slum clearance . . . urban renewal . . . (and) public housing."" HPD proposes that its Charter language be clarified by cross -referencing specifically General Municipal Law Article 16 which authorizes HPD to sell property, make loans and grant tax exemptions. HPD also requests clarification in the Charter concerning its authority to administer tax exemption and abatement programs. Presently, Charter  1802 (6)(b) authorizes HPD to administer these programs pursuant to the following language:  - 21 -   ""administer laws authorizing tax exemption or tax abatement or both, including but not limited to, section 11 -243 of the administrative code of the city of New York and section four hundred twenty one of the real property tax law [RPTL], which are in aid of construction, rehabilitation, alteration or improvement of residential buildings and structures . . ."" HPD would like the specific references to RPTL  421 and Administrative Code  11-243 removed because they no longer reflect accurately HPD's authority and obligations regarding tax incentive programs. First, the reference to RPTL  421 is erroneous because that section is now blank. Second, HPD's authority to administer tax programs has expanded beyond Administrative Code  11-243; HPD now administers tax programs set forth in Administrative Code  11-241 through 11-245. HPD would like to  replace the inaccurate and outdated references with broad, open-ended, language regarding its mandate to administer tax programs generally that would permit HPD to create and administer new tax incentive programs as needed. Additionally, HPD proposes that Charter 1802 specifically state that HPD may administer loan programs.  Reducing Approval Requirements for Small Emergency Purchases  Issue: Should the Charter be amended to exempt small purchases, which are also emergency purchases, from approval by the Corporation Counsel and the Comptroller? Relevant Charter Provision:  315. Discussion: Charter Chapter 13 governs procurement. Section 315 provides for ""[e]mergency procurement"" and requires approval for emergency purchases from  - 22 -   the Comptroller and Corporation Counsel regardless of t he dollar amount at stake. HPD proposes to eliminate the requirement for approval by the  Comptroller and the Corporation Counsel in situations involving small dollar amounts. The dollar amount threshold for small purchases is established by the Procureme nt Policy Board (""PPB"") pursuant to Charter  314. The current small purchase limit is $25,000 for goods, $50,000 for services, $100,000 for construction and construction-related services and information technology. Presently, the Charter requires approval from the Corporation Counsel and the Comptroller for all emergency purchases. HPD's proposal would  authorize PPB to establish small emergency purchase rules eliminating the current approval requirement and making it apply only in specific circumstances, such as for purchases that do not exceed the small purchase limits.  2  Clarifying that the Requirement to Obtain an Appraisal for the Disposition of Real Property is Limited in its Scope  Issue: Should the Charter be amended to clarify specifically when appraisals are required as a predicate to disposition of city property? Relevant Charter Provision:  384. Discussion: Presently, Charter Chapter 15, entitled Property of the City  provides for section 384 reads as follows: ""Disposal of the property of the City. a. No real property of the city may be sold, leased, exchanged or otherwise disposed of 2  HPD has submitted the text of what it states that ""[e]mergency purchases shall be made except that the appro val of the Comptroller emergency purchases which are less than or that the rule worked well, but was repealed by  is a former PPB rule: Section 3-08(i) once provided in accordance with Section 3-06 of these Rules, and the Corporation Counsel is not required for equal to the small purchase limits."" HPD contends Charter  315.  - 23 -   except with the approval of the mayor and as may be provided by law unless such power is expressly vested by law in another agency. b. Except as otherwise specifically provided by law: . . . 3. Real property of the city may be sold only after appraisal made within six months prior to the authorization of the sale and after a review of such appraisal by the department of citywide services within thirty days prior to the authorization of the sale, provided that advertisement for the public auction for such sale shall be commenced within sixty days of such authorization."" HPD finds the provision ambiguous because the final clause of subsection ""3,"" quoted above, appears to limit the provision to auction sales. However, the provision may be read as a general requirement. HPD seeks language that would eliminate the ambiguity. HPD presents a proposed amendment to  384 which clarifies that the provision does not create a general requirement for an appraisal. The new language makes clear that only in instances where the  property is disposed of by auction, pursuant to the provision itself, is an appraisal required. HPD no longer disposes of property pursuant to Charter  384. The proposed change would make clear that HPD is not required to obtain a prior appraisal in all circumstances.  - 24 -     Updating Provisions Relating to the Prohibition of Certain City Employees from Participating in Public Auction, Sealed Bid, and Negotiated Sales of City -Owned Real Property  Issue:  Should the Charter be amended to (1) make clarifying amendments  reflecting accurately the administrative structure of HPD and (2) prohibit employees of another division of HPD from participating in negotiated sales of City-owned residential buildings containing six or less dwelling units if such employees participated in decisions affecting the property? Relevant Charter Provisions:  2604(c). Discussion: Charter  2604 relates to the Conflicts of Interest and imposes various restrictions on the activities of City employees. Section 2604(c)(7)  prohibits certain City employees from bidding on and purchasing City-owned real property at a public auction or sealed bid sale, purchasing any City-owned residential building containing six or less dwelling units through a negotiated sale, if such employees participated in decisions affecting the property. HPD suggests a division of HPD, the Office of Development, be added to the groups of employees prohibited from participating in negotiated sales because that division handles such transactions. Furthermore, the reference to HPD's Office of Property Management (""OPM"") relating to auctions or sealed bids in  2604(c)(7) is outdated and should be omitted becaus e OPM no longer exists and the auction sales program it administered was discontinued a decade ago.  - 25 -   HPD also recommends that this prohibition regarding negotiated sales be separated from the prohibition relating to buying City-owned property at a public auction or sealed bid sale in  2604(c)(7) and moved to its own separate section succeeding the public auction/sealed bid section.  Demolition of Buildings Pursuant to DOB Emergency Orders  Issue: Should the Charter be amended to authorize the Departme nt of Design and Construction (""DDC"") to perform demolitions and related actions in response to Department of Buildings (""DOB"") emergency orders? Relevant Charter Provisions:  1202(a). Discussion: Currently, HPD or the Department of Citywide Administra tive Services (""DCAS"") may demolish buildings pursuant to the precept process. In that process DOB notifies a landlord of the hazardous condition(s) and a survey is conducted and presented at court. The court then determines the remedial action to be taken which may include demolition. DOB also can issue  emergency orders to mandate the immediate demolition of a building. Although there are currently no provisions that identify the agency responsible for such demolition in an emergency situation, HPD ha s effectively taken the sole responsibility for such demolitions despite their complicated nature. DDC,  however, which is responsible for street, sewer, water main and most nonhousing building construction, funded by the capital budget, has more archite ctural expertise and technical skills to demolish buildings on an emergency basis, particularly with regard to buildings with complex structures. Because DDC has greater expertise than HPD in this area, HPD contends it  - 26 -   would be more efficient for DDC to be authorized to handle these demolitions. In order to recoup the costs of this demolition, HPD recommends that the DDC Commissioner be permitted to impose and collect charges for the work, and file liens for these costs.  DEPARTMENT OF INVESTIGATION (""DOI"") Issue: Should the Charter be amended to incorporate and expand the  provisions of the City's Whistleblower Law to protect all City employees, including employees of quasi- municipal agencies? Relevant Charter Provision: Chapter 49. Discussion: The City's Whistleblower Law is codified at Administrative Code  12-113 and prohibits certain City agencies from taking an adverse retaliatory personnel action against an officer or employee who reports information to DOI concerning conduct which he or she knows or reasonably believes to involve corrupt or criminal activity or a conflict of interest. The law is limited in its applicability to officers or employees of ""an agency of the city, the head or members of which are appointed by the mayor."" Thus, employees of the Comptroller, the Borough Presidents, the City Council, the Public Advocate or any quasi-City agency such as the Economic Development Corporation (""EDC""), the Housing Development Corporation (""HDC""), Off- Track Betting Corporation (""OTB""), and Business Improvement Districts (""BIDs""), are not afforded whistleblower protection under City law. However, all City  employees play an essential role in providing information about fraud, corruption  - 27 -   and mismanagement, including those who work in the offices of elected officials, as well as those who work in government-created entities that perform municipal functions. Accordingly, DOI proposes that the Commission amend the current law and recodify it in the Charter. First, DOI proposes that the requirement tha t covered individuals be employed by an agency of the City, ""the head or members of which are appointed by the mayor,"" be deleted, and that the term ""agency"" be expanded to include not only mayoral agencies, but also the offices of elected officials and quasi-City agencies, including BIDs. Second, DOI proposes that the scope of the type of information that may be reported (e.g., criminal activity, etc.) by an individual that would enable him or her to claim whistleblower protection be expanded to include ""gross mismanagement"" and ""abuse of authority"" in order to conform the scope of whistleblower protections found in Executive Order 78 of 1984. Finally, DOI suggests that its proposals be recodified in Charter Chapter 49 because that chapter includes several provisions relating to employee integrity. In particular, Charter  1116, inter alia, makes fraud by a council member, officer, or employee of the City a misdemeanor and bars anyone convicted from office or employment, and Charter  1128 prohibits inte rference with any investigation pursuant to the Charter and demands full cooperation with DOI by every officer and employee of the City.  - 28 -   OFFICE OF ADMINISTRATIVE TRIALS AND HEARINGS The Office of Administrative Trials and Hearings (""OATH"") was establishe d by Executive Order No. 32 in 1979, and was codified in Charter Chapter 45-A by the 1989 Charter revision. As stated in Mayor Koch's  memorandum accompanying the executive order, administrative trials in the City had previously ""too often been characterized by procedural shortcomings and inconsistent, judicially reversible results."" The Mayor's goal, therefore, was to establish OATH as a centralized tribunal, in order ""to reform the due process trial system."" As an alternative to litigation, administrati ve trials are invaluable as a means of dispute resolution, because they provide, in comparison to litigation in court, a relatively quick and simple means of resolving disputes. See generally ""Alternative Dispute Resolution: Panacea or Anathema?"" 99 Harv. L. Rev. 668 (1986). The keys to OATH's structure are its impartiality and independence. In Executive Order No. 32, Mayor Koch mandated that all of OATH's administrative law judges (""ALJs"") ""maintain the standard of, and preside over administrative trials and hearings in accordance with the Canons of the Code of Judicial Conduct of the American Bar Association adopted."" OATH was made a Charter agency pursuant to the 1989 Charter revision. Part of that Charter Revision Commission's goal was to establish OATH as ""an independent adjudicative body that can be a resource to agencies conducting their adjudications, while at the same time establishing an independent structure outside of the agency to provide  - 29 -   an unbiased assessment of the matters to be adjudicate d."" Report of the Charter Revision Commission, Vol. 2 at p. 103 (April 1989). Since that time, OATH has become an integral part of City government. It hears over 2,000 cases per year, on behalf of numerous mayoral and nonmayoral agencies. In most cases, OATH prepares findings of fact plus a The agency  recommendation as to the proper determination of the case.  involved in the adjudication then determines whether to accept, reject, or modify the recommendation. The agency's determination is subject to challenge in court under Article 78 of the Civil Procedure Law and Rules. In addition to the obvious value that OATH's role plays in City government, perhaps one measure of its success is that many agencies have chosen to hold their administrative trials and hearings at OATH. Despite its success, OATH's experience has shown that its current Charter provisions may not give it the administrative flexibility it requires to best serve the needs of the City's agencies and employees. Therefore, OATH has proposed, for the Commission's consideration, a number of changes to Chapter 45-A that would enable this flexibility. Issue: Should the Charter be amended to provide OATH with administrative flexibility to allow it to best serve the needs of the City? Relevant C harter Provisions: Chapter 45-A. Discussion: Under Charter 1049(1), each OATH ALJ must be an attorney admitted to practice in New York State for at least five years. In addition, each ALJ is appointed for a term of five years, and is removable only for cause after  - 30 -   notice and an opportunity to be heard. These provisions help ensure the quality and independence of the ALJs. The five - year term, in particular, helps ensure independence, because it shields the ALJs from immediate retribution for unpopular findings or recommendations. However, the five - year term also has limited the administration of OATH, perhaps in unnecessary ways. OATH has submitted two major proposals regarding the five - year term. The first is to allow the Chief ALJ to appoint temporary ALJs (who would not have the fixed term), in addition to the staff of full- time ALJs. In addition to the Chief and the Deputy Chief, OATH currently has eight ALJs hearing cases. Because this is not a large corps of ALJs, any temporary drop in staffing (e.g. sick leave or maternity leave), results in an assignment of new cases and redistribution of older cases that has a relatively large impact on the remaining ALJs. These temporary problems could be efficiently dealt with if the Chief ALJ had the ability to appoint temporary ALJs to handle these uncovered cases. Furthermore, the ability to appoint temporary ALJs would allow OATH to more efficiently handle unexpected or seasonal influxes of cases. For example, the City, State, and Board of Education are currently considering whether OATH should hear certain Board cases involving special education. Should OATH be designated to hear these cases, its caseload would more than double and there would be a particularly difficult seasonal spike in the late spring and summer. Considering the importance of these cases and the need to resolve them within a short period of time, the ability to hire temporary ALJs is crucial.  - 31 -   OATH's other proposal regarding the five - year term involves creating a one- year term to which a newly appointed ALJ would be appointed, followed by an appointment to the five - year term. While an ALJ, in either type of term, would be removable only for cause, creation of an initial one - year term would allow OATH to determine, based on actual experience with the work of the new ALJ, whether his or her work was of sufficiently high caliber to merit reappointment. This process of an initial one - year term, with subsequent longer terms, is presently used by the New Jersey Office of Administrative Law, New Jersey's central administrative hearings office. 3  When OATH was established, Executive Order No. 32 required that OATH's Administrative Law Judges comply with the Canons of Judicial Conduct. While OATH's judges adhere currently to the highest evels of ethical judicial l conduct, OATH requests that this requirement be codified symbolically in the Charter. Finally, OATH requests that the Charter provision which establishes its adjudicatory standard be more clearly stated. Presently the provision governing its adjudicatory standards (Chapter 45-A,  1049 (2)) references OATH's adjudicatory standard as that contained in Chapter 45 of the Charter. That Chapter contains the entire City Administrative Procedures Act (""CAPA""). Within Chapter 45 is section 1146 which governs adjudication standards. OATH  requests that the specific section regarding adjudication be the reference rather than all of CAPA.  3  See New Jersey Permanent Statutes, Title 52, Section 52:14F- 4.  - 32 -   DEPARTMENT OF PARKS AND RECREATION  Retention of Funds Generated by Fees, Permits, Environmental Control Board (""ECB"") Penalties, and Litigation Regarding Tree Damage Issue: Should the Charter be amended to permit the Parks Department (""Parks"") to deposit into a Parks account rather than the City's General Fund the following: 1) concession fees and special events payments; and 2) money collected from penalties resulting from ECB summonses for violations of Parks rules and affirmative litigation awards regarding tree damage or similar cases? Relevant Charter Provision:  109. Discussion: The operation of concession services and special events requires a significant amount of management. In addition, the operation of special events ultimately contributes to the deterioration of Parks property. In order to provide Parks the incentive to increase concessions revenue and to effectively prevent special events from causing long -term damage to Parks property, such concession fees and special events payments could be specifically earmarked to pay for the enhanced maintenance and upkeep of Parks property, such as re-sodding grass and replacing plantings, etc. In addition, the money collected from summonses and litigation  relating to damage to City trees could be expressly given to Parks for forestry related expenses, such as replanting trees and maintenance of City trees. Such an  amendment would provide greater incentives for Parks to generate revenue and would enable Parks to more immediately see the financial impact of enforcement efforts (i.e. tree damage cases). If this exception to 109 is viewed as too broad,  - 33 -   then Parks proposes that a certain percentage of the above revenue be retained by Parks. Moreover, Parks could dedicate all or a portion of these dedicated funds to specific Mayoral priorities, including developing waterfront parks or extending the service hours at playgrounds.  Registration of Concession Agreements  Issue: Should the Charter be amended to exempt Parks concession agreements from the City contract registration process? Relevant Charter Provision:  375. Discussion: Parks's revenue and administrative functions would be made more efficient if all concession agreements, or at least concessions which earn less than $100,000 in revenue for the City, were exempt from the registration process. Registering concession agreements, where the City receives money, does not present the same oversight concerns as those present in contracts where the City expends money. Moreover, the administrative expense and aggravation involved in registering every pushcart or other small concession far exceeds any benefit from the Comptroller's oversight of this large volume of concessions through the registration process. For example, Parks managed approximately 188 small concession  agreements, 90 temporary use concession agreements, and 170 special event vending permits in 2001. For many of these contracts, the City gets as little as $50 $1,000 in fees. The Comptroller's Office requires such concession agreements to be submitted 30 days before the implementation of the agreement. However, the  registration process is extremely time-consuming because it requires the input of a  - 34 -   large amount of data. Required strict compliance with the registration process will likely delay the City's receipt of this revenue source. This proposed amendment would lower administrative and bureaucratic costs with only a slight concomitant decrease in financial oversight. Further, Parks is already charged with regularly reporting the revenue earned by such concession agreements to the Comptroller's Office, and therefore the Comptroller's Office would retain its ability to monitor these contracts. In addition, the Comptroller's Office would also still be able to conduct audits of such contracts. In the alternative, Parks proposes that such concession agreements be subject to self-registration, whereby Parks inputs the relevant information to register a contract into the Comptroller's Office database, and the contract is deemed to be automatically registered. Although inputting such data would usually take about an hour, self-registration still would stream-line the current 30 day registration process and eliminate unproductive delays.  Use of Board of Education Property When Property is not in Use  Issue: Should the Charter be amended to give Parks jurisdiction to maintain and program activities on playgrounds and playing fields that are currently under the control of the Board of Education at those times when school programs are not taking place (i.e., weekends and school vacation periods)? Relevant Charter Provisions:  521, 533. Discussion: The demand for Parks to provide youth athletic programs and playing fields is extremely high, particularly during the summer. However, many of the playgrounds and playfields of the Board of Education are not in use in the summer,  - 35 -   and Parks' use of this property would expand its ability to provide youth athletic programs and playing fields for permitted activities throughout the City.  Authority to Value and Sell Parks Memorabilia and/or Artifacts  Issue: Should the Charter be amended to authorize the Department of Citywide Administrative Services' (""DCAS"") to issue waivers regarding the salvage process to other City agencies? Relevant Charter Provision:  811. Discussion: Currently, DCAS is responsible for receiving unwanted equipment from other agencies and for determining whether the equipment should be auctioned, reassigned, or destroyed. However, Parks has the expertise necessary to assign the appropriate value for a variety of memorabilia or artifacts that are not otherwise easy to value under the DCAS salvage process, such as old stadium seats, signs, and statutes, etc. Such objects have value for collectors and often can generate a much higher revenue than what the City receives through the DCAS salvage process. Therefore, in order to ease the significant burden the salvage responsibility imposes on DCAS and to generate more revenue for the City by capitalizing on Parks' expertise of specialty items, DCAS should be provided with the authority to issue waivers of its responsibility to salvage equipment to other City agencies.4 In this way, other agencies, such as Parks, with specialized expertise in specific items, would be able to value and sell the objects at a more competitive rate. Under these proposals, all revenue generated by the sale of such specialty items would be placed in the City's General Fund. 4  With this revision, Parks is not suggesting that it be given the authority to sell non -unique items. For example, Parks would not seek authority to sell old office furniture, computer equipment, vehicles, etc.  - 36 -    Issue:  Adding the Parks Commissioner to the Environmental Control Board Should the Charter be amended to add the Parks Commissioner to the  Environmental Control Board (""ECB"")? Relevant Charter Provisions:  1404. Discussion: The ECB has the authority to issue rules and regulations regarding many environmental topics, including air and water pollution, hazardous materials, defacement of City property. It also serve s as an administrative tribunal for various environmental violations. Parks plays an important role in enforcing and helping to promulgate rules and regulations answerable through ECB summons 5, and therefore Parks contends that it is logical for the Parks Commissioner to be included with the Commissioners of Environmental Protection, Sanitation, Buildings, Health, Police, Fire, and Consumer Affairs on the Board. Further, it would be useful to have the Parks Commissioner on the board since the ECB has the authority to adopt and amend regulations relating to the use and regulation of all property subject to Parks' jurisdiction.  PROCUREMENT Issue: Should the Charter be amended in relation to procurement?  Relevant Charter Provision: Chapter 13. Discussion: Both the 1999 and 2001 Charter Revision Commissions examined the City's procurement system, because of concerns expressed both by City  5  For ex ample, Parks employs Parks Enforcement Police officers to issue ECB summons for the violation of Parks rules and requires these officers to be present at the hearings of these violations.  - 37 -   agencies and members of the public, including the contracting community, that the system was inefficient. The primary criticism of the procurement process was that it caused the City to take too long to enter into contracts. The proposals made by the 1999 Commissionincluding proposals to raise the small purchase limit and to make it easier to procure goods, services or construction from another governmental entity were defeated as part of the single question that was submitted to the voters. The 2001 staff recommendations included increasing the small purchase limits, allowing DCAS to delegate to user agencies the authority to purchase certain goods, raising the dollar threshold for holding public hearings on contracts, streamlining the registration process, and providing for centralized vendor integrity assessment. The Commission ultimately chose to propose to the voters only the centralized vendor integrity assessment provision. That  proposal was adopted at referendum, resulting in the repeal of the then-existing Charter  335, and its replacement with the current Section 335. Procurement continues to be an important topic in 2002. In February, the Citizens Budget Commission issued a report on the City's procurement process, suggesting that the City could realize significant budget savings if it streamlined the process, introduced strategic procurement methods, and applied technology to the process. In both the Preliminary and Executive Budgets, the Mayor  included significant savings in the out - years of the Financial Plan from a Procurement Reform Initiative. As the representatives of the Mayor's Office  commenced work on the Procurement Reform Initiative in the Spring of 2002, the  - 38 -   City Council adopted many reforms, summarized below, that had been proposed during the past several years. First, the Council raised small purchases limits. Prior to amendment of the limits, small purchases had been defined as procurements in value of not more than $25,000 for goods and services, not more than $50,000 for construction and construction-related services, and not more than $100,000 for information technology. Effective July 8, 2002, the limits were raised, by concurrent action of the Procurement Policy Board (""PPB"") and the Council, see Charter  314, to purchases in value of not more than $25,000 for goods, $50,000 for services, and $100,000 for construction, construction-related services, and information technology. A second example of procurement reform enacted by the Council in 2002 was in the area of public hearings on contracts. Section 326 of the Charter basically requires public hearings for all non-bid contracts value d over $100,000. By Local Law No. 8 (2002), however, the Mayor and the Council amended Charter  326 to somewhat address the perceived burden of this requirement. While Local Law No. 8 did not change the $100,000 threshold, it added a provision that allo wed an agency to not hold an otherwise necessary hearing in certain circumstances. Specifically, Charter  326(a) not provides that if, within a period of time to be set by the PPB, ""no individual requests an opportunity to speak at such a public hearing with respect to any such proposed contract the value of which does not exceed five hundred thousand dollars, then such public hearing need not be conducted.""  - 39 -   The Commission staff has been asked to identify other issues for the Commission, and to report on the progress made on them since the last Commission studied procurement in 2001. However, the Mayor is in the process of conducting, as coordinated by the Mayor's Office of Contracts, a major Procurement Reform Initiative. Representatives of the Mayor ha ve met, and  continue to meet, with important stockholder in the procurement community, including the City Council, the Comptroller, vendors and Agency Chief Contracting Officers. The Procurement Reform Initiative is an effort to  comprehensively examine the City's procurement system, in an effort to make large-scale reforms that will make the system more efficient, and thereby benefit both the City and its contractors. In light of the Initiative, it has been  recommended to the Commission staff that procure ment not be studied at this time as a source for possible reform, in view of the process that began before this Charter Revision Commission.  - 40 -   PUBLIC SUBMISSIONS THE BOROUGH PRESIDENTS Issue: Should the Charter be amended either to eliminate or alter the powers of the Offices of Borough President? Relevant Charter Provisions:  81 through 86.  Discussion: Commission staff received several public comments concerning the Offices of Borough President. One comment recommended the offices be  eliminated because they perform functions that are duplicative of functions performed by other City offices and officials. The recommendation notes that the elimination of Borough Presidents would save approximately $38 million dollars. Another comment recommends that the Commission reconsider the role of Borough Presidents, including whether they should have control over certain discretionary capital and expense budget allocations.  - 41 -"
GX256-15-6666369	AMENDED IN SENATE APRIL 21, 2003 AMENDED IN SENATE MARCH 26, 2003  SENATE BILL  No. 465  Introduced by Senator Soto  February 20, 2003  An act to amend Sections 65460.1, 65460.2, and 65460.4 of, and to add Section 65040.9 to, the Government Code, and to amend Section 33030 33031 of, and to add Chapter 4.7 (commencing with Section 33499) to Part 1 of Division 24 of, the Health and Safety Code, relating to transit village plans. LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL'S DIGEST  SB 465, as amended, Soto. Transit village plan: design. (1) Under existing law, the Office of Planning and Research is the comprehensive state planning agency that is required to engage in the formulation, evaluation, and updating of the state's long-range goals and policies for land use, population growth and distribution, urban expansion, development, open space, resource preservation and utilization, air and water quality, and other factors that shape statewide development patterns and significantly influence the quality of the state's environment. This bill would require the office to convene a task force to create statewide guidelines that incorporate the best available practices for transit village planning and design. The bill would require that the guidelines be completed, adopted, and published by October 1, 2004, and serve as advisory guidelines to local government agencies, cities, and counties. (2) The 97   SB 465  --2--  The Transit Village Development Planning Act of 1994 authorizes a city or county to prepare a transit village plan for a transit village development district that includes all land within not less than 1/4 mile of the exterior boundary of the parcel on which is located a rail transit station and addresses specified characteristics, including a neighborhood centered around a transit station that is planned and designed, as specified, and demonstrable public benefits that reduce traffic congestion. The Community Redevelopment Law specifies both the physical and economic conditions that cause blight. This bill would extend the surrounding land of a transit village development district to 1/2 mile from a rail transit station. The bill would add as a characteristic of a transit village plan a provision that not less than 20% of new and substantially rehabilitated dwelling units constructed or developed within the district be available at affordable housing cost to persons and families of low or moderate income, as defined, with not less than 40% of these units to be available at affordable housing cost to very low income households, as defined. The bill would also specify conditions that constitute cause blight with respect to land surrounding a rail transit station an urbanized area covered by a transit village plan. This bill would also enact an alternative method of adoption of a redevelopment plan that would authorize a city or county that has adopted a transit village plan area to adopt a new Transit Village Redevelopment Plan, as specified, to include in a redevelopment project area all or a portion of an existing transit village plan area and to enable 2 or more adjoining local agencies to enter into an agreement to jointly establish and operate the new redevelopment plan for a Transit Village Redevelopment Project Area, as specified. Vote: majority. Appropriation: no. Fiscal committee: yes. State-mandated local program: no. The people of the State of California do enact as follows: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 SECTION 1. Section 65040.9 is added to the Government Code, to read: 65040.9. By April 1, 2004, the Office of Planning and Research shall convene a task force composed of representatives of cities, counties, transit agencies, private developers, architects, environmental organizations, and other individuals as nominated by their statewide organizations and associations, public agencies, 97   --3-- 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40  SB 465  and private organizations with expertise in transit village planning and design, for the purpose of creating statewide guidelines that incorporate the best available practices for transit village planning and design. The issues addressed by the guidelines shall include a listing of recommended local financial and other tools to promote higher density development within transit villages, including a recommendation of the most appropriate use of density bonuses for residential and commercial development, and the use of parking reductions. The office shall adopt and publish the guidelines by October 1, 2004. The guidelines shall be advisory to each city and county in the planning, design, and implementation of transit villages. SEC. 2. SECTION 1. Section 65460.1 of the Government Code is amended to read: 65460.1. The Legislature hereby finds and declares all of the following: (a) Federal, state, and local governments in California are investing in new and expanded rail transit systems in areas throughout the state, including Los Angeles County, the San Francisco Bay area, San Diego County, Santa Clara County, and Sacramento County. (b) This public investment in rail transit is unrivaled in the state's history and represents well over ten billion dollars ($10,000,000,000) fourteen billion dollars ($14,000,000,000) in planned investment alone. (c) An October 1998 report from the Institute of Urban and Regional Development at the University of California, Berkeley, recommended that the Legislature amend this act to expand the spatial dimensions of a transit village from a quarter-mile to a half-mile radius from rail transit stations. (d) The use of transit by persons living near rail transit stations is particularly important given the decline of transit ridership in California between 1980 and 1990. Transit's share of commute trips dropped in all California metropolitan areas--greater Los Angeles: 5.4 percent to 4.8 percent; San Francisco Bay area: 11.9 percent to 10.0 percent; San Diego: 3.7 percent to 3.6 percent; Sacramento: 3.7 percent to 2.5 percent. (e) Only a few rail transit stations in California have any concentration of housing proximate to the station. is increasingly 97   SB 465 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39  --4--  important as demonstrated in the January 2002, Statewide Transit-Oriented Development Study performed for the California Department of Transportation's Division of Mass Transportation. (e) The success of a dozen transit-oriented developments in California signals the emergence of and the need to support this important and practical alternative to patterns of lower-density development that depend on automobiles and highways. (f) Interest in clustering housing and commercial development around rail transit stations, called transit villages, has gained momentum in recent years. SEC. 3. SEC. 2. Section 65460.2 of the Government Code is amended to read: 65460.2. A city or county may prepare a transit village plan for a transit village development district that addresses the following characteristics: (a) A neighborhood centered around a transit station that is planned and designed so that residents, workers, shoppers, and others find it convenient and attractive to patronize transit. (b) A mix of housing types, including apartments, within not more than a half mile of the exterior boundary of the parcel on which the transit station is located. (c) Other land uses, including a retail district oriented to the transit station and civic uses, including day care centers and libraries. (d) Pedestrian and bicycle access to the transit station, with attractively designed and landscaped pathways. (e) A rail transit system that should encourage and facilitate intermodal service, and access by modes other than single occupant vehicles. (f) Demonstrable public benefits beyond the increase in transit usage, including all of the following: (1) Relief of traffic congestion. (2) Improved air quality. (3) Increased transit revenue yields. (4) Increased stock of affordable housing. (5) Redevelopment of depressed and marginal inner-city neighborhoods. (6) Live-travel options for transit-needy groups.  97   --5-- 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39  SB 465  (7) Promotion of infill development and preservation of natural resources. (8) Promotion of a safe, attractive, pedestrian-friendly environment around transit stations. (9) Reduction of the need for additional travel by providing for the sale of goods and services at transit stations. (10) Promotion of job opportunities. (11) Improved cost-effectiveness through the use of the existing infrastructure. (12) Increased sales and property tax revenue. (13) Reduction in energy consumption. (g) Sites where a density bonus of at least 25 percent may be granted pursuant to specified performance standards. (h) (1) Not less than 20 percent of the new and substantially rehabilitated dwelling units constructed or developed within the district shall be available at affordable housing cost to persons and families of low or moderate income, with not less than 40 percent of those dwelling units required to be available at affordable housing cost to persons and families of low or moderate income to be available at affordable housing cost to very low income households. (2) As used in this subdivision, the term ``substantially rehabilitated dwelling units'' shall mean substantially rehabilitated single-family dwelling units with one or two units, or substantially rehabilitated multifamily rented dwelling units with three or more units. (3) As used in this subdivision, the term ``substantial rehabilitation'' means rehabilitation, the value of which constitutes not less than 25 percent of the after rehabilitation value of the dwelling, inclusive of land value.

A transit village development district shall include all land within not more than a half mile of the exterior boundary of the parcel on which is located a rail transit station designated by the legislative body of a city, county, or city and county that has jurisdiction over the station area. For purposes of this article, ``district'' means a transit village development district as defined in this section. SEC. 5. Section 33030 of the Health and Safety Code is amended to read: 33030. (a) It is found and declared that there exist in many communities blighted areas which constitute physical and economic liabilities, requiring redevelopment in the interest of the health, safety, and general welfare of the people of these communities and of the state. (b) A blighted area is one that contains both of the following: (1) An area that is predominantly urbanized, as that term is defined in Section 33320.1, and is an area in which the combination of conditions set forth in Section 33031 is so prevalent and so substantial that it causes a reduction of, or lack of, proper utilization of the area to such an extent that it constitutes a serious physical and economic burden on the community which cannot reasonably be expected to be reversed or alleviated by private enterprise or governmental action, or both, without redevelopment. (2) An area that is characterized by either of the following: (A) One or more conditions set forth in any paragraph of subdivision (a) of Section 33031 and one or more conditions set forth in any paragraph of subdivision (b) of Section 33031.

(4) The higher density of development that is permitted by the transit village plan would not reasonably be expected to be achieved by private enterprise or government action, or both, without redevelopment. SEC. 4. Section 33031 of the Health and Safety Code is amended to read: 33031. (a) This subdivision describes physical conditions that cause blight: (1) Buildings in which it is unsafe or unhealthy for persons to live or work. These conditions can be caused by serious building code violations, dilapidation and deterioration, defective design or physical construction, faulty or inadequate utilities, or other similar factors. (2) Factors that prevent or substantially hinder the economically viable use or capacity of buildings or lots. This condition can be caused by a substandard design, inadequate size given present standards and market conditions, lack of parking, or other similar factors.

T RANSIT  VILLAGE R AREAS  EDEVELOPMENT  PROJE  CT  33499. With enactment of this chapter, it is the intent of the Legislature to do both of the following: (a) Provide cities and counties with a means to facilitate redevelopment of territory within a transit village plan area established by the legislative body of the community pursuant to the Transit Village Development Planning Act of 1994 (Article 8.5 (commencing with Section 65460) of Chapter 3 of Division 1 of Title 7 of the Government Code).  97   --9-- 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40  SB 465  (b) Enable redevelopment agencies to include in a redevelopment project area all or a portion of a transit village plan area and thereby utilize the powers of this part with respect to those transit village plan areas. 33499.1. The Legislature finds and declares that extraordinary measures must be taken to facilitate the redevelopment of transit village plan areas and thereby promote the purposes set forth in the Transit Village Development Planning Act of 1994 (Article 8.5 (commencing with Section 65460) of Chapter 3 of Division 1 of Title 7 of the Government Code). 33499.2. Nothing in this chapter shall preclude two or more adjoining cities or counties or their redevelopment agencies, as applicable, from entering into agreements to jointly establish and operate a redevelopment plan for a transit village redevelopment project area if the transit village plan areas are contiguous and each city or county has adopted a transit village plan pursuant to the Transit Village Development Planning Act of 1994 (Article 8.5 (commencing with Section 65460) of Chapter 3 of Division 1 of Title 7 of the Government Code). 33499.3.

(b) The territory included in the new Transit Village Redevelopment Plan shall not, at the time of adoption of such that plan, be located within an existing redevelopment project area. The new Transit Village Redevelopment Plan shall include as the redevelopment project area only territory encompassed by such that transit village plan and may include all or a portion of such that transit village plan area. The designated area shall be known 97   SB 465 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40  -- 10 --  as a Transit Village Redevelopment Project Area. A new Transit Village Redevelopment Plan shall not be adopted unless the proposed Transit Village Redevelopment Project Area is found by the legislative body of the city or county to be a blighted area pursuant to the criteria set forth in subdivision (d) of Section 33030. 33499.5. A new Transit Village Redevelopment Plan adopted pursuant to Section 33499.4, which contains the provisions set forth in Section 33670 shall contain all of the following limitations: (a) A time limit, not to exceed 40 years from the adoption of the Transit Village Redevelopment Plan, on the effectiveness of the redevelopment plan. After the time limit on the effectiveness of the Transit Village Redevelopment Plan, the local agency shall have no authority to act pursuant to the Transit Village Redevelopment Plan except to pay previously incurred indebtedness and to enforce existing covenants or contracts, unless the local agency has not completed its housing obligations pursuant to Section 33413, in which case the local agency shall retain its authority to implement requirements under Section 33413, including its ability to incur and pay indebtedness for this purpose, and shall use this authority to complete these housing obligations as soon as is reasonably possible. (b) A time limit, not to exceed 60 years from the adoption of the Transit Village Redevelopment Plan, to repay indebtedness with the proceeds of property taxes received pursuant to Section 33670. After the time limit established pursuant to this paragraph, a local agency may not receive property taxes pursuant to Section 33670. (c) A time limit, not to exceed 12 years from the date of adoption of the Transit Village Redevelopment Plan, for commencement of eminent domain proceedings to acquire property within the Transit Village Redevelopment Project Area. This time limitation may be extended only by amendment of the redevelopment plan. 33499.6. In adopting a new Transit Village Redevelopment Plan pursuant to Section 33499.4, the local agency shall prepare the appropriate environmental document pursuant to the requirements of the California Environmental Quality Act (Division 13 (commencing with Section 21000 of the Public Resources Code). 97   -- 11 -- 1 2 3 4 5 6  SB 465  33499.7.

Kuehnel, Personally and Representing Save the Dam Foundation 1032 Beech Street Cleveland, WI 53015 FINDINGS OF FACT On May 28, 1993, the Village of Cleveland, c/o Gary C. Schmitz, Village 1. President, applied to the Department of Natural Resourcesfor a permit to remove the   Case No. 3-LM-93-340 Page 2 Centerville dam (the dam) on Centerville Creek within the Village of Cleveland. The dam is located in the SE l/4 of the NE 114 of Section 27, Township 17 North, Range 23 Fast, Village of Cleveland, Manitowoc County, W isconsin. 2. The Department of Natural Resources issued a Notice which stated,that unless written objection was made within thirty days after publication, the Department might issue a decision on the permit without a hearing. Timely objections were filed to the Department opposing the permit application. Publication of the Notice of Proposed Permit was made in the ShebovPanPress on July 15, 1993. (Ex 21) Notice of the first proposed date of public hearing was published on September 9, 1994, in the Herald Ties Reuorter. (Ex 22) An Amended Notice of Public Hearing giving the public notice of the amended January 5, 1995 hearing date was published on October 24, 1994, also in the Manitowoc Herald Times Reoorter. Given these facts, the applicant and the Department have complied with all relevant procedural requirements of sec. 31.185, Stats., including compliance with sec. 31.06.

Exhibit 15 indicates a conveyance of the ""so-called mill property "", including a ""mill dam "" on December 5, 1895. Solely on the basis of this document, Mr. Kuehnel argues that the dam is a mill dam and therefore exempt from the provisions of sec. 31.187, Stats. On this record, the AU fmds an insufficient basis to reach such a conclusion, and finds that the provisions of Ch. 31 govern this application. There is evidence that the current concrete structure at the site was constructed in 1935. (Ex. 10) Further, on its face sec. 31.185, Stats. does not exempt mill dams, but grants the Department authority to require a permit to abandon ""any dam "". 4. An inspection of the dam was performed by Department Dam Safety staff on January 29, 1988. The inspection concluded that there were numerous deficiencies effecting dam safety, including concrete deterioration of the construction joints and walkway, embankment erosion and no dam warning sign. On October 5, 1992, the Department issued an order for Impoundment Draw 5. down, Dam Reconstruction or Abandonment (the 1992 Order). Repairs to the dam were undertaken in September of 1992. These repairs revealed that deficiencies on the dam were even more extensive than had been described in the 1988 inspection. Extensive concrete   Case No. 3-LM-93-340 Page 3 deterioration was evident, as were voids under the apron and a lack of concrete reinforcement. The October 5, 1992 Order concluded that: ""The dam in its present condition, is not ,. sufficiently strong, is unsafe and dangerous to life, health and property. "" The 1992 Order required a draw down of the impoundment, which was 6. accomplished in October of 1992. The Village was required to engage the services of a professional engineer to complete needed dam repairs or to submit a request to abandon the dam pursuant to sec. 31.185, Stats., by June 1, 1993. On May 28, 1992, the Village tiled the Application For A Permit To Abandon A Dam that is the subject of this action. of The Department has made an environmental assessment the proposed 7. abandonmentand determined that the grant or denial of the proposed permit would not constitute a major state action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment. The proposed abandonmentwill not adversely affect water quality nor increase 8. water pollution in CenterviJle Creek nor cause environmental pollution as defined in subset. 144.30(g), Stats., upon compliance with the conditions of the Order. The proposed abandonmentwill not adversely affect public rights in navigable 9. waters and will not endanger life, health and property upon compliance with the conditions in the Order. Numerous persons oppose the abandonmentof the dam, but no municipalities, persons or organization have indicated a wilhngness to acquire ownership of the dam and complete all necessaryrepairs. 10.

The Department has made an investigation of the dam. On the basis of such the following actions are deemed necessaryas part of the process of of the dam to preserve public rights in navigable waters, to promote safety, and health and property: Village of Cleveland shah submit fml dam removal and restoration plans to the Department for approval. The plans shall include all temporary or construction roads, cofferdams, erosion control measures, or other temporary or permanent structures required for the removal project. Prior to removal, a portion of the concrete dam must be breached at least to elevation 81.0 (based on the datum in the original plans). AlJ newly exposed  b.   Case No. 3-LM-93-340 Page 4 sediment should be promptly graded as necessaryand seeded (assuming seasonalconditions will allow germination). C.  All concrete, earth, wood and steel portions of the dam shall be removed completely to native soil or bedrock, including spillway, walks, fences, abutments, gates, penstock pipe section and earth berms. Existing retaining walls on shorelines in the former impoundment may remain if they will be structurally stable under the new conditions. Steel from gates, walks and spillways shall be salvaged for recycling and removed from the site. Concrete and soil shall be placed in an approved disposal area. No broken concrete shall be used as riprap. The exposed pond sediment at the upstream face of the dam shall be graded back at a minimmu slope of 6:l. Silt fence shall be placed at the toe of the sediment until stabilized by vegetation. All exposed banks at the dam removal site shall be stabilized with riprap over filter fabric. Erosion control measuresand sedimentation protection techniques shall be employed throughout the project area to ensure that any dismrbed areas are stabilized and protected from erosion. The project must at all times meet the minimmn protection standardsdescribed in the ""W isconsin Construction Site Best Management Practice Handbook "", DNR publication WR-222-89. The erosion control plan must be approved by the Lake Michigan District Office prior to the start of construction. The Village of Cleveland may be required to obtain a section 404 permit from the Army Corps of Engineers, St. Paul District. DISCUSSION  d. e. f. g.  h. 1.  i  Mr. Chris Kuehnel appeared at hearing objecting to the Village request to abandon the dam. In addition to the procedural and legal arguments noted above, Kuelmel described his efforts to put together a group to acquire ownership of the dam. Prior to issuing this decision, the ALl allowed Kuehnel the 120 day period required by sec. 31.185(4), Stats, to provide evidence that such a group had agreed to acquire ownership of the dam. No such evidence was submitted.   Case No. 3-LM-93-340 Page 5 Kuehnel conceded at hearing that he had no specializedknowledge on environmental issues, nor did he provide any other expert opinions disputing the DNR position that there would be no significant adverse environmental consequences a result of abandonment of as the dam.

A detached accessory dwelling unit (detached ADU) is a small, often rented, living space, that is on the same lot but physically separate from a single family house. Detached ADUs can create attractive and affordable rental opportunities in Seattle without changing the character or quality of life in existing single family areas. Detached ADUs can provide greater flexibility for the homeowner - who is already allowed to rent out a portion of his or her home. They also offer a new housing type to Seattle that is desirable, quiet and affordable, and compatible with single family homes.  2  Detached Accessory Dwelling Units   Introduction The following proposal to amend the Land Use Code includes analysis and recommendations for proposed use and development standards that would allow detached accessory dwelling units (detached ADUs) in Single Family Zones. The report describes detached ADUs and how they would fit into Seattle neighborhoods, and contains proposed development standards that would govern their establishment.  Background In 1998, a Demonstration Program for Innovative Housing Design was established by the City Council to help further diversify Seattle's housing supply and provide an alternative to conventional detached houses, condominiums, or apartments. The Demonstration Program tested innovative residential design concepts, including detached ADUs, using alternative development standards and processes. An evaluation of the projects completed under the Demonstration Program accompanies this report. It reviews four detached ADUs permitted under the Demonstration Program, and is part of an overall evaluation of the program mandated by the Council at the conclusion of the program. Survey forms were mailed to all residents within 300 feet of constructed Demonstration Program projects to assist in their evaluation. Neighbors were asked about the impacts of the new detached ADU project in their neighborhood. On the whole, the results of the surveys were very positive.  Public Process In preparing recommendations for code amendments to permit detached ADU's, significant measures have been taken to ensure community dialogue about detached ADUs:  ! In February, the Planning Commission held three focus groups, representing the general public, those familiar with the innovative housing concepts under consideration, and the design and development community, to discuss the broad community and development issues surrounding detached ADUs.  ! After the focus groups, the Planning Commission and the Department of Design, Construction, and Land Use (DCLU) co-hosted a public forum to present the results of the focus groups and preliminary concepts for permitting detached ADUs. The forum included lively panel and small group discussions relating to both detached ADUs and cottage housing, (another form of innovative housing evaluated as part of the Demonstration Program that is being examined by DCLU).  ! The information presented at the forum was posted online on the City's website, and included an online survey form identical to one that accompanied a brochure distributed at the forum. The brochure was also mailed to Seattle's neighborhood and community councils and planning groups.  ! Staff also met with the Seattle chapter of the American Institute of Architects to discuss proposed development concepts and standards.  DCLU Director's Report July 22, 2003  3   ! Finally, staff has presented the proposal and gotten feedback from a variety of community members, including design professionals, community councils, and other organizations.  Meeting City Planning Goals This proposal advances several Seattle Comprehensive Plan Goals and Policies for several plan elements, including Land Use, Housing, and Neighborhoods. Neighborhood Plan Goals can be found in the appendices of this report.  Comprehensive Plan Land Use Goals include: LG8 Accommodate the City's existing and future housing needs through maintenance of existing residential neighborhoods and the creation of new residential neighborhoods. LG9 More efficiently use limited land resources. LG14 Increase opportunities for detached single family dwellings attractive to many residents, including families with children. LG15 Encourage development of ground-related housing types including townhouses, duplexes, triplexes, ground-related apartments, small cottages, accessory units and single family homes.  Comprehensive Plan Housing Goals include: G4 Achieve a mix of housing types attractive and affordable to a diversity of ages, incomes, household types, household sizes, live/work situations and cultural backgrounds. G7 Accommodate a variety of housing types that are attractive and affordable to potential buyers. The proposal also supports 1999-2004 Housing Consolidated Plan strategies by assisting homeowners with accessory dwelling units, by helping to produce affordable rental housing, and by helping to encourage private affordable rental housing.  4  Detached Accessory Dwelling Units   ADUs and Current Zoning Between 1900 and up to the 1950s, ADUs were commonly allowed under provisions related to domestic servants quarters. However, in ensuing years, concerns about neighborhood density, parking availability, and the protection of the single family character of Seattle neighborhoods, provisions for ADUs of any sort were prohibited. In 1993, in response to widespread concern about the escalating cost of housing, the Washington State legislature required that communities develop legislation incorporating the appropriate safeguards to allow ADUs throughout the city. When Seattle adopted provisions for ADUs, there were concerns about a very large number being added in single family zones, as well as a concern that the single family zones were being ""duplexed."" Most approximations turned out to be grossly overestimated (up to tenfold) once permit applications started coming in. At the time, there was some support for allowing detached ADUs, but provisions for them were not pursued, in part due to concerns about their effect on single family character. Since ADUs were first allowed, the Land Use Code's ADU provisions have been amended, but not to allow detached ADUs.  An addition to a single family home in Ballard. The detached ADU proposal will encourage smaller, more compatible structures than what some have built under existing single family zoning requirements.  Other Jurisdictions A number of jurisdictions in the Puget Sound region allow both ADUs and detached ADUs in their single family zones. They include Clyde Hill, Issaquah, Kirkland, Mercer Island, Newcastle, Redmond, parts of unincorporated King County, Woodinville, and Yarrow Point.  Current Rules In Seattle, the rules governing accessory dwelling units allow ADUs outright in all single family zones. New ADUs must be added to or part of an existing structure and the property owner must reside in either the primary residence, or in the ADU. One off-street parking space must be available for the ADU, and all ADUs are limited to a maximum of 1,000 square feet in size (although there are some exceptions to both of these standards).  DCLU Director's Report July 22, 2003  5   There are 1,200 ADUs in the city with final permits. 1,513 people have applied for ADUs since they were once again permitted in 1993. Approximately 20% of those applications are still active, have been abandoned, or never received the final permit and certificate of occupancy for various reasons. Figure 1, Issued and Finaled ADU Permit 400 Applications, shows the trend of ADU permits 350 since DCLU began allowing them in August 300 of 1994. (Data is incomplete for 1994, the first 250 year that ADUs were allowed.) Applications for 200 ADUs increased in the 150 late 1990's, as did development activity in all 100 sectors, consistent with the economic prosperity 50 experienced throughout the region. Additionally, 0 1994 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 the large number of # ADU Permits Issued # ADU Permits Finaled permits DCLU issued between 1996 and 1998 can be attributed to the Figure 1: Issued and Finaled ADU Permit Applications legalization of existing ADUs that were present throughout the city. Since 1998, the number of ADU applications has remained fairly consistent. ADU Permit Applications  Complaints about significant drop in of the opportunity larly dropped over legalize ADUs.  illegal dwelling units have also remained steady over the last four years after a complaints experienced after 1995, perhaps due to more widespread knowledge to legally establish ADUs. The number of violations issued by DCLU has simitime. Approximately a quarter of the violations result in permits issued to  6  Detached Accessory Dwelling Units   Analysis Detached ADUs are a housing option that offers many of the benefits of single family homesincluding a detached unit with no shared walls, a yard, and generally, a location in a single family neighborhood often perceived to be quieter and more private than denser multifamily or commercial neighborhoods -but may be more affordable due to their smaller size. As with any change to the Land Use Code, the potential benefits must be weighed against the potential impacts of increasing housing density in Seattle's neighborhoods. The potential benefits of detached ADUs include:  ! more flexibility for a homeowner by allowing them to live in their main home or in the detached ADU;  ! a financial benefit to the homeowner that further enhances their investment; ! a new housing type that is in-demand and a housing option not previously widely available; ! attractive and affordable housing for singles or young couples, or for older citizens who may find the upkeep and costs of maintaining a single family home increasingly daunting; both growing segments of the population in Seattle and nationwide;  ! can be designed more sensitively to surroundings than an addition to, or redevelopment of, an existing home;  ! allows more people the opportunity to enjoy some of the advantages of a single family home without having to own a home.  Balancing the Positives and Negatives of Detached ADUs In order to assess the pros and address the cons of allowing detached ADUs, DCLU has endeavored to estimate the number of detached ADUs that are anticipated to be constructed and the pace at which their construction is expected to proceed. Construction of detached ADUs, like ADUs generally, is dependent upon factors such as Seattle's overall economic well being, and the general strength of the local housing market. Several factors make it likely that fewer permit applications for detached ADUs can be expected than was experienced for ADUs:  ! Not every home owner will want to be a landlord or share their property with someone else; ! The complexity of development of a detached ADU; ! The increased costs of construction; and ! Not all sites will be eligible (whereas ADUs could theoretically occur within any single family home). Not everyone that may be eligible to build a detached ADU will choose to do so, just as not every single family home owner who could, has established an ADU in their home (a little over 1% have so far). Many people will not wish to take on the additional burden of being a landlord, much less a developer and the costs associated with both. To convert or build a new detached ADU, most homeowners will need to hire a builder and/or architect. The owner, architect, or builder will need to apply for both a Master Use Permit and DCLU Director's Report July 22, 2003 7   a building permit. Because detached ADUs are free standing structures, and subject to both the Seattle Land Use and Building Codes, it will likely be beyond the expertise of the average homeowner to construct one themselves. In contrast, many single family homes can more easily incorporate an ADU into a finished basement or upstairs level, and if little or no construction work is being done, only two steps need to be taken: a permit for the ADU, and an inspection by DCLU to confirm that the living space meets basic standards. The costs to construct Demonstration Program detached ADUs (generally between $100,000$200,000) indicate that it is probable that most will be long-term investments. The higher costs for detached ADUs make them less likely to be developed by most homeowners than their attached counterparts. Still, the fact that they are detached may appeal to some homeowners that would like the flexibility and benefits that come with ADUs, but do not wish to share walls with others. Further, DCLU may see a number of applications for detached ADUs in the first two to three years of allowing them due to pent up demand, but the numbers will not likely exceed that which was experienced with attached ADUs, for which anticipated numbers were considerably overestimated by proponents and opponents alike. Development of detached ADUs will very likely slow and level off in following years as experience with attached ADUs demonstrated. Using permit data for attached ADUs from the years 1999-2002 as a basis for estimating detached ADU activity, up to approximately 370 units could be built in Seattle over the next four years. Deducting 17%, the estimated number of parcels that will be ineligible or for other reasons may be difficult to build a detached ADU (see Overall Effect of Development Standards, later in this document), an estimate of 307 potential units was derived. Deducting another 25% for the factors contributing to a decision by a homeowner to not build a detached ADU results in an estimate of 230 detached ADUs over four years. Based on these results, we may expect an average of around 54 new detached ADUs permitted per year over time. Depending on a variety of factors, such as the economy and in particular, the housing market, more units could be permitted in a year - but it would still be a very small amount compared to the total number of single family homes citywide. By comparison, DCLU issues around 300 permits for new single family homes each year.  Addressing Concerns The four biggest concerns cited by neighbors of Demonstration Program projects are listed below; these are the issues that are perceived to most affect existing neighborhoods. The proposed development standards for detached ADUs have been written to directly address these potential impacts. Additionally, the nature of detached ADUs may actually have a positive effect on a neighborhood.  Traffic At the neighborhood level, detached ADUs are not anticipated to result in more cars on the street than what is currently allowed by the Land Use Code, since accessory dwelling units are already allowed in single family dwellings. Detached ADUs can actually help prevent more 8 Detached Accessory Dwelling Units   regional traffic congestion in the Puget Sound area by putting more housing choices in Seattle, nearer to jobs, transit, and goods and services.  Parking The existing requirement of one off-street parking space per dwelling unit for any new ADU will be continued whether detached or incorporated into the existing dwelling unit. Exceptions for smaller lots and steep slopes will continue to apply in neighborhoods with on-street parking availability, and no changes to current provisions are proposed.  Privacy Perceptual impacts can be more difficult to address than physical ones, such as the decrease in privacy. However, development standards have been crafted to minimize privacy impacts - and the perception of privacy impacts - by taking lot size, lot width, and the presence of alleys into account. No increase in impacts on privacy are anticipated beyond what may already occur as new single family houses are built or existing homes are remodeled and expanded.  Quality of Design Again, proposed development standards have been crafted to help ensure a proper ""fit"" of the detached ADU with the existing house and neighborhood, a significant aspect of allowing detached ADUs. Experience gained from the Demonstration Program reinforces the notion that one size does not fit all, and that proper ""fit"" can make detached ADUs successful. A combination of standards written to carefully control height, bulk, and scale relative to lot sizes, and a guide that helps applicants through the process while also encouraging architectural design that fits in with existing structures can help protect people's most important investments: their homes.  Proposed Permit Approach Detached ADUs would be non-appealable Master Use Permit decisions (known as Type I in the Land Use Code). The level of review and regulations are reflective of the size and relative impact of the type of housing proposed. No greater number of units is being proposed for single family zones than what is already allowed. Further, standards for lot coverage and rear lot coverage are maintained, and in most circumstances, no further open space could be lost relative to what is currently required. To maintain consistency with existing provisions for a single family home, or a single family home with an attached accessory dwelling unit, no additional level of review or review discretion is recommended for detached ADUs.1 1. Because of their size and cost, administrative Design Review (which includes appealable decisions) would not be required for detached ADUs. All of the detached ADU applicants to the Demonstration Program specifically stated that the administrative Design Review process was too onerous or expensive for a project of this size. While the administrative Design Review Process helped shape several of the detached ADUs into better finished projects, addressing the bulk and scale of the projects was typically the most important aspect of these reviews. Bulk and scale will be appropriately shaped through proposed development standards, including floor-to-lot area requirements. The final aesthetics of the project will be left to the owner, who will still have to comply with the Seattle Building Codes, which ensures a reasonable level of livable space with appropriate insulation and siding, windows, access and other features.  DCLU Director's Report July 22, 2003  9   Proposed Development Standards Proposed site and development standards for detached ADUs are as follows. Objectives/Intent Basic site requirements help ensure space is available to fit a DADU and to maintain adequate open space Development Standards Minimum Lot Size Minimum Lot Width Minimum Lot Depth Maximum Total Lot Coverage (Including Main Structure) Lot Width (feet) Maximum Base Height (feet) Maximum Roof Pitch Height (feet) Maximum Shed or Butterfly Roof Pitch Height (feet) Gross floor area limits help ensure that the size of DADUs are appropriate for the lot Maximum Detached ADU Gross Floor-to-Lot-Area Ratio 3,000 ft2 25 ft 70 ft 35%  Maximum heights proportionate to lot width to minimize overshadowing of existing homes and privacy of adjacent homes  Less than 30 12 15 15  30-35 14 21 18  36-40 15 22 19  Greater than 40 16 23 20  ADU floor area is limited to 20% of the lot size, not to exceed 1,000 square feet including garage and storage area  Setbacks ensure space is maintained between DADUs and surrounding lots  Minimum Side Yard Setback Minimum Rear Yard Setback  Parking requirements will help maintain on-street parking availability The conversion of existing structures can result in minimal impacts and can help maintain neighborhood character.  Off Street Parking Space Conversion of Existing Structures  5 ft to property line; 10 feet on corner lots 5 feet; no setback when rear lot line is adjacent to alley, 12 feet from the alley centerline when a garage faces the alley. One per new unit required with some exceptions Existing structures built before June 1, 2003, may be converted to detached ADUs, so long as the extent of nonconformity is not increased.  Figure 2: Proposed development standards for detached ADUs.  10  Detached Accessory Dwelling Units   It is important to note that the development standards are a combination of factors that can help to create successful projects. For instance, both allowed height and gross floor area are based on the size of a lot, yet both are intended together to control the bulk and scale of a new detached ADU. Additionally, the overlap of basic site and parking requirements will tend to direct detached ADUs to larger, wider lots and to lots on alleys.  Basic Site Requirements. Detached ADUs may be allowed in single family zones if basic site requirements are met. The proposed requirements would help ensure that enough space is available on a lot to fit a detached ADU and that open space is maintained. A detached ADU would be allowed if:  ! the lot is 3,000 square feet or larger; ! if the lot width is 25 feet or greater and the lot depth is 70 feet or greater; and ! the maximum allowed lot coverage (35%) is not exceeded. ! the detached ADU is not within the Shoreline District. Additionally, the existing 40% maximum rear yard lot coverage requirement will be maintained. This standard will tend to encourage detached ADUs more on wider lots and lots with alleys. The maximum allowed lot coverage for SF zones is 35%. According to the City's Geographic Information System, about three-quarters of Single Family-zoned lots have 300 square feet or more allowed lot coverage available for an additional structure (300 square feet is an approximate minimum size for a newly constructed livable space, although the building code allows smaller living spaces). These basic site requirements make approximately 15% of Single-Family zoned parcels ineligible for detached ADUs. Another 1,700 single family parcels fully within the Shoreline District buffer bring this total to 17%.  Height Proposed height limits are based on lot widths (with a cap) to ensure that detached ADUs do not unnecessarily cast shadows on existing homes and that privacy impacts are minimized. The Demonstration Program evaluation confirmed that a roof pitch height of up to 24 feet can work for new detached ADUs on large lots, as long as the bulk of the project is limited. A smaller, narrower, sloped lot was also successful with a 22-foot tall structure (13 feet tall on the uphill side) and a bulk proportional to the lot size. To ensure that detached ADUs are diminutive relative to the height allowed for single family structures, a maximum roof pitch height of 23 feet is proposed for lots more than 40 feet in width, compared with 35 feet for single family structures. This maximum height is intended to allow units above garages on wider lots. Lots less than 30 feet in width are allowed to have detached ADUs, but they must conform to existing height limits for accessory structures. A ratio based on the Golden Rectangle (see Appendix for more information) is used to make the maximum roof pitch heights of lots between 30 and 40 feet wide proportional to the width. DCLU Director's Report July 22, 2003 11   Detached ADU Proposal Illustrations These diagrams illustrate how the proposed development standards for detached ADUs could work on a variety of lot sizes in Seattle.  60x100 Lot  50x100 Lot  40x100 Lot  Note: Most maximum requirements begin at a lot sizes between 4,000 and 5,000 ft  2  Figure 3: Illustration of effect of proposed development standards for multiple lot sizes.  12  Detached Accessory Dwelling Units   35x100 Lot  30x100 Lot  25x120 Lot  Note: Alley likely required for lots 30 ft. or narrower to meet lot coverage provisions.  DCLU Director's Report July 22, 2003  13   The base height of vertical walls, or the height just below the roof pitch, varied among Demonstration Program detached ADUs. The project with the tallest roof pitch had a base height of 11 feet, and the detached ADU above a garage on a sloping site in Wallingford had a base height of 17 feet with a flatter roof pitch above. A tall enough base height will allow units above garages, particularly on narrower lots. To encourage units above garages while still ensuring that detached ADUs are of a height appropriate to the size of the lot, a maximum base height of 16 feet is proposed for lots over 40 feet in width. Similar to the maximum pitch height, a ratio is used for lots between 30 and 40 feet in width to determine the maximum base heights. These requirements are also based on the Golden Rectangle to make the maximum heights proportional to the lot width. The maximum pitch height of 23 feet and maximum base height of 16 feet would apply to approximately 55% of single family lots. About a third of single family lots would be regulated by the height-to-width ratios, and around 3% of single family parcels would only be allowed to build a detached ADU under existing height rules for accessory structures.  Bulk and Scale The bulk and scale of a detached ADU relative to its surroundings are ultimately the most important factors of whether or not a project will be successful. A gross floor area ratio with a maximum limit ensures that the size of detached ADUs are appropriate for the size of the lots they are built on. Demonstration Program detached ADUs varied in the amount of gross floor area from 728 to 1,872 square feet, including garage and storage space. Gross floor area to lot area ratios varied from 0.15 up to 0.26. In the case of the highest floor to lot area ratio, some of the area included in the calculations might be considered below grade (on a sloping site) and not counted according to the proposed standard. Any area of the structure where the ceiling is 6.5 feet or greater in height above finished grade, or the floor-to-ceiling measurement is 6.5 feet or greater, would be counted as floor area. Accessory Dwelling Units are currently allowed up to 1,000 square feet if inside or attached to a single family structure. In this proposal, this amount would be maintained as a maximum for new detached ADU floor area. Lots smaller than 5,000 square feet would be regulated by a detached ADU floor-to-lot-area ratio of 20%. This means on a 4,000 square foot lot, a detached ADU would be limited to 800 square feet of above-grade floor area, including garages and storage areas. Due to existing lot sizes, the ratio would apply to approximately one third of all single family-zoned lots, with the remainder limited to a 1,000 square foot maximum.  Setbacks Setbacks side and from the feet from ensure space is maintained between detached ADUs and surrounding lots. A five-foot rear setback would apply to detached ADUs. On corner lots, a side setback of 10 feet street would apply. On alleys, a detached ADU would be required to be set back 12 the centerline of the alley.  14  Detached Accessory Dwelling Units   Parking One off-street space is currently required of accessory dwelling units, with some exceptions for small lots and steep slopes, provided on-street parking is available. These standards would be maintained for detached ADUs, further encouraging detached ADUs on alleys, where they tend to be less intrusive.  Conversions of Existing Structures The conversion of existing accessory structures, such as detached garages, to accessory dwelling units, can result in minimal impacts while maintaining neighborhood character. The conversion of existing structures that do not comply with development standards for detached ADUs would be allowed for a limited time period (two years - until June 1, 2005), so long as the nonconformity is not increased. After this amnesty period, the conversion would be allowed for structures known to exist prior to June 1, 2003. Many single family lots have small garages in a back corner at the end of a driveway. These provisions would allow them to be converted, and even added on to, although the height of the structure within the required setbacks could not be higher than what is allowed for accessory structures (12 feet with a 3-foot roof pitch). Figure 4 on Page 16 illustrates the potential development allowed by existing zoning compared to the proposed standards for conversion of an existing accessory structure to a detached ADU.  Overall Effect of Development Standards Proposed standards for Detached ADUs place emphasis on encouraging new units on wider, larger lots on alleys, without specifically discouraging them from smaller lots or on lots without alley access. The proposed regulations would shape detached ADUs on smaller and narrower lots to help ensure that their height, bulk, and scale are appropriate and proportional to the size of the lot The diagrams in Figure 3 on pages 12-13 illustrate the scale of detached ADU development allowed under the proposal for a variety of lot sizes. There are 119,212 single family-zoned lots with a single family dwelling in Seattle, the majority of which are zoned Single Family 5000. Due to location, size, and lot coverage requirements, the proposal would render approximately 10% of these lots, which are scattered throughout the city, ineligible for detached ADUs. Another 6.6% of single family lots - those not on an alley, between 3,000 and 4,000 square feet in size - would likely have a more difficult time meeting the proposed detached ADU standards of parking, lot coverage, and rear yard lot coverage.

These materials can be made available online and at DCLU's information and permitting counters. Many examples can be used from the constructed Demonstration Program for Innovative Housing Design projects. Some of these ""How-to"" items could include:  ! The location of the Detached ADU should maximize on-site open space while also maximizing the privacy of adjacent homes.  ! The size and location of windows should take the privacy of adjacent homes into account. ! The pitch of the roof and of dormers should reflect that of the primary structure. ! Window treatments, sizes, and locations should reflect those of the primary structure. ! Building materials and finishes should also reflect the primary structure. ! Detached ADUs should be designed to appear subordinate to the primary structure. ! Siting and landscaping should be used to minimize the visual appearance of detached ADUs.  DCLU Director's Report July 22, 2003  17   18  Detached Accessory Dwelling Units   Recommendation The intent of the detached ADU proposal is to provide more housing options for Seattle residents. Several benefits may be expected from allowing detached ADUs outright in single family zones with appropriate conditions and limitations, including:  ! more flexibility for a homeowner by allowing them to live in their main home or in the detached ADU;  ! a financial benefit to the homeowner that further enhances their investment; ! a new housing type that is in-demand and a housing option not previously widely available; ! attractive and affordable housing for singles or young couples, or for older citizens who may find the upkeep and costs of maintaining a single family home increasingly daunting; all growing segments of the population in Seattle and nationwide;  ! allows more people the opportunity to enjoy some of the advantages of a single family home without having to own a home;  ! allows an alternative housing type without significantly changing neighborhood character . In summary, the proposed Land Use Code amendments would allow for detached ADUs on singlefamily zoned lots that meet basic lot size and location standards. Once land use provisions are adopted into the Land Use Code, DCLU will finalize a Client Assistance Memo (or ""How-to"" guide) that will provide assistance to applicants in shaping sensitive and well-designed detached ADUs.  Development Standards Proposed development standards (see Figure 2 on page 10) will accomplish the following:  ! Basic site requirements will help ensure lots are appropriately sized to accommodate a detached ADU and that minimum open space is maintained.  ! Maximum heights are based on lot width to help ensure that detached ADUs do not cause unnecessary shadowing of existing homes and that privacy impacts are minimized.  ! Gross floor area limits help ensure the size of detached ADUs are appropriate for the size of lots they are built upon.  ! Setbacks help ensure that space is maintained between detached ADUs and surrounding lots. ! Parking requirements will help to maintain on-street parking availability. ! Consistent with existing ADU provisions, owner occupancy requirements will help to ensure neighborhood investment and property upkeep.  ! Consistent with existing ADU provisions, the maximum number of people allowed to live on a single family lot with a detached ADU will be 8 unrelated persons.  ! Conversions of existing structures will minimize impacts and help to maintain neighborhood character, where desirable.  DCLU Director's Report July 22, 2003  19   Other Changes The Land Use Code currently includes provisions related to ADUs that duplicate of provisions in the Seattle Building Code. These provisions prescribe minimum allowable ceiling height of six-feet-eight inches and includes an exception that allows ceiling heights as low as six-feetfour inches for accessory dwelling units that have been in existence prior to October 17, 1979. Existing building code provisions allow a ceiling height of six-feet-eight inches, and allows ducts and similar features to be as low as six-feet-four inches. The proposal calls for removing this language from the Land Use Code and using the Seattle Building Code to regulate interior living spaces. The proposal also would remove language that would potentially levy a $5,000 fine on a new owner of a single family home with an ADU for not notifying DCLU of the change in ownership status. This requirement puts a burden on a homeowner to know the Land Use Code if they buy a home with an ADU. More importantly, the requirement is not needed to effectively enforce owner occupancy requirements for ADUs and can result in overly burdensome consequences for new homeowners. DCLU recommends removing this language, as owner occupancy requirements will remain. Finally, provisions in the Land Use Code that allow home occupations within a single family structure (including the primary residence and an accessory dwelling unit) are proposed to be slightly modified. The proposal applies a consistent approach and would allow home occupations in the detached ADU.  Conclusion DCLU, in making recommendations, has considered recommendations or comments from affected departments, other government agencies or citizens as well as environmental documentation. These materials are available upon request. DCLU recommends approval of the proposed Land Use Code amendments.  20  Detached Accessory Dwelling Units   Appendices Related Neighborhood Plan Goals and Policies Capitol Hill CH-P12 Strive to preserve and provide a variety of housing types, including some singlefamily and other small scale dwellings.

DCLU Director's Report July 22, 2003  21   Proportional Structure Heights and the Golden Rectangle Since the time of the early Greeks, a ratio of approximately 1.618:1 has been used in art and architecture for its visible appeal. This number has many names, including the Divine Proportion, Phi, and the Golden Section. The ratio is also known as the Golden Rectangle. The number 1.618 can also be derived from a Fibonacci sequence, which is a sequence of numbers that occurs frequently in nature. Milan Pacioli's 1509 Divina Proportione was illustrated by Leonardo Da Vinci, who used the mathematical concept written about by Pacioli in his works. Finally, Le Corbusier, the famous modern architect, created his own system of architectural design based on the Golden Section, and used it in several of his buildings. In short, this ratio has been used throughout history in the creation of art and architecture, and is even present in nature in branching plants, pine cones, and flower petals. As the diagrams for different-sized lots show, deriving maximum base and roof pitch heights from this ratio works to effectively maintain a natural proportion of detached ADU height to lot width, ensuring that the overall height of a new structure is not overwhelming to its surroundings.

GX013-21-8101638	STATEMENT OF P. DANIEL SMITH, SPECIAL ASSISTANT TO THE DIRECTOR, NATIONAL PARK SERVICE, DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR, BEFORE THE HOUSE RESOURCES COMMITTEE, SUBCOMMITTEE ON NATIONAL PARKS, RECREATION AND PUBLIC LANDS, ON H.R. 1521, A BILL TO PROVIDE FOR ADDITIONAL LANDS TO BE INCLUDED WITHIN THE BOUNDARY OF THE JOHNSTOWN FLOOD NATIONAL MEMORIAL IN THE STATE OF PENNSYLVANIA, AND FOR OTHER PURPOSES.         June 24, 2003                 Mr. Chairman, thank you for the opportunity to present the views of the Department of the Interior on H.R. 1521, a bill to provide for additional lands to be included within the boundary of the Johnstown Flood National Memorial in the State of  Pennsylvania .           The bill would add seven parcels of land to the boundary of the park to provide permanent protection for resources that are integral to the historic events that the park was established to commemorate.  Six of the parcels, totaling 2.33 acres, are approximately three miles from the park in the  village  of  Saint Michael  where the former South Fork Fishing and Hunting Club was located.  The seventh parcel, comprising approximately 12 acres, is adjacent to the current boundary.  Recently, a property owner of a 0.18-acre parcel has indicated that he does not wish to sell his property.  We ask the Committee to amend the map reference in the bill to reflect this change of only six parcels being added to the park.  Land acquisition costs for these six parcels are approximately $805,000.  All parcels are for sale by willing sellers.         The Department supports the President’s Initiative to address the deferred maintenance backlog and taking care of our current responsibilities.  In this instance, we are faced with a unique situation concerning this boundary adjustment.  The historic structures central to this acquisition have always been considered key components of the park, but were to be protected, maintained, and interpreted through a public-private partnership.  However, the partner can no longer perform this function, based on financial problems.  For this reason, the Department believes it is appropriate to move forward with this bill at this time.           Johnstown Flood National Memorial comprises nearly 165 acres in western  Pennsylvania .  The park’s mission is to tell the stories of the events leading up to the  Johnstown  flood, of the flood itself, and of its effects on  Johnstown  and the nation.  The addition of the South Fork Fishing and Hunting Club properties would significantly increase the park’s capability to interpret the important events surrounding the  Johnstown  flood and the individuals associated with it.           On  May 31, 1889 , a poorly maintained earthen dam breeched, sending 20 million tons of water down the Little Conemaugh Valley into  Johnstown  and other surrounding communities.   A 36-foot wall of water rolled over the town at 40 miles per hour, flattening houses, trees, locomotives, and everything else in its path.  By the disaster’s end, 2,209 people had perished in the flood, another 40 died in the weeks after from typhoid, and property damage was estimated at $17 million.  It was the worst inland flood in the nation’s history and the first test of the newly formed American Red Cross, headed up by Clara Barton.         A pivotal part of the story revolves around the South Fork Fishing and Hunting Club, located in Saint Michael, which in 1879 had purchased an abandoned reservoir, repaired the old dam, and created a private lake and recreational area for its members.   Because the dam was not properly constructed or maintained, it gave way after heavy rains pounded the area, overtaxing the  Lake   Conemaugh  dam spillway and eventually causing the dam to fail.           In 1986, the South Fork Fishing and Hunting Club Historic District was listed on the National Register of Historic Places at the state level of significance.           In 1989, the Park Service and residents of Saint Michael undertook a joint planning effort, which produced the  Preservation and Interpretation Plan for the South Fork Fishing and Hunting Club Historic District.   This plan outlined concepts and guidance for basic visitor services, interpretation, cultural resource preservation and maintenance.  As a result of the plan, there developed a structured partnership between the village  of Saint Michael and the Park Service, designed to protect, maintain and manage the South Fork Fishing and Hunting Club clubhouse and other significant cottages in the historic district.  The 1889 South Fork Fishing and Hunting Club Historical Preservation Society was formed to be the principal community body working with the Park Service in the implementation of the plan.  Since the original planning efforts, the Society has obtained ownership of the Clubhouse, the Annex, the Moorehead Cottage, and the Brown Cottage.  These properties were not originally included within the boundary of the park because it was understood that a local entity could adequately provide for their protection and interpretation.         Unfortunately, the Society lacks the resources to continue to maintain the properties they own, let alone preserve and develop them according to approved plans.  The Society is struggling to make mortgage payments, and while they are desperately seeking a solution, the properties are deteriorating and losing historic integrity.  In 2000, the Society worked with a private, non-profit historic property development company to try and obtain private sector interest in purchasing the properties, but was not successful.  There is an imminent threat to the protection of these resources.  The private owner has already listed these historic structures and properties for sale on the open market.         In 2001, the National Park Service completed a special resource study and environmental assessment to evaluate options for protection and interpretation of the additional parcels of land.  Based upon the report, the Park Service proposed to add these parcels of land to the boundary of the park and to acquire the parcels in fee simple.  Within the village of Saint   Michael, four historically significant properties would be acquired.  These structures include the former clubhouse of the South Fork Fishing and Hunting Club, the Clubhouse Annex, and two cottages built by club members.  One undeveloped parcel, the Clubhouse Side-yard that sits between the Clubhouse and the Clubhouse Annex, would also be added.  The final parcel would protect the historic viewshed of the park, preserving the rural character of the Unger House property (Elias Unger was president of the South Fork Fishing and Hunting Club), owned by the National Park Service.         If the Park Service acquired the historic buildings, we would explore the option of a public-private partnership to lease the buildings to the private sector for commercial and residential use. Through our historic leasing program, the private sector could sign a long-term lease with the Park Service that would cover a portion of the operations and maintenance costs of the properties, which ranges from $75,000 to $310,000.  In addition, the private sector could rehabilitate the buildings, estimated to cost upwards of $2.9 million, using private funds in return for federal historic preservation tax credits.  This would decrease the financial burden placed on the Park Service by the addition of these properties to the park. There has already been interest expressed by local businesses in this proposal.         The proposal to add these properties to the boundary of the park has widespread support among the property owners, state and local governments, and the public who attended a public meeting in July 2001 in Saint Michael.  Public comments received were unanimous in support of the proposal.         We look forward to working with the local communities in Saint Michael and Johnstown to acquire these historically significant properties that will help tell the entire story of the events of the 1889 Johnstown Flood, from the actions leading up to the flood through its devastating aftermath.         Thank you for the opportunity to comment.  This concludes my prepared remarks.  I would be glad to answer any questions that you or the members of the committee may have.
GX231-23-15049992	"April 2, 2003   City of Baltimore-Department of Planning 2002 CRITICAL AREA MANAGEMENT PROGRAM SUMMARY AND BASIC DEVELOPMENT APPLICATION PACKAGE The State of Maryland Chesapeake Bay Critical Area Law establishes the Chesapeake Bay Critical Area Commission (CAC) and requires that the City of Baltimore and other jurisdictions prepare and adopt a Critical Area Management Program (CAMP) to: (1) Improve the water quality of the Bay by controlling pollution from stormwater runoff and; (2) To conserve and protect wildlife habitat along the shoreline of the Bay. Date of the Program The City's Critical Area Management Program (CAMP) became effective with the adoption of Ordinance Nos. 1130, 1131, and 1132, effective January 4, 1988. The City's CAMP has most recently been reviewed, repealed and reordained by Ordinance 02-350, effective June 13, 2002 and approved by the Chesapeake Bay Critical Area Commission on November 13, 2002. The terms and conditions contained herein reflect the most current amendments to the CAMP. Critical Area Boundaries and Sub-Areas The CAMP establishes guidelines for development of properties within the 1,000-foot strip of land measured from the mean high tide line or the bulkhead. The first 100 feet landward of the water is called the Buffer. The Critical Area is also separated into additional sub-areas (see the attached maps for boundaries). The sub-areas are: :  Intensely Developed Areas (IDA)  Resource Conservation Areas (RCA) An additional environmentally sensitive area within the Critical Area is the Designated Habitat Protection Areas. There are twelve Designated Habitat Protection Areas (DHPA) in the City of Baltimore. These areas function as additional overlay districts from the IDA and RCA areas and there may be some overlap on individual parcels; special protection requirements apply. These are by no means all of the important habitats effectively intermingled with industrial areas, interstates and neighborhoods in the City, but these DHPA's have been mapped and surveyed and are especially important habitat for seasonal waterfowl and as fish habitat areas. Please check with the Department of Planning if any special overlay district requirements affect your site. Critical Area Review Within the areas identified above, any of the following actions will trigger Critical Area review: 1) Building/Grading Permit 2) Rezoning 3) Subdivision   4) Conditional Use/ Special Exception 5) Zoning Variance After a preliminary review, Department of Planning staff will decide if a project is considered ""significant"" by the following criteria: 1) If there is any disturbance 2) If there is a disturbance of 3) If improvements are being base full cash value of the in the Buffer; 10,000 square feet outside the Buffer; or made to an existing structure that are 50% or more of the property.  Disturbance is defined as breaking the soil. Only significant development is subject to the special provisions or restrictions outlined below. ""Significant"" Project Process If a project is deemed significant, the following is the minimum that will be requested: a. Three copies of the site plan (use the Site Plan Review Committee Requirements list-in Section X); b. Three copies of the landscaping plan; c. Three copies of Worksheet A showing the proposed pollution reduction method (in Section X); d. Two copies of the Habitat Protection Assessment and the ""Habitat Assessment Field Form""[Worksheet""] if there will be any encroachment in a Designated Habitat Protection Area. These forms are available in the Planning Department. e. A copy of the CAMP Program Certification and Landscape Maintenance Agreement (in Section X). These must be copied onto the landscape plan and signed. f. Copy of the tree detail spliced onto the plans. Once the Department of Planning receives the above, the information is distributed to the Department of Public Works for a technical water quality review and to the Critical Area Commission in Annapolis as required by the Critical Area Act. The Department of Public Works will check the applicant's runoff pollution reduction requirements and the proposed best management practices. Determinations of Buffer establishment and all additional requirements are the responsibility of the Department of Planning. Once these agencies have specified how the project shall meet these requirements, the developer shall provide plans that comply with the requirements and/or provide a written statement of intent regarding any applicable offsets to the responsible Departments. When the developer has submitted development plans and/or a statement of intent regarding offsets, the Department of Planning will again review the plans for compliance to meet local Critical Area requirements. All developers will be required to meet any additional Building Code or other code requirements before the building permit is issued. Water Quality All significant development or redevelopment regardless of development area, shall reduce runoff pollution from the site by a minimum of 10%. If it can be demonstrated   that this is infeasible, developers are required to pay into an offset program managed by the Planning Department so that water quality improvement goals can be met elsewhere in the City's watershed. Buffer Requirements All significant development or redevelopment within the Buffer portion of the Critical Area is subject to special Buffer establishment and/or habitat protection requirements depending on the location of the property. Development within the Buffer is discouraged; disturbance within the Buffer is subject to a fee of at least $2.50 a square foot of disturbance. Funds raised are used to improve Buffer habitat in other portions of the watershed. Summary of Requirements within the Buffer Sub-Area IDA-Waterfront Revitalization SubAreas Developer Requirements  Developer may develop up to 100% of the Buffer area.  Developer must pay an offset fee for total Buffer area that is not landscaped/vegetated.  Does not pay Buffer offset fee for the area designated as ""promenade"". Water Dependent Use*  Developer may develop up to 100% of the Buffer area  Developer must pay an offset fee for total Buffer area that is not vegetated.  Removing 20% of pollutants (in Buffer) can be substituted for the Buffer fee. Non-Water Dependent Use  Developer may develop up to 50% of the Buffer provided: 1. Vegetation is planted on the remaining 50% of Buffer on-site or 2. Payment is made to the offset fund for all Buffer areas not vegetated. All land is either publicly owned parkland, a natural habitat area or restricted by floodplain regulations. Only water-dependent facilities for public use may be developed within the Buffer. Natural vegetation must be planted elsewhere in the Buffer equal to three times the land areas disturbed by any development. Offset $2.50 per square foot  IDA-Waterfront Industrial Areas  $2.50 per square foot  Resource Conservation Areas  $5.00 per square foot for the Buffer area developed  *Where the Buffer comprises 15% or more of the development site, the developer may develop as much as 100% of the Buffer, but must also offset for the total Buffer not vegetated. Any site where the Buffer is over 50% of the site, a maximum of 50% of the offset fee will be charged. Within the Waterfront Industrial Area and the Waterfront Revitalization Areas, Buffer offset costs shall not exceed 2% of the proposed new development or redevelopment costs. This does not include land costs.   Small Projects: As part of the 2002 CAMP review process, the Department of Planning made it a goal to simplify the process for smaller projects, especially when the projects were ""gut"" rehabilitations, etc. of existing rowhouses. The following regulations reflect those changes and better reflect the goals of the State's cutting edge Smart Growth legislation and specialized rehabilitation building code and the general goals to bring more citizens into the City and re-populate areas with existing infrastructure. Residential projects: Development activities on existing structures for residential use outside of the 100-foot Buffer on sites less than 1,500 S.F. do not pay offset fees even if the project activates the 50% assessment criteria. This does not apply to new subdivisions or new construction. Non-residential projects: Development activities on existing structures in Residential, Office-Residential and Business zoning districts for commercial use outside of the 100foot Buffer on sites less than 2,000 S.F. do not pay offset fees even if the project activates the 50% assessment criteria. This does not apply to new subdivisions or new construction. The CAMP Manual is online at: http://baltimorecity.gov/government/planning/available.html It must be viewed using Adobe Acrobat software, which is available on the WEB for free downloads. The Manual contains the Worksheet A (a copy is also attached for your convenience), planting specifications, and everything an applicant needs to meet the requirements. Detailed maps of the Critical Area are also available in the Department of Planning. VERY IMPORTANT: Please note that the City's CAMP and the separate Stormwater Quality Regulations administered by the Bureau of General Services, Department of Public Works, are indeed, SEPARATE regulations. The phosphorous removal required in the CAMP is different than the DPW regulations; offset fees are also calculated differently. Please be aware of these differences as you develop your project. For additional information and help with your submittal materials, please call Duncan Stuart, Critical Area Planner, in the Planning Department at 410-396-5902 or e-mail him at Duncan.stuart@baltimorecity.gov.

GX263-99-0411035	"VERMONT ENVIRONMENTAL BOARD 10 V.S.A. Ch. 151 Re: Green Mountain Habitat for Humanity, Inc., and Burlington Housing Authority Declaratory Ruling #406  Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order This is a petition for a declaratory ruling filed by Green Mountain Habitat for Humanity (Habitat) and the Burlington Housing Authority (BHA) concerning whether a Land Use Permit pursuant to 10 V.S.A.  6001-6092 (Act 250) is required for the construction of an eight-unit affordable housing project with related subdivision, on Venus Avenue in Burlington (Project). As set forth below, the Board finds that Act 250 jurisdiction attaches to the Project and that an Act 250 permit is therefore required. I. Procedural Summary  On January 18, 2002, the District 4 Environmental Commission Coordinator (Coordinator), at Habitat's request, issued Jurisdictional Opinion 4-175 (JO) in which he determined that the Project requires an Act 250 Land Use Permit. On February 28, 2002, the Coordinator issued a Reconsideration of JO 4-175, affirming the JO (Reconsidered JO). On March 19, 2002, Habitat and BHA filed a Petition for Declaratory Ruling with the Environmental Board (Board), appealing the JO and the Reconsidered JO; they contend that the Project does not require an Act 250 permit. On April 18, 2002, Board Chair Marcy Harding convened a Prehearing Conference with the following participants: Habitat and BHA, by Neil Mickenberg, Esq. John Desautels and Katherine Desautels (formerly Katherine Gluck), by Michael J. Straub, Esq. June Garen, Beverly Senna, James P. Senna, Janet L. Prince, Robin E. Dayman, Kevin Greenblott, Robert D.

On April 19, 2002, Chair Harding issued a Prehearing Conference Report and Order (PCRO) identifying parties, the issue on appeal, and setting the case for hearing by a Panel of the Board. At the prehearing conference, the parties agreed to work together toward stipulating to the facts of the case, and the prehearing schedule was crafted accordingly. The parties did not file a stipulation of fact. Also at the prehearing conference, there was some discussion concerning whether Michael Straub would represent the entire group of Neighbors, or only John and Katherine Desautels. On April 25, 2002, Mr. Straub confirmed that he represents John and Katherine Desautels and that Ms. Desautels represents the Neighbors. On August 27, 2002, the parties filed a joint request to continue the hearing from September 4, 2002 to October 30, 2002. Also on August 27, 2002, Chair Harding issued a Continuance Order granting the parties' joint request. In accordance with the Continuance Order, a hearing panel of the Board convened a public hearing in this matter on October 30, 2002, took evidence from the parties. The Panel commenced deliberations immediately after the hearing and also on November 15, 2002. Based upon a thorough review of the record and related argument, the Panel issued a proposed decision on November 20, 2002, which was sent to the parties. The parties were allowed to file written objections and request oral argument before the Board on or before December 6, 2002. On December 6, 2002, Habitat and BHA filed an objection to the proposed decision and requested oral argument. On December 18, 2002, the Board heard oral argument and convened a deliberation concerning this matter. Following a review of the proposed decision and the evidence and arguments presented, the Board declared the record complete and adjourned. This matter is now ready for final decision.   Re: Green Mountain Habitat for Humanity, Inc., and Burlington Housing Authority Declaratory Ruling #406 Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order Page 3  II.  Issue  Whether the Project constitutes a development and requires a land use permit pursuant to Act 250. III. Findings of Fact  To the extent that any proposed findings of fact are included within, they are granted; otherwise, they are denied. See Secretary, Agency of Natural Resources v. Upper Valley Regional Landfill Corp., 167 Vt. 228, 241-242 (1997); Petition of Village of Hardwick Electric Department, 143 Vt. 437, 445 (1983). Topic headings are for organizational purposes only. A. The Project  1. Habitat and BHA propose to build and sell four single-family residences and two duplex units (a total of eight units) at 140 Venus Avenue in Burlington. 2. No construction has taken place at the Venus Avenue Project site, and no site work has taken place. 3. The Project is located on a 2.3 - acre parcel.  4. BHA owns the 2.3 - acre parcel on which the Project will be located; Habitat owns none of the Project land. 5. The Project is legally structured as a condominium, and all of the unit owners will have an undivided interest in the common areas, including the land, a portion of which will be subject to a conservation easement to the Burlington Department of Parks and Recreation. B. Green Mountain Habitat for Humanity  6. Habitat is a tax-exempt, Vermont non-profit corporation which is dedicated to the construction of affordable homes through the use of volunteers. 7. Directors. Habitat has one staff member and is governed by a volunteer Board of  8. Habitat receives grants from the Vermont Housing Conservation Board (VHCB), the Burlington Housing Trust Fund, and from foundations such as the Ronald McDonald foundation.   Re: Green Mountain Habitat for Humanity, Inc., and Burlington Housing Authority Declaratory Ruling #406 Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order Page 4  C.  Other housing units constructed by Habitat  9. Habitat has built six housing units and is currently constructing a seventh housing unit within a five-mile radius of the Project within the past five years: a. a duplex at 660 North Avenue, sold by Habitat and recorded December 20, 2000; b. one single-family residence at 23 Allen Street, sold by Habitat on August 31, 2001 and recorded November 5, 2001; c. one single-family residence at 48 Batchelder Street, sold by Habitat on December 3, 1998 and recorded January 27, 1999; d. one single-family residence at 52 Batchelder Street sold, by Habitat on November 25, 1998 and recorded January 27, 1999 e. one single-family house at 176 South Champlain Street, sold by Habitat on June 4, 2002 and recorded June 17, 2002 f. one single-family unit, presently under construction on an existing lot on Sims Street, which Habitat plans to sell in late 2002 or early 2003 10. None of the seven other houses built by Habitat are contiguous to the Venus Avenue Project. 11. All of the seven other houses built by Habitat were built on existing lots; Habitat did not subdivide any lots in the course of building the other houses. 12. Each of the other houses built by Habitat , except the Sims Street house, was sold to a family as a private residence following construction. 13. Habitat has received zoning approval and other required city permits for the other seven houses it constructed, or is constructing. 14. Habitat has no single, overall ""development plan"" for the houses it constructs; rather, Habitat acts in an ad hoc mode -- if a lot becomes available and it is affordable, Habitat tries to acquire it to use as a building lot.   Re: Green Mountain Habitat for Humanity, Inc., and Burlington Housing Authority Declaratory Ruling #406 Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order Page 5  D.  Funding for the Project and Habitat's other housing units  15. Part of the funding for the Project comes from a grant received by Habitat from VHCB, part comes from charitable donations, and part comes from mortgage payments to Habitat, which holds mortgages on housing units it constructs and sells. 16. The other seven housing units noted above were also partially funded by VHCB grants, charitable donations, and mortgage payments to Habitat, which holds the mortgages for these housing units. 17. In the construction of its houses, Habitat relies on volunteer work and occasionally contracts for certain work, such as electrical work. E. Burlington Housing Authority  18. BHA is a Vermont municipal housing authority within the city of Burlington which constructs affordable housing and assists low-income individuals and families in finding affordable housing. F. 19 Other housing units constructed by BHA During the past five years BHA has not subdivided any land for resale.  20. BHA constructed only one unit within the past five years, an apartment at the Franklin Square Apartment complex. 21. BHA did not participate in the development or construction of any of the other houses noted above which Habitat built. G. Burlington Development Review Board approval of the Project  22. The Burlington Development Review Board (DRB) conditioned its approval of the Project on several things, including a condition requiring that: Habitat and the Burlington Housing authority shall remain responsible as the original developer and applicant for this eight (8) unit PRD for any maintenance or permitting issue(s) for a period not to exceed three (3) years beyond the date of issuance of the final certificate of occupancy for the development. 23. The DRB acknowledged both Habitat and BHA as the original developer in its conditions of approval.   Re: Green Mountain Habitat for Humanity, Inc., and Burlington Housing Authority Declaratory Ruling #406 Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order Page 6 24. H. The DRB approved the Project on February 20, 2001. Other city and state permits for the Project  25. BHA and Habitat applied jointly for city permits, including the zoning permit, for the Project. 26. The Public Water System Permit identifies BHA as the permittee; the record does not indicate the identity of the applicant. 27. The Project received subdivision approval from the City of Burlington on February 20, 2001, and was reviewed and approved under Burlington's subdivision ordinance; the subdivision permit identifies BHA as the landowner; the record does not indicate the identity of the applicant. 28. The state Water Supply and Wastewater Disposal Permit identifies BHA as the landowner; the record does not indicate the identity of the applicant. I. Relationship between Habitat and BHA relative to the Project  29. Habitat and BHA have entered into an Agreement which requires each organization to construct four of the eight units involved in the Project. 30. Under the Agreement, after Habitat constructs a unit, BHA will convey its interest in the unit and an undivided one-eighth interest in the common areas to Habitat. 31. Immediately following the conveyance from BHA, Habitat will convey the same property to a private homeowner. 32. Habitat will never own more than four of the units and will never own more than an undivided interest in one-half the common areas. 33. There is no present agreement between BHA and Habitat concerning which organization is responsible for building which unit. 34. units. 35. BHA will hire laborers to build its four units. Habitat is solely responsible for all costs associated with building its four  36. There will be no shared purchase of materials by BHA and Habitat in the construction of their units.   Re: Green Mountain Habitat for Humanity, Inc., and Burlington Housing Authority Declaratory Ruling #406 Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order Page 7 37. The BHA units will be sold to homeowners along with an undivided oneeighth interest in the common areas for each unit. 38. Habitat and BHA are jointly responsible for obtaining grants to cover infrastructure associated with the Project; such grants will be made to Habitat and BHA jointly. 39. BHA and Habitat hold no joint escrow accounts or financial paper.  40. Habitat paid for the engineering studies and plans for all of the eight units at the Project. 41. Plans and studies submitted by Lamoureux and Dickinson, the engineering firm, include plans for all eight units in the Project. The plans are entitled ""Habitat for Humanity  8 Unit PRD."" 42. 43. Habitat. All housing units at the Project are of a common design. This Project is the only project in which BHA has worked directly with  44. When the Project concludes, BHA and Habitat will have no ownership interest in the land. 45. Upon their construction, a condominium association will be formed for the eight units; the association will hold the common land at the Project. 46. The Burlington Parks and Recreation Department will control the conservation land at the Project site. IV. Conclusions Of Law  The issue is whether the Project is a ""development."" Act 250 defines ""development"" to include: the construction of housing projects such as cooperatives, condominiums, or dwellings, or construction or maintenance of mobile homes or trailer parks, with 10 or more units, constructed or maintained on a tract or tracts of land, owned or controlled by a person, within a radius of five miles of any point on any involved land, and within a continuous period of five years. 10 V.S.A. 6001(3)(A)(iv); see also, EBR 2(A)(3)(defining ""development"").   Re: Green Mountain Habitat for Humanity, Inc., and Burlington Housing Authority Declaratory Ruling #406 Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order Page 8 To determine whether the Project is a development, it is helpful to break the definition of ""development,"" as it pertains to housing units, into its constituent elements. A. ""the construction of housing projects""  The Project is the construction of a housing project of eight units, although BHA and Habitat argue that only four units are attributable to each of them. B. ""with ten or more units""  Even if only four of the units at the Project are attributable to Habitat, those four units, added to the six units already constructed by Habitat, and the seventh unit under construction, put Habitat's portion of the Project over the ten unit threshold. C. ""constructed or maintained on a tract or tracts of land""  The Project is located on a 2.3 - acre parcel. D. ""owned or controlled""  BHA owns the 2.3-acre parcel where the Project is located; by virtue of its Agreement with BHA, Habitat exercises control over the parcel. See, In re Eastland, Inc., 151 Vt. 497 (1989); In re Lou R. Vitale, 151 Vt. 580 (1989). E. ""by a person""  EBR 2(H) defines ""person"" by reference to 10 V.S.A.  6001(14)(A) and (B). The statute, in turn, defines ""person"" to include "" . . . an individual, partnership, corporation, association, unincorporated organization, trust or other legal or commercial entity, including a joint venture or affiliated ownership...."" 10 V.S.A.  6001(14)(A)(i). A joint venture is a relationship between parties ""to engage in and carry out a single business venture for joint profit without any actual partnership or corporate designation."" Vermont Environmental Board v. Chickering, 155 Vt. 308, 317 (1990)(citations omitted). While, arguably, Habitat and BHA will each build, own, and sell their four units, a number of factors lead to the conclusion that the Project is a single business venture consisting of eight units. BHA and Habitat applied jointly for city permits for the Project. The Burlington DRB's approval, which acknowledges both Habitat and BHA as the Project's original developer, includes a condition which requires that Habitat and BHA ""remain responsible as the original developer and applicant for this eight (8) unit PRD for any   Re: Green Mountain Habitat for Humanity, Inc., and Burlington Housing Authority Declaratory Ruling #406 Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order Page 9 maintenance or permitting issue(s) for a period not to exceed three (3) years beyond the date of issuance of the final certificate of occupancy for the development."" Habitat and BHA have entered into an Agreement concerning the construction of the eight units involved in the Project. While Habitat will never own more than four of the units and will never own more than an undivided interest in one-half the common areas, and both Habitat and BHA are responsible for the financing for and construction of their discrete four units, the Agreement acknowledges that BHA has an interest in each of Habitat's four units, as it includes an understanding that, after Habitat constructs a unit, BHA will convey its interest in the unit to Habitat. Other factors indicate the closeness of the Habitat and BHA relationship as it concerns the Project. While BHA and Habitat hold no joint financial papers, they are jointly responsible for getting grants to cover infrastructure associated with the Project. Habitat paid for the engineering studies and plans for all of the eight units at the Project; plans submitted by the engineering firm include plans for all 8 units in the Project. Additionally, all housing units at the Project are of a common design. As it is clear that BHA and Habitat are acting in concert with respect to this Project, the Board concludes that it is a ""single business venture."" 1 1  Habitat takes issue with adding the seven other houses that Habitat built (see Findings of Fact, C) to the Project's eight units in order to reach the 10 unit threshold under 6001(3)(A)(4). It argues that ""the BHA/Habitat joint venture which constitutes the ""person"" under 10 V.S.A. 6001(3) is a different entity than Habitat, which alone built the seven Other Houses over the last five years."" To agree with Habitat's first argument  that a joint venture is a "" 'legal or commercial entity,' distinct from the individual acts of its separate members"" - would ignore the concept of ""person,"" under Act 250. It would allow an entity (like Habitat) to build nine houses and then, by creating a joint venture (Habitat/BHA) by joining itself to another organization (BHA), to build nine more houses within five miles and five years with no Act 250 jurisdiction attaching to the second project. This is exactly the sort of activity disapproved of in the Chickering case. Habitat argues next that the seven other houses cannot be attributed to the Project, since they were built only by Habitat. This argument would again separate out Habitat's individual acts from the Habitat/BHA joint venture. Again, this is contrary to the concept of ""person"" under the Act. It is Habitat's activities as a ""person"" that trigger jurisdiction over the Project; and Habitat must bring to the Project all of its prior acts, including the construction of the seven other houses. See, In re Spencer, 152 Vt. 330, 337  339 (1989) (""Spencer and wife"" do not comprise a separate ""person"" from ""Spencer and Vargas"" or Spencer, himself); Re: John W. Stevens and Bruce Gyles, Declaratory Ruling #240, Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order at 11 (May 8,   Re: Green Mountain Habitat for Humanity, Inc., and Burlington Housing Authority Declaratory Ruling #406 Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order Page 10  While Habitat is a nonprofit corporation and BHA is a Vermont municipal housing authority, the Board also finds that the single business venture in which they are engaged is ""for joint profit."" There is nothing in the word ""profit"" that expressly limits its application to financial gain from sales alone.2 ""Profit"" can be found in avoided costs; here, Habitat profited by its association with BHA because Habitat did not need to spend funds to purchase the land for its four units, and BHA profited because Habitat paid for the engineering studies and plans for all of the eight units at the Project, including those to be built by BHA. The Board therefore concludes that BHA and Habitat are engaged in a joint venture in the development of the eight units on Venus Avenue and thus, for purposes of this Project, are the same ""person"" under Act 250 and the Board's Rules. F. ""within a radius of five miles""  The seven housing units constructed by Habitat are all within five miles of the Project. G. ""of any point on any involved land""  Habitat argues that the use of the term ""involved land"" connotes that there must be a relationship between the Project and the other housing units constructed by Habitat. The Neighbors reply that the term merely means that if a house sits on a  1992); Re: Marcel and Stella Roberts, Declaratory Ruling #265, Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order at 10 (May 11, 1993); Re: Marcel Roberts and Noel Lussier, Declaratory Ruling #239, Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order at 56 (May 11, 1993). In determining the meaning of terms used in a statute, one looks first to the statutory definitions; when, however, such terms are not defined, they ""are to be given their plain and commonly accepted meaning,"" Vincent v. State Retirement Board, 148 Vt. 531, 535 -36 (1987), as ""in the absence of compelling reasons to hold otherwise, it is assumed that the plain and ordinary meaning of statutory language was intended by the legislature."" State v. Young, 143 Vt. 413, 415 (1983). There is no definition of the word ""profit"" either in 10 V.S.A. Ch. 151 (Act 250), or in the statutory definitions found in 1 V.S.A. Ch. 3, subch. 2; thus, one may turn to the dictionary for assistance in defining the term. While the definition of ""profit"" most commonly is ""the gross proceeds of a business transaction less the costs of the transaction, i.e. net proceeds,"" it also includes the ""accession of good, valuable results [and] useful consequences...."" Black's Law Dictionary, (6th Ed., 1990). 2   Re: Green Mountain Habitat for Humanity, Inc., and Burlington Housing Authority Declaratory Ruling #406 Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order Page 11 portion of a lot, the five mile measurement is not made from the location of the house but from any point on the lot on which the house is located. The Neighbors have the more persuasive argument. In its decision in Re: Burlington Housing Authority, Declaratory Ruling #124, Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order (May 20, 1981), aff'd, In re Burlington Housing Authority, 143 Vt. 80, 83 (1983), the Board expressly rejected the application of the ""involved land"" 3 language which pertains to commercial or industrial construction ""involving"" more than ten acres, 10 V.S.A. 6001(3)(A)(i), to the definition of ""development"" which pertains to housing units. 10 V.S.A. 6001(3)(A)(iv): We also reject petitioner's argument that the Supreme Court's decision in Committee to Save the Bishop's House v. Medical Center Hospital, 137 Vt. 142 (1979) exempts scattered housing projects from Act 250 jurisdiction unless a functional relationship exists among the sites that effect a significant impact under the environmental criteria of the Act. ... However, it is clear from the Bishop's House decision that parcels which are actually built upon are ""involved"" in the development, whatever the interrelationship among such parcels might be. See Bishop's House, 137 Vt. at 150. In the case of housing projects, this analysis makes a great deal of sense, since the legislature expressed its concern over the cumulative environmental and fiscal impacts of 10 or more new housing units in a certain area  e.g., effects on school enrollment, public utilities and services, water supplies and prime agricultural soils. These effects exist cumulatively with the development of the housing units, whether on one site or on many, totally apart from the interactive effects of one site on another. ... Burlington Housing Authority at 3. 4  Habitat argues that the Board has adopted a rule which defines ""involved land,"" EBR 2(F)(1), and that this definition must apply to the definition of development which  3 4  See EBR 2(F)(1).  Habitat also cites the Supreme Court case of In re Stokes Communications Corp., 164 Vt. 30, 36 (1995), in support of its ""involved land"" argument. Again, however, Stokes was a matter in which the definition of ""development"" now found in 10 V.S.A. 6003(A)(i) was at issue, not the definition pertaining to housing units in subsection (A)(iv).   Re: Green Mountain Habitat for Humanity, Inc., and Burlington Housing Authority Declaratory Ruling #406 Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order Page 12 pertains to ""housing units."" Habitat asserts that a failure to do so violates the Administrative Procedures Act, 3 V.S.A. Ch. 25 (APA). 5 Habitat's claim ignores the rationale of the earlier Burlington Housing Authority case. As is clear from the Burlington Housing Authority decision, the Board has earlier specifically rejected the arguments now raised by Habitat, finding that there need not be conclusion that ""a functional relationship exists among the sites that effect a significant impact under the environmental criteria of the Act."" Id. The Board also notes Burlington Housing Authority's emphasis on the cumulative impacts caused by housing construction, which exists even if there is no functional relationship between the different housing sites. The term ""involved land"" has been used by the Board solely in terms of computing relevant acreage when determining whether a project ""involves"" more than one or ten acres of land. There is a distinction between the way the term ""involved land"" is used for commercial or industrial development and the way it is used for housing projects. Section 6001(3)(A)(i) states that ""development"" means: i) The construction of improvements on a tract or tracts of land, owned or controlled by a person, involving more than 10 acres of land within a radius of five miles of any point on any involved land, for commercial or industrial purposes in a municipality that has adopted permanent zoning and subdivision bylaws. As is apparent from the language of the statute, development for commercial or industrial purposes in a more than 10 acres of land; the focus under the statute parcels of land, as, if less than 10 acres are ""involved,"" to be subject to Act 250, ""ten-acre"" town must involve is the size of the parcel or there is no Act 250 jurisdiction.  By contrast, 6001(3)(A)(iv) states that ""development"" means To agree with Habitat's apparent claim of error regarding the APA - that the Panel's decision writes a new rule which has not gone through the APA process - would mean that the Board could never, in a decision, establish a definition for a term. This makes little sense, as it would mean that the Board could never make a decision as to the meaning of a word or a term in Act 250, if the word had not already been defined by a rule. While, in light of this case and Habitat's argument, it might be advisable for the Board to consider writing such a rule to apply to housing projects, the present nonexistence of such a rule does not render the Board's actions illegal. The Board notes further that the definition of ""involved land"" that Habitat promotes  one which integrate the ""common-sense criteria""  was also not adopted through the APA process. 5   Re: Green Mountain Habitat for Humanity, Inc., and Burlington Housing Authority Declaratory Ruling #406 Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order Page 13  (iv) The construction of housing projects such as cooperatives, condominiums, or dwellings, or construction or maintenance of mobile homes or trailer parks, with 10 or more units, constructed or maintained on a tract or tracts of land, owned or controlled by a person, within a radius of five miles of any point on any involved land, and within any continuous period of five years. The requirement that the development must involve parcels which comprise more than 10 acres of land does not exist for jurisdiction over housing projects; rather, the number of units is the primary concern, not the acreage on which they sit, either collectively or individually. Burlington Housing Authority tells us that every house sits on its own parcel or parcels of ""involved land,"" and the only question is whether any point on such a parcel is within five miles of other parcels. 6 Lastly, the specific language of the definition of ""involved land"" in EBR 2(F)(1) makes it clear that it cannot apply to housing unit development: (1) The entire tract or tracts of land, within a radius of five miles, upon which the construction of improvements for commercial or industrial purposes will occur, and any other tract, within a radius of five miles, to be used as part of the project or where there is a relationship to the tract or tracts upon which the construction of improvements will occur such that there is a demonstrable likelihood that the impact on the values sought to be protected by Act 250 will be substantially affected by reason of that relationship. In the event that a commercial or industrial project is to be completed in stages according to a plan, or is part of a larger undertaking, Despite Habitat's claim that the Board's decision today ignores the existence of the words ""involved land"" in the statute, the concepts embodied in the EBR 2(F)(1) definition of ""involved land"" are applicable to housing unit development and can be used when considering jurisdiction. The ""involved land"" analysis in Rule 2(F)(1) may encompass a situation in which a house is built on Lot A, but has its primary or secondary leachfield located on Lot B, a separate lot. Lot B may not be contiguous to Lot A; Lot B may not even be owned by the owner of Lot A; it need only be controlled by such owner. In such an example, Lot B would be considered to be ""involved land"" with Lot A, and if Lot B is within five miles of other housing unit lots, then the house on Lot A house will be counted as a housing unit under 6001(3)(A)(iv), even if Lot A itself is not within the five-mile radius. Thus, while Habitat argues that our decision strikes the term ""involved land"" from the statute, we do not ignore the existence of those words. We merely interpret them differently than what Habitat would prefer. 6   Re: Green Mountain Habitat for Humanity, Inc., and Burlington Housing Authority Declaratory Ruling #406 Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order Page 14 all land involved in the entire project shall be included for the purpose of determining jurisdiction. EBR 2(F)(1) (emphasis added). The particular reference in Rule 2(F)(1) to ""the construction of improvements for commercial or industrial purposes"" indicates the types of development - those referenced in 10 V.S.A. 6001(3)(A)(i), (ii) and (iii)  to which the Rule applies. Since housing unit development is a different animal, one which is not included within the legislature's ""commercial or industrial purposes"" category, the definition in Rule 2(F)(1) is inapposite. Habitat raises a stronger claim with its ""single project"" argument, one which is based both on the Burlington Housing Authority case, as affirmed, and the later decision in Re: Trono Construction Co., Inc., Declaratory Ruling 149, Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order (May 23, 1984), aff'd, In re Trono Construction Co., 146 Vt. 591 (1986). In these cases, the Board and Vermont Supreme Court looked to whether housing projects on separate tracts ""are so closely related as to constitute a single 'development' for purposes of Act 250."" In re Trono Construction Co., 146 Vt. at 592. Trono involved two housing projects on separate parcels of land in Burlington. The developer obtained an Act 250 permit for one project (twelve units on College Street), completed construction and began selling units, and then commenced construction on a nine-unit housing project on North Union Street, within 5 miles of the first project. The Court affirmed the Board's decision that ""the mixture of the timing of the projects and common ownership brought [the] second development project within the strictures of Act 250."" Id. The Court noted that the Board had considered ""common sense criteria"" to determine whether different housing projects constitute a single development, such as common ownership or management, common funding, shared facilities, and contiguity in time of development. 7 7  Because Trono cites the ""criteria"" approvingly, Habitat argues that the Panel is therefore ""overturning"" the Court's Trono decision. The Board disagrees.  The Supreme Court's Trono decision did not establish a test that must be followed in all subsequent cases. Rather, the court simply affirmed the test that the Board decided to apply. This does not mean that if the Board chooses to apply a different test, the Court would disallow it because it was not the same test as had been applied in Trono. Indeed, as more fully discussed below, in 1990, the legislature amended the definition of housing unit to add the ""five year"" requirement, something that did not exist at the time of the Court's 1986 Trono decision. Certainly, this amendment allows the Board to undertake a new analysis of 6001(3)(A)(iv), free from the language of the Court's decision. The Board is therefore not ""overturning"" the Trono decision; it is merely interpreting the meaning of the law in light of the legislative change.   Re: Green Mountain Habitat for Humanity, Inc., and Burlington Housing Authority Declaratory Ruling #406 Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order Page 15  Trono, both at the Board and in the Supreme Court, was based on the Board's earlier, May 1981 Burlington Housing Authority decision, which, for the first time, introduced the ""common sense criteria"" test to the housing unit definition in response to an argument that had been presented to the Board: Petitioner argues that our finding that a housing project may exist on scattered sites will subject to Act 250 jurisdiction any developer who builds more than 10 units of any type at any time within a five mile radius..... a. We do not hold that any builder who has constructed 10 or more units will automatically trigger Act 250 jurisdiction with each new unit to be constructed within the necessary geographical radius. A developer may, over time, build and sell a number of different housing projects in scattered locations. Several common-sense criteria may be used to determine whether any of these scattered developments would comprise a related housing project. Such indications would include: retained common ownership or management, common funding, shared facilities, and contiguity in time of development. ... Burlington Housing Authority, at 2 (emphasis added). 8 It is apparent from the above language from Burlington Housing Authority that the principal concern of the petitioner in that matter was the ""ultimate scenario"" claim that housing units built 20 or 30 years apart could be added together to trigger jurisdiction. 9 The Board's measured reply  and its decision to link scattered housing projects together through an initiative based on ""common-sense criteria""  can be seen as a rational response to that concern.  Subsequent reference to these criteria, within a ten-acre ""involved land"" analysis and not an analysis of ""development"" pertaining to housing projects, appears in Re: Town of Wilmington, Declaratory Ruling #258, Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order at 10 (Jun. 30, 1992). And, see, Re: Lake Realty, #9A0175-EB, Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order at 6 (Oct. 20, 1989). These criteria were also noted in William Dibbern, #5R0194-1-EB, Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order at 5 (July 16, 1981). 9  8  The petitioner also expressed a concern that jurisdiction would attach to ""any person who merely owned 10 or more units within a five mile radius,"" but the Board quickly dismissed that fear, noting that ""mere ownership does not constitute a 'development' under 6001(3)."" Burlington Housing Authority at 2  3.   Re: Green Mountain Habitat for Humanity, Inc., and Burlington Housing Authority Declaratory Ruling #406 Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order Page 16 The question is whether these ""common-sense criteria"" remain as critical a component to determining jurisdiction over housing projects today as they were in the early 1980s. Several considerations provide an answer. First, the use of the word ""may"" in the Board's Burlington Housing Authority decision indicates that, in the absence of other factors, the ""common sense criteria"" provide guidance to the Board's jurisdictional determination. Although Habitat dismisses it as immaterial to the ""single project"" question raised herein, it is nonetheless significant to note that Act 250 was amended in 1990 (after all the decisions in Burlington Housing Authority and Trono) to add the words ""and within any continuous period of five years"" to the definition of housing unit ""development."" Act No. 234, 3 (1989 Adj. Sess., eff. June 4, 1990). Thus, as one of the ""common-sense criteria"" specifically noted in the Burlington Housing Authority decision - contiguity in time of development  was specifically addressed and limited by the Legislature, the single, principal fear presented by the Burlington Housing Authority petitioner no longer exists, and the Board need no longer rely on such criteria as a protection against an unwarranted extension or overreaching of Act 250's housing project jurisdiction. 10 Second, the Board presumes that the legislature intended the plain meaning of the statutory language. Re: Vermont Egg Farms, Inc., Declaratory Ruling #317, Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order at 8 (Jun. 14, 1996), citing Bisson v. Ward, 160 Vt. 343, 348 (1993). Therefore, if the meaning of the statute is plain on its face, the Board enforces the statute according to its express terms. Vermont Egg Farms, Inc., at 8, citing Burlington Electric Dept. v. Vermont Dept. of Taxes, 154 Vt. 332, 335-36 (1990). The plain language of the statute, 10 V.S.A. 6001(3)(A)(iv), contains no requirement that housing units on different parcels must be linked together as a single project before jurisdiction will be triggered. To the contrary, the statute sets up only certain factors that must be present to create jurisdiction: the construction of ten or 10  It is interesting to note that the 1990 amendment which added the five-year requirement may also have been in response to the Board's decision in Re: Harold Jacobs, Declaratory Ruling #210, Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order at 2 (Sept. 28, 1989), in which the Board held that there were no time frame limits within the definition of ""development"" pertaining to housing units. Additionally, the Harold Jacobs decision makes no mention of the ""commonsense criteria"" established by Burlington Housing Authority. Two other related Board decisions, one issued before and one issued after the 1990 amendment, also ignore those criteria. Re: Bradford Moore / S.D.L. Enterprises, Inc., Declaratory Ruling #205, Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order (Apr. 24, 1990); Re: Richard Farnham, Declaratory Ruling #250, Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order (July 17, 1992). The Board's application of the ""common sense criteria,"" therefore, has not been consistent.   Re: Green Mountain Habitat for Humanity, Inc., and Burlington Housing Authority Declaratory Ruling #406 Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order Page 17 more housing units, on land owned or controlled by a person, within five miles and five years of each other. Those factors are all present in the instant case. 11 Third, the elements which appear in 6001(3)(A)(iv) are virtually identical to those which appear in the definition of ""subdivision,"" 10 V.S.A. 6001(19): ""a tract or tracts of land, owned or controlled by a person, which the person has partitioned or divided for the purpose of resale into 10 or more lots within a radius of five miles of any point on any lot, ... within any continuous period of five years."" When determining whether the partitioning of lots on separate tracts constitutes a ""subdivision,"" the Board does not require that any common elements (ownership, funding, etc.) exist between those separate tracts; the Board only looks to elements of statute and not to whether there is some sort of relationship between the lots. The Board also notes that the recent amendment to ""development,"" relating to the construction of housing units likewise simply counts units constructed by a person within See, 10 V.S.A. 6001(C). 12 Again, the legislature has not 11  the definition of in designated downtowns, five years and five miles. required that there be any  Habitat contends that our decision violates the limitations on Board jurisdiction imposed by the Supreme Court's Bishop's House decision - - that Act 250 jurisdiction attaches ""only where activity on a very major scale is planned."" 137 Vt. at 151. But it is the legislature which decides the ""scale"" of developments which will be subject to Act 250 jurisdiction; here, 6001(3)(A)(iv) contains certain elements, such as ownership, distance and time, and as long as a project meets the language of that section, the law applies. 12  Section 6001(C) reads: (C) For the purposes of determining jurisdiction under subdivisions (3)(A) and (3)(B) of this section: (i) Housing units constructed by a person partially or completely outside a designated downtown development district shall not be counted to determine jurisdiction over housing units constructed by a person entirely within a designated downtown development district. (ii) Within any continuous period of five years, housing units constructed by a person entirely within a designated downtown district shall be counted together with housing units constructed by a person partially or completely outside a designated downtown development district to determine jurisdiction over the housing units constructed by a person partially or completely outside the designated downtown development district and within a five-mile radius.   Re: Green Mountain Habitat for Humanity, Inc., and Burlington Housing Authority Declaratory Ruling #406 Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order Page 18 relationship between the housing units that are considered for purposes of determining jurisdiction. 13 The Vermont Supreme Court has held that ""when the same words are used in different sections of the same statute they will bear the same meaning throughout, unless it is apparent that another meaning was intended...."" Billings v. Billings, 114 Vt. 512, 517 (1946); accord, State v. Welch, 135 Vt. 316, 321 (1977). The Board believes that the fact that the legislature requires no linkage between lots counted for purposes of determining the existence of a ""subdivision"" or units counted for purposes of determining jurisdiction for downtown housing, no linkage is required under a straight reading of 10 V.S.A. 6001(3)(A)(iv). Fourth, in terms of their environmental impact on the criteria listed in 10 V.S.A. 6086(a), under some circumstances there may be no difference between a residential subdivision and an equal number of single family housing units on tracts of common land. Whether or not they are related by ""common sense criteria,"" housing units on common land may have the same environmental impacts as houses which are each on their own separate lots. 14 Because the environmental impacts can be identical, there is (iii) All housing units constructed by a person within a designated downtown development district within any continuous period of five years, commencing on or after the effective date of this subdivision, shall be counted together. Habitat argues that the legislative history of the 1990 amendment reveals that its purpose was to protect developers from Act 250 jurisdiction in relation to housing that was constructed over an extended period, and that the Panel's use of the amendment to expand jurisdiction turns this purpose on its head. The Board disagrees. The decision today recognizes that the 1990 amendment is a protection for developers. The decision is a statement that the ""five year"" test replaces the ""common-sense criteria"" that had earlier been established in the Burlington Housing Authority decision as an attempt to address a complaint that there was no time limitation in the law as it previously existed. To adopt Habitat's claim would mean that not only does the ""five year"" requirement exist, but also all of the ""criteria"" would still apply, even though two of the ""criteria"" (common ownership or management and contiguity in time of development) specifically relate to time sensitive issues. Habitat asserts that these ""cumulative effect"" considerations can apply equally to commercial or industrial developments which together exceed 10 acres, but the Supreme Court's Bishop's House decision rejects this approach. It was within the context of determining acreage involved in a project that the Bishop's House case was decided. The case did not concern the question of how to 14 13   Re: Green Mountain Habitat for Humanity, Inc., and Burlington Housing Authority Declaratory Ruling #406 Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order Page 19 no reason to treat subdivisions and housing unit developments differently for jurisdictional purposes. 15 Lastly, the ramifications of requiring a ""common sense criteria"" relationship between housing units could allow a person to build nine housing units, sell the last unit, commence construction on the next nine units, ad infinitum, as long as he was careful to obtain funding from different banks. The five-year test would thus be rendered surplusage, contrary to general rules of statutory construction. ""In construing a statute, every part of the statute must be considered, and every word, clause, and sentence given effect if possible."" State v. Stevens, 137 Vt. 473, 481 (1979); Slocum et al. v. Department of Social Welfare, 154 Vt. 474 (1990); State v. Tierney, 138 Vt. 163, 165 (1980); State v. Racine, 133 Vt. 111, 114 (1974) (court ""must presume that all language is inserted in a statute advisedly""). The Board therefore concludes that the plain language of the 1990 amendment supercedes the ""common-sense criteria"" originally enumerated in the 1981 Burlington Housing Authority decision. 16 measure the distances between housing units, which is what the ""involved land"" language in 6001(3)(A)(iv) addresses. The Board also notes that the ""cumulative effect"" argument appears in the earlier Burlington Housing Authority decision; the Board did not create it for this decision. 15  Habitat contends that housing projects should not be equated with subdivisions because the definition of ""subdivision"" does not include a reference to ""involved land."" While this is true, if one considers that the use of the word ""involved land"" in the definition of housing projects relates to distances between the parcels on which the individual houses sit, and not the size of those parcels, then the fact that the definition of ""subdivision"" does not include a reference to ""involved land"" is not material to our decision. Further, by its very nature, all of the land in a subdivision is ""involved land;"" there is simply no need or reason to refer to the concept of ""involved land"" within the definition of ""subdivision.""  Habitat claims that, even if Trono's ""contiguity in time of development"" criterion is addressed by the 1990 amendment, the other ""criteria"" required by Trono still exist. Again, however, as noted above, the Trono decision does not establish any requirements that the Board must follow; it merely reaffirms those that the Board chose to apply back in the mid-1980s. Nothing prohibits the Board from finding that the 1990 amendment supercedes earlier requirements in their entirety. Further, Habitat ignores all of the other reasons as to why the ""common-sense criteria"" should be abandoned. Nor can the Board agree with Habitat's contention that its citation to Trono in the Board's later Town of Wilmington decision, supra, note 8, means that the Board was  16   Re: Green Mountain Habitat for Humanity, Inc., and Burlington Housing Authority Declaratory Ruling #406 Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order Page 20  H.  ""and within a continuous period of five years.""  Habitat's seven other houses were all built within the past five years. Conclusion The Project meets the definition of a housing unit ""development."" V. Order 17  The Project constitutes a development, jurisdiction is triggered, and an Act 250 Land Use Permit is required. Dated at Montpelier, Vermont this 31st day of December 2002.

The Town of Wilmington case merely mentions (within the context of a 10-acre ""involved land"" analysis) the '""criteria"" noted in Trono. This mention is hardly of any note. Habitat notes that the biggest obstacle to building affordable housing in Vermont is the objection of neighbors. While the Board recognizes and lauds Habitat's goals and purposes and realizes that its decision today may make those goals more difficult to achieve, the section of the law at issue here, 10 V.S.A. 6001(3)(A)(iv), makes no distinction between affordable housing and market rate housing. The only provision of Act 250 that provides special dispensation for the construction of affordable housing appears in 10 V.S.A. 6001(3)(B), and, if further exceptions to the law for the benefit of affordable housing projects are to be made, they must also be legislative in origin. 17"

Rowe ) Administrative Law  99-PT-0003 attachment attachment  Judge  RECOMMENDATION FOR DISPOSITION  Appearances: LeGrand L. Malany, Attorney at Law, for Habitat for Humanity.  Synopsis: The hearing in this matter was held in Springfield, Illinois on May 3, 1999, to determine whether or not Sangamon County Parcel Index Nos. 22-02.0-305-015, 22-02.0-305-014, 1427.0-177-046, 14-26.0-301-013, 22-02.0-257-017, 22-02.0-257-018, 22-02.0-257-019, 22-02.0257-020, 22-02.0-257-026, and 14-27.0-254-020 qualified for exemption during the 1998 assessment year. Jan Sorenson, 1997 president and current past president of Habitat for Humanity of Sangamon County (hereinafter referred to as the ""Applicant"") was present and testified on behalf of the applicant. The issues in this matter include: first, whether the applicant was the owner of these parcels during the 1998 assessment year; secondly, whether the applicant is a charitable  1   organization; and lastly, whether these parcels were used by the applicant for charitable purposes during the 1998 assessment year. Following the submission of all the evidence and a review of the record, it is determined that the applicant owned these parcels during all of the 1998 assessment year. It is also determined that the applicant is a charitable organization. Finally, it is determined that the applicant did not use the vacant parcels for exempt purposes during the 1998 assessment year. Regarding Parcel Index No. 14-27.0-177-046, it is determined that the applicant has established that it was used for exempt purposes for 65% of the 1998 assessment year. It is therefore recommended that Sangamon County Parcel Index Nos. 22-02.0-305-015, 22-02.0-305-014, 14-26.0-301-013, 22-02.0-257-017, 22-02.0-257-018, 22-02.0-257-019, 2202.0-257-020, 22-02.0-257-026, and 14-27.0-254-020 remain on the tax rolls for 1998 and be assessed to the applicant the owner thereof. It is also recommended that Parcel Index No. 1427.0-177-046 be exempt for 65% of the 1998 assessment year.  Findings of Fact: 1. The jurisdiction and position of the Department that Sangamon County Parcel  Index Nos. 22-02.0-305-015, 22-02.0-305-014, 14-26.0-301-013, 22-02.0-257-017, 22-02.0-257018, 22-02.0-257-019, 22-02.0-257-020, 22-02.0-257-026, 14-27.0-254-020 and 44% of Parcel Index No. 14-27.0-177-046 did not qualify for a property tax exemption for the 1998 assessment year was established by the admission into evidence of Dept. Ex. Nos. 1 through 14. (Tr. p. 14) 2. The applicant was incorporated under the General Not for Profit Corporation Act  of the State of Illinois on May 22, 1989. The mission of the applicant is: to eliminate poverty housing by building simple, decent, affordable housing for working families in need. To be eligible to receive a Habitat home, the Habitat family must have a family income of between 35 and 65% of the median family income for the City of Springfield as established by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. Habitat homes are built through the use of donated funds, donated materials, and volunteer labor. Where labor and materials must be purchased, they are purchased with funds raised by Habitat for Humanity through donations. Once a home is built, it is deeded to the homeowner at our cost of construction. Habitat finances a  2   Habitat family home by a zero interest five to six homes per year. Although homes, we do purchase or get donated Habitat program is the same for new (Dept. Ex. No. 2) 3.  mortgage. We are currently building we generally have been building new older homes which we remodel. The construction as it is for remodeling.  The applicant acquires real estate to be used in its Habitat home building program.  The applicant obtains real estate through purchases, gifts, and donations. Some are received from the city of Springfield through various economic development programs. The real estate that the applicant purchases is usually vacant lots, which can be utilized as home building lots. The applicant never knows exactly when a property will be needed. The applicant holds parcels in inventory until one of its families is approved for home construction. In order to qualify for approval a family needs 250 sweat equity hours for each adult in the family. Once approved, the family chooses a lot for its new home. Volunteers of the applicant begin construction on the home. Once the home is completed, the Habitat family moves in. The house is then deeded to the Habitat family at no interest and at the applicant's cost. The deeding process takes additional time. From the time the applicant receives a piece of property until it is disposed of may be as long as four years. (Dept. Ex. No. 2; Tr. pp. 22, 26-28) 4. The Habitat family finds the applicant either through word of mouth or through  the applicant's advertising and family orientation programs. (Tr. p. 22) 5. The bylaws of the applicant state that:  Habitat for Humanity - Sangamon County shall seek to sponsor specific projects in habitat development in Sangamon County, Illinois, starting with the construction of modest but adequate housing, and to associate with other groups functioning with purposes consistent with those listed below, namely: a. to work with economically disadvantaged people to help them create a better human habitat in which to live and work. b. to cooperate with other charitable organizations, through grants and otherwise, which are working to develop a better habitat for economically disadvantaged people. c. to communicate our faith in God by means of our words and actions as we work in partnership with God and people building homes  3   and community. d. to enable an expanding number of persons from all walks of life to participate in this ministry. (Dept. Ex. No. 2) 6. The applicant is exempt from the payment of federal Income Taxes pursuant to a  group determination by the Internal Revenue Service that the applicant qualifies as the type of organization described in Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code. (Dept. Ex. No. 2) 7. The applicant acquired Parcel Index No. 22-02.0-305-015 by a quitclaim deed on  December 24, 1996. The property is commonly known as 1900 East Cornell Street, Springfield, Illinois. In 1998, the property was vacant land. (Dept. Ex. No. 2) 8. The applicant also acquired Parcel Index No. 22-02.0-305-014 by a quitclaim  deed on December 24, 1996. The property is commonly known as 1828 East Cornell Street, Springfield, Illinois. In 1998, the property was a vacant lot. (Dept. Ex. No. 3) 9. The applicant acquired Parcel Index No. 14-27.0-177-046 on December 29, 1995,  by a warranty deed. The property was donated to the applicant as a gift. The property is commonly known as 801 North 7th Street, Springfield, Illinois. When the applicant acquired the property it contained a one-story commercial building that was vacant. It had been used as a medical office. From 1996 until February 1998 the applicant used the parcel as a construction site for a house on an adjoining parcel, for storage of construction materials, storage of materials for applicant's fundraisers, and as an office. The applicant moved out of the building on  February 2, 1998. (Dept. Ex. No. 4; Tr. pp. 16-19) 10. On June 11, 1998, the applicant obtained a demolition permit for ""interior gutting  single family residence"" at 801 N. 7th Street. Construction was started on or about June 13, 1998, and substantially completed by mid-September. On July 15, 1998, the applicant was  issued a building permit to ""remodel interior, & new truss roof, SFR house #38"" at 801 North 7th Street. Applicant's construction, remodeling, and utility costs for job #38 totaled $65,270.99 including the cost of the land and insurance. The applicant knew the property was worth about $50,000.00 and did approximately $20,000.00 to $25,000.00 worth of rehabilitation. On August  4   16, 1998, the applicant sold the property and home by a lease with the option to purchase to a family that qualified for applicant's program. The mortgage had not been signed at the time of the hearing. The family was delinquent on the lease payments. (Dept. Ex. No. 4; Tr. pp. 16-19, 21) 11. The applicant acquired Parcel Index No. 14-26.0-301-013 on December 30, 1995,  by a warranty deed. The property was donated to the applicant as a gift. The property is commonly known as 1515 East Miller, Springfield, Illinois. In 1998 the property was a vacant lot. (Dept. Ex. No. 5) 12. On July 22, 1996, the applicant acquired Parcel Index No. 22-02.0-257-017 by a  warranty deed. The property is commonly known as 1828 Perkins Court, Springfield, Illinois. In 1998 the property was vacant land. (Dept. Ex. No. 6) 13. Parcel Index No. 22-02.0-257-018 was acquired by the applicant on July 22, 1996  by a warranty deed. The property is commonly known as 1824 Perkins Court, Springfield, Illinois. The property was a vacant lot in 1998. (Dept. Ex. No. 7) 14. The applicant acquired Parcel Index No. 22-02.0-257-019 on July 22, 1996, by a  warranty deed. The property is commonly known as 1820 Perkins Court, Springfield, Illinois. In 1998 the property was vacant land. (Dept. Ex. No. 8) 15. The applicant also acquired Parcel Index No. 22-02.0-257-020 on July 22, 1996,  by a warranty deed. The property is commonly known as 1816 Perkins Court. The property was a vacant lot in 1998. (Dept. Ex. No. 9) 16. Parcel Index No. 22-02.0-257-026 was acquired by the applicant on July 22, 1996  by a warranty deed. The property is commonly known as 1800 Perkins Court, Springfield, Illinois. In 1998 the property was vacant land. (Dept. Ex. No. 10) 17. On October 21, 1994, the applicant acquired Parcel Index No. 14-27.0-254-020  by a warranty deed. The property is commonly known as 1011 North 12th Street, Springfield, Illinois. The property contained an abandoned house and was vacant in 1998. (Dept. Ex. No. 11)  5   18.  None of the parcels at issue required zoning changes. In 1998 the applicant  cleaned up the vacant lots and mowed them. (Tr. p. 28) 19. I take administrative notice that the Department granted the applicant a partial  exemption for 1998 in Docket No. 98-84-46, which concerns Parcel Index No. 14-27.0-177-046, street address 801 N. 7th. Conclusions of Law: Article IX, 6 of the Illinois Constitution of 1970, provides in part as follows: The General Assembly by law may exempt from taxation only the property of the State, units of local government and school districts and property used exclusively for agricultural and horticultural societies, and for school, religious, cemetery and charitable purposes. This provision is not self-executing but merely authorizes the General Assembly to enact legislation that exempts property within the constitutional limitations imposed. City of Chicago v. Illinois Department of Revenue, 147 Ill.2d 484 (1992) Pursuant to the constitutional grant of authority, the legislature has enacted provisions for property tax exemptions. At issue is the provision found at 35 ILCS 200/15-65, which exempts certain property from taxation as follows: All property of the following is exempt when actually and exclusively used for charitable or beneficent purposes, and not leased or otherwise used with a view to profit: (a) Institutions of public charity. (b) Beneficent and charitable organizations incorporated in any state of the United States, . . . It is well settled in Illinois that when a statute purports to grant an exemption from taxation, the tax exemption provision is to be construed strictly against the one who asserts the claim of exemption. International College of Surgeons v. Brenza, 8 Ill.2d 141 (1956) Whenever doubt arises, it is to be resolved against exemption and in favor of taxation. People ex. rel. Goodman v. University of Illinois Foundation, 388 Ill. 363 (1941). Further, in ascertaining  6   whether or not a property is statutorily tax exempt, the burden of establishing the right to the exemption is on the one who claims the exemption. MacMurray College v. Wright, 38 Ill.2d 272 (1967) The Department granted the applicant a partial exemption pursuant to Docket No. 98-8446, Parcel Index No. 14-27.0-177-046, address 801 N. 7th Street. Therefore, the Department has determined that the applicant is a charitable organization. The only question before me is whether the applicant used the subject properties for charitable purposes during the 1998 assessment year. With regard to all the properties other than Parcel Index No. 14-27.0-177-046, street address 801 N. 7th St., the applicant did not use the parcels at all in 1998. They were vacant lots. The Illinois Appellate Court found that a church-owned building, which was not used for any purpose and was boarded up during the taxable years in question, did not qualify for a property tax exemption for those years. Antioch Missionary Baptist Church v. Rosewell, 119 Ill.App.3d 981 (1st Dist. 1983). In addition, the Fifth District Appellate Court held that eighteen vacant lots did not qualify for a property tax exemption in Comp. Train. & Devel. v. Co. of Jackson, 261 Ill.App.3d 37 (5th Dist. 1994). In the v. case The 311 of People ex. rel. of the  Pearsal  Catholic Ill. 11  Bishop  Chicago,  (1924),  Illinois Supreme Court held that the mere fact that a property was intended to be used for an exempt purpose was not sufficient to exempt said property. Court required that the The  actual  primary exempt use must have begun for the property to be exempt. Regarding Parcel Index No. 14-27.0-117-046, the 801 N. 7 th  Street  7   property, the applicant used it from the time of acquisition until February 2, 1998, for storage and construction projects associated with its charitable purpose. The Appellate Court of Illinois has determined that property owned by a church and used for storage of church records and furniture qualified for a property tax exemption in Our Savior Lutheran Church v. Department of Revenue, 204 Ill.App.3d 1055 (5th Dist. 1990), leave to appeal denied. It is therefore  recommended that the property qualify for exemption from January 1, 1998, through February 2, 1998. However, the applicant has failed to establish that Parcel Index No. 14-27.0-117-046 qualifies for exemption for the period of February 2, 1998, through June 11, 1998, or for 35% of the 1998 assessment year. The Department previously determined that the property qualified for exemption from June 11, 1998. Based upon the foregoing, I find that the applicant has failed to establish that it used the vacant subject parcels for charitable purposes in 1998. I therefore recommend that Sangamon County Parcel Index Nos.: 22-02.0-305-015 located at 1900 E. Cornell; 22-02.0-305-014 address 1828 E. Cornell; 14-26.0-301-013 a/k/a 1515 E. Miller; 22-02.0-257-017, which is 1828 Perkins Court; 22-02.0-257-018 located at 1824 Perkins Court; 22-02.0-257-019, a/k/a 1820 Perkins Court; 22-02.0-257-020, which is 1816 Perkins Court; 22-02.0-257-026, the address of which is 1800 Perkins Court; and 14-27.0-254-020, located at 1011 N. 12th Street, remain on the tax rolls for be the entire to 1998 the  taxable  year  and  assessed  applicant, the owner thereof.

REPORT IN BRIEF: On February 7, 2001, the Davie Town Council unanimously adopted Resolution 2001-037 approving the ""Harmony Village Community Redevelopment/ Revitalization"" Plan. This Plan is a holistic approach to neighborhood revitalization which contains both residential and non-residential components. The center-piece of the Plan is the construction of 22 new single-family homes by Habitat for Humanity of Broward, Inc., on land to be donated by the Town of Davie. The vacant site is located on the northeast corner of the Davie Road Ext. and NW 76 Ave. The time-line contained in the ""Harmony Village Plan"" contemplated that the land would be donated to Habitat for Humanity by the end of FY 2000/01; however, in order to minimize Habitat's liability or maintenance costs associated with the vacant parcel, the donation was delayed until the Plat was recorded, the Site Plan approved, and the infrastructure designs were completed. The Broward County Commission unanimously approved the Plat for Harmony Village on April 16, 2002. The Site Plan had previously been approved by the Davie Town Council, contingent upon approval of the Plat by the County Commission. The designs for the infrastructure have been completed by CDI Engineering, and are now ready to be put out to bid. Given that the above actions are now complete, it is time for the Town to transfer the Warranty Deed to the site to Habitat for Humanity of Broward, Inc., so that they can   proceed with the development of this urgently needed affordable homeowner housing.

The plan, which focuses on 12 municipalities in the western and southern region of Cumberland County, has the following goals:      Address the existing needs for jobs, infrastructure and economic development Provide balance between economic development and environmental protection Achieve intermunicipal agreement on development goals and strategies Develop a planning and implementation agenda Obtain plan endorsement  opportunities for its residents. A Smart Growth plan was viewed as a means to properly plan for new development. Starting in the Fall of 2001, and concluding in the Spring of 2004, the CDC led an intensive public involvement process which served to gather input on the desired direction of the Western/Southern Cumberland Region, and which culminated in the Western/Southern Cumberland Region Strategic Plan. The CDC was assisted in this process by OrthRodgers & Associates, Inc, a consulting planning firm, along with Maser Consulting and S. Huffman Associates.  Study Area Cumberland County is located on the southern end of New Jersey, with frontage on the Delaware Bay (Map 1, Regional Location). As of 2000, it had a population of 146,438, ranking 16th among New Jersey counties. Its land area of 388 square miles places it 5th among New Jersey counties. The most rural of New Jersey counties, it is also in some respects the most isolated. It has no Interstate highway, and the one limited access highway is Route 55, which extends north to the Philadelphia-Camden metropolitan area. The County has considerable natural beauty, but, situated on the Delaware Bay, it does not have the beaches which attract millions of visitors to the popular shore communities in Cape May County to the east. Cumberland County is perhaps best known for the agricultural and nursery products it ships to cities in the middle Atlantic region and along the Eastern seaboard.  This volume is the heart of the Western/Southern Cumberland Region Strategic Plan: it contains the identification of centers, the strategic plan, and the planning and implementation agenda for both the region and for the individual municipalities. Taken together, this report provides the blueprint for planning efforts in the WSCR communities for years to come. The volume was preceded by a series of other planning documents that laid the foundation for the Plan. The other documents include:  Municipal Profiles  April 2003  Regional Profile  April 2003  Potentials for Economic Development, Phase I Report: Secondary Data Review and Analysis  April 2003  Potentials for Economic Development, Phase II Report: Market Feasibility Study  April 2003  History The WSCRSP has been spearheaded by the Cumberland Development Corporation (CDC), a non-profit, 501(c)6 corporation founded to promote economic development in the rural communities of Cumberland County. Cumberland County is one of the least developed counties in New Jersey. Residents and businesspersons would like to retain its rural environment and its high quality of life, while attracting development that will enable the County to offer adequate employment  The Plan - Draft Western/Southern Cumberland Region Strategic Plan December 2003  Page 1    The WSCR study area itself consists of the following municipalities, as listed below and depicted on Map 2:             Bridgeton City Commercial Township Deerfield Township Downe Township Fairfield Township Greenwich Township Hopewell Township Lawrence Township Maurice River Township Borough of Shiloh Stow Creek Township Upper Deerfield Township  same time, however, there are pockets of poverty even in the rural communities. Median household income and median housing values are well below the state average. Economic development initiatives are needed in the WSCR communities, to prevent them from slipping further below the median income. This Strategic Plan thus pursues the goal of economic development, in a way respectful of the need to protect the important natural resources in the area and the traditional industries, such as farming and fishing, based on those resources.  Public Involvement Public involvement has been an integral part of the creation of the Plan. It has occurred principally through two venues: the Steering Committee and the Advisory Committee. The Steering Committee consists of the mayors from each of the municipalities, along with representatives from the Cumberland County Department of Planning and Development, the Bridgeton Area Chamber of Commerce, the NJ Office of Smart Growth (NJOSG) and the CDC. The Steering Committee has provided overall direction to the study. There will be seven meetings through the study. The Advisory Committee embraces a wide cross-section of community representatives. Close to 90 persons have been invited to each Advisory Committee meeting, with attendance typically varying from 30 to 40. The representation includes the business community, state and local officials, environmental community, community action agencies, educators, farmers, utilities, and others. To maximize public involvement, the Advisory Committee meetings have been organized using a workshop format. Following an initial presentation by the planning consultants, attendees have been organized into discussion groups. The input of these discussion groups was incorporated into a ""vision matrix"" for the Region, which identified the most critical needs and issues. This vision matrix, in turn, was eventually developed into the planning and implementation agenda for the Plan. There will be four Advisory Committee meetings throughout the study.  With the exception of Bridgeton, all of the WSCR communities are rural, with a relatively low population density. The combined population of the 12 communities in 2000 was slightly over 63,000, making up 43% of the County's population. Very little population growth has occurred since 1990, with virtually all of the growth due to the prison population. Unlike much of the rest of New Jersey, the WSCR area has seen only modest suburban development. The study area offers some of New Jersey's most important natural resources: 80,000 acres of prime farmlands concentrated in the north and west sections of the study area, and pristine rivers and coastal watersheds in the south. The area has great natural beauty, and the many small historic villages and hamlets add to the region's appeal. The traditional industries still remain  such as oystering, fishing, sand mining, glass making and food processing  but these offer a smaller share of employment than they once did, and a need exists for a greater diversity and number of industries and services. Historically rural, the study area communities lack the larger concentrations of poverty found in the urban communities of Vineland, Millville and Bridgeton. Economic development in desirable in these communities, and some development has already been spurred by the establishment of the Empowerment Zone and Urban Enterprise Zone encompassing these areas. At the  The Plan - Draft Western/Southern Cumberland Region Strategic Plan December 2003  Page 3    There will be two Public Meetings conducted during the study, at the halfway point and shortly after preparation of the draft Plan. For each public meeting, a formal presentation is made, followed by a question and answer period. Attendees are also surveyed. A series of newsletters has been published throughout the study to inform the public. These have been made available in hard copy and posted on the CDC website. The CDC website has made meeting minutes and reports available to the public at large. As described in the section below, a CD-ROM, video, and poster summarizing planning efforts in Cumberland County were prepared as part of this study, and have also served to inform the public on planning activities. At the beginning of the study, there were surveys of representatives of each municipality to identify key planning goals for the region. The surveys expressed broad agreement in many areas, as follows:      All of the responding communities identified open space, agricultural and environmental resources as main assets; All of the responding communities identified the lack of infrastructure as a main concern, with lack of ratables and job opportunities a close second; Most communities would consider planning tools to limit the loss of farmland; Most communities would like to see tourism related development, as well as light industry and agricultural industries; The communities would welcome a variety of development programs, including funding for infrastructure, tax incentives, assistance with permitting, loan programs, and others.  summary is made available by the Cumberland County Planning Department on a CD-ROM entitled Planning for the Future: A Summary of Cumberland County Planning Initiatives. A poster is also being prepared to highlight County planning efforts. In conjunction with this task, a video was prepared, also entitled Cumberland County: Planning for the Future. The video, intended for the layperson, describes the process of strategic planning in Cumberland County. The video project was the recipient of the 2003 Public Education Award from the New Jersey chapter of the American Planning Association. The County plans to show the video in a variety of venues. A series of reports established the foundation for the Plan: Municipal Profiles  these summarize land uses, key demographic trends, and major planning issues within each of the 12 municipalities. The Municipal Profiles were based upon review of municipal master plans and other reports, and interviews with local officials. Regional Profiles  these provide a comprehensive overview of existing and future conditions in the WSCR study area, and highlights prominent issues that should be addressed, within the areas of: Land use  the largest land usea are wetlands and forest ;amds, both with about one-third of the land area. Farming is the most important industry, accounting for 5,000 jobs, and 12,000 of the 68,000 acres in farmland are preserved. Hopewell, Upper Deerfield, Stow Creek and Lawrence have the greatest amount of assessed farmland. Significant sand mining operations are found in Maurice River, Commercial, Downe and Fairfield. State parks and wildlife areas account for over 56,000 acres, four PSE&G conservation sites account for over 10,000 acres, and non-profit lands over 13,000 acres. Historic and natural resources  there are over 200 properties on the Cumberland County Register of Historic Sites, and two historic preservation ordinances, in Bridgeton and Greenwich.  Background Reports The Cumberland County Department of Planning and Development has overseen the preparation of various regional plans in recent years, many of which have focused on the importance of balancing economic development and environmental preservation. As part of the WSCRSP, a summary was prepared of these plans, both as a foundation of the Plan and to increase public awareness of these planning efforts. This The Plan - Draft Western/Southern Cumberland Region Strategic Plan December 2003  Page 5   Transportation  the need for regional transportation projects was cited as the highest priority. Better access to the west was listed by South Jersey Transportation Planning Organization (SJTPO) as a transportation improvement that could facilitate economic growth. Sewer and water infrastructure  CCUA provides sewer service to all of Bridgeton; to parts of Hopewell and Upper Deerfield; and to a small section of Fairfield. Shiloh, Upper Deerfield, Fairfield, and Hopewell are approved for future sewer expansion, and Stow Creek and Greenwich are in the CCUA planning area. The remainder of the study area is within the Rural Wastewater Management Area. Expansion of sewer to serve communities such as Rosenhayn Village in Deerfield and Port Norris is a critical issue. NJDEP has indicated that there appears to be a water supply deficit, but renewal of the Watershed planning process is needed to address this issue. Community facilities the County lags behind the state in educational attainment. Economic development  As of 2000, there were 59,000 jobs in the County, and about 15,000 in the study area. Retail and office development is minor. State planning areas and proposed and designated centers were also discussed. Potentials for Economic Development  this market study analyzed the potential for economic development in the region. The first volume examined various economic data, and the second volume offered strategies for promoting growth. The report noted that that study area is less accessible than other locations with direct access to I-295, and industrial land is thus lower priced. There is not immediate demand for industrial acreage in the WSCR study area, with about 1,200 acres of industrial park land already available  virtually all in Millville and Vineland  and another 1,000 to 1,500 acres in the planning stages. The study recommends that the Cumberland County Improvement Authority establish a loan guarantee program for micro-businesses, and that the Urban Enterprise Zone be extended to cover a proposed intermunicipal industrial park.  Industries that should be strongly targeted and recruited include manufacturing industries such as glass manufacturing, packaging and shipping container manufacturing, or business services such as commercial printing. Potential spin-offs from hospitality include restaurants, cleaning services and specialty stores. Fresh food and value-added food processing should be a priority. To support the production of fruits and vegetables, the study recommends bringing the product directly to its destination, through targeting additional food processors to establish plants, and encouraging the development of a mechanism for direct delivery of produce to food stores and restaurants. Alternatively, farmers markets should continue to be developed as part of an ecotourism strategy. Aquaculture can also support the farming industry by supplying a market for some of its by-products. Ecotourism strategies to build on natural, historic and recreational areas was extensively discussed in the market study.  The Plan - Draft Western/Southern Cumberland Region Strategic Plan December 2003  Page 6   BUILD-OUT ANALYSIS Process An analysis was conducted for the WSCR study area to determine the potential number of housing units and jobs at full build-out. For this analysis, zoning districts for each municipality were organized into composite zoning districts with similar land uses and densities grouped together. The composite zoning districts were then mapped in the Geographic Information System (GIS) to illustrate the generalized zoning in the WSCR (Composite Zoning, Map 3). The districts were classified according to these specifications: Composite Zoning Classifications Residential Uses Definition/ Density Rural Residential 0.1 units/acre Very Low Density Residential 0.25-0.3 units/Acre Low Density Residential Average of 0.5 units/acre Medium Density Residential Average of 2 units/acre High Density Residential Average of 6 units/acre Residential uses permitted with minimum lot size greater than 5 acres Very Low Density Agriculture Residential uses permitted with minimum lot size from 1-5 acres Low Density Agriculture Non Residential Uses Commercial Commercial and business uses Conservation/Institutional/Public Conserved land, institutional and public uses Industrial Industrial Residential and commercial uses permitted in same Mixed Use district  final estimate of developable land's acreage indicates the land that could be developed with housing units or commercial or industrial uses. The residential build-out numbers were calculated by dividing the minimum lot area into the total area available for each actual zoning district. For example, if there is 435,600 square feet of land available in a particular zone and the minimum lot area for that zone is 43,560, ten homes could be built within that zone. The number of housing units built in the years 1996-2000 was deducted from the housing yield to account for units that have been developed since the 1995 NJDEP land use layer was prepared. Potential employment was calculated through multiplying the amount of available acres within each zone by the average number of jobs per acre. Existing employment density in the WSCR study area was calculated to determine the appropriate average. It was determined that the City of Bridgeton could sustain an average of 16.1 jobs/acre while the rest of the municipalities within the study area have an average of 5.8 jobs/acre. For example, in most of the study area it would be assumed that a 10-acre site would yield roughly 60 jobs. For areas of mixed use zoning, both residential and non-residential uses are permitted in the same district. It was assumed that the developable land would be built half residential and half non-residential. There are some exceptions to the above process for the build-out of residential units in agricultural zones. Hopewell, Shiloh, Stow Creek, and Upper Deerfield Townships have restrictions against building new roads in agricultural zones, and these districts thus require special residential build-out calculations. For these districts, the total linear length of existing roads was calculated and divided by the minimum lot width for each municipal agricultural zone. The resulting number was then multiplied by two in the assumption that both sides of the road were undeveloped. For example, if there is a 1,000-foot road in an undeveloped agricultural zone and the municipality's minimum lot width for single family homes was 250, an additional eight homes would be yielded in the agricultural zone.  The total areas of developed and undeveloped land within each municipality were calculated through conducting a GIS analysis of NJDEP 1995 land use/ land cover data. To determine lands that cannot be built upon, all ""constrained"" lands were first identified. Constrained lands are either unsuitable for development  such as wetlands  or permanently protected, such as parks. The constrained lands were merged with the developed lands to form a layer of undevelopable lands. The areas of undevelopable lands were then subtracted from the total areas within each municipality, resulting in a mapping layer that depicts developable lands (Map 4). The areas of developable land were calculated for each composite zoning district, and a 15% deduction was applied in order to account for future infrastructure improvements. The  Analysis Table 1 (Residential Build-out) shows the potential build-out calculations for residential units in the WSCR study area. Almost 70,000 acres are Page 7  The Plan - Draft Western/Southern Cumberland Region Strategic Plan December 2003   developable within the existing residential districts; at current zoning, these areas could yield 36,000 housing units. Table 2 (Jobs Build-out) shows that approximately 6,700 acres are suitable for non-residential development within the WSCR area. This land has the potential to produce 41,000 new jobs in both commercial and industrial uses. Almost 16,000 of the potential housing units could be located in the agricultural zones. Preservation of agricultural lands is a high priority in WSCR municipalities. Acquisition of farming easements will reduce this number; however, alternative and innovative zoning techniques should be considered to direct development to centers. It should also be noted that the build-out analysis was conducted using vacant lands. Lands that are under-utilized and have redevelopment potential were not included. Incorporation of these lands would result in even greater build-out yield.

The issues were organized into the following categories:  Natural Areas;  Historic;  Mining;  Agriculture;  Transportation;  Sewer and Water;  Community Facilities and Services;  Housing;  Economic;  Intermunicipal Cooperation; and,  State Plan Endorsement. Key strategies have been developed for each of these issue areas. As translated into the regional planning and implementation agenday, these form the heart of the Plan. These strategies are presented below.  municipal master plans and the County Open Space Plan should specify and prioritize remaining natural areas that are worthy of preservation. These plans should also indicate when further acquisition of open space areas will not be in a municipality's interest, because such areas are needed to fulfill other important municipal goals. Because these lands are an important public good, and critical to the County's important eco-tourism industry, these lands should be highly accessible. A comprehensive inventory should evaluate the adequacy of the signing for these natural areas, both for tourists trying to locate these areas and for tourists within the natural areas. An inventory should also document whether the roads and other facilities, such as rest areas, are properly maintained. Other, less visible aspects of management, such as proper security, should also be evaluated. Some of these responsibilities fall upon the municipalities, and some on the State or County. In all cases, however, it should be the goal to maintain visitorfriendly natural areas. Following the inventory, needed improvements should be prioritized, and possible funding sources identified, so improvements can occur in a comprehensive manner. PILOT Programs A robust PILOT (payment in lieu of taxes) program is recommended to help pay the cost of needed services or improvements on lands owned by the State or non-profit organizations. As noted earlier, municipalities must pay for services, such as road maintenance or fire protection, for natural areas even though these properties make no contribution to the municipal revenues. This is, of course, true across the state. However, in Cumberland County the lands owned by public entities or non-profit groups are so considerable that an unusual burden is placed on certain municipalities.  Natural Areas Coordinated Planning A significant share of lands in the WSCR study area are permanently preserved, either by the state in parks or wildlife management areas (56,000 acres) or by private for-profit or non-profit groups (24,000 acres). These lands provide both an opportunity and a problem for study area municipalities. Because so many lands are preserved, residents of Cumberland County know that they will always be surrounded by considerable natural beauty, and that a ""critical mass"" exists for an eco-tourist industry. However, the large number of acres in state or non-profit hands also limits the ability of municipalities to foster the development of lands and thus create jobs. Many miles of Township roads run through these natural areas, and the Townships must keep these in good condition, even when taxes are not paid on these properties. Given the large percentage of these lands in the Townships, the most fundamental strategy for natural areas is to improve the coordination of the County and municipalities with the State and non-profit conservation groups, particularly with regards to acquisition. Open space elements in The Plan - Draft Western/Southern Cumberland Region Strategic Plan December 2003  Page 11   A PILOT is an attempt to compensate local governments for lost tax revenue. It is a way to generate funding to help improve access and other needed infrastructure and services for public lands. PILOTS already exist in the study area. To take one example, PSE&G established an estuary enhancement area in Greenwich Township (as well as in Commercial and Maurice River.) Although the estuary enhancement area was set up under a non-profit subsidiary, PSE&G established a PILOT with Greenwich Township whereby it contributes to the Township approximately the amount of money it would have been responsible for if the land were taxed as private, undeveloped land. The PILOT is indexed to the inflation rate, so the contribution will continue to increase in the future. Further, PSE&G provides its own security, by contracting through another natural non-profit group in the area, the Nature Conservancy. It has also contributed to signing improvements in the area. It would be ideal if the PILOTS created by other non-profits in the area were similar to that established by PSE&G. It would also benefit the study area municipalities if the State, recognizing the special circumstances of the large percentage of lands in public ownership and the minimal tax base of much of the study area, would provide or increase PILOT funding for WSCR municipalities. It could be established, as part of this understanding, that the payments to the municipalities would result in direct improvements to infrastructure in, or leading to, the natural areas, as well as for services to the natural areas. PILOT payments could be based, in part, on the percentage of lands within a municipality that are not taxable. Rural Enterprise Zone In addition to an upgraded the creation of a ""Rural management capabilities conservation, maintenance PILOT program, the WSCR should evaluate Enterprise Zone"" to help develop local and generate economic incentives for and revitalization.  be used for marketing, job training, small business loans, or other stated improvements. Centers in rural areas could receive special consideration in such a program. It should be noted that a Rural Enterprise Zone would require policymaking and legislation at the state level, and thus would likely be one of the longer-term strategies. Cohansey Greenway System Concept The Cohansey River is a special resource for the Region. It runs through Upper Deerfield, Bridgeton, Fairfield, Hopewell and Greenwich. The Cohansey River Management Plan (1998) was intended to balance the conflicting issues of environmental protection and economic development along the river. Significant public conservation lands exist along the river including PES&G Estuary Enhancement sites, preserved farmlands, parklands and wildlife management areas. The lower portion of the Cohansey River has been identified as a particularly outstanding example of the CAFRA zone, due to its vast wildlife habitat. Public access along the river is limited and the value of this river corridor could be enhanced with better public access. The Cohansey River Management Plan recognizes the importance of keeping a navigable river channel up to Route 49, and connecting the waterfronts in Bridgeton, Fairton and Greenwich to the Delaware Bay. The Plan also states that people should have access to areas along the river in the developed areas of Bridgeton, Fairton and Greenwich. The development of an intermunicipal Cohansey River Greenway Plan would assist in the planning, implementation and management of a greenway system or multipurpose path to provide access and recreational opportunities along the river. It will serve the Region and can also be an ecotourism destination with links to the Bayshore bicycle trail and the New Jersey Coastal Heritage Trail. There are sections of the Cohansey River Corridor in public ownership which can be established in the initial section of the greenway from Sunset Lake in Upper Deerfield to Cohansey Park and the waterfront promenade in Bridgeton. Other sections may require acquisition of public easements to link current public land holdings. Special techniques may be required such as elevated boardwalks to traverse sensitive environmental areas  Similar to an Urban Enterprise Zone, but in this case intended for lowerincome rural areas, a Rural Enterprise Zone could be established with a number of benefits. Qualified businesses could be made eligible for tax incentives, marketing support and business counseling. Certified businesses would collect a sales tax of only three percent. Funds could be reinvested in municipal business development programs which would  The Plan - Draft Western/Southern Cumberland Region Strategic Plan December 2003  Page 12   such as the wetlands. Funding can be sought through the Green Acres Trust Fund and other sources for planning and development of this greenway system. Marine-Based Industry/Recreation The importance of supporting marine-based industry and recreation activities was identified as a need in the regional vision workshop. A breached dike on the Cohansey River should be restored, and dredging and other maintenance is needed in the Maurice River, Fortescue Creek and Fairton Marina. Study area municipalities should identify other areas in need of improvement, continue maintenance of existing efforts underway and coordinate with NJDEP for priority funding.  historic preservation ordinance. Currently, only Bridgeton and Greenwich have historic preservation ordinances. Municipalities can also establish informal advisory committees if there is not sufficient personnel for an historic preservation commission as provided for in the Municipal Land Use Law. A planning board can also act as an historic preservation commission for smaller towns. Finally, New Jersey can abet historic preservation by creating an historic home tax credit. Currently, tax credits can be used for buildings renovated by county or municipal governments, or non-profit groups. Protecting Scenic Roads As part of a strategy to promote areas of outstanding scenic, natural, recreational, cultural, historic or archaeological significance, an effort to protect those scenic landscapes should be encouraged. These include the open farmlands surrounding Greenwich and Othello, and the marshes visible from CR 553 in Downe or Lawrence Townships. Open views across farmlands and fields and the tidal lands are an important part of the landscape setting. Protecting these unique aspects of the landscape will support ecotourism opportunities drawing visitors to the Region. These features are also important to the quality of life of the study area municipalities. These scenic roads and views can be protected from the encroachment of development, through strategies described in the following section. Scenic Roadways Cumberland County should prepare a Scenic Roadway Plan to sections of county roadways that are attractive, and along which bicycling or walking would be an enjoyable experience. guidelines should be prepared for use in the Cumberland Planning Board's development review process for projects on identify driving, Design County County  Historic Protection of Historic Resources Cumberland County has historic resources which are important to its sense of place and its attractiveness as a visitor destination. These resources make the area a viable destination. There are two historic districts, in Bridgeton and Greenwich. Even outside these two districts, however, there are older centers with numerous historic structures, such as Dorchester and Leesburg in Maurice River Township. Port Norris has a number of fine historic structures on Main Street in need of repair. While many centers may not have the same concentration of historic properties as Greenwich and Bridgeton, taken together, a tour of historic areas can provide an enjoyable driving or bicycling excursion for visitors to Cumberland County. It should also be noted that the rehabilitation of historic structures in disrepair can help generate local economic activity, by employing local craftsmen. Municipalities should thus make an extensive effort to document and evaluate its existing historical resources. Properties could be added to the National Historic Landmarks Register, and the National or New Jersey Register of Historic Places. To fully develop their potential as historic attractions, municipalities can take a more active role through establishing an historic preservation commission, developing a strong historic preservation element in their master plan and adopting an The Plan - Draft Western/Southern Cumberland Region Strategic Plan December 2003  Page 13   roadways. These guidelines can also serve as model guidelines to be incorporated into municipal ordinances. Monmouth County, NJ serves as an example for this strategy. The County adopted a scenic roadway plan, which provides guidelines for developers to follow in installing a wide range of features, including curbs, drainage, grading and clearing, guiderails, bridges and culverts, detention/retention basins, fences and walls, and identification signs. The County can also consider preparing a scenic corridor management plan, which involves mapping the scenic viewshed along a scenic roadway, describing the notable scenic features, and identifying necessary improvements and management tools, such as local ordinances. Municipal Tools Following creation of a County Scenic Roadway Plan, municipalities are encouraged to adopt various guidelines or ordinances to more directly protect desirable landscapes. Among the tools that municipalities can use to preserve scenic roadways and historic resources are:  Scenic corridor overlay district  preserves a viewshed through requiring development to be sited in the least visible location of a viewshed, such as along the periphery of a site or where natural feature can provide screening. Physical structures within a scenic roadway buffer could be strictly regulated;  Agricultural district  restricts development to agriculture or nursery operation;  Design district  regulates the physical appearance of structures; and  Historic district  regulates alteration to historic structures. Scenic Byway Corridor Management Plan A scenic roadway can also be designated at the state or national level. The New Jersey Department of Transportation created the New Jersey Scenic Byways Program in 1995; its principal goal is to preserve the views of the state's landscape from a roadway. A route must be at least five miles in length to qualify, and is nominated by the State Scenic Byways Program Advisory Committee and the Commissioner of NJ DEP. Routes that are designated as state scenic byways may also be designated as a scenic byway at the national level, and be eligible to receive Federal Scenic Byway discretionary grant funding. Recently, a The Plan - Draft Western/Southern Cumberland Region Strategic Plan December 2003  $150,000 grant was provided from the Public Lands Highway Discretionary Funds Program to develop a scenic corridor through the Salem-Cumberland-Cape May area, constituting the Delsea region of the New Jersey Coastal Heritage Trail. WSCR municipalities should support and coordinate with the project to ensure that important local attractions are included, thus promoting the region. A scenic byway plan should include a scenic inventory, long-term management and maintenance recommendations, ""viewsheds"" management, and describe economic benefits and funding needs and sources. Some communities nominate a scenic byway to increase tourism and bolster their economic base; others use it as a way to conserve the byway corridor resources that reflect the community's character. Additional benefits include federal funding, recognition, increased tourism, technical assistance in the scenic byway process, planning for protection and managed growth and consideration for financial assistance for plan implementation. To enhance the economic vitality of communities along the Mullica River corridor and Delaware Bay region, the Pinelands Rural Economic Development Program has suggested designating a New Jersey and National Scenic Byway, which would promote more widespread recognition and appreciation of the natural and cultural assets of the Pinelands.  Mining Proactive Planning Sand mining and glass manufacturing has historically had a profound effect on the economy of Cumberland County. There are almost 2,000 acres of land developed to mineral extraction in the WSCR study area, with most municipalities containing at least one sand mine facility. The mining activities extend beyond municipal borders and have intermunicipal effects. Both public and private lands are the site of sand mines. One of the issues identified for the study area is the need to proactively plan and regulate the activities on, and reclamation of, the mined lands. While many of the Cumberland County municipalities address mining activities in their own zoning ordinances and Master Plans (Downe, Commercial, Fairfield, Lawrence and Maurice River Townships), there has been an expressed interest in developing intermunicipal plans and a Page 14   model countywide reclamation ordinance so that municipalities and the region can establish common policies and goals. Reclamation Plans should be prepared before any mining activities begins and should be used to evaluate the best and future use of the land based upon its current zoning. WSCR municipalities have expressed interest in using reclaimed mine lands for everything from wildlife habitat to an off-road vehicle park. In addition, with mining such an important part of the economic and cultural heritage of the WSCR, it is recommended that the large sand mining companies create a museum or heritage facility that would demonstrate the importance of silica sands to the economy.  Agriculture Preserve Agriculture Agriculture has long been the backbone of Cumberland County's economy, generating over $2 billion per year and employing over 5,000 people. Given the prevalence of agricultural lands in the region, and the role of agriculture in the area's culture, farmland preservation is a critical issue. Because of its potential for combating suburban sprawl, and its assistance in sustaining an agricultural economy, farmland preservation should continue to be promoted in the study area. County Ranking The County should continue to develop its farmland preservation program, which stands as a model in the effort to prioritize parcels for preservation. The County is in the process of revising its farmland preservation program to better identify strategic lands; this effort will place a greater emphasis upon municipal agricultural zoning districts. As with all such programs, the need to develop a critical mass of preserved agricultural lands, and thus better maintain the viability of the agricultural industry, is key. Municipal master plans should also reflect farmland preservation goals and priority areas.  Farmland Easement Values Land values in Cumberland County are relatively low by New Jersey standards, which can be attributed in large part to the lack of development pressure in the area. Indeed, the ratio of accepted easement values to agricultural products sold is lower in Cumberland County than any other county in the state. There is concern that funding made available for farmland easements in Cumberland County by the New Jersey Department of Agriculture may actually be too low, and thus not be sufficient to entice farmers to selling the easement on their property's development rights. A study is thus needed to review the level of assessments on farmland in the County and determine whether these are in the same relationship to purchase offers as found elsewhere in the state. Balancing Development Preserving farming and agricultural activities, and limiting the encroachment of residential development are two of the major issues identified within the WSCR. One of the strategies used to protect farmland is to focus future residential and commercial growth in the existing centers. Many municipal zoning, subdivision ordinances and master plans can be tailored to better to accommodate farming practices and minimize the amount of farmland that is lost to residential and commercial development. Various techniques intended to protect farmland have been successfully implemented in New Jersey municipalities. Development Transfer One planning tool used to encourage farmland preservation is the use of transfer of development rights (TDR). Under this technique, development rights are transferred from one parcel to another parcel. Under New Jersey law, a conventional TDR program is not permissible in Cumberland County. However, a development right can be transferred under a ""non-contiguous parcel clustering"" (NCPC) program. In its simplest form, NCPC works to preserve farmland by clustering all development on one parcel, and by establishing the open space for this  The Plan - Draft Western/Southern Cumberland Region Strategic Plan December 2003  Page 15   development on a non-contiguous parcel. Unlike a TDR, which is available only in Burlington County, a NCPC transfer can be used anywhere in New Jersey. This technique can be used to preserve farmland and concentrate residential and commercial development in designated centers, with the necessary infrastructure to support development at higher densities. The net result is to conserve valuable land, and make centers more viable. For new centers, such as the Planned Village in Stow Creek, new development can be designed to create a walkable and livable community. Examples of innovative new centers in New Jersey include the Town Center in Washington Township, Mercer County. A detailed plan established a design framework for this center, which followed the principles of ""New Urbanism."" Development credits were transferred to the Center, without technically being a TDR. In Chesterfield Township, Burlington County, a town center was created within a large agricultural area through the use of transfer of development credits. There, two developers have plans for transferring 280 units to a town center. Zoning Provisions For residential development, cluster subdivisions can reduce the extent of developed land by reducing the average lot size while preserving farmland or open space. For example, Readington Township in Hunterdon County has mandatory cluster provisions for tracts of 40 acres or more, or for tracts of 30 acres or more that are adjacent to deed restricted farmland or open space. The clusters comprise lots of 1.5 acres in size. A key provision requires a minimum open space setaside of 70 percent and states that land which is currently being farmed shall, to the greatest extent possible, remain farmland. Fredon Township in Sussex County incorporates a six-acre average lot size in its AR-6 zone, with a minimum lot size of one acre, provided that at least 50 contiguous acres of farmland is preserved. At least 75 percent of the preserved farmland must be Class I or II soils. The clustering provision is also available to the AR-2 zone, which has a twoacre average lot size. The entire tract in both districts must be 80 acres or more. Upper Freehold Township in Monmouth County permits ""agricultural preservation subdivisions"" in its Agricultural Residential district. In this district, 75 percent of tract acreage must be preserved as farmland  through the Monmouth County Agricultural Development Board or the State Agricultural Development Board. Up to 50 percent of the homes that would be permitted on the entire tract as a conventional subdivision can be developed on the remaining acreage. Water Supply When the NJDEP reactivates its statewide water supply planning efforts, it should place a premium on the need to prioritize water supply for farms, if increasing demand ultimately leads to allocating water supply. Right to Farm Ordinance Another technique includes ""Right to Farm"" ordinances which establish parameters that permit farmers to conduct essential farming practices that may create nuisances to adjacent commercial or non-residential property owners. Within the Cumberland Region, municipalities including Fairfield, Hopewell and Lawrence Townships have established ""Right to Farm"" ordinances. Develop Industries Related to Farming Part of what makes the Cumberland Region so special is its farmland. The WSCR is one of the largest agricultural regions in the State of New Jersey. The marketing of farm products through produce stands, ""pick your own"" operations, or active farm markets all contribute to the farming identity. One of the issues identified at the regional vision workshop is the need to develop industries that support agricultural priorities of the region. This includes not just agriculture, but also aquaculture, hydroponics, and marine-based industries. Through municipal land use controls, regulations should be put into place that encourage agri-industry types of businesses. Municipal zoning ordinances and performance-based standards should ensure an agri-industry's appropriate location and compatibility with surrounding uses. Zoning districts should explicitly recognize agricultural industries.  The Plan - Draft Western/Southern Cumberland Region Strategic Plan December 2003  Page 16   Agri-Industry The best way of preserving farming in Cumberland is to improve the profitability of farming operations in the region. Given the higher costs of living in New Jersey, farmers that rely upon traditional row crops to survive will increasingly find themselves at an economic disadvantage. Farmers will thus need to better identify farm products that can occupy market niches. For example, farmers can identify products that are prized in the Hispanic community, grow those products, and cooperate with wholesalers to market the products in those areas. In general, foods that are sought after in ethnic communities would be desirable commodities. Nursery and landscape crops are responsible for an increasing share of farming revenues in the County, and farmers should continue to diversify into this area. The state should provide funding for farmers to transition into new products, as the equipment required to grow these new niche products often differs dramatically from existing equipment. Farmers should also take advantage of the proximity of the Food Innovation Research Extension Center in Bridgeton, which is a partnership between Rutgers University and the NJDA. Farmers can be counseled on how to realize a vision they may have for new operations, or can join an Entrepreneurial Network to discover how other farmers in the area are preparing to diversify into new products and operations. Agricultural Enterprise District Another way to maintain farmland viability in Cumberland County and create investment in rural areas is through the use of an Agricultural Enterprise District (AED)1. This would be a state program, but The Agricultural Enterprise District. Prepared for The Cumberland County Agricultural Development Board. Prepared by the Heinrich Hultgren Team. September, 2001. 1  managed at the County level, by the County Agricultural Development Board (CADB). The CADB must establish the area's agricultural viability, calculate the number of farmers willing to enlist and win the support of the municipality. Those with viable, productive agriculture and CADBs with the staff and resources necessary to run the program are qualified. The district is then designated by the State, County or municipality. Farms that voluntarily apply and meet the criteria can be included in the zone, as well as farm-related businesses. Funding would be similar to the UEZ program. The State would return taxes paid by farm landowners (including State inheritance, income or sales taxes). Alternatively, the county or municipality would dedicate property taxes paid by farmers to the program. Benefits could include:  Grant funding or cost-share programs for individual farmers;  Exemption from sales tax on equipment and supplies used in agriculture production;  Exemption from property tax on single-purpose farm buildings and structures;  Regulatory streamlining for all state and county rules;  Strengthened ""Right to Farm"" protection;  Marketing and promotion of major commodities;  A county link with the Statewide Farmers' Market Line computerized database; and  Job training. This would require action by the Department of Agriculture and New Jersey Legislature.  Transportation Roadways Perhaps the greatest transportation priority for municipalities in the WSCR study area is an improved regional connection. However, there are two significant obstacles to improving any regional connection to Cumberland County: lack of funding, and the perceived environmental and demographic impacts of constructing new roadways. Route 40 and County Route 540, among others, have been identified, as offering the greatest potential for improved access to the region. Business stakeholders have also called for improvements to Route 322.  The Plan - Draft Western/Southern Cumberland Region Strategic Plan December 2003  Page 17   More ambitiously, interest has been expressed in a new interstate highway through the region, from Delaware Memorial Bridge to Atlantic City. Such a study could be spearheaded by the New Jersey Turnpike Authority. In the near term, a greater push should be made for more discrete improvements. In some respects, Route 40 would be easier to improve on-alignment than CR 540, as it has a more adequate vertical and horizontal alignment, and there may be few environmental issues. To make better use of Route 40, however, a southern bypass of Woodstown Borough in Salem County is required. Pilesgrove Township, which would be the site of the bypass, is opposed to the bypass. Further, the Woodstown Bypass was eliminated from the State study and development program, as the State is not making sufficient funding available for larger projects. Similarly, the Route 55 extension to Cape May was also eliminated from the State study and development program due to a lack of funding. State legislators have proposed bills to fund concept development and design of the Route 55 extension. A study to improve CR 540 should be added to the SJTPO Unified Planning Work Program. While it would be more difficult to improve CR 540 to NJDOT principal arterial design standards than Route 40, it currently offers perhaps the fastest route from Bridgeton to the Delaware Memorial Bridge. Improvements to Route 77 should also be considered for the State study and development program. A number of the more critical regional roadway improvements have been clearly identified. At this point, less emphasis should be placed on a transportation needs assessment, and more on securing the funding needed to advance the projects through the NJ DOT project development process. A priority should be to restore Route 55 and Woodstown Bypass projects to the State study and development program. At the same time, the environmental impacts of major roadway projects, whether the Route 55 extension or a new east-west  roadway, would need to be addressed. For any local access roadways in Cumberland, efforts should be made to discourage strip development. In addition to those improvements that enhance access to Cumberland County, it would also be desirable to improve east-west roadways within Cumberland County, especially to facilitate access to Route 55. It may be feasible in the near future to implement needed improvements to a cross-county route, CR 552. This roadway is currently under study by the SJTPO, and the needed improvements have not yet been identified. Improvements to Route 56 should also be considered. Development along key roadways in the future may erode roadway capacity and safety. An access management study could identify actions to preserve the capacity of CR 552, Route 56, Route 77 and other major roadways even in the absence of major physical improvements. An access management strategy would provide guidelines on the frequency and spacing of driveways, and would encourage adjacent land uses to provide internal roadway links. Transit The Cumberland County Improvement Authority has applied for funding for a new fixed-route transit line which would extend from Carll's Corner in Upper Deerfield to Vineland. This will help address the need for an east-west transit line in the northern part of the county; the SJTPO should be encouraged to support this program. Under this grant program, funding is guaranteed for only one year following an award; presuming that funding is initially authorized, funding should be extended for an additional year. The Cumberland County Improvement Authority has received an award from the Federal Transit Administration for a Jobs-Access Reverse Commute (JARC) program. This would support a ""demand-response"" system, in which transit-dependent County residents could request the CCIA van to pick them up at pre-scheduled times. Although typically created to respond to the transportation needs of social service clients, this service could be used to transport persons from their home in more rural areas to their workplace, every day from Monday through Friday, if necessary. Until population density increases in certain areas thus making fixed route transit service more viable, innovative transportation systems such as the use of demand-response transportation should be  The Plan - Draft Western/Southern Cumberland Region Strategic Plan December 2003  Page 18   used to meet the needs of transit-dependent County residents. Funding should be sought to continue and expend transit programs. Rail The Winchester & Western Railroad has been identified as an important asset, particularly for major bulk good companies in the county, such as minerals. The Winchester & Western service could be further encouraged if the State adopted a program similar to that found in Pennsylvania, and helped fund the construction of rail sidings for new industrial customers. The State could also take on a greater share of rail maintenance, over its existing 70% share. Bike Routes Possible bike routes have been identified through the Cumberland County Bike Plan. However, a number of actions must still take place. Roadways that are currently suitable for bike travel must be signed. A bikeway brochure should be prepared. Along with indicating bikecompatible roadways, possible rest stops for bicyclists should be indicated. The County Tourism Department should also integrate the bikeway plans with other County attractions. More ambitiously, the County should evaluate acquiring easements to develop an off-road bike path system within the WSCR municipalities. The Cohansey Greenway would be part of this effort. Municipalities should also plan for bike facilities as part of the circulation plan in their master plans.  public sewer regardless of the amount of discharge. This public sewer service area largely corresponds to the area within the planned Bridgeton Regional Center, and expansion will be critical to realize the goal of concentrating a greater amount of development within the center. Financing the expansion of public sewer within this area should thus be a municipal priority, with assistance from the State and from the US Rural Development Administration. NJDEP has indicated that it will more rigorously screen any future request for needed permits, if this leads to significant growth outside centers. Municipalities in the WSCR should thus review the center boundaries currently proposed to ensure that any area that could possibly benefit from public sewer in the future is included within these centers. Package treatment plants should also be more widely employed in the study area as an ""interim"" measure between septic facilities and public sewer systems, or even as a final measure. Package treatment plants have increased in reliability in recent years, and NJDEP regulations should be more flexible in permitting their use. Package facilities will permit a somewhat greater density of development in centers that could not feasibly be included in a public sewer service area in the near future, while avoiding the health or technical problems that sometimes arise with septic systems. Package plants also have the benefit of returning water to the same watershed from which it was drawn, and thus benefit water supply planning. Additional sewer service strategies include: to amend the Rural District Wastewater Management Area by adding Deerfield to the CCUA sewer service area; to purse the construction of sewage treatment plant and/or pipeline in Port Norris and Laurel Lake and to identify a feasible sewerage treatment plan for Fortescue. Sewer facilities in Port Norris and Fortescue are critical to support ecotourism services in those communities. Water A major issue in the study area is whether development could be limited by the water supply. The large part of Cumberland County falls within Watershed Management Area 17, which was projected by the NJ DEP in its 1995 Water Supply Plan to have a ""dependable yield"" water supply deficit of 9 MGD in the year 2010. Unfortunately, the Area 17  Sewer and Water Sewer A relatively small area of the WSCR study area is currently sewered, with the Cumberland County Utilities Authority (CCUA) being the sole public sewer provider. The major obstacles to expansion of the CCUA sewer service area are financial and environmental. Significant public sewer expansion could still take place within the CCUA planned sewer service area; the Borough of Shiloh and parts of Hopewell, Upper Deerfield and Fairfield Township are approved for The Plan - Draft Western/Southern Cumberland Region Strategic Plan December 2003  Page 19   Watershed Management Plan study which was to have more definitively resolved the nature and extent of the water supply deficit in the area was disbanded by the State. This effort could also have identified the most feasible means of addressing the water supply deficit in the County, if indeed it exists. A critical priority, therefore, is for the State to revitalize the watershed management planning effort. However, a number of actions can be taken to better preserve water resources in the area, even in the absence of a more comprehensive planning effort. Greater use can be made of recycled water and different water conservation techniques. The CCUA plant in Bridgeton, which currently discharges treated effluent to the Cohansey River, should ideally discharge to ground water, and thus recharge the aquifer. This action would be expensive, requiring the infusion of new capital equipment and the purchase of land. This should thus be a priority for funding, with any action to be phased in over a reasonable period of time.  County Park/Open Space Plan Cumberland County is already in the process of developing a County Open Space Plan. Such a plan should explore the possibility of a County park system. It should also incorporate a prioritized list of open space and recreation priorities to serve as a planning tool for state, county and municipal open space and recreation acquisition. Education Cumberland County College is seeking to become one of the 10 new technology incubators designed by the State of New Jersey. Practices that require specialized training, such as aquaculture, are receiving great attention from the County College. The County should promote development of new and innovative technologies, such as solaraquatics and wetlands management. A Food Innovation Research Extension Center has been established by Rutgers University in Bridgeton; to complement this center, food industry technology should be an emphasis at the County College. In addition to the agricultural related jobs and economic opportunities, employment training initiatives should also capitalize on the region's glass making heritage by offering glass training programs.  Community Facility/Services Public Recreation Facilities Intermunicipal/County Parks There is a limited amount of municipally owned parkland within the WSCR. One of the issues identified is a need to develop a greater number of active recreational facilities within the region. As a result, the WSCR should consider developing an intermunicipal park system to help increase the amount of parks and open space within the region. Benefits of an intermunicipal park system include shared costs of land acquisition, park development and on-going maintenance. Shared park systems and services offer the greatest potential for smaller, geographically compact communities. This is particularly true of smaller communities with resource limitations, such as those in the Pinelands or CAFRA region. The Cohanzick Zoo in Bridgeton is one of the prized recreational amenities in the WSCR area, and visited by households from all over the County. This could serve as a test case for shared financial support from WSCR communities, as shared and regionalized services are considered.  Housing Affordable Housing The housing opportunities within the WSCR reflect the diverse nature of the area and the historic development patterns. Bridgeton, as the urban center, offers a variety of generally older housing stock, ranging from apartments and multi-family units to row housing and single-family housing. There are also settlements along the Delaware Bay including both seasonal and year round housing. River based communities in Maurice River Township and other larger settlements in Port Norris, Fortescue, Fairton, Laurel Lake, Rosenhayn, Seabrook and Cedarville provide diverse housing stock in their centers. In New Jersey each municipality has an obligation to provide its share of affordable housing needs as determined by the Council of Affordable Housing (COAH). To meet the obligations, COAH has established affordable housing targets for all municipalities in the State. As of April 2003, only two municipalities within Cumberland County have New Jersey COAH certification: Commercial Township and Vineland  The Plan - Draft Western/Southern Cumberland Region Strategic Plan December 2003  Page 20   City. Upper Deerfield is a `court town' and is currently under litigation. Other municipalities in the WSCR area should prepare or update their individual Housing Plan elements and achieve COAH certification. This would have two important effects: 1) certification would remove the threat of court action that could accompany new housing developments; and 2) it would enable the municipality to receive Plan Endorsement from the Office of Smart Growth. The WSCR should also identify ways for the municipalities to cooperatively address their COAH housing obligations. As one example, municipalities could investigate regional contribution agreements (RCAs), through which the construction of new affordable housing units in one community is subsidized by another municipality. To prepare the housing plans, municipalities should pursue housing grants through the State. Migrant Housing An issue of particular concern to the study area is housing for migrant workers. Although there are no farms within Bridgeton, people working on farms in the surrounding areas have often come to locate within the City. It is estimated that as many as 3,000 to 5,000 migrant workers are housed in Bridgeton every growing season. The lack of short-term rental space creates significant over-crowding, neglected housing and other associated problems. Ideally, the need for updated housing for migrant workers could be addressed through a regional effort involving the County, and municipalities surrounding Bridgeton.  Vineland and Millville. As identified in the Potentials for Economic Development report, there are a number of potential industries that could grow in the WSCR communities with the infrastructure to support them. Among them are certain sectors of the glass industry and food processing. However, large areas of the WSCR lack the infrastructure necessary to accommodate large-scale economic development. In these areas, the primary activity may be agriculture, including nurseries, specialized produce, or aquaculture. In other areas, with scenic vistas, historic structures, bird watching fishing and other recreational activities, ecotourism is an appropriate economic generator. Ecotourism The County produced an Ecotourism Plan in 1996. The County's Ecotourism Plan identifies six themes that build on the county's historic and natural resources. These include marine-based industries and recreation amenities: tracing Cumberland County's Maritime Heritage; boating adventures in Cumberland County; hunting, fishing and crabbing opportunities; birding, biking and hiking; and tracing the natural history of glass in the County. The County has initiated a number of efforts to promote this plan. In 2002, a $300,000 marketing campaign to promote Cumberland County both to the local residents and visitors and investors was completed. However, there is a need to go further to attract the tourism dollars. The lodging expenditures in Cumberland County fall well below the State average. Cape May generated over 96% of tourism related expenditures in the Southern Shore Region that includes Cape May and Cumberland Counties. A goal to increase tourism activity by 20% over the next five years through targeted marketing and promotional activities would have dramatic economic impact on the rural areas of the region. Lengthening the stay of tourists  at a minimum, accommodating a greater number of overnight stays  is a key element to gain tourism dollars. Since Cumberland County does not have major attractions, it will be critical to package destinations together for potential tourists to entice them to extend their stay. The WSCR needs to implement a comprehensive tourism package that will do the following:  Economy The WSCR has been economically stagnant since the decline of its historic major industries: glass and fishing. It has experienced a slower rate of growth than the State, with a higher unemployment rate and a lower income level; indeed, its median family income and per capita income were lowest in the State in both 1989 and 1999. Cumberland County has had success targeting industry for areas with adequate infrastructure, especially in The Plan - Draft Western/Southern Cumberland Region Strategic Plan December 2003  Page 21          Dramatically increase the number of hotel rooms and restaurants, especially along the Bayshore Route and its historic villages; Encourage strategic planning for towns on the Bayshore bicycle trail to focus future business opportunities; Establish a County based website to coordinated ecotourism opportunities and program; Provide strong coordination of tourism events and attractions, both year-round and seasonal; Identify and seek funding for key attractions that will draw visitors to the region, such as a Regional Nature Center; and Strengthen the County Office of Tourism and coordinate activities with special emphasis of the WSCR.  To support these businesses, the zoning should be evaluated to ensure that appropriate performance standards are in place to accommodate ag-industries in appropriate locations. Intermunicipal revenue sharing could serve to concentrate these industrial facilities in the regional industrial parks where infrastructure and services are available. The County College and County Technical School should continue and expand educational offerings to support these businesses. Develop Businesses Which Complement the Region Real estate development in rural areas not appropriate for agriculture or aquaculture should focus on micro-businesses and those that support the growing recreation and ecotourism industry. There is a need to identify financial assistance programs available to smaller business in the rural areas. The Region should look at innovative solutions to support these businesses, such as through the CCIA by establishing a loan guarantee program for micro-businesses that would serve as an incentive for bank lending. In additional, funding to support micro-businesses should be pursued. A pilot program possibly funded through the USDA Rural Development or the New Jersey Department of Commerce should be pursued to support a business assistance pilot project in the CR 553 corridor. CR 553 is the most important roadway linking together the shore communities. To expand tax advantages beyond the limited Urban Enterprise Zone in Bridgeton, the WSCR should work with the legislature to extend the boundaries of the UEZ zone in the county to include the proposed intermunicipal industrial park or similar areas which could include an infusion of revenue and loan guarantees. Better still, the Rural Enterprise Zone, discussed in an earlier section, should be vigorously pursued. Alternatively, sites could be selected in the UEZ for development, but should be coupled with a revenue sharing agreement.  As one possibility for increasing coordination, there could be consideration of creating a Cumberland County Vacation Bureau, consisting of any business that would benefit from increased tourism. This would provide a forum in which area businesses could cooperate and creatively plan to link their attractions or services as part of an overall package. Agri-Tourism As part of the ecotourism effort planned for the Cumberland County area, an agri-tourism campaign should be planned. A brochure should be prepared identifying the farms open to public sales in the County, along with the products sold there, and the days and hours of operation. This could be combined with a list of bed and breakfast operations, motels/hotels, campgrounds, and wildlife management areas. This has worked well in the Skylands Region of northwest New Jersey. Develop Industries that Support Agriculture Food processing, especially small scale, value added processing of fresh foods and aquaculture, including recent efforts in shell fishing and tank farming hold potential to generate limited real estate development in the rural areas. The growing nursery business in the County can spawn spin-off businesses that serve the nursery industry including truck, fertilizer, seed, burlap and other related goods and equipment.  The Plan - Draft Western/Southern Cumberland Region Strategic Plan December 2003  Page 22   The aquaculture industry Aquaculture can support some of the by-products the lengthy lead-time in industry, the CDC should  holds promise in the rural areas of the WSCR. the farming industry by supplying a market for which can be used as fish food. Because of establishing a cash flow in the aquaculture develop an outreach program to local bankers.  Continue Revitalization Efforts The New Jersey State Development and Redevelopment Plan strongly supports redevelopment and revitalization of our urban areas. Bridgeton, the center of the WSCR, has a redevelopment program underway with funding available through the Urban Enterprise Zone and Empowerment Zone programs, in addition to recent Hope VI federal funding for housing and commercial development.  Minnesota Approach The Minnesota approach includes only non-residential properties created after the date on which the program was first adopted. Sixty percent of added assessed values are retained by the community where the new properties are located, and 40 percent are place in the pool to be shared by all communities. This division recognizes that the host community must bear most of the added costs of servicing that property, but also that other communities may also have to bear some added costs. The distributions are independent of expenditure needs. Joint Intergovernmental Agreements Joint Intergovernmental Agreements have been allowed in Virginia, Kentucky, Colorado, Michigan and Ohio through State enabling legislation. This approach permits local governments to enter into a contractual agreement for a specific development, or an area where development might occur. The contract described contributions in terms of services or infrastructure and the revenues to be received from the development. Hackensack Meadowlands A regional commission, the New Jersey Meadowlands Development Commission, controls development and apportions property tax revenue among 14 municipalities. This tax-base-sharing program is aimed at ensuring that those communities that contain valuable tidal wetlands do not suffer financially because the wetlands cannot be developed for business or industrial development. The 1972 Hackensack Meadowlands Development Commission and Redevelopment Act provide the legal basis for the tax base sharing program. Forty percent of the increase in each municipality's tax base over the initial 1970 valuation is subject to the tax-sharing program. Redistribution is based on the number of school children and the proportion of property each town has in the Meadowlands District. All affected municipalities equitably share in the new financial benefits and new costs resulting from the development of the Meadowlands District as a whole. WSCR Revenue Sharing CDC Intermunicipal Industrial Park The Cumberland Development Corporation has initiated development of an industrial park to serve as a revenue sharing mechanism for the Region. Most of the CDC municipalities have relatively limited  Intermunicipal Cooperation Establish Intermunicipal Revenue Sharing Revenue sharing can help in successful implementation of the WSCR plan. It can temper ratable chasing and inefficient, uncoordinated planning. It can also help balance the benefits of development with the less tangible quality of life amenities for which the WSCR is known. The basic purposes of tax revenue sharing are:  To reduce competition among communities for attracting nonresidential properties;  To create a fair distribution of tax benefits from development in each community; and  To permit a `smart growth' approach to regional land-use planning to be undertaken in a rational manner curtailing haphazard and conflicting development. Cost and revenue sharing agreements have been very successful elsewhere. The two most outstanding examples are in Minnesota, where Minneapolis and St. Paul (with seven counties and 187 jurisdictions) entered into an agreement under the State ""Fiscal Disparities Act"" in 1971; and New Jersey, where the Meadowlands are being planned and developed by the New Jersey Meadowlands Commission, a regional agency. Other approaches have been implemented through Joint Intergovernmental Agreements. The summary of these cost and revenue sharing agreements are presented below. Their applicability to the WSCR is then addressed.  The Plan - Draft Western/Southern Cumberland Region Strategic Plan December 2003  Page 23   commercial potential, and the infrastructure and supporting improvement costs of an industrial park would exceed the financial abilities of an individual host community. The proposed intermunicipal industrial park is an innovative approach to revenue and cost sharing. The exact parameters of the revenue sharing approach are currently being assessed. This can serve as a demonstration project of revenue sharing techniques or development policy strategies that could be replicated in other places as a possible answer to problems of urban decay and suburban sprawl. WSCR Revenue Sharing District Through the WSCR strategic plan, it is apparent that other options are needed to help share the revenues of the region. The extent of constrained lands in the Region, the lack of infrastructure and limited accessibility all have established a dichotomy of have and have-nots in the Region, in one of the poorest counties in New Jersey. The need to more equitably distribute revenue and to share benefits was a main impetus for this study. As shown in the prior examples, both nationally and in New Jersey at the Hackensack Meadowlands, opportunities exist to expand approach to revenue sharing looking for unique innovative solutions. Property tax reform, if ever implemented in New Jersey, would help stem the ratables chase for more non-residential development and help guide development to appropriate areas. But it will not solve the revenue disparities of the WSCR municipalities. The nature of the Region, with the unique Bayshore habitat and extensive natural lands precludes significant development for many of the WSCR municipalities. These untaxed lands provide recreational and environmental benefits for the Region and the State. There is a need to balance the areas which can appropriately handle large-scale development  such as in the Bridgeton Regional Center - with the public lands in those other Bayshore municipalities. This presents an opportunity to derive a regional solution, with innovative ways to share the wealth - both in tangible revenues and the wealth of the quality environment. Shared Services The WSCR municipalities have identified the need to reduce costs of providing public services through a shared services approach. Currently the level of municipal services varies for the WSCR municipalities. Bridgeton, as an urban community provides a full range of services to its  residents. Most of the other municipalities have much more limited services. As an example of intermunicipal cooperation, there are limited public works services sharing staff between Bridgeton and Fairfield. With all the towns, there are mutual aid agreements between EMS service providers. As the WSCR area grows in the future, there will likely be greater demand for services such as trash removal, road maintenance, parks and recreation, and building inspection. Services such as tax collection, animal control, and courts can also be shared. Sharing services can help to lower costs and provide a greater level of services to the residents. The WSCR study participants acknowledge that these programs should be further explored. Funding would be needed through the State, likely through the Department of Community Affairs, to develop a workable plan and program for the WSCR. Certain services may be intermunicipal, serving adjacent municipalities or regional in aspect. For example, the need for Animal Control may require that the County or the Region lead the efforts. The only municipal Police Department is in Bridgeton; the other 11 municipalities in the WSCR rely on the State Police for policing and security. Given that the State has discussed charging municipalities for police services, the need to explore a regional police department would be a possible option. Cooperative shared road maintenance agreements should be considered since many towns do not have road departments. The Interlocal Services Act and the Consolidated Municipal Services Act allow any two or more local units to contract to provide jointly any service or function which any one of them can provide for itself. These laws are available to any combination of municipalities, counties, school districts, and, under certain conditions, local public authorities. As noted in the WSCR Region Profile, due to the rural nature of the region, funding for community services, such as parks, is rather difficult. Regional Efficiency Aid Program According to DCA, New Jersey has provided $19.54 million in direct credits to residential taxpayers whose towns or schools have participated in shared service agreements.  The Plan - Draft Western/Southern Cumberland Region Strategic Plan December 2003  Page 24   The funding is being provided through the state's Regional Efficiency Aid Program, or REAP, which offers property tax relief as an incentive for local officials to combine services and cut costs and taxpayers will continue to receive a benefit as long as the shared service activity is in place, as well as credit for any additional actions taken by their municipality or school district. REAP, and its companion program, REDI, the Regional Efficiency Development Initiative, are designed to help municipalities and school districts reduce spending and save taxpayer dollars. Legislation creating the two programs was signed into law in April 1999. (It should be noted, however, that the REDI program was put on hold in 2002 due to a lack of state funding.) The state has devised formulas to calculate the amount of tax relief a specific shared services action would generate under REAP. The formulas take into consideration such factors as the type and difficulty of the shared service, as well as the fiscal stress and population of the community. A tax credit is applied to property tax bills for each calendar year in which the shared services agreement is in effect. Property owners whose home is their principle residence, and tenants in dwellings of five or more units, are eligible for the REAP assistance. Bridgeton Regional Center Partnership To support Bridgeton's efforts and to enable an expansion of the Bridgeton Regional Center to encompass Upper Deerfield and Hopewell, there needs to be a cooperative planning effort undertaken. A Bridgeton Regional Center Partnership should be formed to address issues and needs of the Center in a comprehensive manner. The Partnership should meet on a regular basis to coordinate on intergovernmental issues and services.  As part of the WSCR strategic plan, a planning and implementation agenda has been developed. Funding should be sought to implement the planning agenda.  State Plan Endorsement Obtain Plan Endorsement Status The WSCR Plan will most greatly benefit those communities that follow through with the actions necessary to gain Plan Endorsement. Each municipality must individually approve the WSCR Plan to receive Endorsement. Municipalities should also take steps to ensure that their municipality receives plan endorsement and centers are established under NJ Office of Smart Growth guidelines. The Plan - Draft Western/Southern Cumberland Region Strategic Plan December 2003 Page 25   CENTERS Centers are a key element of the New Jersey State Development and Redevelopment Plan. Centers are defined as a ""compact form of development with one or more cores (pedestrian-oriented areas of civic or commercial uses) and residential neighborhoods."" As stated in the New Jersey State Plan, ""centers are the preferred vehicle for accommodating growth"" for a whole host of reasons. They preserve more land than sprawling development patterns, reduce the number of vehicular trips, support pedestrian activity, and have many other benefits. In some ways, centers actually assume more importance for the WSCR communities than for the much more densely populated municipalities in northern and central New Jersey. In Cumberland County, there is a greater opportunity to use centers to concentrate development, and to avoid the sprawling patterns that characterize so many areas elsewhere in the state. By the same token, a greater share of existing farmland can be preserved than elsewhere in the state. Following is a list of centers for the Western /Southern Cumberland Region. It should be noted that some centers may not always meet the State Planning Guidelines for what constitutes a center, in terms of employment density or residential density. There is a greater amount of vacant land in a number of the centers than found elsewhere in the State. This reflects the historically rural character of the communities in the study area, with modest population bases and sparse commercial services. To provide the opportunity for a reasonable level of commercial development, and for residential development to meet the needs of the next generation, it is important to provide sufficient space in the centers for expansion over the currently, extremely limited development. Redevelopment will not yield the same potential in jobs and housing units as it would in more urban areas elsewhere in New Jersey. Further, the preservation of agricultural lands has been called out as a high priority. The centers can serve as receiving areas to transfer density from the agricultural lands throughout the study area. All centers, proposed and designated, are depicted in Map 5. All proposed centers are depicted in aerial photographs in the Appendix.  Bridgeton Bridgeton Regional Center The City of Bridgeton serves as the heart of the Bridgeton Regional Center, which also includes Hopewell Township and Upper Deerfield Township. The proposed town center of Gouldtown and the proposed village center of Fairton in Fairfield Township are also adjacent to the City of Bridgeton. It is the one urban center within the Western/Southern Cumberland region, and the only municipality in the WSCR area consisting wholly of Planning Area 1. Bridgeton is the only municipality to be completely sewered. Bridgeton contains numerous residential neighborhoods, small commercial centers, an historic CBD, and several industrial areas, including the South Woods State Prison, a major employer. It is also the County seat. The City Park is the largest municipal park in the region, and, particularly because of the presence of the Cohanzick Zoo, a great amenity. Revitalization is a pressing need in Bridgeton, and WSCR communities have acknowledged that economic redevelopment in the city is needed to help lift up the economic status of the entire region.  Commercial Township Laurel Lake Village Laurel Lake is a designated village along CR 670 in Commercial Township, directly below Millville. It lies in Planning Area 5. It comprises one of the larger residential neighborhoods in the region. It also contains a general store, gas station and liquor store. The use of on-lot sewerage for small lots has resulted in septic failures, and improved sewerage infrastructure is needed. Mauricetown Village Mauricetown is a designated village located in PA4 in Commercial Township. It lies along CR 744 and CR 676, next to the Maurice River. Page 26  The Plan - Draft Western/Southern Cumberland Region Strategic Plan December 2003    Mauricetown is a predominantly residential center and also contains several small commercial and community services such as a post office and fire hall It is an historic community, with well-preserved 19th century homes, and antique shops, and fits well into the region's ecotourism theme. Sand mines immediately to the west will ultimately present a reclamation and redevelopment opportunity. Port Norris Village Port Norris is a mixed use residential and commercial center in Commercial Township along Maurice River, proximate to the Delaware Bay, and at the terminus of CR 553. It is a designated village in PA 5. The Commercial Township municipal hall is here, as is the post office, several restaurants and other commercial uses. It is an historic fishing center. With its maritime heritage, Port Norris is an important part of the County ecotourism plan. Public sewer is needed for both modern industries and maritime-oriented tourist services. It has a number of historic homes along main streets in need of rehabilitation, as well as more modern houses.  Carmel Village Carmel, located in PA5 in the south central part of Deerfield Township, is a proposed village. It is the subject of a municipal plan endorsement application to the State Planning Commission. The village straddles CR 552, an important east-west county route. Residential development is sparse, and the village has several small commercial uses, a small school, and a volunteer fire department, among other land uses. Public water and sewer is needed to help support a more concentrated residential population, and to thus accommodate residential development that otherwise might be attracted to outlying areas. Covering an area of 1.17 square miles, with a developable area of .72 square miles, it encompasses a population of 282 and 107 dwellings. Employment exceeds 50. Design controls are needed to ensure its appearance and function as a mixed use village. Rosenhayn Village Rosehayn, located in PA 4 in the north central part of Deerfield Township, is a proposed village. It lies on Route 56, one of the few state highways in Cumberland County. Further, the village is in relatively close proximity to Route 55, the only limited access highway in the County. Its population is 1,143, with 416 housing units and more than 200 jobs. It covers an area of 2.3 square miles, with 1.59 square miles of developable land. It is home to manufacturing/warehousing operations including trucking companies, a refrigerant manufacturing plant, and farm produce processors. It also has commercial firms, including retail sales, a bank, insurance office, and gas stations. Community services include a post office and the Township school, municipal complex and fire hall. Similar to Carmel, public water and sewer are needed to help support a more concentrated residential population. The Master Plan suggests considering multi-family housing in southern Rosenhayn, next to the Township school. Also similar to Carmel, design controls are needed to develop its image and function as a mixed use village.  Deerfield Township Deerfield Township wishes to maintain its overall character as a rural farming community. One of its primary planning objectives is to focus growth into ""the existing centers of Carmel and Rosenhayn or specifically planned areas meant to prevent an indiscriminate sprawl"" (2002 Master Plan). The Township thus wishes to nurture the growth of Carmel and Rosenhayn as vital, mixed use communities. These villages are proposed to be the ""main receiving area within the Township of a variety of housing types at varying densities."" Both proposed centers are being processed separately from the WSCRSP, in a municipal plan endorsement application.  Downe Township Much of Downe Township is covered by low-lying meadows, and by private or state conservation lands. Development potential is minor, and the proposed centers will accommodate future residential growth and limited commercial development in a traditional rural setting. Dividing Creek Village and Newport Village are among the string of historic mixed use villages along CR 553 that have traditionally provided homes Page 28  The Plan - Draft Western/Southern Cumberland Region Strategic Plan December 2003   and limited commercial services to workers in oystering, lumbering and farming industries. Dividing Creek Village The proposed village of Dividing Creek is located at the intersection of CR 553 with CR 555 and CR 676. The village lies in PA 4, with wetlands bordering the village to the south, with some wetlands inside the center boundary. Covering an area of 384 acres, it contains 19 acres of developable land. It has a population of 425 in 170 housing units. It contains some historic homes, a gas station, an historic Baptist church, an old school, and the fire hall. The Master Plan calls for a mixed use center, with commercial uses targeted for the outskirts of the village. The village center boundaries would be consistent with the V-1 and V-2 zoning districts that encompass Dividing Creek. The V-1 district permits homes on 20,000 square foot lots, and the V-2 district on 30,000 square foot lots. There is no public sewer or water, and none planned. Fortescue Village The proposed village of Fortescue rests on the Delaware Bay, at the end of CR 637. It lies within PA 5. It is an old fishing village, and was a popular summer resort. Today there is a residential area, marina, service oriented commercial businesses, and a hotel/restaurant. It has a population of 275, in 396 housing units. It covers an area of 120 acres, with 7 acres of developable land. Fortescue has great potential as a tourist center, and the 1995 Master Plan calls for a community of small retail shops, tourist services and family-oriented recreational activities. The State Marina and a commercial redevelopment area with parking is envisioned for the northern end, and another commercial redevelopment area to the south. There is no public sewer; none is planned in the near future, but there is an increasing recognition that sewer would be desirable to accommodate the tourist facilities. The Cumberland County Rural District Wastewater Management Plan calls for new sewer facilities at Fortescue. These could conceivably take the form of a package plant. The proposed center boundary is the same as the NJDEP coastal village boundary in the CAFRA regulations. By redeveloping a bay resort community, Downe Township will reclaim its heritage and make a valuable contribution to a developing ecotourist strategy that safeguards the area's natural resources.  Newport Village The proposed village of Newport is located at the intersection of CR 732 and CR 637, just off CR 553 at the western border of Downe Township. It lies within PA 4. It covers an area of 457 acres, with 89 acres of developable land. It has a population of 615 in 286 housing units. It has a small commercial area, with a general store and gas stations, as well as a school, fire hall, and churches. It contains a densely populated residential area with large Victorian homes built by persons in the oystering industry. The center boundary would include portions of the V-1, V-2 and I-1 districts around Newport, but not the entirety of any. The sparsely populated areas in the west of the V-2 district are not included, nor is the southern portion of the I-1 district. There is no public water or sewer, and none anticipated. Newport would continue its role as a small, mixed use village with limited residential and commercial growth. Gandy's Beach Hamlet This proposed hamlet is a small residential community on the Delaware Bay, close to Nantuxent Creek. It is in PA 5. It is 40 acres in size, with a population of 196. There is no public water or sewer, and no new development is envisioned. Gandy's Beach would continue as a small residential community. Money Island Hamlet This proposed hamlet is a small residential community on the Delaware Bay, adjacent to Nantuxent Creek. It is in PA 5. It is 46 acres in size, with a population of 101. There is no public water or sewer, and no new development is envisioned. Money Island would continue as a small residential community.  Fairfield Township Fairfield Township is directly east and south of the City of Bridgeton. Fairfield is currently coordinating with the State Planning Commission to designate Fairton as a village center and Gouldtown as a town center. Given the proximity of both centers to the City of Bridgeton, it would be desirable to ultimately consider folding these two centers into the Bridgeton Regional Center along with Bridgeton, Hopewell and Upper Deerfield. Fairfield is seeking center designation to focus growth in these two centers, and to relieve pressure for developing agricultural  The Plan - Draft Western/Southern Cumberland Region Strategic Plan December 2003  Page 29   lands in the environs. Both centers are being processed separately from the WSCRSP, in a municipal centers petition. Fairton Village The proposed village of Fairton is an historic community, situated at the crossroads of CR 553, CR 609, and CR 692. It is an old fishing community and the Fairton Marina is located on the Cohansey River. The village is located within PA 4. There is no public sewer or water, and no infrastructure is envisioned for Fairton in the near future. The boundaries for the Village Center extend from the historic center north to the township border with Bridgeton, with the west boundary being the river and east boundary being the Winchester and Western Railroad. The center covers an area of 1.59 square miles, encompassing 382 acres of developable land. It has a population of 1,935 in 353 housing units. A mix of residential, commercial and industrial uses are found within the center, as well as an 18-hole golf course. The center also accommodates the Township municipal complex, recreational area, elementary school and post office. The village presents redevelopment opportunities with vacant or underutilized properties. Gouldtown Town The proposed town of Gouldtown is an older suburban community centered on Route 49 to the east of Bridgeton. It contains Planning Areas 1, 2 and 4. The center of Gouldtown actually consists of four distinct neighborhoods, with an area of 3.28 square miles. It has a population of 2,332 in 771 housing units, and about 185 jobs. The primary use is residential, although there are commercial uses along Route 49. There are also sand mines in the center, reclamation of which should be an important land use planning strategy. There is essentially no public sewer or water; the one exception is Tips Trailer  Park adjacent to Bridgeton, which is served by the City of Bridgeton. Public sewer and water is desired in this center, partly to serve the new elementary school, and should be extended to support medium- and high-density residential and commercial development in appropriate locations. Seabreeze Hamlet This proposed hamlet is located in PA 5, about seven miles southwest of Fairton on the Delaware Bay. It is a residential community, with a number of housing units strung along the Bay. Fairfield Township has coordinated with NJDEP on restoring the bulkhead in this hamlet. Seabreeze is one of the few communities directly on the Delaware Bay, and could have a valuable role in introducing ecotourists to this ecosystem through the provision of extremely limited commercial services, such as a marina. However, its primary role will be to continue as a traditional, small residential resort community. The center boundary is defined by the Bay with the marsh forming a barrier behind the main road. Seabreeze is 35 acres in size, with a population of 97.  Greenwich Township Limited growth is anticipated for all three centers in Greenwich Township. The center boundaries are drawn with sufficient space to allow transfers of residential density from outlying areas, and thus preserve farmland and a viable agricultural industry in the environs. Greenwich Village Greenwich Village is located in PA 4 in Greenwich Township, on the Cohansey River. This proposed village is relatively isolated, at four miles from the nearest state highway, and from any appreciable county roadway. The village is perhaps the best preserved historic residential settlement in the WSCR area, with many 18th and 19th century houses, and the Teaburners monument. It also has a general store and vital community services, such as a Post Office, school, marina, library and fire hall. It has no public sewer or water, with no installation anticipated. It is 262 acres in size, with 87 acres of developable land. It has a population of 379 in 162 housing units, and about 15 jobs. The proposed village center boundaries correspond to the Historic Conservation district. It also incorporates a small portion of the Commercial Recreation district adjacent to the Historic Conservation district, in order to include the Greenwich marina, one of the important recreation facilities in the area. Page 30  The Plan - Draft Western/Southern Cumberland Region Strategic Plan December 2003   Othello Hamlet Othello Hamlet is located in PA 4 in Greenwich Township, along CR 650. It incorporates several homes, one church and an antique shop. It is 30 acres in size, with developable land of 16 acres. It has 67 residents in 29 housing units, and 10 jobs. It has no public water or sewer, with none anticipated. The boundaries correspond to the Historic Conservation zoning district. The hamlet would accommodate limited residential development. Development applications are evaluated to ensure consistency with nearby historic structures. Springtown Hamlet Springtown Hamlet is located in PA 4 in Greenwich Township at the intersection of CR 620 and CR 650. It is a residential community, with two churches and a small park. It covers an area of 107 acres, with 79 acres of developable land. Its population is 102 in 47 housing units, with 6 to 10 jobs. It has no public water or sewer, with none anticipated. The center boundaries fall within to the R-1 district.  and HCI districts are linear districts extending along Route 49 between CR 621 and the border with Shiloh Borough. As one of the relatively few areas in the WSCR area with public sewer, and extending along one of the few state roadways, these districts are logical places to concentrate higher intensity commercial and industrial activity. At the same time, it will be important to create design guidelines to prevent sprawling development along this roadway. The sewered areas of Hopewell and Upper Deerfield, together with the City of Bridgeton, will likely be the most significant economic generators within the WSCR area for some time to come, so it will be desirable to encourage coordination between these three municipalities within the Bridgeton Regional Center. Roadstown Hamlet This proposed hamlet is located in PA 4 in Stow Creek Township Hopewell Township. The village is a residential center with a building, antique shop and church. It is located at the intersection of 620 and CR 626. It covers 139 acres, with developable land of acres. It has a population of 262 in 102 housing units. and fire CR 103  Hopewell Township Bridgeton Regional Center The central eastern portion of Hopewell Township, adjacent to the City of Bridgeton, is proposed to be part of the Bridgeton Regional Center. The center lies between CR 694 to the north, and CR 699 to the south. The Route 49 corridor, which accommodates much of the commercial development in the township, runs diagonally through the center. The center contains Planning Areas 1 and 2. A portion of the township along Route 49 and directly west of Bridgeton is sewered. The center boundaries are drawn to be consistent with the planned sewer service area of the CCUA. The center within Hopewell covers 4.6 square miles, with 2.8 square miles of developable land. It has a population of 2,876 in 1,096 housing units. Hopewell is predominantly a single-family residential community, although there is zoning for garden apartments, townhouses and mobile homes. Commercial uses such as office buildings and industrial parks are found along the Route 49 corridor, and the Township plans to continue the development of commercial uses in this area. Zoning districts within the center include an Agriculture-Industry district, medium density (1/2 acre lots) residential districts, Highway Commercial Business (HCB), and Highway Commercial Industry (HCI). The HCB The Plan - Draft Western/Southern Cumberland Region Strategic Plan December 2003  There is no public water or sewer, with none anticipated. The center boundaries coincide with the Village district in Hopewell. In Stow Creek, the center includes the Historic Residential district, but moves beyond it 400 feet to the west in order to permit development of a parallel roadway. In Hopewell, the existing Village district would also permit use of a parallel roadway, in this case to the east of CR 620. The Townships seek to maintain its historic, compact character, as a mixed use settlement in the midst of agricultural lands. The zoning for Roadstown in Stow Creek is  acre lots; zoning in Hopewell has not yet been established. The hamlet is intended to enhance and complement the agricultural character of the surrounding lands.  Lawrence Township Cedarville Village This designated village lies Township, and includes PA 4 residential community with a hardware store. It has well representative of the small through the County. There anticipated. on CR 553 in the middle of Lawrence and 5. It is a mixed use, predominantly commercial core, including a bank and preserved 19th century houses, and is historic villages strung out on CR 553 is no public water or sewer, with none  Page 31   Maurice River Township The intent of centers in Maurice River is to focus growth and thus protect environmentally sensitive lands in the environs. Much of the Township is located within the Pinelands. Port ElizabethBricksboro Village This is a designated village, located partly in PA 5 and partly in the Pinelands. It is a predominantly residential community located primarily along Route 47. There is no public water or sewer. Cumberland-Hesstown Village This designated village lies directly on Route 49, within the Pinelands. It has a church, volunteer fire company, store, and residences. There is no public water or sewer. Heislerville Village This designated village lies on a dogleg of CR 616, on the route to East Point Lighthouse, a local attraction on the New Jersey Coastal Heritage trail. It is in PA 5. It has residences, a church, Post Office fire hall, community hall and several businesses. It has no public water or sewer. Delmont Village This designated village lies on Route 47, straddling the Pinelands and PA 5. It has a market, volunteer fire department and steel fabricator. It is zoned as medium and high density residential. Dorchester-Leesburg Village This designated village  really a combination of the two villages of Dorchester and Leesburg  lies along CR 616. Dorchester is the home of the Dorchester Ship Building Company and a small residential community, with a church and volunteer fire station. Leesburg is a The Plan - Draft Western/Southern Cumberland Region Strategic Plan December 2003  mixed residential-commercial-industrial area, with a gas station, post office, and Township building and small recreation area. It is located in PA 5. The village center contains some well-preserved historic structures.  Shiloh Borough Shiloh Village The Village of Shiloh is located in PA 4 in Shiloh Borough, on Route 49. The village center encompasses the residential, commercial and industrial districts, but stops short of Hopewell to the south and Stow Creek to the north, to prevent continual development along Route 49. The center covers an area of 227 acres, with 113 acres of developable land. It has a population of 527, in 202 housing units. There is no public water or sewer, but the Borough would eventually like to have public sewer extended to the community, along Route 49 from Hopewell. The Borough would like to maintain agricultural lands on the environs, and the village center should thus be used to transfer density from this area. It is a mixed use village, with two general stores, a post office, municipal buildings, a bank and several other businesses. The Borough would like to maintain its character as a rural center with limited businesses and mixed uses. Lower density lots are envisioned because of dependence on septic, but medium density lots are possible if public sewer is extended. An important planning issue to resolve in the future is the commercial district along Route 49 on the south side of the Borough, next to Hopewell Township. As noted in the 1998 Master Plan, development of the Route 49 corridor between Bridgeton and Shiloh may eventually distract from the sense of village of the Borough. A rural buffer is called for between the developing areas of the Route 49 corridor and the village center. Further, design guidelines, incorporating parking lot design, access and landscaping need to be applied to the commercial areas along the Route 49 corridor to prevent strip development.  Stow Creek Stow Creek Village A planned village is proposed for the northwestern section of Stow Creek, along Route 49. The center would fall totally within PA 4. There is residential development at the intersection of Route 49 and CR 617, along Seeley Road, and adjacent to Lake Arrowhead. The center also Page 32   has several commercial uses along Route 49. It covers an area of 1.16 square miles, with .86 square miles of developable land. It has a population of 481 in 187 housing units. The population density would not currently meet the criteria for a village. However, the planned village would serve as the focus for future residential development in the township, and would be the receiving area for any transfer of residential density from agricultural areas in the environs. Medium density development would be desirable if public sewer is extended northwest from Bridgeton along Route 49 through Shiloh. The planned village would also strive to build on the small town character already found within the village. Most of the center would include the Residential zone, which permits homes on  acre lots. Provisions should be made for homes on smaller than  acre lots, depending upon sewer availability. A village center district should be established for some or all of this center to promote a traditional mixed use character. Design standards should promote attractive, pedestrian-scaled development. In so doing, the planned village would complement and strengthen the surrounding agricultural areas. Roadstown Hamlet Roadstown Hamlet lies in PA 4 in both Hopewell Township and Stow Creek Township. Its role in the WSCR area was discussed earlier under Hopewell Township.  schools, and the municipal complex. Upper Deerfield Township has seen more development than any other community within the WSCR study area. Excluding institutionalized population, it had a higher population gain from 1990 to 2000. It also saw the greatest nonresidential development, as exemplified by big box retail development in the Route 77 corridor. Significant portions are served by public sewer and water, and all of the regional center falls within the CCUA sewer service area. Initially, in the last round of cross-acceptance, discussion of centers had focused on keeping Seabrook Village separate from the Bridgeton Regional Center area within Upper Deerfield. Increasingly, however, the distinction has proven more difficult to maintain. This is partly because the upper part of the regional center was identified as the most desirable location for an intermunicipal industrial park , and the site would, in fact, extend a little north of the originally conceived boundary, toward Seabrook Village. Further, there are several retail properties on Route 77 immediately south of the original Seabrook boundary. Two of the three uses are abandoned. Redevelopment of these properties are desirable, and would be encouraged by inclusion into a center. A compost recycling site has since built between the two centers. Because of these land developments, it has become less useful to try to distinguish between the two centers. Inclusion of Seabrook village within the Regional Center would also enable the Township complex, the highestdensity residential neighborhood, recreational fields and schools to be within the regional center. The Bridgeton Regional Center area would accommodate the large majority of future residential and commercial development within Upper  Upper Deerfield Bridgeton Regional Center The southern and central part of Upper Deerfield is proposed to be part of the Bridgeton Regional Center. The center spans Upper Deerfield from the northern border with Bridgeton to Seabrook Village. The center includes Planning Areas 1 and 2, and a small portion of PA 4. The center in Upper Deerfield covers an area of 7.3 square miles, with 4.43 miles of developable land. It has a population of 4,505 in 1,762 housing units. Route 77 is the most important roadway within the Upper Deerfield center. The center also includes the western terminus of Route 56; the intersection of Route 77 with Route 56  at Carll's Corner  has been at the heart of much of the new commercial development within recent years. The corridor includes small businesses, banks, light industry, The Plan - Draft Western/Southern Cumberland Region Strategic Plan December 2003  Page 33   Deerfield. It should be used to transfer development from the agricultural areas in the environs surrounding the Center. Several challenges should be addressed in the future with the Bridgeton Regional Center in Upper Deerfield. An effort should be made to incorporate neighborhood-based commercial services in some residential developments. Design guidelines need to be improved to discourage excessive strip development, and to make growing retail and office corridors more attractive and functional. Access management is one means to accomplish this. The Township needs to focus on improving accessibility for pedestrians and bicyclists, especially in the major retail areas. Such accessibility is consistent with centers. Deerfield Village The proposed village of Deerfield Village is located north of Bridgeton Regional Center, at the intersection of Route 77 and CR 540 in Upper Deerfield Township. It is located entirely in PA 4. It is a traditional mixed use village in the agricultural areas in west Cumberland County, with residential uses, a general store, farm equipment business, Post Office, and the Soil Conservation Service Office. It has no public sewer or water, with none anticipated in the future. The boundaries are consistent with the two residential zoning districts and the B-2 Business district at Deerfield Village, although the village boundaries have been revised since originally proposed to exclude preserved farmland that falls within the east side of the B-2 zone.  The Plan - Draft Western/Southern Cumberland Region Strategic Plan December 2003  Page 34   REGIONAL AGENDA  PLANNING  AND  IMPLEMENTATION  A planning and implementation agenda (PIA) has been prepared for the Western/Southern Cumberland Region. Issues were preliminarily identified for the Region through interviews with local stakeholders and review of master plans and other planning reports. The issues were fleshed out in the Advisory Committee workshops held as part of the public involvement process. Strategies for addressing each issue were then developed. The ""Lead"" column identifies the level of government  local, county or state  that is responsible for taking the lead on each strategy. Other agencies that can help facilitate the accomplishment of each strategy are identified. The ""time frame"" classifies strategies by the time needed for their accomplishment, which is partly a function of their complexity. The ""targets"" column denotes the end product of each strategy. The Regional PIA is consistent with the Strategies Report presented earlier in the Plan. By presenting each strategy individually, a clear blueprint is provided for the region to move forward and to simultaneously evaluate its progress over the coming years. The Regional PIA is categorized into many different areas. There is, however, one over-arching theme: maintain and improve the economic and social viability of the region's centers  ranging from the many small, historic villages to the economically diversified corridors stemming from Bridgeton  while providing good stewardship for the area's rich agricultural and natural resources in the environs. The Regional PIA is divided into the following areas: Natural Areas  the Region cherishes its natural areas, which are among the most unspoiled in the State. The protection of the varied natural areas is an important smart growth goal. At the same time, the natural areas should be made accessible to visitors to help maintain the ecotourist industry, and the state should recognize the value of these areas by contributing funds to the municipalities to maintain services. Historic/Cultural  Historic properties are another important resource in the region. If well preserved, they have the ability to stabilize neighborhoods in many centers, maintain community pride and spur the  ecotourist industry. The cataloging of historic sites, establishment of historic preservation commissions, and ordinances can do to much to protect this heritage. Mining  Sand mining has long been a basic industry; proper planning will maximize the potential of mined sites once the mining ends. Agriculture  Maintenance of the agricultural industry is a top priority for the region. By continuing to support farmland preservation activities, receiving equitable payments for farm easements, protecting farm properties through zoning techniques, increasing the value of farming operations through the development of new practices and products, the WSCR area can retain its rural character. In so doing, there will be a clear line between the centers and the environs in the County, particularly in the west side of the county where agricultural uses predominate and development pressures are strongest. Transportation  Improvements are needed to improve access to, and within, the WSCR area. The study area is relatively isolated from other employment centers in the greater region, and it will be easier to attract businesses to fully employ Cumberland residents with improved roadways. Bike and pedestrian facilities are also needed to accommodate residents in centers and attract ecotourists. Sewer/Water installation of businesses, characteristic  Expansion of public sewer and water, and the package treatment plants, are needed to serve potential and to accommodate residents on smaller lots of village centers.  Economy  A multi-pronged strategy is called for to ensure the economic viability of the region's many centers. An active ecotourist industry, agriculture and aquaculture industries, food processing, back office services, manufacturing niches, a healthy retail sector  all are needed to improve the economic condition of New Jersey's poorest county. By targeting programs for low-income rural areas, particularly centers, the State will help make these centers desirable places to live and lessen pressures for suburban sprawl. Community Facilities/Services  Educational levels in Cumberland County lag behind the rest of the state. Improved education, and other  The Plan - Draft Western/Southern Cumberland Region Strategic Plan December 2003  Page 35   community facilities, such as parks, are needed to make the centers more attractive to a wide range of households. Housing  Many houses in the WSCR area need rehabilitation. Housing plans prepared with the assistance of the state will enable WSCR communities to pro-actively plan for low and moderate income households. Intermunicipal Cooperation  Beginning with an intermunicipal industrial park and extending through regional cost and revenue sharing agreements, the WSCR communities have the opportunity to plan in a rational fashion, with the development of land uses in places best suited to accommodate them. Sharing government services will cut costs and make the municipalities more efficient. State Plan Endorsement  By implementing the PIA that has been presented here, the WSCR communities can follow through on State Plan guidelines for enhancing centers and preserving environs. The issues discussed in the Regional PIA are presented in the WSCR Plan Map (Map 6).

The focusing elements of this report include involvement by land developers regarding cases of new land development or redevelopment, in which there was provided funding or other contributions to public bus capital facilities or operations, under circumstances applicable to Florida localities. This report provides examples of the provision of both on-site and off-site bus facility improvements. This investigation included a review of case studies nationwide, and it is believed that most of the information in this report would be of value to readers nationwide. Case studies feature 16 examples from eight Florida counties or municipalities and 15 additional examples from nine other states. 17. Key W ords  18.

It provides from around the country but focuses on circumstances applicable to Florida  This study specifically examined the development of bus transit facilities and services because far more transit systems are exclusively bus transit systems and those that do run rail service usually operate bus service as well. The report first presents information about those mechanisms used currently in Florida localities. The report then presents information on other mechanisms not currently known to be used in Florida, but which are allowable under Florida law and have potential to provide additional funds for public bus transit capital and operations. The funding needs of bus transit systems include capital expenses such as buses and shelters. Capital needs also exist for accessibility features at bus stops, such as sidewalks, adequate right-of-way, curb cuts and pull-out bays; passenger amenities; bus stop signage; and park and ride lots. Operating expenses constitute the most serious funding gap, and private sector contributions for operations, outside a special district, have been infrequent at best. Provided herein are examples of the provision of both on-site and off-site bus facility improvements. This investigation included a review of case studies nationwide. It is believed that most of the information presented would be of value to readers nationwide, though most of the recommendations are placed in the context of Florida. Case studies include 16 examples from eight Florida counties or municipalities and 15 additional examples from nine other states.  Comprehensive Planning and Regulatory Processes Local government planning and regulatory processes provide the framework for empowering local governments and transit agencies to engage private sector land developers to contribute toward the costs of public bus transit service and capital facilities. These processes include the transit development planning process, the local government comprehensive planning process and the requirements contained in the land development code. i   The land development code is the set of regulatory tools that establishes what is required of private land developers before building approvals are granted. A strong land development code starts with a well-crafted local government comprehensive plan (LGCP). The LGCP should provide policies that prioritize transit-friendly land development patterns. It is important that the LGCP strongly and clearly provide the policy foundation for transit development as a part of the land development process, otherwise the implementing ordinances will lack effectiveness. Ideally, the LGCP and the transit development plan (TDP) should support and reinforce each other so that land development and redevelopment occur where public bus transit is able to efficiently provide high quality service. The adoption of an urban service boundary by a host local government is an important first step toward containing and directing growth, and improving the efficiency of public services delivery. However, because the transit service area does not often extend either to the entirety of the transit taxing district or to the limits of an urban services boundary, it can be very effective for the host local government to designate transit service corridors. Transit service corridors are areas along roadways that are served by existing and proposed bus routes. In these corridors, the city ensures adequate roadway level of service (LOS) and encourages site developments that support transit. Furthermore, the city requires on-site access for a bus stop and the incorporation of transit-friendly design, and commits the city to provide improvements to existing bus stops. Predicated upon an LGCP with clear policies, the land development code (LDC) should be kept up-to-date to implement the LGCP. The best LDCs are a balance between providing predictability regarding what is expected of private land development and providing flexibility to enable the best and most appropriate transit improvements. A good LDC also provides the right balance between stipulating enough requirements to help develop good transit service (which ultimately proves itself as an enhancement to development), without being so onerous as to drive land development out of the area.  Regulatory Approaches Zoning This report discusses three different types of zoning: conditional, incentive and overlay, which can facilitate land developer participation. Conditional and incentive zoning are presented with existing examples of their use to secure bus transit facilities. The State of Virginia provides examples of the use of conditional zoning in densely populated counties to support transit. The approach is to require developers to abide by transportation management plans that spell out numerous provisions for public transit. ii   This may provide ideas for local governments as Florida communities continue to urbanize and rely more on transit, as well as for developments of regional impact. Overlay zoning is presented as a future consideration for local governments to apply as a transit overlay zone for bus rapid transit. It also may work well for larger, permanent bus facilities where higher density is encouraged for attracting and facilitating land development. Transit overlay zones may simplify the development regulatory process for getting zoning approvals for transit facilities, such as park-and-ride lots. In Orlando, LYNX is an example of a transit agency that does not rely simply on land development regulations, but provides a Mobility Design Manual and a Customer Amenities Manual, which provide explicit and detailed information to the local government and to the land developer regarding what is desired rather than what is required. The development of these manuals recognizes that the transit agency probably will not get what it wants if it does not ask. Level of Service Mechanisms The report also addresses the use of transportation concurrency, as practiced in Florida, as a means to require the provision of transit improvements to maintain adequate standards for transportation level of service. This study has found that transportation concurrency has almost exclusively been applied to mean roadway concurrency. With the exception of Orlando, service standards for public bus transit are generally not framed within the passenger's perspective. Most commonly, local governments have requirements in their land development codes that ensure that land development design provides access to transit, such as walkways, signage and shelters. However, when the developer cannot demonstrate that roadway improvements will restore and maintain roadway concurrency, arrangements have been worked out for the provision of operating funds. These funds allow localities, such as Hillsborough and Broward counties, to extend bus routes or provide shuttles that connect to regular fixed-route bus service. Generally, the emphasis upon transit improvements is their application as a means to restore roadway level of service, rather than as a means to enhance overall mobility. Transportation concurrency exception areas have been applied in Gainesville and in Miami-Dade County to secure public bus transit facilities. In Gainesville, the City provides specified standards for bus amenities and capital improvements that the land developer must meet according to development size and impact of the project. In Miami-Dade County, the land development code expressly calls for bus terminals to serve multiple routes.  iii   There are some promising aspects to the future application of the transportation concurrency law to engage private sector land developer participation in contributing toward public bus facilities and operations. The 1999 legislative changes to transportation concurrency law provided for the allowable use of multi-modal LOS measures. These measures have been newly developed and issued through the Florida Department of Transportation (FDOT). FDOT discourages the application of these multi-modal LOS measures to quantify the value of trade-offs among different modes of travel; however, ongoing research to further refine these measures aims to enable local governments to quantify such trade-offs. Once local governments are able to incorporate multi-modal LOS techniques into transportation planning activities, then they will have the ability to establish acceptable LOS standards for transit service for locations to satisfy concurrency. Once those standards are established, the basis for requesting the provision of transit facilities and/or operations funding as a part of the land development negotiation process can be established. The primary need of transit passengers is bus transit availability to serve their travel needs, according to the Transit Capacity and Quality of Service Manual, prepared by Kittelson & Associates. Transit service must be available before there can be any discussion of transit service quality, as provided by transit facilities and amenities. As a result, the most important bus transit service elements include funding for bus operations to and from the development site. The emphasis of engaging private sector land developer participation should be on funding the primary service measures of availability first, such as frequency of bus service. In a separate effort to assure transit service availability, Broward County has proposed a transit-oriented concurrency system. The proposal calls for the County to be divided into Transportation Concurrency Management Areas (TCMAs). Each TCMA could either use the new transit-oriented system or opt out of the program and use a conventional concurrency system. A developer pays a fee into the Transit TCMA proportionate to the transportation impact of the proposed development, which would contribute to the funding of the five-year transit development plan. This proposed assessment, to satisfy transit-based concurrency, is envisioned as a ""payand-go"" system, meaning that the developer's only obligation is to pay the appropriate amount to the County. Under a ""pay-and-go"" system, the payment would be made at the site plan stage, when the specific nature of each development is well defined. This would enable a more accurate calculation of the expected impact of each project and eliminate the need for monitoring and enforcement.  iv   Impact Fees Impact fees also are defined and addressed in this report. There are considerable restrictions on the use of impact fees. As a result, impact fee ordinances generally require greater staff time and expertise to administer. As illustrated by the case of Portland, Oregon's service development charges, a great deal of effort goes into calculating the cost of the transportation improvements attributable to each mode of travel that is generated by a new development. The detailed calculations emphasize fairness as a result of a proven precision in the method. Impact fees are a regulatory device rather than a taxing mechanism and so must not demonstrate that the fees raise excessive revenues. Impact fees must meet the rules that were established in the Dunedin (1976) court case, as well as rational nexus and rough proportionality tests. The funds raised from impact fees are limited to use within a prescribed geographic area. The fees must be spent within a particular time period. They can neither be used to address existing transportation deficiencies nor can they be used for operations or maintenance costs. Still, impact fees are an available tool to secure transportation capital funds specifically resulting from land development activities. Broward County is the only Florida county that currently administers an impact fee for transit; however, it applies only to properties that require platting within an urban infill area. These conditions apply to very few land developments. Hillsborough County's impact fee ordinance generates some amount for transit based upon existing mode share. The City of Orlando's roadway impact fee program provides credits to the developer in exchange for providing transit improvements. The 1999 legislative amendments to concurrency providing for multi-modal transportation districts include the provision that ""local governments may reduce impact fees or local access fees for development within multimodal transportation districts based on the reduction of vehicle trips per household or vehicles miles of travel expected from the development pattern planned for the district."" The intended effect is to encourage developers to adopt development patterns as promoted by multi-modal transportation districts. While this will not raise funds for transit, it should have the positive effect of putting appropriate land development patterns in place that make bus transit more effective. Considering this new legislation, there may be a missed opportunity when impact are considered only for roadways and no other form of transportation. While there be a reduction of vehicle trips per household, there will almost certainly still be a for transportation, in one form or another. Broadening our view toward development of a ""transportation impact fee"" might open new opportunities to transit using private sector land developer participation. fees may need the fund  v   Developments of Regional Impact Included herein is an examination of the development of regional impact (DRI) process, with respect to its applicability in engaging private sector land developer participation in contributing toward public bus transit facilities and operations. Development orders resulting from the DRI process tend to secure such features as: ! ! ! ! ! ! coordination between the land developer and the transit agency provision of on-site amenities, per the requirements of the local land development code transportation demand management and transportation systems management activities new route subsidization in the form of a one-time fee or for a specified period of time provision of preferential parking transit-friendly design, including sidewalk access  Aside from the coordinated review among agencies, the DRI process itself does not appear to result in anything more than what would have occurred for a development of similar magnitude with no multi-jurisdictional impacts. In most cases, service provided by the various transit properties in Florida stays within city or county boundaries. In Florida, transit service planning focuses service development where there is likely to be the greatest demand, which is not necessarily where new land development is occurring. As a result, strategic planning for the maintenance and expansion of bus systems may or may not be completely aligned with the pattern of new construction and redevelopment activities of an area, which are controlled by market forces. For example, due to budgetary constraints experienced by public bus transit agencies to support the existing customer base, transit agencies may be justifiably hesitant to spread resources across a larger service area by expanding service to newly developing areas. In this way, there is a critical disconnect between marshalling the transit agency's resources to best serve its mission and harnessing the land development process for transit system development. As a result, transit may be in a weaker position to address multi-jurisdictional travel patterns and impacts. This study reviewed the site impact analysis process that is used to determine the impact of DRIs upon state transportation facilities. With the attention that continues to be placed on developing and refining methods to measure multi-modal level of service, these new methods should be incorporated into both the Florida Administrative Code 9J-2.045 and the instructions for determining impacts as part of the DRI Application for Development Approval.  vi   Other hurdles in elevating the use of public transit improvements to address the transportation impacts of DRIs are: ! ! providing public bus transit improvements that can be demonstrated to specifically benefit the particular DRI contributing funds, and demonstrating that those particular transit improvements cause a mode shift to transit.  Transportation improvements, as provided by developers, must meet certain tests as provided by State law. These tests are similar to those provided for impact fees, regardless of whether a local government has adopted an impact fee ordinance or not. ! ! ! ! The transportation need that must be mitigated must be attributable to the proposed development paying for the mitigation. The amount of the contribution must correspond to the amount needed to mitigate the impacts from the development. The funds must go toward improvements to serve that development. Developers of DRIs cannot be required to contribute funds for mitigation unless the host local government has an ordinance in place requiring non-DRIs to mitigate their impacts. Developers of DRIs cannot be charged twice to mitigate for the same impacts, as in the case that a local host government charges impact fees.  !  These requirements pose special difficulties for developers to provide transit improvements as mitigation for the transportation impacts of a DRI. For example, if a high quality bus service is not in place, then it is not possible to reasonably estimate the need for transit service by a new development. That is unless there is a way to measure latent demand for transit service. As a result, a very low number of bus trips is estimated. Consequently, a small amount of money or capital facilities is estimated to pay for bus mode share. Funds must be demonstrated to benefit the development. If there is an impact fee ordinance in place, then funds cannot go toward bus operations. This leaves capital facilities as the only alternative with bus shelters as the likely choice. However, the Transit Capacity and Quality of Service Manual assigns bus shelters as an amenity and not a necessary element of bus service availability. Bus shelters do not accomplish much if bus service is not available. If funds can go toward operations, it is possible to quantify a cost of bus service to cover bus operations to serve those generated trips only; however, this still would not help if bus service does not yet extend out to the DRI. If bus transit service does not already exist in the area, then it is not possible to pay some incremental bus transit cost. Incremental costs paid by the development must be commensurate with the number of new trips generated by the development.  vii   It is recommended that there be some means to enable local governments to charge development for bus transit improvements. These include the improvements that do not necessarily serve that development, but that go toward bus service development of routes that may be extended to serve them in the future. The contribution should be consistent with the intent to provide transportation facilities concurrent with the impact of development and to maintain a transportation LOS. It also should be commensurate with the mobility demand generated by the development. Trip Reduction Ordinances Trip reduction ordinances (TRO) primarily enlist the participation of property owners and employers, but they also can target land developers. TROs specify the implementation of transportation management efforts that can include public transit promotion. There is generally no limit to what activities are conducted, as long as those activities produce trip reduction results. TROs may be an additional tool that local governments could use to ensure contributions toward public transit. A survey of trip reduction ordinances nationwide resulted in featuring those TROs in this report that were most explicit about providing for transit facilities and operations. The City of Boca Raton has proposed the adoption of a citywide trip reduction ordinance. Special Financing Districts Another tool that has been rarely used but is allowable in Florida is the use of special assessments. Special assessments are fees charged against property within a geographically defined district to finance specific capital improvements or services. Special assessments are used more to pay for new improvements rather than their replacements, are distinct from independent and dependent special districts as well as tax increment financing districts, and can be used to provide public transportation. Special assessments provide an alternative to negotiating with developers to secure financing for new improvements. Financing through special assessments avoids some of the legal restrictions on local taxation and borrowing, which may be more politically acceptable to taxpayers than other sources of revenue and can be used in addition to exactions. Special assessments expedite the placement of infrastructure, which lowers long-term costs of construction. Tax increment financing (TIF) is discussed in this report because TIF districts are rarely established without the commitment of a land developer. Tax increment financing is a method of funding public improvements in an area slated for redevelopment. This is done by capturing, for some period of time, all or a portion of the increased tax revenue that may result if the redevelopment stimulates private investment. The report provides the example of the Downtown Orlando Lymmo.  viii   Non-Regulatory Approaches There are three circumstances under which non-regulatory approaches can be successful.  1. The local government and/or the transit agency, and the private land developer each have something uniquely valuable to offer to the others in the partnership. An example is provided by VOTRAN, the transit service in Volusia County, Florida. VOTRAN enabled Daytona Beach to maintain required public access to the beaches. VOTRAN also was able to offer its own sources of funds that could supplement those of the private developer and the County for a necessary public facility. In the case of Tri-Met in Portland, Oregon, the City did not want to rely on federal funding for a light rail extension to the airport because federal involvement would have greatly extended the amount of time to complete the project. Private contributions enabled the City to accomplish the light rail extension quickly without the use of federal funds, which included bus transit centers, park-and-ride lots, and bus bays. Packaging Portland's light rail system as a whole, the locally funded airport light rail extension project was offered as the local match for the future eastern extension of light rail in Portland. Subsequently, the eastern light rail extension received 100 percent federal funding. In return, the City had the power to grant the land developer the right to become the main project contractor and the right to lease a prime parcel of land near the airport to develop a business district.  2. Incentive programs and negotiations do not take the place of a strong land development code. In the presence of land development regulations, the existence of incentive programs signals to the developer that there is some flexibility in the process. Incentives also show that there is the desire on the part of the local government to negotiate to achieve the best outcome, above and beyond the minimum legal requirements. Incentive programs include density bonuses, lower parking requirements (which also reinforces public transit), expedited permitting, and others.  3. Local government planning and permitting staff have effective negotiating skills. The staff also should understand enough about development financing to recognize what requests are too costly for the developer to accomplish.  ix   Under the topic of non-regulatory approaches, there is also a discussion of future potential opportunities in low-income housing programs. Private land developers can find affordable housing ventures to be attractive for reasons discussed further in this report. Since many low-income housing occupants are also transit users, land developer provision of transit facilities and services could be of significant value for them as well as for transit agencies. It is recommended that the application process for low-income housing projects be reviewed to determine if it is possible to change the rating scale of amenities to reward developers higher points for providing public bus transit access, capital facilities, and service operations. In this manner, the land developer who promises better transit provisions is the one who is awarded the project.  Conclusions This report provides numerous examples of non-regulatory and regulatory tools that could be used to engage private sector land developers to contribute toward public bus transit facilities and services. It is recommended that these tools be considered for use in combination, such as the use of impact fees with special assessments. One further example of a case in Portland, Oregon, using a non-regulatory approach, emphasizes the importance of public pressure to secure a land developer commitment to fund bus transit improvements. This speaks to the potential power and influence of an educated and well-organized community. This may also point to the value to local governments of using available tools, such as transportation management associations, to help educate citizens about the value of a strong public transit system. In this regard, citizens become advocates. The local government comprehensive planning process, the land development code, and the use of incentive programs are existing tools to help harness the land development process for transit system development. However, these are no substitutes for a local host government whose professional staff and executive leadership are allies and advocates for public bus transit and are committed to making public bus transit a priority in land development negotiations.  x   Introduction and Purpose of Report The purpose of this report is to provide an inventory and description of the ways in which private sector land developer participation can be engaged to contribute toward the costs of public bus transit capital facilities and operations expenses. The report is intended to be a resource for local and state governments and transit agencies to learn what other areas have done to secure private sector funding for public bus transit facilities and services. The report focuses on contributions by private land developers for bus capital facilities and/or operations costs as a result of new development or redevelopment of land, with a particular emphasis on mechanisms applicable in Florida. The investigation emphasizes development activities and mechanisms applicable or transferable to Florida for two reasons. First, 11 public transit systems in the state serve populations residing in counties that rate in the top 100 nationwide for population growth, according to the 2000 Census. Consequently, land development activities are proceeding at a brisk pace, resulting in more opportunities to find examples of private sector land development participation in contributing toward the cost of bus transit capital facilities and operations. Second, the study found that Florida is among the more progressive states in the nation in regard to providing local governments with the authority and the regulatory tools to secure land developer participation. However, this investigation included a review of case studies nationwide, and most of the information in this report should be of value to readers nationwide. The report focuses upon private land developer community is in a position to develop property from using transit. Ideally, developers also e development, to develop land in such as way adding benefits. participation because the development in a way that does not prevent people spouse the concept of transit-oriented that maximizes people's mobility while  The report also focuses upon private land developer participation because not enough public funding is provided to support public transit systems. While local governments in Florida have ample taxing powers, it is generally a political reality that local government leaders impose increased taxes as a last resort. As a result of these circumstances, the study explores other funding sources besides taxation, particularly focusing upon regulatory and non-regulatory approaches to engage private sector land developer participation. In addition to the participation of land developers, there are a few illustrations in this report featuring the participation of owner/managers of large private developments. These illustrations were included because these entities may also have the power and  1   the goal to further develop these substantial properties in the future. In one case, a public university was featured as a contributor because many universities (both public and private) in Florida and nationwide are expanding their campuses to accommodate growing student bodies and are engaged in the business of developing campus facilities. University students are a prime market for transit patronage. Public university funds come from a different revenue stream than that which provides for public transit and so the benefit to transit is similar as if it came from private sector land developer participation. This report features development examples that include such existing mechanisms as joint development, zoning, concurrency, impact fees and developments of regional impact. A later section discusses future considerations for interactions between local transit providers and land developers, featuring examples of mechanisms not currently used in Florida but that could be used in the future. These include employment park foundations, trip reduction ordinances, and new processes under development relating to transportation concurrency, among others. Many of the development examples highlighted in this report could actually fit under one or more categories listed. The organization of the development examples is based upon which mechanism appeared to be the key or pivotal element of the development arrangement. For example, if a development is highlighted under the Development of Regional Impact category in this report, it is because the private sector contribution to bus transit was determined by the DRI process itself and not a local government land development code criterion or some other factor. The study focuses primarily on how funds can be raised by private land developers for bus transit, through the land development or redevelopment process. Much of the focus nationwide upon private sector land developer involvement has been on joint development of land adjacent to light rail stations. This is often referred to as transitoriented development. This study specifically examines the development of bus transit facilities and services because far more transit systems are exclusively bus transit systems, and those that do run light rail service usually operate bus service as well. Bus transit capital needs primarily include buses, shelters, accessibility features at bus stops, such as sidewalks, adequate right-of-way, curb cuts and pull-out bays, passenger amenities, bus stop signage and park and ride lots. However, operating expenses are the most serious funding issues, and private sector contributions for operations, outside a special district, have been infrequent at best. This report provides examples of the provision of both on-site and off-site bus facility improvements. Case studies feature 16 examples from 8 Florida counties or municipalities and 15 additional examples from 9 other states.  2   Method of Study The study includes a literature review of transportation planning texts, journals, transit periodicals, TRIS (Transportation Research Information Services) and other sources related to developer participation in providing bus transit facilities or operations. An annotated bibliography is provided in Appendix B of this report. A search also was conducted by the Planning Advisory Service of the American Planning Association. The Florida Statutes and local codes included in the files of the Municipal Code Corporation were reviewed. Internet searches of federal, state, local and municipal governments web sites were conducted. A legal search of Florida case law was conducted to identify any recent challenges to existing laws or procedures relating to land development and its involvement in contributing to public bus transit to identify any existing controversies or issues. The search was intended to find any clarifications that the courts provide in the application of the law. The literature search included a review of Florida Development of Regional Impact (DRI) regulations and processes and the site impact analysis process used by the Florida Department of Transportation. The study also included initiation of contact by email with 290 contacts nationwide, with follow-up by telephone to messages containing useful information. Contacts included staff from public bus transit agencies and land development planning staff from municipalities and counties served by transit. The initial roster of contacts was developed, in part, by identifying bus transit systems nationwide that are peers of transit systems in Florida, based primarily on size. The roster also included transit agencies that were identified through the literature review as being among the best-run transit systems in the nation. The initial roster of contacts also was developed, in part, by identifying those urbanizing counties in the United States that are served by transit and that are experiencing the highest population growth rates, according to U.S. Census 2000 data. These areas would tend to have the greatest amount of new development and redevelopment occurring, thereby potentially providing examples of how transit is accommodated as part of land development. In Florida, 12 counties are ranked in the top 100 fastest growing counties in the nation. These include Broward, Miami-Dade, Palm Beach, Hillsborough, Brevard, Orange, Duval, Lee, Lake, Collier, Volusia, and Polk counties. All public transit agencies that provide fixed route bus service in Florida were contacted. In addition, a request for information was broadcast on three email listservs, including those sponsored by the Institute of Transportation Engineers, Transportation Planning Council; the American Planning Association; and the transportation demand management email listserv sponsored by the Center for Urban Transportation Research.  3   Legal Foundation for Land Developer Contributions This section of the report details the legal foundation in Florida for private sector involvement in contributing toward public bus transit services. The discussion addresses the question of what is possible and allowable in the way of engaging private sector contributions. Florida's Constitution confers strong home rule powers upon local governments, providing them the authority to regulate through the enactment of ordinances and to impose special assessments, impact fees and other means to raise revenue. While noncharter counties have powers of self-government only as explicitly provided by State law, charter counties can do practically anything their electorates allow as long as actions of self-governance are not inconsistent with State law. In the arena of land development, the legal authority to engage private sector contributions for transit facilities rests squarely upon the local government comprehensive planning process and the exercise of police power to regulate land development activities. Police power is a power of state governments to impose restrictions upon private rights for the purpose of promoting public welfare. States can delegate this police power to local governments. One aspect of the problem of transit systems attempting to provide service is that residential and employment sites continue to expand outward into a growing suburbia. For a number of reasons, municipalities may elect to adopt an urban services boundary to improve the efficiency of public services delivery, direct growth and preserve rural areas. It is to the advantage of a transit system to operate in a municipality that has an urban service boundary (USB), also called urban growth boundaries (UGB), preferred growth areas (PGA) and urban development boundaries (UDB). The land development process, which conceptually could provide an increment of funding (or in-kind land, amenities, etc.) with each new land development, has not traditionally been a significant source of funding for public bus transit. Instead, due to the historical reliance on government funding, transit system planning processes have been aligned more with the long range transportation planning process that is required by all metropolitan planning organizations (MPO). Transit systems complete yearly updates to five-year transit development plans (TDP), the information of which is incorporated into the long range transportation plan and funded yearly through the annual Transportation Improvement Program (TIP). The TDP process does not strongly address the relationship among transit, land use planning, and urban service boundaries. Toronto is an example of a place where, unlike Florida metropolitan areas, transit development has strong regional influence, 4   and transit can actually shape development location, density, and attributes. In Florida, transit has little influence on the comprehensive planning process and vice versa. Most Florida transit properties do not provide levels of transit service that could be a major force in shaping the land use planning process. In Florida, transit planning focuses service development where there is likely to be the greatest demand, which is not necessarily where new land development is occurring. As a result, strategic planning for the maintenance and expansion of bus systems may or may not be completely aligned with the pattern of new construction and redevelopment activities of an area, which are controlled by market forces. Transit agencies may be justifiably hesitant to spread limited resources across a larger service area by expanding route coverage to newly developing areas. In this way, there is a critical disconnect between a transit agency marshalling its resources to best serve its mission, and harnessing the land development process for transit system development. This is especially true if land development is occurring in locations where transit service cannot reasonably extend. The Local Government Comprehensive Planning and Land Development Regulation Act, Chap. 163.3161, F.S., not only establishes the power of local governments to control future land development to ensure stable and orderly growth but also requires them to do so. Local governments across the state have achieved this through their planning processes with varying degrees of success. However, there is recurring interest in concepts of establishing urban growth boundaries, directing land development inward, downtown revitalization and sustainable communities. This interest reflects a continued awareness that it is possible to use the local government comprehensive planning (LGCP) process and its implementing land development code to successfully align the interests of transit system development with land development activities. This law states that no public or private development shall be permitted except in conformity with the LGCP. At the same time, all ordinances and programs adopted under the authority of this act must be developed and applied with sensitivity for private property rights. The LGCP must ""...facilitate the adequate and efficient provision of transportation....""1 Municipalities having populations greater than 50,000 and counties having populations greater than 75,000, which are designated within the boundaries of a metropolitan planning organization, must prepare a transportation element. The intent of the transportation element is to combine the planning for traffic circulation and parking facilities with all other modes of travel, including bus transit, into one integrated plan.2 This law provides the potential power of the comprehensive planning process to guide transportation system development. In particular, the law has the power to guide bus transit system development through the land development process. 1 2  Chapter 163.3161(3), F.S. Chapter 163.3177(6)(J), F.S.  5   In addition to land use and transportation elements, LGCPs must be economically feasible as assured through a required five-year capital improvements element (CIE) that is reviewed annually. The CIE must include an outline of principles to expand or increase public facilities as well as principles to correct existing deficiencies in public facilities. It must also estimate public facility costs, and provide for ""...standards to ensure the availability of public facilities and the adequacy of those facilities....""3 Those standards are defined by concurrency, as provided in Chapter 163.3180 F.S., which states that public facilities, including transportation facilities, must be available to provide adequate service concurrently with the impacts from new development. This state law is implemented by local government concurrency management plans as guided by Florida Administrative Code 9J-5. Concurrency management planning directly affects local capital improvements programming and the land development process. In other states with growth management legislation, these are known as adequate public facilities ordinances (APFO). While transportation concurrency has almost exclusively applied to roadway level of service4 some local governments in highly urbanized areas of Florida have used the requirements of concurrency as a tool for negotiations with land developers to contribute toward public bus transit improvements. Conversely, other local governments can negotiate with land developers to contribute toward public bus transit improvements in designated areas where state law grants an exception from roadway concurrency requirements. In these cases, the proposed development must otherwise be consistent with the adopted local government comprehensive plan. In addition, it must be a project that promotes public transportation or must be located within an area designated in the comprehensive plan for urban infill development, urban redevelopment, or downtown revitalization. The 1999 Florida Legislature made changes and added new sections to Chap. 163.3180, F.S. regarding transportation concurrency, which was intended to make the planning environment more favorable to alternative modes of travel, including bus transit.5 The amendments included modifications for greater multi-modal inclusiveness, such as a multi-modal transportation district option. This type of district means that private motor vehicle mobility is secondary and priority is given to development design for the pedestrian with ""convenient interconnection to transit.""  3 4  Chapter 163.3177(3)(a)1-4, F.S. The 2002 edition of the Quality/Level of Service Handbook, issued by the Florida Department of Transportation, clarifies that a more accurate term for the commonly used phrase ""roadway level of service,"" is ""automobile/truck level of service"". 5 The complete language of the legislation can be found on Florida Sunshine Online at http://www.leg.state.fl.us/Welcome/index.cfm.  6   The amendments provide for the use of multi-modal level of service standards when justified by professionally accepted level of service measurement techniques. The analysis should demonstrate that the existing and planned community design will provide an adequate level of mobility within the district. With the emphasis of such developments on internal capture of trips, and given that the legislation is concerned with ""...an adequate level of mobility within the district...[emphasis added],"" the opportunity exists for transit agencies to consider the development of bus circulator services within these districts. The local government comprehensive plan sets the policy framework guiding new development. Land development regulations adopted by a local government implement the comprehensive plan by specifying minimum standards for development. The Florida Statutes (Chap. 163.3202, F.S.) provide specific standards regarding what land development regulations must contain, including provisions that public facilities and services, such as transportation meet or exceed the standards established in the local government capital improvements element. These improvements must be available when needed for the development. Development orders and permits are conditioned on the availability of these public facilities and services necessary to serve the proposed development. The Florida Statutes require each local government to unify its set of land development regulations into one Land Development Code. State law explicitly encourages local governments to use such land development regulations as incentive zoning, plannedunit development, and impact fees, discussed later in this report. It is within the land development code that local governments can specify criteria for the type, amount, and placement of transit facilities and amenities. These requirements are based upon the size and character of the proposed land development. The specifications in the land development code are non-negotiable. Unless a land development code specifies development size thresholds for the application of requirements to provide public facilities, there is no rule of thumb that expresses the relationship between the size of a development and the degree to which developers can be expected to contribute toward public transit. If requirements are not specified in the land development code, then the outcome is based on negotiations. For the largest developments, particularly those that are judged to have an impact on more than one county, a Development of Regional Impact (DRI) process of development review engages input from local, state and federal agencies. Typically, they are only the developments of regional impact for which public transit agencies are involved in the review process. However, it is the host local government that is ultimately responsible. Local governments have the power to decide upon the conditions set in a development order, after consideration of recommendations from other agencies. A well-crafted land development code is at the heart of ensuring that transit facilities  7   are provided. Such a code would reduce reliance upon negotiations. However, requirements in land development codes tend to run the risk of treating developments as ""one-size-fits-all."" This approach raises the possibility that requirements might not suit a particular development, or that minimum specifications actually become treated as the maximum expected of a developer without considering what is most desirable. Public transit agencies rarely have the staff resources to stay on top of the myriad development proposals under review at any one time. It is up to the local host government to advocate on behalf of the transit agency. The best that a transit agency can expect is what a local host government is willing to negotiate. Even in the case of developments of regional impact, in which transit agencies are usually involved, the local government needs to act as a strong and vigilant ally of public transit. It is often the case that the review process occurs over an extended period of time. The development concept may change repeatedly in response to market conditions. Changing conditions may necessitate follow-up reviews for which transit agencies may not have the staff resources. The next section of this report, ""Current Approaches for Engaging Private Sector Involvement,"" presents examples of both incentives-based approaches and regulatory approaches that have been successfully used to secure transit facilities or funds for operations.  8   Current Approaches for Engaging Private Sector Involvement This section addresses options that have been recently used in Florida for engaging private sector participation in contributing toward public bus capital facilities or operations. The options have been divided into two categories: non-regulatory (voluntary) or incentives-based approaches, and regulatory approaches. A national search of case examples of non-regulatory approaches found that private sector land developer participation has been more active in contributing toward roadway improvements, light rail service, streetcar service (also fixed guideway) or private shuttles rather than fixed route public bus service. When there has been private sector participation, the participation has been from private commercial or retail businesses, independent and dependent special districts, employers, or property owners who are not in the land development business. With two exceptions, this study included only those examples in which a property owner also had land development interests. Many mechanisms that potentially support public bus transit work better with the above groups rather than private sector land developers. Such mechanisms include: ! ! ! ! ! cost sharing agreements with private businesses to pay for nearby bus shelters advertising within public rights-of-way transit contributions in return for recognition employer-subsidized transit passes commuter choice tax benefits  In other cases involving public bus transit service development where land development interests are represented, such as in the case of a downtown development organization, it often turns out that private funds are not used but public mechanisms for raising revenue for public transit are used instead, such as special financing districts. In another case, it appeared that transportation management organizations (TMO) might hold some potential for harnessing the support of private sector land developer participation, but the best examples of TMOs were effective because the organization's work was backed up by the existence of community financing districts, or local trip reduction ordinances in response to federal clean air requirements. As a result, a multitude of initially considered case study examples of non-regulatory approaches ultimately fell away from inclusion in this report because they did not address the focusing features of this report, which were:  9   ! ! ! !  involvement by land developers cases of new land development or redevelopment providing funding or in-kind contributions to public bus capital facilities or operations under circumstances applicable to Florida localities  As a result, the examples of non-regulatory approaches are noticeably few. Developers often do not find incentives or reasons to believe that a mutual gain is available as a result of contributing to public bus transit service. However, there are a few cases below that provide some insight as to what circumstances allow for non-regulatory approaches to be successful.  Non-Regulatory Approaches Non-regulatory approaches for engaging private sector land developer participation in contributing toward public bus transit facilities and operations hinge on effective negotiations in order to be successful. Negotiation is a means to achieve positive results for both parties regarding a specific project, within the context of the local regulations. Negotiation is often necessary when the cooperation of several parties is needed and it can be used to tailor a development result. Those negotiating for the municipality must be well versed in development financing in order to recognize what requests are too costly for the developer to accomplish. Negotiation is often laborintensive and expensive. It should not be used for every decision, but for complex situations involving many parties and there should be a defined process for negotiations. Local development opportunities should be such that developers will want to strike a deal and not go somewhere else to pursue business opportunities. The result of negotiations is a development agreement, the requirements of which are defined by the Florida Statutes.6 A development agreement is a legally binding contract between the developer and a municipality. Negotiation can be a way to allow the developer to vest his rights against future changes in the municipality's regulations affecting his land in return for private contributions of public services to the municipality. Incentive programs offered by local governments may be most effective when reinforced by local regulations, in order to form partnerships between local governments and the development community. Incentive programs may provide a reason for a developer to want to negotiate. Examples of incentives commonly offered by local governments include:  6  Chap. 163.3227, F.S.  10   ! ! !  density bonuses lower parking requirements expedited permitting  Joint Development Joint development, from a transportation standpoint, involves coordinated ventures undertaken by the public and private sectors for the development of land above, below, or along transportation facilities.7 Joint development can have a variety of advantages to transit, including attracting new riders to the transit system by fostering commercial and residential projects on and adjacent to transit stations. In some cases, the negotiation process for development agreements can be expedited due to the mutual gains sought by both private and public development entities. Sometimes development agreements provide for sources of revenue for transit system operation and maintenance. Joint development can also assist local jurisdictions to recapture a portion of their past financial contributions. Furthermore, joint development can continue providing operating support by expanding the local property tax base and adding value to available local revenue sources. These opportunities can result in promoting transit-oriented development, reducing the cost of system expansion, and further involving private stakeholders. Development projects that came about as a development code or rather as a voluntary parties had something listed as case studies under this category do not include those fulfillment of responsibilities pursuant to a local government land as a stipulation in an agreement under the DRI process, but and opportunistic arrangement in which both public and private to gain by combining resources.  Daytona Beach, Florida VOTRAN is the public transit system in Volusia County. VOTRAN's involvement in new development along Daytona Beach was the catalyst for economic redevelopment. To secure the commitment of a developer for the expansion of a civic center and an existing hotel and the construction of a new hotel with restaurants, shops and a movie theater, the County had to remove some existing parking and prohibit driving along a one-mile stretch of beach. To restore required access to the public beach, the County needed to build a parking garage and enhance public transportation to the beach. In the meantime, VOTRAN received Section 5309 public transportation funds for capital expenditures from the Federal Transit Administration for the purpose of building a transit hub. The City and County needed the partnership with VOTRAN to marshal the 7  Urban Public Transportation Glossary, Benita H. Gray, ed., Transportation Research Board/National Research Council, Washington, DC, 1989.  11   funds necessary for the parking structure and to establish the Beach Tram Service to ensure public beach access. In return, VOTRAN secured the placement of the Daytona Beach Intermodal Facility within the parking structure, using the federal funds. This established a major transit hub on the beachside and in the middle of a major redevelopment.8 In this case, the transit agency gained locational advantages for a new transit hub in return for providing public beach access and leveraging federal funds for parking garage construction.  Portland, Oregon Bus transit centers, park and ride lots and bus bays resulted from a public/private partnership to build the airport MAX, a light rail to the airport in Portland. The partnership included Tri-Met, the Port of Portland, the City of Portland, and Bactel, a private developer, to fund the airport MAX in its entirety. No federal funds were used for this project. The agreement called for each party to contribute one quarter of the project cost. In return for its contribution, Bactel received the rights to become the main project contractor and the right to lease a prime parcel of land near the airport to develop a business district. In the case of Portland, developers are willing to contribute to light rail service, and less so for public bus service, because there is the strong perception that access to light rail service will make a property more desirable.9  Bridgeport, Connecticut A joint development project involving three areas in Bridgeport incorporated an activist community and an economic role for the transit agency in the revitalization of areas surrounding transit service corridors. The transit agency worked closely with community and business leaders to foster revitalization of these areas. The transit agency received public and private monies to make pedestrian/transit street improvements, faade improvements, and bus stop improvements.10  Regulatory Approaches From the viewpoint of economic development interests in a municipality or region, there is the desire by local governments to attract large employers that will create many high paying jobs. When employers scope out potential areas for relocating, they want three things: a predictable process for moving in, building, and developing their facility; a  8 9  Ken Fischer, VOTRAN, phone conversation, 2/01/02.

Except in the largest urban areas in Florida, such as Miami-Dade and Broward Counties, transportation concurrency is usually not the driving issue behind negotiating transit or even roadway improvements with land developers. Rather, they are issues relating to traffic flow, access and safety. The bottom line is that a local government can impose any requirements it wants upon a land development proposal, including stricter requirements than that specified in the land development code. Ultimately, if the local government's conditions are unacceptable, then the developer can either create a new site plan concept, decide not to develop the property, or locate the development elsewhere; however, the local government usually wants the development to proceed in order to increase the local tax base. The local government must balance this desire with ensuring that any minimum requirements of the land development code are met. The developer wants to maximize profits from the development. Usually, roadway improvements are costly and the developer will be willing to contribute transit improvements if it is a way to reduce local government requests for roadway improvements. Due to the negotiation process, outcomes can vary greatly, even within the same jurisdiction. For example, in the City of Tampa, the development order for the International Plaza shopping mall, which opened in September 2001, required only that the developer build two bus shelters and pullout bays along two highways located onehalf mile from mall property.12 By contrast, when plans were under way to renovate and expand the Westshore Mall in 1999/2000, also located in Tampa, Hillsborough Area Regional Transit (HART) feared that they would lose a bus transfer location on mall property. However, the developer rebuilt a higher quality transfer center with access through the parking garage (a totally covered walk for bus riders), which provided the same level of access to the mall as exists for people parking their cars. This included a three-bus bay transit center with loading area, landscaping, and a bus stop. The developer also funded one third of the cost of bus shelters, totaling $21,000.13 The Florida Department of Transportation exercises much stricter control regarding specifications for roadway improvements on state roads, but has no control regarding on-site issues. Local governments can negotiate with land developers regarding on-site 11  Notes from speech by John Dawsman, former Economic Development Director for Hillsborough County, given at the 6th Annual Impact Fee Roundtable 2000, November 15-17, Tampa, Florida. 12 Ed Crawford, Hillsborough Area Regional Transit, phone conversation, 10/9/02. This development received an extraordinary amount of public criticism over the lack of bus service, which opened the door to renewed negotiations. The issue was covered by an August 30, 2001 article in the Tampa Tribune and two articles in the St. Petersburg Times, dated September 3 and September 6, 2001. 13 Sharon Dent, Executive Director, Hillsborough Area Regional Transit, email communication, 2/20/02.

For example, if the land development code specifies maximum floor area ratios (FAR) for a development in a particular zoning classification, it is the local government's prerogative to offer the developer an increase in FAR (which could make the development more profitable) in return for other design features, amenities, or contributions. Ultimately, the end result varies widely from one locality to another, depending upon what the local government wants. Local Land Development Regulations Nationally, land development regulations (LDR) for a municipality usually include, at a minimum, a zoning ordinance and a subdivision ordinance and specify what a developer must do in order to receive a Certificate of Occupancy. As outlined in the earlier section on the ""Legal Foundations for Private Sector Contributions,"" the local government comprehensive planning process has the power to guide transit-friendly development patterns. It also has the power to support public transit, as demonstrated by the capital improvements element. Local ordinances that guide land development, also known as land development regulations or the land development code, also provide the foundation to engage private sector land developers to contribute to public bus transit capital facilities and operations costs. All local ordinances must be consistent with the local government comprehensive plan (LGCP). These ordinances include zoning, subdivision, and impact fee ordinances and adequate transportation facility regulations that set level of service standards. They must serve as implementing tools of the LGCP. Therefore, it is important that the LGCP strongly and clearly provide the policy foundation for transit development as a part of the land development process, otherwise the implementing ordinances will lack effectiveness. Identification of public transportation corridors is one way to establish the expectation, as provided by the LGCP, that contributions toward public bus transit facilities will be a condition of land development. The Transportation Element of the Comprehensive Plan for the City of Port Orange, Florida, provides an example of clear policies that support transit development. Excerpts from this document are included in Appendix A of this report. One of the most important features of the policies in the Port Orange Transportation Element is the identification of ""public transportation corridors."" These are areas along roadways that are served by existing and proposed bus routes. Along these corridors, the City ensures adequate roadway level of service, encourages site developments that support transit, requires on-site access for a bus stop and the incorporation of transit-friendly design, and commits the City to provide improvements to existing bus stops.  14   The land development code implements and carries out the intent of the LGCP; however, not all land planning policies are or can be necessarily translated into effective land development regulations. At best, land development regulations are instruments that ensure a minimum result and that do not always capture the nuances of good land planning. They are difficult to craft in a way that promotes the best possible outcome for all parties. The best results are more likely to come about if all parties work together to achieve a result that represents what is best for the locality as a whole. This is difficult to achieve because the developer wants a maximum return on that particular property investment and the public sector wants to minimize adverse impacts. The collaborative effort also takes more time and planning staff expertise than a locality can often afford. Therefore, the minimum standards imposed by the LDC often reflect the final outcome. The advantage of providing specifications in the LDC is that they lend some degree of certainty about minimum expectations of the developer and a starting point for negotiations in jurisdictions that have conditional zoning. LDRs can specify standards for transit accessibility, such as providing a location and construction of bus stops and the development of a sidewalk system that provides easy access from the development to transit stops. A transit amenities survey of Regional Transit System (RTS) bus riders in Gainesville was conducted, which found that the presence of a bus shelter and bench were considered to be the most important bus stop amenities.14 The Florida Statutes explicitly encourage local governments to use such LDRs as tax increment financing, incentive zoning, planned-unit development (conditional zoning), and impact fee ordinances. Tax Increment Financing (TIF) Tax increment financing (TIF) harnesses public money, but this mechanism is included in this report because TIF districts are rarely established without the commitment of a land developer. Tax increment financing is a method of funding public improvements in an area slated for redevelopment. This is done by capturing, for some period of time, all or a portion of the increased tax revenue that may result if the redevelopment stimulates private investment. TIF bonds are a financing option that does not count against a municipality's bonded indebtedness. The TIF is financed by subsidizing one city's developments with taxes from another municipal taxing authority. For example, sources of money for contributing to the TIF fund include city property taxes, county property taxes, school district taxes and sales taxes. No state or federal funds go to TIFs. Typically, a redevelopment agency is established to oversee the TIF district. The redevelopment agency solicits developers to perform the public improvements. Developers generally  14  Dr. Linda B. Crider.

The tax increment is diverted to an established redevelopment agency or a fund earmarked for retiring the debt on the project. The State must have enabling legislation and sometimes a constitutional amendment allowing TIFs. At least 33 states, including Florida, allow TIFs of some kind. Permitted activities for TIF projects can include providing infrastructure. Proceeds are only to be used in the TIF area. Other bonds that can be used are general obligation bonds, lease-revenue bonds, industrial revenue bonds, and special assessment or other municipal improvement bonds. The feasibility of TIFs is difficult to determine because it is based upon economic projections, market analysis, and appraisals.  Orlando, Florida The Downtown Orlando Lymmo is financed by a Tax Increment Trust Fund of the Orlando Community Redevelopment Agency. The Lymmo, established in 1997, is a free downtown bus service that can deliver passengers within a block of any downtown location in 10 minutes or less. Lymmo is a service provided by the Central Florida Regional Transportation Authority (LYNX). The Community Redevelopment Agency (CRA) was set up to pursue revitalization activities within a designated Redevelopment Area, with one emphasis to address long-term transportation needs. The CRA is a part of the City Downtown Development Board, which was created by a special act of the Legislature in 1971 and is guided by an advisory board. Zoning Zoning is a police power that a City or County uses to divide (zones) for which particular land development regulations specify allowable uses for property and regulates land use building density, building placement and setbacks, and other different types of zoning described here. land into areas or districts apply. Each zone may features such as lot size, standards. There are two  Incentive Zoning Incentive zoning provides the opportunity for private developers to voluntarily donate funds for public amenities in exchange for development advantages, such as opportunities to save or make money. Incentive zoning provides flexibility in planning for a land development by granting the developer additional development capacity in exchange for providing specified public facilities, benefits or amenities that the local government seeks. Traditionally, these facilities have included public plazas, open  16   space, or affordable housing, but the local government can also use this tool for transit facilities. The use of incentive zoning for transit has more often been applied to light rail. For example, the Minneapolis zoning code contains provisions for granting floor area ratio (FAR) bonuses in exchange for the construction of transit stations at light rail stops according to standards as specified in the zoning code. However, similar incentives might work when applied to developments near premium bus service corridors.  Orlando, Florida Orlando's Land Development Code provides for bonuses to developers who set aside at least one percent of the total construction costs for the development and contribute this to the city. The City will use these funds in accordance with an adopted comprehensive mass transit facilities program, to provide access to mass transit services appropriate to the type of activity center in which the development is located. Bonus parking spaces also are available for a contribution to the mass transit fund.  Rosslyn, Virginia The Rosslyn bonus program provides that additional floor area can be granted in exchange for not only urban design benefits but also for off-site amenities and economic development benefits.15 Rosslyn is located in Arlington County, in proximity to downtown Washington, D.C., Georgetown, and federal employment centers. New zoning regulations for Rosslyn were adopted in 1996, which established the base density in the downtown at a 3.8 floor area ratio (FAR), which made most development subject to the site plan review process. Through this process, additional density (referred to as bonuses or premiums) is granted to the developer in exchange for providing public amenities. These have included connections of high-density development to transit stations of the Washington Metro Area Transit Authority. Density bonuses can also be granted to developers in exchange for cash contributions to the Rosslyn Fund. The Rosslyn Fund provides community benefit improvements in Rosslyn from payments made by developers. The fund could be used for transit though it has not been to date. Transit in Rosslyn is primarily the Metro subway system, which was developed before the Rosslyn Fund was created. The Fund has been used for improvements to a performance theater and for design services. A small sum ($25,000) was contributed to  Marya Morris, Incentive Zoning: Meeting Urban Design and Affordable Housing Objectives, Planning Advisory Service Report Number 494, American Planning Association, Chicago, September 2000.  15  17   a shuttle service between Rosslyn and Georgetown in Washington, DC, which began in September, 2001.16  Conditional Zoning A conditional use district is one in which a permit to develop is issued only when certain conditions are met, in exchange for allowing a use of the property not otherwise applicable to land similarly zoned. The attachment of special conditions upon a development by a local government allows for a rezoning of the property that makes the property more profitable. Conditional zoning is often used in dense central cities and in growing suburban areas. Examples of uses that may be subject to conditions are those that attract a lot of people, or may create traffic congestion or noise, place burden on infrastructure or cause some adverse effect to public welfare or safety. These include schools, churches, hospitals, assisted living facilities, clubs, open-air recreation facilities and shopping centers. Specific conditions might include access requirements or the placement of transit-oriented design requirements. Conditional zoning is also applied in the form of planned unit developments (PUD). PUDs exist where there are PUD ordinances or enabling provisions in subdivision ordinances. PUDs are a method of residential development in which an area within a specified minimum contiguous acreage is developed as a single entity. The plan for the PUD contains one or more residential clusters in which lot area, setback and height restrictions may be waived and which may include commercial, public or quasi-public uses for the primary benefit of the residential development.17  Orlando, Florida The City of Orlando encourages transit-oriented design by placing conditions on development when possible. Equally important, Orlando's Land Development Code includes standards similar to LYNX's Mobility Design Guidelines for developing in a transit-friendly manner. The Mobility Design Guidelines are helpful to the city staff who review new developments and who can place conditions on development. The Central Florida Mobility Design Manual18 includes a mobility design checklist for use by architects, planners, and engineers when creating a site plan. The checklist covers, among other things, transit circulation, transit stop and terminal design, building Betts Abel, Arlington County Public Affairs Department.

The Guidelines are applicable during the stages of land development that involve the subdivision of large parcels, the site planning stage, and the final stages prior to issuance of a building permit and certificate of occupancy. LYNX also provides the Customer Amenities Manual19 that provides detailed guidance for the design of bus passenger amenities. In some cases, private developers are required to provide property easements to accommodate the most appropriate and beneficial transit stop and install improvements within the road right-of-way as a condition of approval of their development. For example, the developer for the Colonial Town Center in Orlando provided land for a ""Super Stop"" bus shelter close to major stores. There are five types of bus stops based on the number of daily passengers and the number of routes served. Each of the five is located within a certain land use classification. The Super Stop serves neighborhood focal points and community centers and is located near parks, activity centers, schools, government centers, and shopping centers. The Super Stop consists of multiple covered shelters with seating, bus staging lanes or bus bays, bike storage, landscaping, information kiosk, trash receptacles, telephones, and a water fountain. The land for the Colonial Town Center Super Stop was negotiated as a 20-year lease at no cost to LYNX and was required by the Orlando Planning Department before permitting began. The results of the negotiation process were advantageous to LYNX because of the location of Colonial Town Center, which is important as a transfer location for routes.  Counties in Virginia Several examples are provided here regarding the use of conditional zoning in Virginia. These include examples of highly urbanized areas where entire transportation management plans are required of the developer as a condition of development approval.  Fairfax County--Fairfax County refers to their conditional zoning as a ""proffer system"", a system in which developers agree to provide public facilities necessary to meet local standards in exchange for an advanced date of project approval. The Virginia state legislature granted Fairfax County and other counties broad conditional zoning power in the early 1970s. The proffer system coordinates transportation development decisions among private developers, planners with the state department of transportation, and local land use planners. Conditional zoning allows local government to make approval of rezoning contingent upon the receipt of proffers from the party seeking the rezoning. Customer Amenities Manual, Central Florida Regional Transportation Authority (LYNX), prepared by Herbert Halback and Associates, Inc., 2000. 19  19   Although historically, proffers have been used largely for on-site improvements, they can also be used for off-site improvements, such as schools, sewers, roads, and transit improvements. Proffers have that may not contributions. dedications or construction. rezoning.20 the advantage of providing flexibility in resolving site-specific problems be addressed easily under general formula approaches to developer The use of proffers often results in time savings in the case of direct land developer construction of facilities rather than public acquisition or Proffers can only be sought for facilities that are required by the  Prince William County--Another example is Prince William County, located in the Washington, D.C. area. The County transportation department encourages private land developers to proffer conditions above and beyond those normally required. These conditions are intended to mitigate impacts resulting from the proposed use of the land. Proffer statements are reviewed as a part of the rezoning application, and are accepted by the Board of County Supervisors with its approval of a rezoning application. Proffers from private land developers have included those for transit improvements, such as the construction of bus shelters, the provision of commuter lots, and the provision of bus or shuttle service within large developments. Arlington County--Commonwealth Atlantic Properties proposed a redevelopment plan for Potomac Yard in Arlington consisting of 2.9 million square feet of office and commercial space and 1.4 million square feet for residential and hotel use. The plan also includes new streets, parks, and other amenities that are intended to make the development an attractive, coherent whole. As a condition of development, the developer agreed to a transportation management plan that implements transportation demand management (TDM) and transportation systems management (TSM) strategies designed for the purpose of achieving a transit/bike/walk mode share of 40 percent. Requirements of the plan included access to the CommuterPage.com web site. The web site is a service of the Arlington County Commuter Assistance Program. The web site contains commuter service information, including complete transit system information for the more than seven public transit systems serving the area, as well as private transit systems. Requirements of the plan also included provision of space and build-out of a small transit store, installation of $30,000 worth of electronic kiosks providing access to transit information and a contribution of $75,000 each for the purchase of two new Arlington Transit buses to enable extension and enhancement of the development's transit services.  20  Robert D. Vander Lugt and Salil Virkar, Coordination of Transportation Planning and Land Use Control: A Challenge for Virginia in the 21st Century, Virginia Transportation Research Council, Charlottesville, June 1991.  20   The transportation management plan also called for coordinated parking management, which included the provision of reserved, conveniently located and free vanpool parking spaces, and daytime parking for commuter buses serving the office uses in the development. The parking plan also called for single occupant vehicle parking only at fair market rates. The transportation management plan is required to be coordinated with the Arlington County Commuter Assistance Program, to which the developer was required to provide a contribution. The developer was also required to contribute to the Metrochek Match Employer Incentive Program, which provides a cash incentive for employers to subsidize transit passes for employees. The transportation management plan also required the developer to devise and implement, in coordination with the County, a local transit service plan to provide high quality transit service to the site prior to the completion of a planned transitway. As a part of site plan conditions, there also was the requirement for the contribution of right-of-way for a transitway. The transitway is a corridor shared by transit systems and which excludes other vehicular traffic. All land adjacent to the transitway was required by the site plan conditions to be developed according to adopted Urban Design Guidelines and consistent with the Transit Corridor Plan. The site plan conditions also required the developer to pay the cost of interim and permanent improvements in the median strip between the transit corridor and the street. In addition, the developer was required to pay a transit station contribution, equaling $0.10 per square foot of gross floor area represented in the final site plan, for transit stations and related improvements consistent with the Transit Corridor Plan. This contribution would go toward the installation of transit stations and shelters outside of the transit corridor to serve the buildings within the Potomac Yard development. The developer was also required to install initial transit stations and shelters serving the existing transit system before the transit way was completed.21  Arlington County--In another location in Arlington County, plans for the Crystal Mall and Plaza, providing retail and office space, also required the developer to devise a transportation management plan (TMP) as a condition of development. The TMP required the developer to provide for the relocation of a bus stop and staging areas to a Metrorail Station, including a minimum of four full-size active bus stops, including seats, signage, upgraded lighting, wider sidewalks, saw-tooth stop configuration, paint and striping, special pavement treatments for pedestrian crosswalks, and landscaping enhancements, all with a total cost not to exceed $300,000. The developer also was required to provide the following:  21  Potomac Yard Transportation Management Plan, as provided by James Hamre, Arlington County, VA.  21   ! ! !  ! ! !  ! ! !  !  public restrooms for use by bus drivers within 600 feet of the relocated bus stop one bus/van carpool shelter installed within Crystal City to replace an existing bus layover area two electronic transportation information displays providing public access to transit information and to the CommuterPage.com web site or payment of an inlieu fee of $10,000 assurance that building facades will not interfere with or preclude the option for a planned transitway along the adjacent access drive cooperation with future efforts to establish a special transportation district in Crystal City establishment of monthly parking rates for single occupant vehicles that are consistent with comparable office buildings located in the Arlington County development corridors conveniently located parking spaces for ridesharing vehicles payment of $24,000 or provision of free office space for the Crystal City Commuter Store for two years maintenance of an active membership with Arlington Transportation Partners (ATP), a local transportation management association, on behalf of the property management team provision of transit promotional services such as a new-tenant package to include site-specific transit-related information, transit information as part of recruiting and employment materials, and a transit advertising program for distributing transit information to tenants and employees four times per year  Level of Service Mechanisms The discussion below summarizes the existing use of level of service measures and standards for enlisting land developer participation in contributing toward bus facilities and operations.  Concurrency and its Application The keystone of growth management in the State of Florida is the concept of concurrency, as provided in Chapter 163.3180 F.S., which states that public facilities, including transportation facilities, must be available to provide adequate service concurrently with the impacts from new development. In other states with growth management legislation, these are known as adequate public facilities ordinances (APFO). This state law is implemented by local government concurrency management plans as guided by Florida Administrative Code 9J-5. Concurrency management planning directly  22   affects local capital improvements programming and the land development process. It is typically in the most urbanized counties, such as Miami-Dade and Broward Counties, that concurrency is the driving issue behind negotiating roadway or transit improvements. Then local governments can negotiate aggressively for such things as operating subsidies to extend bus routes. Florida's concurrency law, as originally written for transportation, has been almost exclusively applied to mean roadway concurrency. Over the years, roadway concurrency has changed gradually to provide local governments with more flexible options, such as: ! ! ! Transportation concurrency exception areas (TCEA) for ""projects that promote public transportation""; Transportation concurrency management areas (TCMA) that can incorporate viable alternative travel modes; and Exclusions for public transportation facilities from having to meet roadway concurrency requirements.  There are now established methods for measuring level of service for bus transit, bicycle and pedestrian modes of travel. Nonetheless, for the purposes of meeting transportation concurrency, the available methodologies currently in use for measuring level of service (LOS), as well as Florida's statewide minimum LOS standards and the LOS standards adopted by local governments have been almost exclusively roadway LOS standards. Maintaining these roadway LOS standards has been the basis upon which local governments make arrangements with private sector land developers to pay the costs of transportation improvements.  Lee County, Florida More commonly, Florida municipalities provide standards in their land development codes for the provision of access to public transit rather than service standards. The Lee County Land Development Code provides an example of this, in which public transit facilities include paved walkways, signage, and shelters.22 These are all physically fixed capital facilities, comparable to roadway through lanes, turn lanes and traffic signals. Typically, if land developers do provide public transit facilities, based on conditions in the development order, they will be fixed capital facilities, such as sidewalks and shelters, which provide physical access from the new development to public transit service. After the development is complete, the land developer often leaves. As a result, the provision of capital facilities is attractive to the municipality because it has lasting value. The provision of capital facilities is attractive to the developer because it requires no ongoing commitment. 22  Lee County Land Development Code. Sections 10-441 through 10-443. See also the Hillsborough County Land Development Code. Site Development Design Standards. Sections 6.03.00-01.  23   Orlando, Florida The City of Orlando Growth Management Plan (the comprehensive plan) provides an example of public transit policies that incorporate transit level of service standards that are based upon quality of service from the passenger perspective. Objective 1.13 states that the City will prioritize transit headway improvements along designated transit corridors throughout the planning period, with 59 percent of the designated transit service corridors within the Transportation Concurrency Exception Area (TCEA) maintaining or improving a 30-minute weighted average headway by 2005.23 Policy 3.3.5 states that the first priority for funding transit improvements shall be based upon improving headways on existing routes.24  Hillsborough County, Florida In 1999, Hillsborough County determined that roadway concurrency would not be met with road improvements made to mitigate traffic from The Preserve, a large residential development in the Hidden River area. To meet concurrency requirements, the developer entered into an escrow agreement with Hillsborough County Regional Transit (HART), in which $10,000 was paid into an account utilized to pay for bus service extension to the area. HART has ten other similar agreements for paying for bus service.25 This arrangement can be very useful to initiate bus service to see if the ridership exists to continue the service but it does not provide a means to maintain the service. As in the case of the Hidden River area, businesses along Hidden River Parkway offered no support to provide funds to maintain the service. Ridership was low and as a result, bus service was discontinued in December 2001.  Broward County, Florida Broward County Transit (BCT) has several contracts with cities for providing community shuttles through developer funding. Two such developments that provided for shuttle services are described below, as part of development agreements. These agreements, entered into with the Cities of North Lauderdale and Pembroke Pines, represented cases in which the shuttle service was successful for the purpose of meeting concurrency requirements only because there were a small amount of trips to mitigate. A third development is a development of regional impact that is not yet finalized and is, as of this writing, in the stage between the assessment by the regional planning council 23 24 25  City of Orlando. Transportation Element, p. 14. City of Orlando. Transportation Element, p. 26. Les Weakland, Senior Planner, Hillsborough Area Regional Transit. Phone conversation, 2/20/02.  24   and the Development Order stage. The Lightspeed DRI is located at the Cypress Creek Tri-Rail Station, and involves the Cities of Ft. Lauderdale and Oakland Park. The DRI includes the location of a mixed-use development at a park and ride lot owned by the Florida Department of Transportation. The developer originally claimed a mode split rate that indicated high transit usage. The County did not see that such a high rate was justified. The County worked out an arrangement with the developer to commit to funding a shuttle to justify the rate. Currently, there are shuttles running during the morning and evening peak hours when Tri-Rail is in service. The developer will fund a shuttle to continue to run between the morning and evening peak times, so that the shuttle is running throughout the day.  North Lauderdale--The Broward County Development Management Division issued to two developers, Notifications of Failure to Satisfy Broward County Concurrency Standards for the regional transportation network. The proposed developments involved the establishment of a cemetery and an industrial facility. The notices indicated that the applications for approval of the plats did not satisfy the concurrency standards for the regional road network, as defined in the Broward County Land Development Code. As a result, Broward County entered into an agreement in which the two developers will provide a three-year contribution toward the maintenance, operation, and equipping of a community bus service. The County agreed to lease a vehicle to the City of North Lauderdale to operate the service. This agreement will mitigate the traffic impacts to the two plats so that the plats will satisfy Broward County concurrency standards. The two developers agreed to pay a share of the cost proportionate to each plat's traffic impact, totaling $159,600. The shuttle will provide free fixed-route service to connect with regular County bus routes. The service will be offered five days per week for a minimum of 40 hours per week. The City agreed to operate the service, while the County agreed to provide drivers, transit planning assistance, printed bus route timetables, and signposts.  Pembroke Pines--Similarly to the North Lauderdale situation above, the Broward County Development Management Division issued Notifications of Failure to Satisfy Broward County Concurrency Standards for the regional transportation network to the City of Pembroke Pines for a plat for a charter school and to the South Broward Hospital District for a hospital. The notices indicated that the applications for approval of the plats did not satisfy the concurrency standards for the regional road network, as defined in the Broward County Land Development Code. As a result, Broward County entered into an agreement with the South Broward Hospital District (SBHD) that the SBHD would provide a three-year contribution toward the maintenance, operation, and equipping of a community bus service. The County agreed to lease two vehicles to the City of Pembroke Pines to operate the service. This agreement will partially mitigate the traffic impacts of the hospital plat so that the plats will satisfy Broward County concurrency standards. The SBHD agreed to pay $90,000 to the City of Pembroke  25   Pines to operate the shuttle. Non-transit arrangements were made to satisfy the concurrency requirements of the school.  Transportation Concurrency Management Areas Transit level of service (LOS) standards used for concurrency purposes have been used in very few places. The City of Miami has used a ""transportation corridors"" approach, in which overall LOS is measured by aggregating the service capacities of parallel highway and transit facilities in designated corridors. Instead of measuring service capacity by how many vehicles can be accommodated by the system, service capacity is measured by how many person-trips can be made within the designated peak period. For example, if a highway within one of the corridors is operating at capacity but few people are riding MetroRail, then the aggregated measure of the level of service will indicate that capacity is still available within that corridor. Using such an approach, this would suggest that a developer could contribute toward the cost of higher frequency bus service in a corridor in order to meet concurrency. This may also have applications with bus rapid transit.  Transportation Concurrency Exception Areas Transportation concurrency exception areas have been implemented, with the result of providing public transit facilities. It is useful to review here how they work. Chap. 163.3180(5)(a) and (b), F.S., state that: A local government may grant an exception from the concurrency requirement for transportation facilities if the proposed development is otherwise consistent with the adopted local government comprehensive plan and is a project that promotes public transportation or is located within an area designated in the comprehensive plan for: 1. 2. 3. 4. urban infill urban rede downtown urban infill development velopment revitalization, or and redevelopment under s. 163.2517.  An urban redevelopment area is defined by statute as an economically distressed area, designated by a local government where public services, including transportation, are already available or are scheduled to be provided in an adopted 5-year schedule of capital improvements. More than 50 percent of the area is within  mile of a transit stop or a sufficient number of such transit stops will be made available concurrent with the designation.  26   The Florida Administrative Code (FAC), Rule 9J-5.0055(6) defines areas that can be established as concurrency exceptions. Implementation guidelines include the following:   The transportation concurrency exception area must be compatible with and further the elements of the local comprehensive plan. The size and boundaries of the area must be supported by data and analysis that demonstrates consistency with the Rule's requirements. Local government must coordinate the establishment of an exception area with the Department of Transportation and the local metropolitan planning organization. Transportation concurrency exception areas may transcend jurisdictional boundaries when appropriate and must be designated in each applicable comprehensive plan consistent with this Rule. Local government should adopt guidelines as an amendment to its comprehensive plan that include strategies to address transportation needs of the exception area.     Referring to those areas designated by statute, the amount of land that may be included in the exception area must not be more than 10 percent developable land. Density for residential development and floor area ratio for non-residential development also are specified.  Gainesville, Florida The City of Gainesville uses two Transportation Concurrency Exception Areas (TCEA), within which most of the improvements required by developers are transit related. The goals of the Gainesville TCEA include urban redevelopment, infill development, transportation choices, desirable urban design, residential and non-residential mixed use, and streetscaping/landscaping of roadways within the city. The Gainesville TCEA is an Urban Redevelopment Area and is subdivided into two zones, A and B. Zone A consists of the city's inner core and includes the University of Florida campus. Zone B is further west and north. Each zone is treated differently under the TCEA. Zone A contains abandoned sites that have been difficult to redevelop because of transportation concurrency problems. The priority in Zone A is to provide incentives to developers. Multi-modal transportation modifications are funded by the City, the Community Redevelopment Agency, federal and state governments, and other grant funds. Modifications required by safety or operating conditions, which are unrelated to concurrency, are provided by the developer.  27   Zone B does not require the subsidies that Zone A does. The City provides specified standards that developers must meet according to the size and impact of the project. Developers can choose from a list of requirements that include traffic signals, dedicated turn lanes, bus pass programs for residents or employees of the development, payments to the regional transit system which will add or increase the frequency of bus service, ride-sharing or van pooling, participation in a TDM program, or provision of shading over sidewalks.26 According to a Gainesville planner, the goal of the TCEA is to not do road widening. For example, Plaza Royale, which was a former Scotty's in a deteriorating area in Zone A, is now mixed-use development, with the residential component currently being built. The developer met TCEA standards, and also funded bus shelters, sidewalks, crosswalk improvements, all of which the city could not have afforded.27  Miami-Dade County, Florida Miami-Dade County successfully negotiated on behalf of the transit agency in coordination with the land developer to implement a Metrobus Transit Terminal as part of the Kendall Town Center. The Kendall Town Center is being developed as a new downtown for the County's fastest-growing suburban area. The development will include 400,000 square feet of office space, 1.35 million square feet of gross leasable retail space, a community medical center, elderly housing, a theatre, and a hotel. While this is a Development of Regional Impact, the concurrency regulatory mechanisms in the comprehensive plan and the land development code were the determining factors for successful negotiations. These include Objective 8B of the Mass Transit Sub-Element of the Comprehensive Development Master Plan (CDMP), which states: In the planning and design of rapid transit sites, stations and transit centers, high priority shall be given to providing a safe, attractive and comfortable environment for pedestrians and transit users; such amenities shall include weather protection, ample paved walkways, sidewalks, lighting, and landscaping and ancillary uses that provide conveniences to transit patrons such as caf, news stands and sundries sales. To implement this section of the comprehensive plan, Section C of the Miami-Dade Compliance Amendments Ordinance No. 99-42, April 27, 1999 states that a proposed 26  ""Using TCEAs to Increase Sustainability,"" Florida Sustainable Communities Sarasota Workshop, 25-28 July 1999. http://edesign.state.fl.us/fdi/fscc/news/wkshp/sara/oneila.htm 27 Onelia Lazzari, City of Gainesville, phone conversation, 9/21/01.  28   development will not be denied a concurrency approval for transportation facilities, provided that the development is otherwise consistent with the adopted CDMP and it meets the following criteria: The proposed development is located inside the Urban Development Boundary (UDB), and directly and significantly promotes public transportation by incorporating within the development...a Metrobus terminal for multiple Metrobus routes...28 As a result, provisions are contained in the proposed plan for the developer to pay for and provide the following transit amenities: ! ! ! ! ! six saw-toothed bus bays a covered waiting area with sitting furniture a restroom facility for bus operators a kiosk/transit information center 40 park-and-ride spaces reserved for transit users  The Latest Statutory Amendments to Concurrency The 1999 Florida Legislature made changes and added new sections to Chap. 163.3180, F.S. regarding transportation concurrency, which were intended to make the planning environment more favorable to alternative modes of travel, including bus transit.29 The amendments included modifications for greater multi-modal inclusiveness, such as a multi-modal transportation district option, in which private motor vehicle mobility is secondary. The amendments make an allowance for the use of multi-modal level of service standards when justified by professionally accepted level of service (LOS) measurement techniques. Please refer to the last section of this report, ""Future Considerations for Interactions with Developers,"" for a discussion of future potential applications of this new law. Impact Fees An exaction is the general term used to describe the arrangement in which the developer must provide or finance the provision of certain public facilities, in exchange for a project's approval. The exaction covers the costs of growth attributable to the project. Impact fees are a type of exaction. 28  Correspondence from Danny Alvarez, Director, Miami-Dade Transit, to Ann Pope, Development Manager, RouseWest Dade, Inc., Miami, Florida. n.d. 29 The complete language of the legislation can be found on Florida Sunshine Online at http://www.leg.state.fl.us/Welcome/index.cfm  29   Impact fees nationwide originally evolved as a type of fee in lieu of land dedication for public facilities. The advent of the use of impact fees in Florida in the early 1970's actually began as an unsuccessful effort by local governments to lobby the state legislature to establish an excise tax upon building materials. While the Florida Constitution prohibits taxation not otherwise legislatively permitted, it does not prohibit fees. Because of the failure to establish a tax, governments turned to the use of fees. A tax is not a regulation but a means to raise revenue and there are no geographic restrictions upon where revenues are collected or spent. Impact fees are a police power regulation, the primary purpose of which must not be to raise revenue. Impact fee ordinances that raise excessive amounts of revenue can be struck down, although they have the potential to be a good source of revenue if the rate of development is high. The revenues that are raised by the impact fee from a land development must be spent for the benefit of that development or within a designated impact fee zone or subdivision. Since their introduction in the 1970s, impact fees have been challenged in Florida courts on the basis of the unconstitutional exercise of home rule power, the unconstitutional exercise of police power, establishment of an invalid tax, and denial of constitutionally guaranteed equal protection. For example, the Florida courts struck down early impact fee ordinances as unauthorized forms of taxation because the fees did not relate specifically to their ultimate use. In Broward County v. Janis Development Corp., the court found that the fee was a tax because it did not specify where and when the monies would be used, even though it did specify the purpose, road and bridge construction for a high-density development.30 Four other impact fee Contractors upheld the impact fees landmark Florida court cases have since defined the required elements of ordinances in order to withstand legal challenges.31 In the earliest case, & Builders Association of Pinellas County v. City of Dunedin, the courts validity of impact fees, in principle, and set the ground rules for the use of in Florida municipalities:  Broward County v. Janis Development Corporation (1975, Fla App D4) 311 So. 2d 371. Contractors and Builders Association of Pinellas County v. City of Dunedin (1976, Fla) 329 So. 2d 314; Hollywood, Inc. v. Broward County (1983 Fla App D4) 431 So. 2d 606; Town of Longboat Key v. Lands End (1983, Fla App D2) 433 So. 2d 574; Home Builders and Contractors Association of Palm Beach County, Inc. v. Board of County Commissioners of Palm Beach County (1983, Fla App D4) 446 So. 2d 140. 31  30  30   ! ! !  The fee to be charged may not exceed the reasonable cost to the system of absorbing the new users. The fees must be reserved for the purpose for which they are charged. The fees must actually be used for the designated purpose and used in an area that will directly benefit the development that paid the fees.32  In Florida and other states, the impact fee program of a local government must be consistent with its capital improvements plan. A U.S. Supreme Court case established the ""rational nexus"" test, in which there must be a specific causal link between the need for additional facilities and the growth generated by the new development. In addition, a sufficient benefit from the exaction must accrue to those paying the costs.33 In a later case, the U.S. Supreme Court further clarified the rational nexus test by adding the requirement that exactions should bear a ""rough proportionality"" between the exaction and the impact of the proposed development. 34 The calculations in impact fee programs to set fee rates accomplish this. Impact fees can be arranged as flat fees, variable fees and negotiated fees. In programs nationwide, they can also be called a variety of names, such as infrastructure fees, system development charges, capital facility fees, building occupancy taxes, and connection fees. Impact fees for transportation have almost exclusively been used for road improvements but this may begin to change. Included below are the few cases found where there was some provision for the use of impact fees for transit improvements. Problems with impact fees in programs nationwide have included the lack of reliable data on which to calculate demand for the public service, poor procedures to collect the data, the cost of data collection and issues regarding special uses. Impact fees must also be limited to use in a particularly defined geographic area and funds must be spent within a certain time period. Impact fees cannot be used for the elimination of existing deficiencies and cannot be used for operations or maintenance costs, based on the rational nexus test. An advantage of impact fees is that they can be used as a mechanism for raising funds from land developers for off-site improvements. In some programs, voluntary donation of land is accepted in lieu of an impact fee. In this case, voluntary donation of property by an owner/developer should be property that is needed to accomplish the local work program. If it is not, then local government is giving an impact fee credit to the owner for land that is not needed in addition to taking away from the money or land otherwise obtained for a necessary project in the 32  Case summary by Eric Damian Kelly, FAICP, ""A Historic and Legal Perspective on Development Exactions,"" introduction to Transportation Impact Fees and Excise Taxes: A Survey of 16 Jurisdictions.

A determination of creditable land donation should be based on whether it is located on the same site as the development and on what percentage of the donated land is usable by the general public. Transferability of credits should not be allowed beyond the impact fee zone. The key for impact fees to work is for developers to have an up front idea of what the costs will be and the fee must directly benefit the project. Municipalities should establish mutual goals with developers. Municipalities must not change program rules that would inadvertently make it easier for the developer's competition.  Hillsborough County, Florida Hillsborough County is one of the few local governments in Florida that generates funds for public bus transit capital facilities, through its roadway impact fee. In this case, the land developer pays a fee that is reflective of the entire transportation impact from the development. The fee is then allocated across modes based upon current mode share. The existing transit mode share, on the order of from one to three percent, comes from estimates from U.S. Census data.  Orlando, Florida The impact fees used by Orlando are road impact fees and cannot be used for transit funding; however, the Transportation Impact Fee Ordinance allows the city to issue credits against impact fees to developers for contributions to public transportationrelated improvements such as providing land for bus stops or building transit shelters. The credit could be in an amount equal to: 1. the cost of non-site related improvements to the major road network (including on-site and site adjacent arterial roads and major collectors to the extent such improvements are in excess of or in addition to the site related improvements), or; 2. the contribution of land, money or service for non-site related improvements to the major road network (including on-site and site adjacent arterial roads and major collectors to the extent such improvements are in excess of or in addition to the site related improvements), or; 3. non-site related roadway improvements previously contributed, paid for or committed to by the applicant or his predecessor in interest.35  35  Orlando City Code, Chapter 56, Road Impact Fee. http://www.municode.com  32   These credits against impact fees have been used infrequently, possibly because ordinance language may be too vague or that developers may not be aware of the credits.36  Broward County, Florida The Broward County Mass Transit bus system connects all municipalities and interconnects with Palm Beach and Dade counties. Transit impact fees are assessed instead of road impact fees in some cases, generally in an area in eastern Broward County that is designated as urban infill. Transit impact fees can be used for any capital costs that are outlined in the Transit Development Plan (TDP), such as transit centers, buses, shelters, information kiosks, Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) improvements, and bus bays. The transit impact fee has been in effect since 1996. The Broward County Land Development Code contains the specifications for the transit impact fee.37 Development permitting requires approval for any development within an area designated on the Broward County Land Use Plan for urban infill, urban redevelopment or downtown revitalization. Approval requirements include a finding at the time the development permit is issued that the adequacy of transit service standards have been satisfied. If the costs of the adopted Broward County Transit Development Plan (TDP) are not fully funded, then the specific capital improvements within the TDP which enhance transit service within each designated area shall be identified. The application shall be granted with the express condition that the applicant deposit money in a ""transit account"" in an amount calculated according to a fee schedule that is updated every October 1. The schedule provides the required fee per unit of development for a variety of different types of developments. The transit impact fee applies only to development applications that require platting and are located in the urban infill area within the County. As a result, the transit impact fee has not raised as much money as it otherwise could.  Montgomery County, Maryland In Montgomery County, impact fees are called development impact taxes. Recently the County Council proposed an amendment to the development impact tax ordinance. If approved, the changes would become effective on July 1, 2002. The proposed amended ordinance revises the eligible projects that can be funded with impact fees. These include the addition of road capacity that improves transit service such as bus 36  Pedro Leon, Transportation Capital Administrator, City of Orlando Transportation Planning Bureau, phone conversation, 10/01/01. 37 Broward County Land Development Code, Chapter 5, Article IX, Section 5-182, Subsection U.  33   lanes, new or expanded park-and-ride lots, new buses (not replacement buses), new bus shelters (not replacement shelters), and sidewalks.38 The county does not assess impact fees on government buildings, moderately priced housing, or any new development within a short walk to a Metro station.  Portland, Oregon The Transportation System Development Charges (SDC) Ordinance39 was adopted in Portland in 1997, pursuant to the Oregon Systems Development Act. Portland's ordinance provides for the collection of fees, based on a rate study.40 SDCs are multimodal impact fees and are one-time fees paid by new development to pay the government for capital costs of public facilities. Eligible modes include motor vehicle, transit, bicycle, and pedestrian improvements. Eligible improvements include new through lanes for vehicular, transit, and bicycle use, bridges, rights-of-way acquisition, intersection and signal improvements, landscaping, walkway, bike paths, and design/engineering costs. Characteristic of impact fees, funds cannot be used for maintenance or elimination of existing capacity deficiencies. System development charges (SDCs) are based on a property's projected trips for a new use less the trip generation rate of the previous use. If the calculation is within 15 percent, no SDC is required. Modal splits are also computed among vehicular, transit, and nonmotorized trips. Credits are provided for transit-oriented development. In order to promote the use of transit, Portland encourages transit-oriented development by discounting SDCs for development that is transit oriented. 41 The City Comprehensive Plan identified 36 multi-modal capacity improvement projects for SDC funding. Total cost for these projects was approximately $95.9 million. Each project was analyzed to determine the portion of its cost that was attributable to three modes of travel: motorized (automobile, truck, and motorcycle), transit (rail and bus), and non-motorized (pedestrian and bicycle). Allocation of project costs among the three modes was achieved by using the following process:   Separate the direct costs of each mode from costs that are common to all modes of travel. Identify the direct costs of non-motorized facilities and subtract this amount from all other direct costs.  38 39  Proposed amendments to the Montgomery County Code. Chapter 52, Taxation.

Cooper, Transportation Impact Fees and Excise Taxes; A Survey of 16 Jurisdictions. American Planning Association, Planning Advisory Service, Report No. 493, p 35.  34       Allocate the remaining direct costs between transit and motorized modes. The transit portion was determined by comparing the transit passengers along the project route to the total of all persons (""passengers"") moving on the same route in all motor vehicles. The motorized portion of direct cost was the remainder (after subtracting non-motorized costs). Divide the direct cost of each mode by the total direct cost of all three modes to identify the relative distribution of project costs among modes. The resulting percentage for each mode's direct cost was used to allocate the common costs among the three modes.42  Each mode of travel was analyzed separately to determine the ""through"" trips (trips that begin and end outside the city limits) on each project in the SDC capital improvement program. For transit travel, transit trip matrices (from the regional travel model) were created using the trip origins and destinations of each project's corresponding geographic area. Once the ""through"" trip percentages were calculated for each project (or project group), the percent of ""non-through"" trips was calculated. Other aspects of the SDC rate calculation process included finding the project cost attributable to SDC, the cost per new trip for each mode, and trips generated by various types of development. Finally, the SDC rate for each type of land use was calculated by multiplying the number of trips by the percent of trips on the mode of travel. The result was multiplied by the cost per new trip for the mode of travel. The SDC program took effect on October 20, 1997, after many information meetings and debate which led to adjustments to the program, such as the discount for transit oriented development and exemptions for low-income housing. The implementation issues include internal miscommunication regarding SDC charges and exemptions, delay in collecting revenue due to a payment deferment option, lack of public awareness of the new ordinance, difficulty understanding the system of credits, and reduced revenue due to exemptions. Developments of Regional Impact It is important to examine developments of regional impact (DRI) in this report because DRIs usually represent the largest developments and as such, have the greater potential impact on land development patterns and the opportunity to influence the development of the transportation system. The development of regional impact review process is concerned with identifying multi-jurisdictional impacts of development and  42  Paul Shirey and Donald R.

The structured DRI review process facilitates capital improvements planning. A Florida Development of Regional Impact (DRI) is any development that, because of its character, magnitude, or location would have a substantial effect upon the health, safety, or welfare of citizens of more than one county.43 There are different types of DRIs, including the following. ! ! ! Areawide DRIs, in which there are two or more development projects represented by separate property owners Downtown DRIs DRI Master Plan, in which construction is in phases over an extended period of time  DRIs are established by Chapter 380, F.S., which authorizes the Florida Department of Community Affairs to develop land and water management policies to guide local decisions relating to growth and development. DRIs are implemented by rules in the Florida Administrative Code, Chapter 9J-2. The DRI designation of a land development proposal initiates a review process, in which the regional planning council, the state and other agencies have an opportunity to provide recommendations to the local government in the drafting of conditions attached to a local government development order for assuring that regional impacts have been properly addressed.44 The regional impact review includes the documentation of impacts upon transportation as part of an Application for Development Approval (ADA), which must be approved by the Department of Community Affairs. Transit service is addressed in the ADA question, ""What provisions, including but not limited to sidewalks, bicycle paths, internal shuttles, ridesharing, and public transit, will be made for the movement of people by means other than private automobile? Refer to internal design, site planning, parking provisions, location, etc."" The end result of the DRI process is a resolution passed by the host municipality, rendering a development order (DO) in response to an Application for Development Approval submitted for a project that has been determined to be a development of regional impact. The DO must be consistent with Chapter 380, F.S., Rule 9J-2 F.A.C., the local government comprehensive plan, the strategic regional policy plan, and the state comprehensive plan.  43 44  Chapter 380.06, F.S. A local government development order is any order granting, denying, or granting with conditions, an application for a development permit, whereas a development permit includes any building permit, zoning permit, plat approval, or rezoning, certification, variance, or other action having the effect of permitting development activity to proceed, as defined in Chapter 380, F.S.  36   Fourteen types of projects may be DRIs if they exceed specific size thresholds. These development types include airports, hospitals, and hotels, as well as industrial, office, retail, residential, and multi-use developments. Thresholds for determining DRI status include building square footage, acreage, and parking requirements. If a project is determined to have a methodology meeting must be held. Florida Department of Transportation, (DCA), the local government, and the methodology for identifying a project's simplifying the process. transportation impact, then a separate traffic This allows the regional planning council, the the Florida Department of Community Affairs applicant to decide on a mutually acceptable transportation impacts, thus saving time and the following measures that reasonably assure that public available when needed to consistent with Chapters 163  Rule 9J-2.045(7)(a)1-5, Florida Administrative Code, lists can be used to mitigate transportation impacts and which transportation facilities will be constructed and made accommodate the impacts of the proposed development, and 380, F.S.: ! ! ! ! !  scheduling of facility improvements alternative concurrency provisions proportionate share payments for roadway improvements based upon peak hour roadway trips generated. level of service monitoring with binding commitments for needed improvements a combination of the above mitigation measures, OR the provision for capital facilities for mass transit [e.g. buses for fixed route service, vehicles for vanpool or ride share programs]  Through the DRI process, RPCs in Florida have recommended to local governments a number of conditions as part of a DRI development order, that the developer: ! ! ! ! ! consult with the transit agency to determine the transit related needs to serve the project and coordinate with any plans to extend transit to the project; be financially responsible for any implementation of on-site amenities; establish a transportation systems management plan that includes use of bus transit as a means to reduce project-related p.m. peak hour automobile trips; coordinate with the city to promote transportation demand management strategies; and, when transit is already available to the site, build bus turnout bays and reasonably sized bus shelters along public roadways to serve the development, as required by the local government, or provide the transit agency with the funds to do it.  37   For approving a development order that requires developer exaction, the local government must comply with Paragraphs 380.06(15)(d), (e), and Subsection 380.06(16), Florida Statutes, which are similar to requirements for impact fees. The Florida Statutes state that DRI developments must pay their proportionate share only if non-DRIs are required to pay also. The law further states that developers cannot be charged twice for the same impact. The key for a land developer to fund transit is to demonstrate that impacts would be mitigated by doing so. The existing DRI process instructs the developer to use professionally accepted methods for assessing level of service (LOS). The tools of analysis available for determining level of service are mode specific. Most commonly in use is the Highway Capacity Manual method for determining roadway level of service. Recommended development order conditions regarding bus transit generally assume that the local government or local transit provider will run a bus route past the development site, if they are not already doing so.  FDOT Procedures for Site Impact Analysis Proposed developments that do not meet the size thresholds constituting a DRI do not require site impact review by FDOT. The FDOT procedures for site impact analysis is a process that is specifically geared toward determining a new development's roadway traffic impacts upon the State Highway System and the Florida Interstate Highway System. Most FDOT activities relating to site impact assessment originate from amendments to the future land use map (FLUM) of the comprehensive plan and amendments to the comprehensive plan due to a proposed development of regional impact (DRI). The estimated traffic impact is the basis for determining the deve in contributing to roadway improvements that are necessary to level of service. Considerations about transit usually only arise in of alternative modes to serve some of the new trips generated lessening the impact to roadway level of service. loper's fair share cost maintaining roadway relation to the ability by the development,  According to FDOT's Standard Site Impact Procedures, there is a process composed of several steps, conducted in this order: 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6.

Assignment Future Conditions Analysis Mitigation Analysis, if necessary Site Access, Circulation and Parking Review and Permitting  It is the applicant who proposes a methodology for reviewers' concurrence for determining site impact. The study area, also called the area of influence, is typically estimated using professional judgment and then refined during the study process. The DCA rule for DRIs requires that the study area include all facilities where traffic generated by the proposed development is equivalent to 5 percent of the maximum service volume at the LOS standard for the facility. The methodology improvements is impact analysis. generated by the for determining the developer's fair share for funding of mitigation identified in the Methodology Development (Step 1) phase of the The fair share is determined in relationship to the number of trips development and the capacities on an affected roadway segment.  Step 2, the Existing Conditions Analysis, includes a review of existing transit service and transit ridership. It is interesting to note that Step 4, Trip Generation, is a separate step conducted before the estimation of person trips. Trip generation differentiates trips as motor vehicle movements and it is considered to be the most critical stage in the site impact analysis. The amount of travel that uses modes other than automobiles is estimated using regional and local guidelines based upon existing transit usage. As a result, 3 to 5 percent is considered a maximum realistic share of travel for modes other than automobiles. Step 6, mode split, is the analysis portion that estimates the amount of travel in person trips that will use the various modes available to the site. References to transit appear again in Step 9, the mitigation analysis, in which the measures proposed must clearly demonstrate that they contribute to reducing traffic congestion along facilities where LOS has been made unacceptable upon the addition of the new development. The mitigation analysis includes a plan that details system improvements necessary with the phasing of the project and identifies the responsible party for implementing the improvements. Improvements typically include some combination of physical or operational changes to the roadway facilities, transportation demand management strategies, and fair share contributions by the developer. Under Mitigation Analysis, various examples of mitigation measures are listed, including construction of new facilities and addition of general-use lanes. Where the construction of new facilities are considered, enhancements for the use of transit, such as geometric  39   and operational improvements to accommodate bus travel are encouraged. Other encouraged mitigation measures include enhancements for the use of transit, such as the construction of park and ride lots, the construction of bus shelters and turn-out bays. The measures also include high occupancy vehicle (HOV) treatments such as the construction of HOV access ramps and the implementation of HOV priority lanes. Public transit operational improvements are other available mitigation measures. These improvements include new or modified service routes and employer subsidized transit. This measure can be used if it can be demonstrated that the necessary agreements are in place with the local transit agency and that the strategy can be demonstrated to cause a mode split shift toward transit. Transportation demand management techniques, such as providing transit subsidies, are recognized as having potential to reduce site traffic. A monitoring plan is usually put in place to measure effectiveness. The mitigation analysis demonstrates that the proposed improvements will result in an acceptable operating condition along the roadway. The calculation of the proportionate share contribution is based upon a formula, as provided in the Florida Administrative Code. The final fee and mitigation fee considered is typically negotiated among the applicant, local governments, regional planning councils and FDOT if state highway improvements are involved.  A Summary of Stipulated Conditions Relating to Bus Transit All RPCs in Florida were contacted with the request to provide best examples of RPC recommendations for the provision of bus service. The list below is a synthesis of conditions that RPCs in Florida have recommended to local governments as part of a DRI development order. These include recommendations that the developer do the following. ! ! ! ! ! Consult with the transit agency to determine the transit related needs to serve the project and coordinate with any plans to extend transit to the project. Be financially responsible for any implementation of on-site amenities. Establish a transportation systems management plan that includes use of bus transit as a means to reduce project-related p.m. peak hour automobile trips. Coordinate with the city to promote transportation demand management strategies. When transit is already available to the site, build bus turnout bays and reasonably-sized bus shelters along public roadways to serve the development, as required by the local government, or provide the transit agency with the funds to do so. Subsidize a bus route to a new mall and provide bus drop-off at the front entrance. Provide a parcel within the development for a transit stop that can accommodate multiple buses at one time.  ! !  40   ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !  ! !  In public gathering places, provide a place where transit information can be prominently displayed. Encourage tenants and owners within the employment centers to provide preferential parking for vanpools/carpools. Disseminate information to tenants and residents about local ridesharing programs. Some period of time after the issuance of the development order, propose transit-related actions, facilities, and sites to the municipality and transit agency. Consider paying the cost for an additional bus route to the DRI or increased frequency on existing routes during later phases of construction. Maximize access by interconnecting parcels within the development and providing road linkages to the local street system. Provide park and ride spaces proximate to a multi-bus transit stop, either in conjunction with commercial development or by purchase of property. Designate a part-time ride share coordinator to distribute transit information. Include transit-oriented design (TOD) features into the project design, as specified by a transit agency design manual, such as covered pedestrian walkways linking buildings to transit stops. Establish a transportation management association to implement trip reduction programs within the DRI. Provide sidewalk access between transit stops and nearby residential and commercial development.  Information from two other development orders is provided here, which may provide ideas for how transit can be accommodated.  Alachua County, Florida The Springhills DRI Development Order (DO) language found in Alachua County Resolution 99-73 is illustrative of the kinds of conditions regarding provision for bus transit capital facilities and operation costs that can be included in a DO. Springhills is a mixed-use development that is located in the unincorporated area of Alachua County, but within the Gainesville Urban Area. It is situated on all four quadrants of the intersection of SR 22 (NW 39th Ave) and I-75. The development is to be in four phases, with the first two (retail commercial) already completed. The residential, single and multi-family, is the next phase. The development order contains the following. ! In the interest of safety, and to promote alternative forms of transportation, the Applicant shall provide a plan for an on-site system of bikeways and pedestrian circulation for all of Phase I.  41   !  Notwithstanding the arrangements able to be achieved within the Springhills TMA, the Applicant shall coordinate with the Gainesville Regional Transit Service in Alachua County for the expansion of transit routes to serve the Springhills DRI and provide for integration with existing transit service in or adjacent to the DRI study area and the regional transit service area prior to the initiation of Phase II. Prior to Phase II construction, the developer will construct a covered bus shelter to serve the new bus route that will access the DRI. Bicycle lockers or bicycle racks, transit passenger shelters and transit parking bays, consistent with Alachua County Land Development Regulations and RTS policies and requirements, shall be constructed to augment and facilitate the operations of transit service to the site in Phase II and in all future phases in conjunction with the extension of transit service. Transit pull-out bays and transit shelters, and their location as required by Alachua County Public Works Department and Department of Growth Management and the Applicant's trip reduction strategies shall be constructed by the applicant within the site boundary following approval by the Alachua County Public Works Department. The location of transit facilities shall be approved by the transit provider in cooperation with Alachua County. The Applicant shall consult with Gainesville Regional Transit System in order to determine the appropriate number and location of pull-out bays and transit shelters. The Applicant shall promote and encourage variable work hours and flextime participation by on-site employers. Sidewalks shall be constructed along both sides of all collector and arterial internal roadways, where feasible. Sidewalk access will also be provided between transit stops and nearby residential and commercial development. During Phase III, a possible mitigative measure includes an additional RTS bus route to the area or increased frequency on existing routes. The annual report shall also document mass transit modifications, bicycle/pedestrian modifications, and any other TSM/TDM strategies undertaken to date to reduce single occupant vehicle (SOV) trips, and changes in mass transit frequency and level of service as well as bicycle/pedestrian levels of service, when such levels of service are adopted by the Board of County Commissioners. The Annual Monitoring Report (AMR) shall evaluate and recommend mitigative measures involving/including local street networks, transit, bicycle/pedestrian facilities, and service to address any transportation system capacity deficiencies identified in the report for the year being monitored.  !  !  !  !  !  !  42   !  The AMR shall specifically investigate and make recommendations on non-auto modifications (including, but not limited to, park and ride lots, mass transit, bicycle, and pedestrian enhancements), which will help reduce SOV trips. To reduce traffic impact on the regional roadway network, the AMR shall investigate opportunities for new roadway facilities to provide and promote route choice. Trip credits will be granted for mitigative measures listed, e.g. mass transit, park and ride lots, by Alachua County Dept. of Public Works based on documentation of the mitigative measures to be undertaken by the Applicant/Owner and supported by appropriate data. In addition, through the study and/or Springhills Transportation Management Association (TMA), the Applicant shall make a good faith effort to coordinate transit service and other trip reduction strategies with Santa Fe Community College and AvMed Health Services. If the annual monitoring report indicates that the trip reduction program is operating more effectively than the model used with the revised transportation impact study estimated, then additional trip reduction credits may be granted.  !  !  !  !  Orlando, Florida Florida Hospital contributes $25,000 annually for transit services as a requirement of its DRI approval. Florida Hospital is the largest private, not-for-profit hospital and second largest hospital overall in Florida. It is the third largest employer in the Central Florida area and one of the largest in the Orlando area. The hospital is one of the nation's leading cardiac intensive care/open heart centers. DRIs are usually a pay-as-you-go process. Normally, there are multiple phases of development during which each impact must be assessed on an ongoing basis. This DRI was not typical. The hospital wanted a ""higher level of certainty"" (of the costs) because of the nature of the healthcare business. Therefore, they opted for negotiated annual payments. Florida Hospital's development order contained the following.  Transit and current ridesharing information must be displayed in all public gathering areas, in employment centers, and in commercial center areas on the hospital property. A staff member must be designated as an Employee Transportation Coordinator (ETC) and must coordinate Transportation Demand Management programs in cooperation with LYNX. Florida Hospital agrees to pay for the construction of six (6) bus shelters within the planning area. They are also responsible for the maintenance of    43             the shelters. Bus shelters, bus stops, and amenities are designed in cooperation with LYNX. The City Transportation Engineer and LYNX will determine where transit bays are needed within and adjacent to the planning area. If additional land owned by the Developer within the Property is necessary for bus stops beyond that which can be accommodated within the existing rightof-way, then this land shall be provided by the Developer at no cost to the City or other applicable government agency. The Developer shall become actively involved with van pools and joint ventures with public agencies to offer mass transit facilities and services. The hospital must provide a fifty percent (50%) transit fare discount for employees. The hospital must continue to be an ""active and financially supportive"" member of the Downtown Orlando Transportation Management Association (DOTMA). Either through DOTMA or on their own, the hospital must develop a TDM program. The TDM program was subject to the review by the City prior to the issuance of a Certificate of Occupancy. The TDM program is to consider ""at a minimum the following"": parking management provisions for carpools and vanpools, publicity for transit and ridesharing information, work hour adjustments (compressed week, flextime), telecommuting where possible, showers and bicycle lockers, and daycare facilities. The hospital was required to make a one time payment to the City towards mass transit system improvements on the two (2) routes serving the project. An annual contribution was also required. These were specified in the agreement between the City and the hospital. The agreement stipulated the following: $379,481 for the one time payment, and $25,000 annually. The annual contribution cannot be increased.  Observations This section summarized the existing use of non-regulatory and regulatory tools used by local governments in the State of Florida and elsewhere in the nation. This investigation found that non-regulatory approaches are not frequently used alone unless there is an extraordinary opportunity of mutual gain, as found in a joint development opportunity. The vast majority of these cases involving private sector land developer contributions concern light rail rather than public bus transit. The successes experienced by local governments private sector land developer participation, appear key regulatory measures. In Florida, these meas comprehensive planning process and requirements 44 and transit agencies, in securing to have relied strongly upon a few ures include the local government of the land development code, in   the form of zoning, transportation concurrency exception areas, and impact fees. The development review process for developments of regional impact provides further opportunity for the host local government to establish conditions in which land developers provide for transit facilities and operations. It is most commonly the case that a land development code contains provisions that land development provide for access to transit, mainly through connective sidewalks and land for a bus stop. The amenity most frequently provided is bus shelters. In a few instances, mainly in Hillsborough and Broward counties, funds have been provided for a limited amount of time, usually 3 years or less, to operate bus service along a route extension or in the form of shuttle service that connects to a standard bus route. The U.S. Supreme Court case law and the Florida Statutes clearly restrict the application of impact fees to protect the private sector. Land developers only must pay a fee representing the impact of the development on the transportation system. It is challenging to express that impact in the form of a transit mode share, especially in areas where transit service is nonexistent or infrequent. Transportation concurrency has been traditionally applied to mean roadway concurrency. The application of concurrency relies primarily on processes and measures of level of service that emphasize highway travel. Transit usually enters the discussion only if it has been determined that roadway improvements alone cannot raise the level of service to the adopted standard. There is interest in transit usually to the extent that it can be proven that transit service will mitigate traffic impacts. Localities, such as Orlando, where there seem to be more promising opportunities to engage private sector land developer participation in providing for public bus transit capital facilities or operations, appear to rely upon: ! ! ! strong policies in the comprehensive plan; land development code language that effectively implements the comprehensive plan; information for both land developers and local governments to use, such as urban design manuals and customer amenities manuals, which takes the guesswork out of what is desired by the transit agency and expected of the land developer; and a host local government that places a priority on transit service and advocates effectively on behalf of public transit development.  !  The next section looks at future possibilities for strengthening the options for local governments to engage private sector land developer participation in public bus system development.  45   Future Considerations for Interactions with Developers The previous section in this report covered examples of both non-regulatory and regulatory approaches that have been used in Florida and other states to engage private sector participation to contribute toward the costs of public bus transit capital facilities and operations. This last section presents examples of other mechanisms that have been used in other states that could be considered for use in Florida. In addition, there are a few examples of mechanisms in the proposal stages, such as Broward County's proposed transit-oriented concurrency system and the City of Boca Raton's proposed trip reduction ordinance, which have good potential for engaging land developer participation. There is also an example provided here of transit overlay zones, which are currently used in Miami-Dade County but for rail station areas only. Transit overlay zones could be used for public bus facilities as well. As with the previous section, the discussion begins with non-regulatory approaches, then moves on to regulatory approaches.  Non-Regulatory Approaches Employment Park Foundations The concept of an empl consideration. There may Companies located within improvements to their sites future. oyment park foundation is presented here for future be similar employment parks or foundations in Florida. employment parks may depend upon transportation and so may be willing to fund transit improvements in the  Research Triangle Park, North Carolina The Research Triangle Park Foundation, a private non-profit foundation that develops and markets the Research Triangle Park, is made up of all the companies who bought land within the Park (IBM, Nortel, Cisco, Glaxo and others). The Research Triangle Park Foundation raises funds through the selling and leasing of land within the Park.45 The Research Triangle Park, located between the cities of Raleigh and Cary, is a bustling center of high-tech employment. As traffic congestion has increased on Davis Drive, the main roadway through the Park, the need for transportation improvements has also increased. The North Carolina Department of Transportation (NCDOT) did not have the funds for improvements for Davis Drive in their seven-year Transportation Improvement Program. The State has a legislative requirement for the equitable 45  Conversations with Liz Rooks, Transportation Manager, RTP Foundation and Glen Lang, Mayor of Cary.  46   distribution of transportation funds to its 100 counties through the use of a formula that tends to favor economically distressed areas of the state while being less able to respond to rapidly growing areas. In the spring of 2000, the Research Triangle Park Foundation entered into a publicprivate agreement with NCDOT and the Town of Cary, which calls for Cary to contribute funds to cover the cost of road improvements along the portion of Davis Drive within their jurisdiction. The Foundation will contribute the funds to cover the cost of improvements on the portion of Davis Drive within Research Triangle Park, and NCDOT will cover the cost of road improvements on the remainder of Davis Drive. Although this example involves a partnership to pay for road improvements, it also serves as a model that could be applied to transit improvements as well as services. Cost Sharing Programs In the example below, the ""private partner"" is actually a public university, not a private developer, but it was included in this report because it illustrates how public transit can harness funds from a different revenue stream, in this case, a department of education. The concept would also appear to be transferable to a case in which a transit agency serves a private university or college. In Florida, campuses of State universities are subject to campus master planning requirements as well as transportation concurrency. As new campus construction and development tries to keep pace with ever-growing enrollment rosters, administrators struggle to address campus transportation impacts upon the adjacent highway network. The example from North Carolina below offers an alternative arrangement in which the operating costs of public transit are supported by the university.  Chapel Hill, North Carolina Chapel Hill Transit operates the transit system in Chapel Hill with two financial partners, the Town of Carrboro and the University of North Carolina (UNC) at Chapel Hill. Chapel Hill and Carrboro are contiguous municipalities, and the transit agency provides service in these two areas in addition to the UNC campus. The financial assessments of this three-way partnership are based on population: the population of each city plus the total population of UNC (faculty, staff, and students). Currently, Chapel Hill's share is approximately 45 percent, Carrboro's is 16 percent, and UNC's is 39 percent. The current agreement stipulates that if such as a new bus route, that partner is full for one year. At the end of the first standards, then the route is established one of the partners requests a new service responsible for paying for the new service in year, if the route's ridership has met service and all partners must share in the additional  47   cost. However, if ridership is below service standards, the requesting partner must continue to fund the service in full if it is to continue. Currently, UNC funds all university services, including circulators and shuttles, in full and also shares in the population based assessment for the cost of the total service. The university pays the transit agency $10 per service hour. Beginning in January 2002, all transit service to the university became fare free, funded by the university. Public Pressure A third example below is another case of voluntary contributions by the owner/developer but only as a result of public pressure to provide transportation solutions. This speaks to the potential power and influence of an educated and wellorganized host community. This may also point to the value to local government of using available tools to help educate citizens. One example of this is the establishment of a transportation management association (TMA). In Tampa, Florida, the University North Transportation Initiative (UNTI) is a unique partnership of local government representatives, large employers and residential neighborhood leaders. The membership has become increasingly supportive of public transit as a result of the learning process that comes from active involvement in a TMA.  Portland, Oregon A concentration of medical institutions on Marquam Hill in the City of Portland needed to respond to traffic congestion problems in the area. In particular, the Oregon Health Sciences University (OHSU), which constitutes over 70 percent of the employment population, faced a major space problem and needed to expand. There is just one main access road that leads into and out of Marquam Hill, which also includes a residential population organized with a strong neighborhood association. Because of community pressure about traffic congestion, the City required the medical institutions to mitigate traffic problems before starting new construction. OHSU recognized that the neighborhood association would have testified against the OHSU expansion and the City would not have given OHSU a permit to expand without a credible plan to reduce traffic on the Hill. In response, the medical institutions voluntarily decided to enter into the Partnership with the City of Portland and the transit agency, Portlan provide express bus service directly to the Hill, paying for 70 percent of costs of four express bus routes. Tri-Met paid the other 30 percent of costs to maintain public access to the bus service. Marquam Hill d Tri-Met, to the operating the operating  48   Low Income Housing A discussion of affordable housing is provided here for two reasons. One, affordable housing ventures can be profitable to land developers. Two, there is reason to consider that potential changes in the developer selection application process of some housing programs could rate the provision of transit services and facilities as a higher priority. In this way, developers could be more strongly encouraged to incorporate transit service and amenities into their development proposals for affordable housing. Since the 1934 creation of the Federal Housing Administration, the United States government has sought to extend opportunities for home ownership and rental housing to those unable to afford it on their own. To utilize the three federally authorized programs that seek to provide low-income housing, a Housing Finance Agency has been established in each of the nation's fifty states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands. These programs are the Mortgage Revenue Bond (MRB) program, the Low Income Housing Tax Credit program (Housing Credit), and the HOME Investment Partnerships Program (HOME). Through these programs, the federal, state, and local governments form a partnership with organizations in the private sector to finance and build low income housing initiatives. Chapter 420.502(7), F.S. created Florida's housing finance agency, the Housing Finance Corporation (FHFC). FHFC is affiliated with the Department of Community Affairs (DCA), which has performance oversight; however, the FHFC is administratively distinct from the DCA. The FHFC operates much like a private sector entity, although it is a public corporation, and is managed by an executive director appointed by the DCA. The FHFC issues bonds to generate funds for housing construction, manages Statefunded programs such as loan guarantees, and provides grants to local governments for housing construction. The corporation concentrates on funding single-family home ownership programs and multi-family (rental apartment) loan programs for individuals with low- to moderate-income levels. Private land developers find affordable housing ventures attractive for several reasons. For instance, under the Housing Credits program, developers receive a 10-year federal income tax dollar-for-dollar reduction in exchange for cash infusions for new construction and restoration projects. The HOME program provides mortgage loans to developers that are non-amortized and have a simple interest rate of 0 percent for nonprofit organizations and 3 percent for for-profit organizations. Interest repayment is only during the term of the loan and loan terms are 15 years for rehabilitation and 20 years for new construction. Additionally, low-income rental properties fill up quickly and remain at full occupancy rates due to the high demand. These developments are profitable and are driven by market economics.  49   Hillsborough County, Florida In Hillsborough County, the Housing Finance Authority, assisted by the Community Improvement Department, administers the Multifamily Mortgage Revenue Bonds (MMRB) Program, State Apartment Incentives Loan (SAIL) Program, Housing Credit (HC) Program, and other housing programs that provide incentives to the private sector to develop affordable housing. MMRB and HC are federal programs; SAIL is a state program that can be used in conjunction with other state and federal programs. The developer selection process requires the developer to agree to set aside commitments (depending on the program and type of development). The developer is also required to provide certain construction features. For instance, for any Multifamily Mortgage Revenue Bond (MMRB) project, such as new construction, rehabilitation of existing development, elderly development, and non-elderly development, the following items are required.        air conditioning in all units dishwasher (in all new construction) garbage disposal (in all new construction) cable TV hook-up minimum square footage of living space full sized appliances a bathtub  Since developer selection is a competitive process, additional features or amenities may be chosen that are rated on a point basis. Applicants are ranked in order of the total points assigned according to the amenities that are selected. Loan amounts are assigned in order of this ranking. For example, under an MMRB project for new construction for non-elderly developments, the developer must select items totaling 25 points. The developer could choose window treatments (3 points), 30-year expected life roofing (5 points), ceramic tile bathroom floors (2 points), marble window sills (3 points), double compartment kitchen sink (1 point), or other amenities. Public transportation must be located within one-half mile of the property. For elderly developments, the developer must select items totaling 16 points. All items are worth 2 points each, and all must be on-site and include hairdresser or barber shop, laundry facilities on every floor, and a library consisting of a minimum of 100 books and 5 magazine subscriptions. Public transportation must be located within 150 feet of the property or the developer can choose to provide private transportation. There is met with the case chosen, some question whether the needs of affordable housing residents are being these developer choices, as influenced by the point rating system. It is often that when private transportation for elderly developments is the option the developer provides one van to serve a large population within the  50   development, which can be inadequate. A bus stop that is one-half mile from someone's home is a burdensome distance and even more so during inclement weather or if the person has packages to carry or children to tend. Since many low-income housing occupants are transit amenities and better access to service cou well as for transit agencies. It is recommended income housing be reviewed to determine if it features to include more accessible transit service amenities to reward developers higher points for capital facilities and service operations. also transit users, the provision of ld be a significant boon for them as that the application process for low is possible to change the required and/or to change the rating scale of providing public bus transit access,  Regulatory Approaches This investigation found some other regulatory approaches that a local government might find useful to consider in strengthening the means to engage private sector land developer participation in providing for public bus transit capital facilities or operations. A discussion of regulatory approaches below includes overlay zoning, impact fees, trip reduction ordinances, special assessments, new approaches toward evaluating concurrency, and ideas to consider regarding the DRI process. Overlay Zoning An overlay zone provides for superimposing additional specified requirements onto a basic use zoning district. Where the standards of the overlay and the base zoning district differ or are in conflict, usually the stricter standard applies. A transit overlay district assigns controls that accommodate transit in addition to the basic requirements of the underlying zoning district. Such controls may require the provision of pedestrian walkways to access transit and the provision of transit stops and shelters. Transit overlay zones are more typically associated with allowing high-intensity commercial and office development adjacent to rail stations, such as the overlay zone in Santa Clara County, California, which is associated with the Tasman East and Tasman West Light Rail Projects in San Jose. In the future, transit overlay zones may be useful in corridor planning for bus rapid transit.  Miami-Dade County, Florida Miami-Dade County is an example of a transit overlay zone used in areas adjacent to light rail stations. In the future, Miami-Dade County is considering expanding it to cover the South Miami-Dade busway and possibly several other park-and-ride facilities. 51   Miami-Dade County is a charter county and is comprised of an unincorporated area and 30 incorporated municipalities, each having its own government. Miami-Dade County's municipal code, Chapter 33-C, Fixed Guideway Rapid Transit System, Development Zone, provides for a Rapid Transit Zone that is in effect at MetroRail stations. The original transit district was created in 1974 and wiped out all existing zoning. The philosophy applied to the overlay approach is that it is a work in progress, and has been changed many times. For example, the Dadeland North and Dadeland South subzones no longer exist and were replaced by a transit overlay zone for the entire Kendall area. The Dadeland North and Dadeland South MetroRail stations are near one of the largest shopping malls in the nation and also located within the Rapid Transit Zone. The Dadeland North MetroRail station connects to eight Metrobus routes. Seven Metrobus routes connect with the Dadeland South MetroRail station, which also represents the south terminus of the County's heavy rail service. In 1994, the Miami-Dade Board of County Commissioners approved the lease of a 9.2acre site at the Dadeland North MetroRail station. The project is called Dadeland Station, consisting of a three-phase mixed-use project that includes a transit plaza with 9,600 square feet of ""transit convenience retail,"" in addition to 320,000 square feet of retail space. Hotel, office and residential uses are included for future phases. The County, which receives both guaranteed minimum rent and gross income from the project, will realize between $40 million and $100 million in new revenue over the term of the 99-year lease. Near the Dadeland South MetroRail station, there is the Datran Center, a privately owned development that leases the County property on which it is located. The Datran Center includes office, retail, and hotel uses and transit parking. The arrangement provides over $600,000 in revenue to the County annually. When a development project is proposed, it is reviewed by a county development commission, and zoning is created at the time of the permitting. Then it is reviewed by the individual municipality in which the development will be located. The County development commission is open to market needs. They would like to see the stations be an integral part of the development; however, they try to pick the best that is offered by any given set of proposals. No formal requirements apply to developers. However, transit-friendly plans get higher points and more favorable consideration. Currently, the Rapid Transit Zone covers only the MetroRail system. It is believed that a transit overlay zone would work well for larger, permanent bus facilities where higher density is encouraged for attracting and facilitating land development. It may also simplify the development regulatory process for getting zoning approvals for transit facilities, such as park-and-ride lots.46 46  Frank Talleda, Miami-Dade Transit, phone conversation, 9/26/01.  52   Pleasant Grove, Utah The City of Pleasant Grove, Utah, located in between Salt Lake City and Provo, has established by ordinance a transit overlay zone. The Transit Overlay allows for a more intense and efficient use of land at increased densities for the mutual reinforcement of public investments and private development. In return, developers must conform projects to building standards in the Transit Overlay that are designed to create a safe and pleasant environment near transit stations oriented to pedestrians and to those who rely upon public transportation. The Transit Overlay only applies to a zoning district when a Regional Transit Center is included as part of any proposed development. A Regional Transit Center, as defined in the Transit Overlay ordinance, is a transportation complex that: ! ! ! must provide 150 park-and-ride parking spaces, or must participate with government agencies in the development of a county-wide plan to meet federal Environmental Protection Agency air quality standards, or must be used by at least three local bus routes or at least two express bus routes or has the potential to provide a light or commuter rail station.47  Level of Service Mechanisms Methods for evaluating transportation level of service are undergoing significant changes in Florida. With such changes come new opportunities to enhance or develop mechanisms for engaging private sector participation in paying some portion of the costs of transit capital and operations. This discussion summarizes new directions under pursuit. A major limitation of the transportation concurrency evaluation process in Florida, as it affects transit system development, has been the difficulty in assessing level of service equally across modes. Established measurement techniques and standards to compare modal options must be in place in order for a land developer to justify transit investments to satisfy transportation concurrency requirements. In the transportation planning process, the private auto historically has been viewed as the primary mode of travel around which other modes are auxiliary or supportive at best. Regarding transportation concurrency, public transit is viewed as a motor vehicle trip reduction measure. Local governments in Florida can justify the use of transit service as a mitigating factor only if it can be proven that transit service will have the effect of shifting mode split and reducing motor vehicle trips to and from the development site, thereby maintaining established highway LOS standards. 47  Pleasant Grove Code, Chap. 14.14, Transit Overlay.  53   If local ordinances contain language requiring transit facilities as part development, the ordinances mostly specify bus shelters. According to the Capacity and Quality of Service Manual, prepared by Kittelson & Associates, bus are an amenity, albeit an important one, but not a backbone characteristic of that enables a person to use transit successfully.48  of land Transit shelters service  Roadway level of service does affect public bus transit service, since transit vehicles use the road system to deliver service. Contributions to road improvements do help transit; however, a high roadway level of service is not sufficient for transit to work properly. Transit systems require additional physical facilities and vehicles, and the funds to operate the system.  Multi-Modal Level of Service Measures The Tran in 1998, focus of modes is sportation and Land Use Study Committee (TLUSC), convened by the Governor believed that pedestrian mobility with access to transit should be the primary local governments if a real mode shift from private automobile to alternative to be realized.  The TLUSC intended that multi-modal LOS measures should be used as incentives by local governments through the allowance of LOS trade-offs from private automobile mobility to other modes. Additionally, local governments should work with developers to reduce requirements for motor vehicle concurrency through providing facilities for transit and other modes.49 The use of multi-modal level of service measures were successfully recognized and incorporated into transportation concurrency law by the 1999 Florida Legislature. Since then, the Florida Department of Transportation (FDOT) issued its 2002 edition of the Quality/Level of Service Handbook, which incorporates the leading evaluation techniques for transit and other modes.50 At this time, FDOT has discouraged the use of these techniques to quantify the value of trade-offs among modes. However, through further refinement of techniques, the multi-modal level of service measures have the potential to provide local governments  48  ""Highlights of the Transit Capacity and Quality of Service Manual: First Edition,"" Transit Cooperative Research Program, Federal Transit Administration, Transportation Research Board, National Research Council, Washington, D.C., November 1999, Number 35, p. 27. 49 Sprinkle Consulting, Inc., ""Assessing Level of Service Equally Across Modes,"" Prepared for FDOT Systems Planning Office, March 2001, p. 29. 50 The 2002 edition of the Quality/Level of Service Handbook can be found currently at http://www11.myflorida.com/planning/systems/sm/los/default.htm  54   with the tools to quantify the value of these trade-offs in the future.51 The desire of FDOT has been to develop a comparable evaluative process for transit level of service, which would supposedly yield a similar local planning response to that received for highways. According to local planning processes, those road segments performing at a poor level of service generally receive priority for funding of improvements. The intent is that the application of the measurement of level of service for transit and subsequent establishment of transit LOS standards would shine a spotlight on those aspects of transit with low quality of service in order for them to receive higher prioritization for funding of improvements at the local level. So far, transit agencies have been hesitant about the results of preliminary testing of these evaluative processes due to the perception that the local level response to any evidence of poor transit quality would be punitive rather than supportive. This may indicate that some local governments and their respective communities continue to prefer a highway-only transportation system. Another concern is that the service development and priorities for each transit agency may differ so much from one to another that attempting to standardize the measurement of quality of service across all transit agencies does more to muddle rather than clarify the status of service quality. Clearly, developing measures for transit quality of service has proven to be a much more complex undertaking than developing level of service measures for roadways. The Transit Capacity and Quality of Service Manual (TCQSM), prepared by Kittelson & Associates, Inc., was developed as a transit companion to the Highway Capacity Manual. Based upon the TCQSM, the Florida MPO Transit QOS [Quality of Service] Evaluation, Agency Reporting Guide was subsequently prepared to provide guidance for transit agencies in using the methodology for measuring transit quality of service. The TCQSM proposes the use of transit availability measures and quality of service measures, from the passenger's point of view. It is the traveler's experience that will determine whether he or she chooses to use transit service, thus shifting the mode split from private automobile travel to transit.  51  Studies can be found on the FDOT Systems Planning web site listed in footnote #50. These include multi-modal level of service analysis techniques at the planning level, multi-modal quality of service for transit and pedestrian modes of travel, multi-modal corridor level of service analysis, research involving assessing level of service equally across modes, and assessing multi-modal level of service over a facility based on the following facility definitions:      an intersection, bus stop, or street crossing (point) a roadway between points or intersections (segment) a series of segments and intersections (facility) a group of parallel facilities (corridor) a community or entire area (areawide)  55   This shift in mode split is what would justify the use of private sector land developer funds to pay the costs of transit facilities and operations improvements. As a result, it would appear that those aspects of transit service that private sector land developer funding should go toward are the ones that would really make a difference in terms of ridership. Using the categories of performance measures above, Kittelson argues that availability of service first must be provided before quality of service can be considered. Availability includes such factors as: ! ! ! Service Coverage: Does bus transit serve my residential area? Does it serve the area to which I want to travel? Hours of Service: Is bus transit service provided during the times of day that I need to travel? Frequency: Are buses running frequently enough that I don't have to wait too long?  All these conditions must be met for bus service to be considered available. These conditions have entirely to do with bus operations. However, in most cases, if land developers are contributing funds for bus transit, the funds are usually earmarked for bus shelters or related amenities. Bus shelters are one of the few examples of a transit-related fixed capital facility that can be demonstrated to specifically serve a particular new development. As a result, developer funds go toward bus shelters, whether that is the most crucial need or not. Further research for FDOT includes a study that investigated multi-modal level of service at various points in the traveler's journey. With respect to bus transit, the point of concern is the bus stop. Rather than physical amenities such as bus shelters, the primary service measure at the bus stop was identified to be the frequency of bus service at the bus stop. Stops that incorporate multiple routes enhance level of service by providing greater choice of destination. Secondary service measures include pedestrian access to the bus stop, as described by the ease of street crossings to access the bus stop. These also include the presence of sidewalks adjacent to the bus stop, the distance of the bus stop from the trip origin or final destination and presence of obstacles as measured by the degree of ADA (the federal Americans With Disabilities Act) accessibility of the bus stop. Other secondary measures include passenger loading as measured by the number of boarding passengers, and a comfort convenience measure that includes transit amenities at the bus stop. A transit amenities survey of RTS bus riders (Regional Transit System, City of Gainesville, Florida) was also conducted, which found that the presence of a bus shelter and bench were considered to be the most important bus  56   stop amenities.52 The results of the survey cited above should inform local governments as to what are the most important bus transit amenities to negotiate as conditions of land development. According to the primary need for available service, the most important bus transit service elements include funding for bus operations to the development site. Secondarily, it includes the more frequent placement of bus stops to serve the development, street design and traffic controls to aid pedestrian crossing, sidewalks, and Americans with Disabilities access. Once local governments are able to incorporate multi-modal LOS techniques in transportation planning activities, then local governments will have the ability to establish acceptable LOS standards for transit service to satisfy concurrency. Once those standards are established, this can provide the basis for requesting the provision of transit facilities and/or operations funding as a part of the land development negotiation process. The emphasis should be on funding the primary service measures first, such as frequency of bus service.  Broward County, Florida A proposed change to the fee assessment process in Broward County would replace the current roadway concurrency system, the road impact fee, and the transit impact fee with a transit-oriented concurrency system. The focus of a transit-oriented concurrency system would be to have proposed developments contributing a fair share towards transit improvements, as mitigation for transportation concurrency, instead of constructing or paying for roadway improvements. Legal, fiscal, and intergovernmental issues need to be resolved before the county can adopt this proposal.53 The proposal calls for the county to be divided into Transportation Concurrency Management Areas (TCMAs). Each TCMA could either use the new transit-oriented system or opt out of the program and use a conventional concurrency system. A developer would pay a fee into the Transit TCMA, proportionate to the transportation impact of the proposed development, which would contribute to the funding of the fiveyear transit development plan. In order to change from a roadway improvement orientation to a transit enhancement orientation, the County Department of Planning & Environmental Protection recommended that the County change both the basic standards used to measure 52  Dr. Linda B. Crider. ""Multi-Modal LOS `Point' Level of Service Project, Final Report"" Department of Urban and Regional Planning, University of Florida, Gainesville, August, 2001, p. 55. 53 The description of the proposed alternative concurrency system is from information in the paper, ""Creating a Transit-Oriented Concurrency System for Broward County-A Concept Paper."" Broward County Department of Planning & Environmental Protection. Broward County, Florida Development Management Division, May 2001.  57   adequate transportation facilities and the type of mitigation implemented. By using the Transit Capacity and Quality of Service Manual (TCQSM), referenced above, the County would not only calculate the capacity of transit vehicles and facilities, but it would also measure the quality of transit service from the user's perspective. Specific criteria for assessing the quality of transit service includes service frequency, hours of service, service coverage, passenger loading (degree of crowding), reliability, and a comparison of transit versus auto travel time. This proposed assessment, to satisfy transit-based concurrency, is envisioned as a ""payand-go"" system, meaning that the developer's only obligation is to pay the appropriate amount to the County. Under a ""pay-and-go"" system, the payment would be made at the site plan stage, when the specific nature of each development is well-defined. This would enable a more accurate calculation of the expected impact of each project, and eliminate the need for monitoring and enforcement. Transportation concurrency exception areas (urban infill) and exemptions for de minimis impacts would be eliminated. Currently, Broward County's urban infill area comprises most of the eastern part of the county. The adoption of this type of concurrency system would not, by itself, require additional public funding for transit. The transit service standards adopted by the County Commission for each TCMA would have to be based on a reasonable projection of revenues. Any increase in these standards above current service levels would have to be justified in terms of additional funding sources. Broward County's transit development plan (TDP) guides the capital and operations improvements of the transit system over the next five years. However, it does not contain revenue projections for the five-year period, and is not intended to match planned improvements to future revenues. According to the proposal, for the TDP to be usable for the purposes of a transitoriented concurrency system, it would need to be based on projected revenues for the five-year period. The projection should include an estimate of revenue from the concurrency system, based on the portion of future transit demand which will be attributable to new development. The planned improvements in the TDP should be limited so that they are financially feasible based on the revenue projections. The type and distribution of improvements in the TDP would need to match the transit service standards that are being recommended for each TCMA. The transit service standards would therefore be much more than a key factor in the concurrency system; they would be the policy guides to determine the location and type of enhancements for public sector expenditures on transit. The general form of a fair share calculation would be:  58   Trip generation of proposed development  x  Cost/trip for TCMA projects in TDP (five years of cost).  Several important assumptions are built into the sample formula above. First, it assesses all of a new development's trips as if they were transit trips. This is, of course, not a realistic assumption, but it could be a reasonable proxy based on the deletion of all roadway-related assessments (roadway concurrency and road impact fees). A second assumption is that a cost per trip for the TDP can be estimated. This means that a projection of future transit ridership based on the planned improvements has been made. This projection may be made more difficult to the degree that unconventional enhancements are included in the TDP. There may also be difficulty splitting the costs of some improvements among the TCMAs. Finally, the formula implies that the TDP will be updated annually, so that there will always be five years of cost involved. According to the proposal, there may also be a need to modify the formula to account for other transit revenues that will be paid by the occupants of new development during the five-year period. This avoidance of ""double counting"" has been used frequently in impact fee methodologies. Since the funds provided by a land developer would all be used for TDP projects in the appropriate TCMA, the developer would not need to study and propose particular improvements. Also, the use of the funds for implementation of projects in the TDP would satisfy the timing requirement of concurrency. This is the link between the completion of the transportation enhancement and the occupancy of the new development. The proposal concludes with four recommended actions for Broward County: ! Initiate a general Comprehensive Plan amendment to the Transportation Element which would create a new policy consisting of the following: 1) divide the county into Transportation Concurrency Management Areas (TCMAs) as defined in Section 163.3180(7), FS; 2) utilize a quality of transit service concept as the transportation level of service standard for some or all of the TCMAs; 3) within those TCMAs which utilize a quality of transit service concept, require applicants for development approvals, as mitigation to satisfy transportation concurrency requirements, to make a fair share contribution towards the cost of implementing components of an adopted, financially feasible Transit Development Plan; and, 4) modify the timing of transportation concurrency assessment from the plat stage to the site plan stage, with a provision that no local government can issue a site plan approval without evidence from Broward County that the project has satisfied regional transportation concurrency requirements.  59   ! ! !  Request each municipality to indicate a TCMA preference. Request the MPO to recommend TCMAs and transit standards. Authorize hiring a consultant to review the second Comprehensive Plan.  Pipelining Pipelining could be a method of payment by land developers that could be applied to public bus transit as well as to roadway facilities. The 1999 amendments to the concurrency law provide that land developers may pay a proportionate fair share contribution toward transportation facilities to serve the trips generated by a multiuse development of regional impact.54 Also referred to as pipelining, this method of payment for transportation facilities by land developers enables them to take the entire cost of the proportionate fair share mitigation for all affected road segments and put it toward the construction of just one or two of the needed segments. Under this approach, a critically needed road project could be put in place in its entirety. What may be significant to bus transit is that the pipelining method of payment encourages developers to undertake large multi-use land development projects with a significant component of residential uses, which constitute the type of desirable development pattern that can achieve walkable communities with multiple transportation modes.55 The wording of the legislation in Chap. 163.3180(12)(e), F.S. states that the proportionate-share contribution may be applied to any transportation facility to satisfy the provisions of this subsection of the law. However, the law also provides a formula for the calculation of the proportionate-share contribution, based on the number of peak period trips reaching affected roadways. The formula as defined and provided, encourages the application of the pipelining mechanism to payments for roads only. Considering that the explicit intent of this legislation was to allow the development of DRIs ""...designed to encourage pedestrian or other non-automotive modes of transportation..."",56 the opportunity exists to develop a method for applying the pipelining mechanism to be used for bus transit facilities. It is recommended that the formula provided by law for calculating the proportionate share contribution, be reviewed in light of recent state-initiated efforts to develop multi-modal level of service measures. The goal would be to apply a proportionate share contribution based on bus passenger trips rather than on peak period motor vehicle trips.  54 55  Chap. 163.3180(12), F.S.

As a regulatory device, impact fees are not supposed to raise too much revenue. As provided in an earlier discussion about impact fees in this report, impact fees have almost exclusively been used for funding roadway improvements. Broward County is the only county with a transit impact fee. There is a proposal, as described above, to eliminate the transit impact fee and replace it with the proposed transit-oriented concurrency system. In Hillsborough County, impact fees for transit can currently raise a small amount in places where fees are based upon current mode share. The existing transit mode share is on the order of 1-3 percent, as estimated by U.S. Census data. This data is collected based upon questions relating to the journey to work and no other trip purposes, so this gives a limited view of existing transit use. This method of determining funding for service development also locks the system into the existing mode split status quo. If transit service is funded to serve a three percent mode share, the service will likely be of a quality that will not attract anything higher than that. There are a few new developments regarding impact fees that, while not having the effect of raising revenues for transit, instead may have positive indirect effects of encouraging development toward transit-friendly land use patterns. The Transportation Planning Bureau of Orlando recommended in 1998 that the road impact fee schedule be changed to a rate based upon Vehicle Miles of Travel (VMT) within designated transportation areas. Refinements are still being made to this proposal. If this change were implemented, the impact fees for urban infill development would be significantly reduced. This reduction in impact fees would attempt to redirect development as transit-oriented development into urban infill areas. The proposed VMT approach is simply a refinement of the roadway impact fee calculation. VMT would make the process more precise and allow the recognition of different land development patterns that are conducive to transit, such as multiple intersecting points within a development's street system. Furthermore, the City of Orlando has enacted an impact fee reduction ordinance that reduces roadway impact fees for developers in the Southeast Sector Plan if they provide amenities and facilities for transit users and construct development to promote the internal capture of trips. The recent changes to the use of impact fees as legislatively enacted in 1999 through the creation of the multi-modal transportation district option, has had the effect of further reducing the effectiveness of impact fees to raise revenue for roadway improvements. The new legislation for multi-modal transportation districts includes the provision that ""Local governments may reduce impact fees or local access fees for development within multimodal transportation districts based on the reduction of  61   vehicle trips per household or vehicles miles of travel expected from the development pattern planned for the district.""57 The intended effect is to encourage developers to adopt development patterns as promoted by multi-modal transportation districts. While this will not raise funds for transit, it should have the positive effect of putting appropriate land development patterns in place that make bus transit more effective and efficient. There may be a missed opportunity when impact fees are considered only for roadways and no other form of transportation. While there may be a reduction of vehicle trips per household, there will almost certainly still be a need for transportation, in one form or another. Broadening our view toward the development of a ""transportation impact fee"" might open new opportunities to fund transit using private sector land developer participation. Review Process for Developments of Regional Impact The Development of Regional Impact (DRI) review process focuses upon identifying impacts to the existing roadway system. DRIs are often located on large tracts of undeveloped land to which transit service has not yet extended. Developers will seek less costly undeveloped land, on the suburban fringe, where there is usually little or no transit service but is attractive because of market accessibility by the existing road system. As the suburb-to-suburb home-to-work travel pattern expands with increasing suburbanization, some transit agencies are withdrawing poorly used bus service extensions from new developments to downtowns in favor of focusing on service enhancements to existing well-used bus routes serving neighborhoods closer to the urban core. Under the current DRI review process, level of transportation service is measured in terms of roadway capacity. Alternative transportation, such as ridesharing and transit, are identified as part of Transportation Systems Management (TSM) strategies for the purpose of mitigating development impacts on roadways rather than as a mode of transportation with its own level of service (LOS) standards. This necessarily leads to a determination of improvements, to be accomplished by the developer, which are intended to restore roadway LOS rather than improving use of transit as a mobility solution to the new development. For example, the DRI Application for Development Approval (ADA) emphasizes and provides detailed instructions on quantifying the impacts to roadways as part of Question 21  Transportation. At the end of Question 21, after parts A through H addressing quantifying roadway impacts have been addressed, there is the general question: 57  Chap. 163.3180(15)(d), F.S.  62   What provisions, including but not limited to sidewalks, bicycle paths, internal shuttles, ridesharing and public transit, will be made for the movement of people by means other than private automobile? Refer to internal design, site planning, parking provisions, location, etc. Alternative modes are a procedural afterthought and it is implied that not much attention is expected by the developer to seriously consider other modes of transportation. All other modes, each having very different characteristics, are combined into one ""other than automobile..."" category for purposes of review. The Application for Development Approval provides further instructions: The applicant must clearly document any estimate of mode split to transit or non-motorized transportation. The proposed usage should also be supported through an agreement with the transit agency and an acceptable internal roadway design...Change in mode split must be supported by the developer based on data collected on projects of similar intensity and use. The burden of proof is placed upon the underdeveloped alternative mode, to demonstrate a shift in mode split. The new project is not likely to be permitted to set a precedent, if projects of similar intensity and use that demonstrate a higher transit mode share cannot be found. Despite the limitations of the current Application for Development Approval, the DRI process has the potential to be an opportunity to guide DRIs in a positive direction toward State Comprehensive Plan goals for a truly balanced transportation system. Developers must submit annual reports regarding the phased development of DRIs, which must identify modifications that are consistent with the plans and policies of the local host municipality, the Florida Department of Transportation, and the metropolitan planning organization. This places the responsibility upon these state and local agencies to have plans and policies that set the tone for improving transit. One way to accomplish this is for the provisions of Florida Administrative Code 9J-2.045 and the instructions for determining impacts as part of the ADA to be updated to include new methods for measuring multi-modal level of service. The F.A.C. guidance and ADA instructions should be updated as these methods are refined in the future by the Florida Department of Transportation. Other hurdles in elevating the use of public transit improvements to address the transportation impacts of DRIs are: ! providing public bus transit improvements that can be demonstrated to specifically benefit the particular DRI contributing funds, and  63   !  demonstrating that those particular transit improvements cause a mode shift to transit.  Transportation improvements, as provided by developers, must meet certain tests as provided by state law. These tests are similar to those provided for impact fees, regardless of whether a local government has adopted an impact fee ordinance or not. These tests are that: ! ! ! ! The transportation need that must be mitigated must be attributable to the proposed development paying for the mitigation. The amount of the contribution must correspond to the amount needed to mitigate the impacts from the development. The funds must go toward improvements to serve that development. Developers of DRIs cannot be required to contribute funds for mitigation unless the host local government has an ordinance in place requiring non-DRIs to mitigate their impacts. Developers of DRIs cannot be charged twice to mitigate for the same impacts, as in the case that a local host government charges impact fees.58  !  These requirements pose special difficulties for developers to provide transit improvements as mitigation for the transportation impacts of a DRI. For example, if a high quality bus service, commensurate with highway level of service, is not in place, then it is not possible to reasonably estimate the need for transit service by a new development unless there is a way to measure latent demand for transit service. As a result, a very low number of bus trips is estimated. Consequently, a small amount of money or capital facilities is estimated to pay for bus mode share. Funds must be demonstrated to benefit the development. If there is an impact fee ordinance in place, then funds cannot go toward bus operations. This leaves capital facilities--bus shelters are the likely choice. The Transit Capacity and Quality of Service Manual already assigns bus shelters as an amenity and not a necessary element of bus service availability. Bus shelters do not accomplish much if bus service is not available. If funds can go toward operations, it is possible to quantify a cost of bus service to cover bus operations to serve those generated trips only; however, this still would not help if bus service does not yet extend out to the DRI. If effective bus transit service does not already exist in the area, then it is not possible to pay some incremental bus transit cost, commensurate with the number of new trips generated by a development, such that the new development benefits from the fees paid. It is recommended that there to be some means to enable local governments to charge development for bus transit improvements that do not necessarily serve that 58  Chapters 380.06(15)(d) and (e) and 380.06(16), F.S.  64   development, but can be applied to bus routes that may be extended to serve the development in the future. Whether the development is a DRI or not, the contribution should be consistent with the intent to provide transportation facilities concurrent with the impact of development and to maintain a transportation LOS, commensurate with the mobility demand generated by the development. To reinforce the improvements as the planning and locations where it These include: ! ! ! ! the long range transportation planning process and the transportation improvement plan of the MPO, the local government comprehensive planning process, urban development boundaries, and zoning and other tools within the land development code. desired results of engaging land developers to pay for bus transit part of the DRI process, local governments should make full use of regulatory processes available to them to guide development toward is efficient to provide transit service.  Additionally, local governments could provide disincentives for a development that is located outside the existing or planned service area of transit, while offering incentives that make it more desirable to build in areas within the existing and planned bus service area. Trip Reduction Ordinances Trip reduction ordinances are regulations passed by a local government, which require developers, property owners and employers to participate or assist in financing transportation management efforts. Ordinances may specify a target reduction in the number of vehicle trips expected from a development based on standardized trip generation rates. Ordinances may also establish peak periods for travel reduction, establish time tables for compliance, and penalties for non-compliance.59 In practice, owners and management telecommutin trip reduction ordinances primarily enlist the participation of property employers, but they can also target land developers. Transportation efforts encompass a wide range of actions, including carpooling, g, and parking management but they also often include public transit  59  ""Managing Our Way Through Congestion,"" Florida's Commute Alternatives System Handbook.

There is generally no limit to what activities are conducted, as long as those activities produce trip reduction results. Trip reduction ordinances usually require employers or developers to submit plans that list the specific transportation demand management strategies to be employed and to survey commuters in order to quantify progress toward the goal of the ordinance. A local government could develop a trip reduction ordinance with requirements to identify and examine potential bus transit development efforts and implement them if they are deemed feasible as a means to mitigate traffic congestion. Employers and developers can be penalized for not submitting a plan. Penalties for developers usually relate to the denial of a building permit. Examples below describe how trip reduction ordinances have been used to e developers in improving transit service.

The TDM Plan for each development would adopt some combination of at least two elements contained in a list that includes:  66   ! !  !  public transit incentive programs, including the construction of transit shelters and amenities and the provision of fare subsidies; public transit improvements, such as changes in service routes; increases in frequency of service, alteration in the location of facilities; and the establishment of fare incentive programs and other measures designated to make public transit service more accessible to the occupants of the proposed use; and designated spaces provided on site that are restricted to bus pool vehicles, for those who utilize bus subscription service.  Bus pool spaces would be provided at a minimum rate of 2 percent of the total parking required by the City Code of Ordinances or the Downtown Development Order. The spaces must be non-handicapped employee parking spaces located closest to the building entrance.60  Cambridge, Massachusetts Two mechanisms are used to encourage land developer participation in paying for transit capital and operating costs in Cambridge, Massachusetts. These are the Parking and Transportation Demand Management Ordinance (PTDM) and the Project Review/Traffic special permit in Cambridge's zoning code. PTDM (Chapter 10.18 of the Municipal Code) and Project Review (Article 19 of the Zoning Code) are independent ordinances. The goal of the City is to coordinate the implementation of the two ordinances in order to streamline the process for developers.61 Developers are required to engage in transportation transportation mitigation measures but are also able When bus transit is included as a proposed measure building and maintaining bus shelters is the main device demand management and/or to customize their programs. in a development application, used.  Zoning permits also can contain the requirement of providing shuttle services to rail hubs, sidewalks, and signage, in addition to bus shelters. Several projects that have received permits under PTDM or Project Review/Traffic are involved in funding a shuttle service from a commuter rail hub in Boston to employment centers in Cambridge. The businesses are required by their permits to fund an initial match to the City's start-up funding. In subsequent years, the businesses will bear the sole financial responsibility for the shuttle service. The shuttle service is a joint effort between the City and the Charles River Transportation Management Association. It will be operated by a private contractor and not by the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority, which operates bus, subway, light rail, and commuter rail systems.  60 61  Proposed ordinance drafted by John Reilly, City of Boca Raton, May 21, 2001.

There is a proposed trip reduction ordinance still under review by City staff. The Transportation Management Association Group, authors of the draft ordinance, anticipates that interest in growth management will speed the adoption of the ordinance. The proposed ordinance includes a Developer Program that includes Tier 1 and Tier 2 actions. Tier 1 incorporates actions that have a modest cost and a modest impact on travel behavior, such as information display/kiosks and the encouragement of ridesharing. Tier 1 incentives are recognition and publicity. Tier 2 actions are considered ""highly effective"" and include sidewalks, access for bus service, safe bus loading zones, bus shelters, land for transit facilities, and the operation of, or the financial contribution to, transit services (shuttles or express buses). The incentive for participation at this level would include road impact fee offsets, fast track approval of the development plan, parking requirement reduction, and increased floor area ratio.63  Prince George's County, Maryland The Maryland National Capital Park and Planning Commission (MNCPPC) is currently responding to a request from the Prince George's County Council to create Transit 62 63  Pasadena Codes, Ord. 6573, 1993; Ord. 6172, 1986.

A transit district is a legally defined geographic area in which vehicle trip reduction procedures, strategies, and programs are required. Developers within transit districts may be asked to provide bus shelter installations, transit use incentives and improved pedestrian facilities. The goal of the TDM measures is to reduce vehicle trips during specified periods of the day.64 Special Assessments Special Assessments are fees charged against property within a geographically defined district, to finance specific capital improvements or services. Special assessments are used more to pay for new improvements rather than their replacements. These districts can be used to provide public transportation. While a special assessment district does not exclusively target private land developers, it does target owners of property within a specific area that is usually undergoing new development or redevelopment, and so is in need of new public facilities and services. Property owners of such land are also frequently land developers. Developers are often willing to pay to hasten placement of improvements necessary to increase land values. Special assessments are a type of special financing district. Special financing districts are distinct geographic areas created by local governments, usually with the consent of property owners within the district, to raise funds, provide special services, and construct capital facilities within the district. These districts may lie wholly within a larger jurisdiction, or the boundaries of the special financing district may lie in more than one jurisdiction. Special assessments are related to but different from tax increment financing, which is used as another type of special financing district. Special assessments are distinguished from tax increment financing (TIF) in that TIFs are dependent on the parent jurisdiction, whereas a special assessment district may be independent from the parent jurisdiction. In TIF districts, there are no additional fees charged to property owners, as are charged in special assessment districts.65 A discussion of tax increment financing is found in the previous section on ""Current Approaches for Engaging Private Sector Involvement."" Special assessment districts are not impose a tax. Special assessments addition to impact fees or other assessments are distinguished from 64  independent or dependent special districts, which impose a fee. This technique also can be used in exactions imposed on land developers.

However, there is the problem of majority rule in which a person may oppose adoption of a special assessment district that includes his/her property but is forced to participate in the payment of the project cost. Like an impact fee, the developer may also shift the costs to the final consumer. The power to set up a special district must come by State legislation. Florida allows local governments to create special districts. Florida courts have addressed issues that distinguish between taxation and special assessments. In Collier County v. State of Florida,67 the Florida Supreme Court stated, ""...local governments have no other authority to levy taxes, other than ad valorem taxes, except as provided by general law. The County does, however, possess authority to impose special assessments and user fees."" In another case, City of Boca Raton v. State of Florida,68 the court explained the difference between a tax and a special assessment. A legally imposed special assessment is not a tax. Taxes and special assessments are distinguishable in that, while both are mandatory, there is no requirement that taxes provide any specific benefit to the property; instead, they may be levied throughout the particular taxing unit for the general benefit of residents and property. A tax is an enforced burden of contribution imposed by sovereign right for the support of the government, the administration of law, and to execute the various functions the sovereign is called on to perform. On the other hand, special assessments must confer a specific benefit upon the land burdened by the assessment... A special assessment is like a tax in that it is an enforced contribution from the property owner; it may possess other points of similarity to a tax but it is inherently different and governed by entirely different principles. It is imposed upon the theory that that portion of the community that is required to bear it receives some special or peculiar benefit in the enhancement of value of the property against which it is imposed as a result of the improvement made with the proceeds of the special assessment. It is limited to the property benefited, is not governed by uniformity and may be determined legislatively or judicially. 66 67 68  National Association of Homebuilders, Impact Fee Handbook, Homebuilder Press, Washington, D.C., 1997, p. 24.

This can be difficult to prove for local bus The use of special assessments may have future applications for use to rapid transit.  While general ad valorem taxes vary from year to year and fluctuate in proportion to changes in the assessed valuation, a special assessment is customarily a fixed amount and is often payable in annual installments, until the project is completely paid off. The installment amount is usually fixed at the time of the initial levy and does not fluctuate as a result of changes in ad valorem valuation or increases in the cost of maintaining the improvement.69 Provisions in the Florida Constitution and the Florida Statutes that afford taxpayers the ability to challenge state taxes do not apply to special assessments since they are not considered to be taxes.70 The validity of a special assessment depends on the benefit received by the recipients of the service or improvement, whether the recipients are spread throughout the entire community or are merely located in a limited specified area within the community.71 Special assessments may also be called service charges or user fees. The Florida Supreme Court has also defined user fees as ""...fees [that] are charged in exchange for a particular governmental service which benefits the party paying the fee in a manner not shared by other members of society.""72 Therefore, user fees are similar to special assessments, because the fee ""must result in a benefit not shared by persons not required to pay the fee.""73 Special assessments are often administered through special taxing districts or municipal service benefit units. Chap. 125.01(1)(q), F.S. authorizes a county that provides municipal services, to establish a municipal services taxing unit (MSTU) or a municipal services benefit unit (MSBU), which is a means to raise revenues from those properties within a specific geographic area that will benefit from the service. The difference between a MSTU and a MSBU is that MSBUs raise revenues through service charges or special assessments rather than taxes. A MSBU is not a dependent special district. A MSBU must be the governing body of the affected municipality, the conse annually for a term of years. The boundaries of the MSBU may boundaries of a municipality.

Projects involving the use of special assessments tend to be used most often for smaller, localized projects. They can be applied to finance general public improvements in a local district where the whole district has benefited, although not necessarily uniformly. These districts typically require that a portion of the cost of the project be allocated to the municipality at large and paid from general revenue sources. After the public benefits are allocated, the remaining costs are paid by those who receive private benefits. The allocation to specific parcels may be calculated using simple formulas or may require professional appraisals. Special assessments provide an alternative to negotiating with developers to secure financing for new improvements. Financing through special assessments avoids some of the legal restrictions on local taxation and borrowing. This may be more politically acceptable to taxpayers than are other sources of revenue. Special assessments expedite the placement of infrastructure, which lowers long term costs of construction. They work best where long repayment periods are not needed, just in case there is an economic downturn.  San Francisco, California San Francisco provides an example of a special assessment district used to provide public transportation purposes, although the name of the ordinance creating the special assessment district can be deceiving. The Transit Impact Development Fee Ordinance, adopted in 1981, enables San Francisco County and City to charge a one-time fee to developers of office properties within a special assessment district in downtown San Francisco. The funds raised go to the San Francisco Municipal Railway's operating revenue fund. The fee covers the cost of providing transit services over the 45-year life of an office building with the maximum fee per gross square foot set at $5.00.74  74  Funding Strategies for Public Transportation, Volume 2 Casebook, TCRP Report 31, 1998.  72   Recommendations The following recommendations are listed below to summarize those main points made in earlier sections of this report. They are offered to assist local governments and transit agencies in maximizing their options in engaging private sector land developer participation in contributing toward bus transit capital facilities and operations costs. 1. Begin with a well-crafted local government comprehensive plan (LGCP) with strong and clear policies regarding transit-friendly land development patterns. The LGCP and the transit development plan (TDP) should support and reinforce each other so that land development and redevelopment occur where public bus transit is able to efficiently provide high quality service. (See pp. 4-5 and p. 14. Also see p. 28, Miami-Dade example.) 2. If not already accomplished, consider the adoption of an urban services boundary as well as the designation of transit service corridors, which focus both public and private resources for enhancing bus service along roadways that are served by existing and planned bus routes. (See p. 4 and p. 14. See also p. 28, Miami-Dade example.) 3. Maintain an up-to-date land development code (LDC), consistent with the intent of the LGCP. A good LDC strikes the right balance between providing predictability and flexibility to the land development process. (See p. 14.) 4. Consider the use of conditional (p. 18), incentive (p. 16), and overlay zoning (pp. 51-53) for purposes of securing private sector contributions to public bus transit. (See pp. 16-22.) 5. Develop guidance manuals for use by the host local government and the private land developer, regarding preferred development design concepts to enhance transit mobility and transit amenities for customers. It is far easier for a developer to provide what the community would ultimately like to have if models and examples are available. (See pp. 18-19.) 6. Using the transit level of service (LOS) measures developed by FDOT, establish transit LOS standards and provide these as the basis for requesting the provision of transit facilities and/or operations funding as a part of the land development negotiation process. (See pp. 54-57.) 7. Prioritize those elements most needed for the bus system, for which private sector land developers would be asked to provide. This would first prioritize the elements of bus service availability, such as frequency and duration of bus  73   service to and from the development site, then secondarily upon bus service quality, such as customer amenities. (See pp. 56-57.) 8. As it relates to any land development, large or small, establish a means to enable local governments to charge development for bus transit improvements that do not necessarily serve that development but go toward bus service development of routes that may be extended to serve that development in the future. (See p. 63, beginning with ""Other hurdles...,"" through p. 65.) 9. As part of the provisions of Florida Administrative Code 9J-2.045 as well as the instructions for determining impacts in the DRI Application for Development Approval, incorporate the directive to use multi-modal level of service measures. (See pp. 62-63.) 10. The 1999 amendments to the concurrency law provide that land developers may pay a proportionate fair share contribution toward transportation facilities to serve the trips generated by a multiuse development of regional impact. It is recommended that the formula provided by law for calculating the proportionate share contribution, be reviewed in light of recent state-initiated efforts to develop multi-modal level of service measures. The goal would be to apply a proportionate share contribution based on bus passenger trips rather than on peak period motor vehicle trips. (See p. 60.) 11. Consider the adoption of other regulatory approaches, such as trip reduction ordinances (pp. 65-69) and special financing districts (See pp. 15-16 regarding tax increment financing and pp. 69-72 regarding special assessments), to provide for public bus transit operations and capital facilities. 12. Consider offering incentive programs to land developers, such as those that offer density bonuses, lower parking requirements and expedited permitting advantages, in return for transit improvements. (See p. 11.) 13. Invest in professional development opportunities for local government staff to become more informed about the economics of land development and to enhance negotiation skills. (See p. 7, last paragraph starting with ""A wellcrafted land development code...."" Also see pp. 10, 13, and 15, first paragraph. 14. Review the how transit features in who propos application processes for low-income housing programs to determine services and facilities can be incorporated and prioritized as valued application proposals. Such features would cause land developers e them to score higher in the rating process. (See pp. 49-51.)  74   15. Consider using both regulatory and non-regulatory tools in combination. For example, special assessments can be used in combination with exactions. (See p. 69.) 16. Use various approaches to educating citizens about the value of public transit so that it becomes incorporated into the ethos of the community. High quality public bus transit would become the desire and expectation of the community. Such approaches might include establishing transportation management associations with neighborhood association participation, conducting social marketing campaigns, supporting public relations and outreach efforts of the public transit agency, and involving high school students in campaigns to promote alternative transportation. (See p. 48.) This report has documented the known non-regulatory and regulatory tools, using illustrative case studies, which have been used to engage land developers in contributing toward public bus transit facilities and operations. This report also contains information about mechanisms that have rarely been but can be used by Florida localities, as well as recommendations for actions to improve those opportunities to enlist support for transit through the land development process. Finally, and notwithstanding the local government comprehensive planning process, the land development code, and the use of incentive programs, these are no substitutes for a local host government whose professional staff and executive leadership are allies and advocates for public bus transit and are committed to making public bus transit a priority in land development negotiations.  75   Appendix A. Port Orange Comprehensive Plan Objective 2.2 from the Port Orange Comprehensive Plan  Update '98 is included here, as an example of a well-written planning policy that can provide a foundation for a strong local land development code. Strong local government comprehensive plans and land development codes establish the authority of a local government to engage private sector land developer contributions toward public transit facilities and operations.  Objective 2.2: The City shall work with and continue to encourage VOTRAN to provide a safe and efficient mass transit system to the citizens of Port Orange at an acceptable level of service. Mass transit service shall be based upon the location of trip generators and attractors, and appropriate land uses. The City shall work with VOTRAN to achieve a 5 percent modal split for transit use by the year 2005. Policy 2.2.1: The City shall designate all roads serviced by existing and/or proposed VOTRAN bus routes as ""public transportation corridors."" Policy 2.2.2: The City shall ensure that all roads within designated transit corridors function at a level of service (LOS) sufficient to support the VOTRAN minimum local bus system. The peak hour directional LOS standard for transit shall be defined as the LOS standard for each particular roadway segment along a given transit route. Policy 2.2.3: The city shall support the operational LOS performance standards for fixed-route transit systems as provided by the MPO in its 2020 Transportation Plan Update. Policy 2.2.4: The city shall encourage land uses and site developments (both generators and attractors) which promote mass transit within designated public transportation corridors, with priority given to those projects that will bring the greatest increase in transit ridership. Policy 2.2.5: The City shall guide the placement, type, and density of new development along public transportation corridors, in a manner consistent with the Future Land Use Element, so as to achieve the level of ridership needed to support mass transit. Policy 2.2.6: Major trip generators and attractors, i commercial developments exceeding 50,000 square feet in space and new residential developments of more than 200 shall provide on-site space for bus stops if located transportation corridor. ncluding new gross leasable dwelling units, on a public  A-1   Policy 2.2.7: The City shall continue to inform VOTRAN as to the proposed location of new transit generators and attractors as they are being reviewed. Policy 2.2.8: The City shall require major trip generators and attractors (as defined by Policy 2.2.7 above) located on a public transportation corridor to incorporate elements of ""transit-friendly design."" Specific elements shall meet with VOTRAN's approval, and may include... A. Transit stops meeting ADA requirements; B. Parking lots and intersections designed with minimum corner turning radii for buses; C. Clearly delineated walkways from the building to the transit stop; and D. Buildings and transit stops placed close to the street.  Policy 2.2.9: By the year 2005, the City shall assess the feasibility of requiring a maximum (as opposed to a minimum) number of parking spaces for new developments along public transportation corridors. Policy 2.2.10: The City shall work with stops by refitting them with benches, covered or enclosed waiting areas. convenient, and meet the needs of ""tran VOTRAN to improve existing bus clearly marked signs, lights, and All bus stops shall be safe, sportation disadvantaged.""  A-2   Appendix B. Literature Review An annotated bibliography is provided here as a result of a search of the general literature in transportation research to determine how private sector participation or private sector land developer participation in providing transit facilities or operations has been addressed. This bibliography provides a representative selection of current sources that most closely address the topic of this report. The literature review was conducted by researching professional and academic journals, periodicals, newspapers, textbooks, and other sources, including the Transportation Research Information Services (TRIS). Research and reports from allied professional associations, the University of South Florida (USF) LexisNexis Academic Universe and the USF General Business File ASAP were also used. Beimborn, Edward, Harvey Rabinowitz, and Peter Gugliotta, ""Implementation Issues for Transit Sensitive Suburban Land Use Design."" World Conference on Transportation Research, Sydney, Australia, July 1995. This paper examines guidelines that can be used to create situations in which transit, pedestrian, and bicycle facilities are used as a basis for land use design. The authors discuss reasons why it has been difficult in the past to incorporate public transit service into suburban areas in the United States. In order to implement transit sensitive land use techniques, an assessment of the user groups is necessary. User groups are identified as developers, local government staff and the market itself. Beimborn et al. view developers as a group who are ""very open to change and will quickly adapt to new ideas."" Developers, as well as those who finance development, must be willing to take risks, especially the risks involved with innovative approaches to transit funding. Since developers are motivated by the bottom line and are ""highly market driven,"" successful projects are often emulated. The problem that the authors perceive with developers, and others in the user groups, concerning transit issues is a ""lack of knowledge"" about transit. They think of transit in a negative way. ""Most cannot conceive of using transit for their basic travel. There is a lack of knowledge of the basics of good pedestrian access and how to provide good connections from buildings to transit service. Further, there are few champions of the idea and a hesitancy to be early adopters of the concept.""  1   Suggestions for improving the chances of implementation of transit sensitive suburban land use design and acceptance by developers include the following.   Increase awareness of transit service design by informing developers (and government personnel) of how transit is operated, the economics of transit, and the physical factors in transit route location. Conduct market research to identify market segments that may be attracted to live and work in transit based communities. In order to obtain investment commitments, a clearly demonstrated market potential must be demonstrated. Provide for transit-sensitive review of site plans and development proposals, either by a staff person with training in the transit service field, or by the transit agency if such a person is not on staff. Provide a transit checklist for potential developers that could be used informally to give developers information about which issues a municipality will consider when reviewing a proposal. Explore public/private opportunities for transit stop joint development. ""A most opportune location for joint development by the private and public sectors is at transit stops. Local governments should consider a proactive approach to development surrounding stops. Large stops can become part of the surrounding buildings. Developers may pay to construct sheltered stop areas that tie directly to their buildings and revert the actual right-of-way to the municipality. The main benefit for the developer is the increased patronage that will flow from the transit stop directly into the building. For the municipality, capital costs are reduced. At smaller stops, simple retail services can become part of joint development efforts. The presence of retail services at transit stops can be contracted out to businesses for different services. This also allows small businesses to become established in each neighborhood. Another alternative is to seek joint development opportunities with private companies. In return for providing some of the needed funds to develop the transit stop, a private firm is allowed to use the adjacent land for retail service provision.""      Buffkin, Tom, Roanne M.

Proceedings of the 1996 Annual Meeting of ITS America, Houston, Texas, April 15-18, 1996. Although the authors discuss one specific Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) project, the evaluation centered on key issues and lessons learned with the  2   partnership process. Key issues include the formulation of the partnership process; the expectations of the participants; legal issues and other issues and stumbling blocks; what participants liked most and least; how much time participants spent on the partnerships; what participants would change about the process; comparison of the public/private partnership process with the traditional Request for Proposal (RFP) process; and advice for those undertaking a public/private partnership. The authors determine that the major difficulties with carrying out the agreements are legal issues. These include proprietary issues and property rights; copyright and ownership; license agreements; confidentiality; and ability to carry out partnership agreements under the state's enabling legislation. ""FTA's Innovative Financing Handbook,"" Federal Transit Administration, U.S. Department of Transportation, May 1995, currently found at http://www/fta/dpt/gov/library/money/inovhnbk.html This work gives examples of innovative financing approaches that are available under the Federal Transit Act (Title 49 of the United States Code, Chapter 53). Specifically, ISTEA (1991) and Executive Order 12893 (1994) called for ""more efficient management and enhancement of our Nation's public transit infrastructure through the creation of public/private investment partnerships."" The Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century (TEA-21) continues these changes in traditional funding approaches. The handbook discusses several techniques that transit operators can use.  Joint development of transit assets--Capital Program funds can be used for a variety of joint development activities, as long as they are physically or functionally related to a transit project and they enhance the effectiveness of the transit project. If the joint development relates to transit supportive development in FTA's ""Livable Communities Initiative"", FTA allows a great deal of flexibility in funding. Super turnkey and private financing also called Build/Operate/Transfer (BOT)--The ""Super Turnkey"" process which was authorized in Section 3019 of the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 (ISTEA) is one where the project engineers or project management consortium undertake to build, operate for a time, and transfer a facility to the purchaser. Purchasing, deliveries, and scheduling are directed by the Turnkey Manager. As a result, construction delays, start-up difficulties, disagreements about change orders and project timing are minimized, resulting in lower project costs and reduced litigation.    3     Toll revenue credits--ISTEA provides that toll revenues on public roads and bridges expended for capital investment may count as local match for Federal grant funds in a specific year. Since different modes of transportation are interconnected, capital expenditures to reduce congestion in a particular corridor benefit all modes in that corridor including automobiles, transit buses, and rail systems.  ""Funding Strategies for Public Transportation-Casebook,"" TCRP Report 31, Volume 2, Transportation Research Board: Washington, D.C., 1998. This report presents case studies on creative methods for generating revenue for public transportation capital and operating costs. It identifies external funding sources, such as dedicated taxes and transit impact fees. Agency-generated funds are also examined and include turnkey procurement, public-private partnerships, and joint development. Each case study includes lessons learned and contact information. ""Growing Smart Legislative Guidebook: Model Statutes for Planning and the Management of Change,"" American Planning Association, 2002 Edition, currently found at http://www.planning.org/Guidebook/View.asp Incentive zoning is a technique that grants incentives or bonuses to developers on condition that certain physical, social, or cultural benefits or amenities are provided for the community. Bonuses are usually in the form of added permissible density to a development project. Waivers of regulatory requirements or fees are also used. Community benefits include transit access.

Proceedings of the 1996 Annual Meeting of ITS America. Houston, Texas, April 15-18, 1996. While the author focuses on Intelligent Transportation Systems affordability, he also makes several important points concerning the motives for private sector involvement in public/private partnerships, as well as the risks for the private sector investor. He states that the private sector stands to gain more prestige and recognition as a provider of a service or set of services to the public. The private company may need to utilize data collected using government owned equipment and facilities. The government may decide to allow this data to be used only by companies that would be willing to enter into agreements with the  4   public sector agency to reflect a public benefit from providing the information. Private firms may create income by selling a system or through value added resources that would provide a percentage to the public sector for providing the raw data resources. Public sector barriers such as lack of enabling legislation and a lack of dialogue with private entities regarding partnerships increase private sector risks involving time and money. Other examples of risks that the author cites are stringent regulations, especially regarding right-of-way, and the lack of public commitment to a project. Hinebaugh, Dennis, Laurel Land, and Lisa Staes. ""Public Transit Access to Private Property,"" Center for Urban Transportation Research, August 2000. This report, completed for the Florida Department of Transportation, examines the issues surrounding the legal rights of public transit agencies to enter and serve private property. A written survey was conducted of public transit operators to identify agency experiences, both positive and negative, related to their bus systems' access to private property. A written survey was also conducted of private property developers, owners, and managers. The purpose of this survey was to identify major concerns related to allowing direct vehicle access to public transit providers. ""Innovative Financing: Evaluation of Pricing Options and Alternative Financing Mechanisms,"" Department of City Planning, City of New York, Transportation Division. August 1999. This report is an examination of current innovative transportation and transit funding approaches used across the United States. Financing tools are broken down into three categories: revenue raising, borrowing, and cost cutting. Private participation revenue raising tools that could apply to bus transit operations include the following.  Advertising revenue--In 1998, the transit agency in Orlando, FL (LYNX) had 70 of its 250 buses wrapped entirely in advertisements. Called ""shrink wrap"", this approach can generate substantial revenue. Generally, production costs vary for whole bus wraps and painting vary. The advertiser pays for the $8,000 to $10,000 wrapping, removal, and repainting in addition to the monthly ad fee. The rate for a whole bus wrap varies from $1,500 per month, with a 6-month minimum guarantee  5          in a small media market to $6,500 per month for one bus in a major media market. Air rights--Properties owned by transit agencies which have unused air rights may be sold to private entities for development subject to zoning restrictions. Joint development/facility connection fees--This approach involves the leasing of agency land to developers, who pay rent to the transit provider and develop the land. Fees can also be collected from a landowner or private tenant to physically connect their facility, usually an office building or retail establishment to a transit station or park-and-ride via a passageway. Leasing rights-of-way--Transit operators lease the space within their transportation corridors to telecommunications or other companies that use the area to install cabling or utility connections. Station concessions--Leasing concession stands on transit property provides steady income as well as additional amenities and convenience to those using the transportation system. Transit impact fees--This fee is charged to businesses in specific areas that would stand to benefit most from the new or improved service brought about by a specific transit improvement.  Markus, Henry S., 1998. ""1992-1997 Westside Light Rail Station Area Design, Planning & Development Program-Accomplishments and Lessons Learned,"" Rail-Volution '98, September 12-16, 1998. One mechanism that governments and transit agencies are using to encourage private funding of transit facilities/operations is transit-oriented development. There are many references in the general literature to this subject. This paper details the methods used to set up and successfully utilize a TOD project that included a rail station and bus service. The author recommends that public officials make standards clear and objective. For example, language should be specific: use ""shall"", not ""may""; adopt ""standards"", not ""guidelines"". Markus states: ""Mixed use TODs are the most effective type of development for reducing external automobile trips but are difficult to do. Public incentives are necessary. Mixed use projects can be vertical...or horizontal...Nationally, there is growing experience with mixed use urban villages (neo-traditional development). Combined with transit, this is a powerful and workable marketing concept."" One important aspect the author addresses is public/private partnerships. He advises transit agencies to partner with local government, major property owners and developers. ""Offer to split the cost of master planning but require a 50% private match. Be willing to modify transit facility location and design to take maximum advantage of major development projects. Define roles and responsibilities, and  6   set clear joint objectives at the beginning for land uses, density, parking, block size, incentives, street connectivity, public involvement and so on. Either jointly hire a consulting team or create two teams, one for the private participants and another for the public. Use a charrette process with the decision makers and consultants in face to face discussion."" ""Summary of Provisions of RCW 47.46,"" (amended in 1995 and 1996), the State of Washington, currently found at http://ltc.leg.wa.gov/manual97/resou221.htm The legislative intent of this law is to allow the Department of Transportation to test the feasibility of building privately funded transportation systems and facilities through the use of innovative agreements with the private sector. Therefore, WSDOT is encouraged to take advantage of new opportunities provided by federal legislation that allow federal funds and programs to encourage private financing of transportation capital improvements. The DOT should enter into public private agreements for the private financing of these transportation capital improvements. ""Transit Oriented Development-Creating Accessible and Multi-Modal Neighborhoods,"" TDM Encyclopedia, Victoria Transport Policy Institute, currently found at http://www.vtpi.org/tdm/tdm45.htm As noted above, the subject of transit-oriented development has received much attention in the transportation literature reviewed. A good description of what TOD is and how it can be implemented can be found in this encyclopedia, along with case studies and resources for additional information. Volinski, Joel, ""Lessons Learned in Transit Efficiencies, Revenue Generation, and Cost Reduction,"" Center for Urban Transportation Research, University of South Florida, Tampa, Florida, June 1997. This report examines ways in which transit agencies are generating revenue or reducing costs through five methods, one of which is public/private partnerships. The author summarizes the lessons learned about partnerships that were provided in the survey responses of 75 public transit agencies.  Hospitals, malls, universities, employers, tourist attractions, etc. have typically initiated partnerships with transit agencies. Transit systems should promote their interest in partnering and stay in touch with the needs of the broader community.  7           Transit is all about linkages, not just for getting people from point A to point B, but linking public transit with community goals...those linkages should be positively exploited. If local share for capital projects can be obtained from other public or private partners, the transit agency can use their own limited resources for other capital or operating needs. Decentralize and customize transit services to local needs with the help of local sponsors. Maintain close ties with agencies that have complementary community improvement goals, such as Air Quality Districts, state EPAs, Downtown Development Authorities, Councils of Government, and MPOs. Use a colorful marketing approach to advertise for partners. Avoid bureaucratic language that emphasizes process and constraints. Talk about opportunities. Be extremely responsive to expressions of interest. Be flexible in negotiations. Many entities see public transportation in a positive light. If transit agencies develop strong partnerships with these, they can save money while also increasing ridership and revenue.  http://www.nahb.net/growth_issues/fees&taxes/growth_impact.html  McNamara, Bob, ""Development Impact Fees: A Role for State Enabling Legislation,"" National Association of Home Builders, currently found at  This paper examines issues of fairness and legal sufficiency pertaining to the calculation and administration of impact fees. The author reviewed forty-six local impact fee ordinances in the United States, and concludes that state enabling legislation may help to reduce errors in areas that are prone to legal challenges by establishing uniform requirements and guidelines. Morris, Marya, ""Creating Transit-Supportive Land-Use Regulations,"" Planning Advisory Service, Report Number 468, American Planning Association, December, 1996. This report presents examples of code provisions, standards, and guidelines that offer creative implementation strategies to encourage transit, pedestrian, and bicycle travel. The ordinances come from many states and address a variety of community situations.  8   ""The Principles of Smart Development,"" Planning Advisory Service, Report Number 479, American Planning Association, Chicago, September 1998. Smart development incorporates the following principles: conserve valuable land, energy, and facilities resources; offer people multiple convenient transportation options; relieve traffic congestion and air pollution; offer residents a variety of dwelling choices; and, create attractive community-oriented neighborhoods. The sixth principle is implementation, which is the key to success. The report states that since regulatory and financing systems primarily serve single-use, conventional, and suburban development patterns and designs, builders often stick with this model, choosing what the existing system encourages rather than spending time and money trying to overcome barriers to smart development. These barriers include local regulations (codes, standards, and processes) that act as obstacles to smart development. Lack of flexibility in subdivision and zoning codes discourages smart development with its smaller lots, higher densities, mixed uses, narrower streets, and emphasis on providing a range of transportation options. Needed variances for smart projects can lead to costly delays. Other barriers to smart development are market conditions, development and process costs, financing, and community involvement. A specific obstacle to bus transit is the fact that communities fail to recognize that increasing density within a quarter-mile of a transit stop also increases the likelihood of people walking to use transit. In order to encourage transit-supportive development, or transit-oriented development, municipalities should mandate transit-oriented development along transit corridors through the establishment of overlay zones and revised street standards including internal connectivity standards. ""Transit-Friendly Streets: Design and Traffic Management Strategies to Support Livable Communities,"" TCRP Report 33, Transportation Research Board, Washington, D.C., 1998. This report states that transit-friendly streets make transit use more efficient and convenient while making the street less convenient for automobiles while still accommodating them. Transit-friendly streets accomplish four goals: establish a clear priority for transit vehicle operations with convenient, accessible transit stops; reduce conflicts between cars and other vehicles, including reduction of vehicle speed; create a strong pedestrian orientation; and, are a part of larger community development or livability enhancing strategies. Several strategies for  9   accomplishing this are discussed including creating priority lanes for transit vehicles and providing amenities for pedestrians and transit riders. ""Transit-Oriented Tax Exemption,"" City of Gresham, Oregon, currently found at http://www.ci.gresham.or.us/departments/cedd/bap/infoandincentives/TOTE.htm  The city's web site explains that the transit-oriented tax exemption (TOTE) is a targeted development incentive that grants limited, ten-year property tax exemptions for qualifying new transit-oriented developments in certain areas of the city.  10"

The plan, which focuses on 12 municipalities in the western and southern region of Cumberland County, has the following goals:      Address the existing needs for jobs, infrastructure and economic development Provide balance between economic development and environmental protection Achieve intermunicipal agreement on development goals and strategies Develop a planning and implementation agenda Obtain plan endorsement  opportunities for its residents. A Smart Growth plan was viewed as a means to properly plan for new development. Starting in the Fall of 2001, and concluding in the Spring of 2004, the CDC led an intensive public involvement process which served to gather input on the desired direction of the Western/Southern Cumberland Region, and which culminated in the Western/Southern Cumberland Region Strategic Plan. The CDC was assisted in this process by OrthRodgers & Associates, Inc, a consulting planning firm, along with Maser Consulting and S. Huffman Associates.  Study Area Cumberland County is located on the southern end of New Jersey, with frontage on the Delaware Bay (Map 1, Regional Location). As of 2000, it had a population of 146,438, ranking 16th among New Jersey counties. Its land area of 388 square miles places it 5th among New Jersey counties. The most rural of New Jersey counties, it is also in some respects the most isolated. It has no Interstate highway, and the one limited access highway is Route 55, which extends north to the Philadelphia-Camden metropolitan area. The County has considerable natural beauty, but, situated on the Delaware Bay, it does not have the beaches which attract millions of visitors to the popular shore communities in Cape May County to the east. Cumberland County is perhaps best known for the agricultural and nursery products it ships to cities in the middle Atlantic region and along the Eastern seaboard.  This volume is the heart of the Western/Southern Cumberland Region Strategic Plan: it contains the identification of centers, the strategic plan, and the planning and implementation agenda for both the region and for the individual municipalities. Taken together, this report provides the blueprint for planning efforts in the WSCR communities for years to come. The volume was preceded by a series of other planning documents that laid the foundation for the Plan. The other documents include:  Municipal Profiles  April 2003  Regional Profile  April 2003  Potentials for Economic Development, Phase I Report: Secondary Data Review and Analysis  April 2003  Potentials for Economic Development, Phase II Report: Market Feasibility Study  April 2003  History The WSCRSP has been spearheaded by the Cumberland Development Corporation (CDC), a non-profit, 501(c)6 corporation founded to promote economic development in the rural communities of Cumberland County. Cumberland County is one of the least developed counties in New Jersey. Residents and businesspersons would like to retain its rural environment and its high quality of life, while attracting development that will enable the County to offer adequate employment  The Plan - Draft Western/Southern Cumberland Region Strategic Plan December 2003  Page 1    The WSCR study area itself consists of the following municipalities, as listed below and depicted on Map 2:             Bridgeton City Commercial Township Deerfield Township Downe Township Fairfield Township Greenwich Township Hopewell Township Lawrence Township Maurice River Township Borough of Shiloh Stow Creek Township Upper Deerfield Township  same time, however, there are pockets of poverty even in the rural communities. Median household income and median housing values are well below the state average. Economic development initiatives are needed in the WSCR communities, to prevent them from slipping further below the median income. This Strategic Plan thus pursues the goal of economic development, in a way respectful of the need to protect the important natural resources in the area and the traditional industries, such as farming and fishing, based on those resources.  Public Involvement Public involvement has been an integral part of the creation of the Plan. It has occurred principally through two venues: the Steering Committee and the Advisory Committee. The Steering Committee consists of the mayors from each of the municipalities, along with representatives from the Cumberland County Department of Planning and Development, the Bridgeton Area Chamber of Commerce, the NJ Office of Smart Growth (NJOSG) and the CDC. The Steering Committee has provided overall direction to the study. There will be seven meetings through the study. The Advisory Committee embraces a wide cross-section of community representatives. Close to 90 persons have been invited to each Advisory Committee meeting, with attendance typically varying from 30 to 40. The representation includes the business community, state and local officials, environmental community, community action agencies, educators, farmers, utilities, and others. To maximize public involvement, the Advisory Committee meetings have been organized using a workshop format. Following an initial presentation by the planning consultants, attendees have been organized into discussion groups. The input of these discussion groups was incorporated into a ""vision matrix"" for the Region, which identified the most critical needs and issues. This vision matrix, in turn, was eventually developed into the planning and implementation agenda for the Plan. There will be four Advisory Committee meetings throughout the study.  With the exception of Bridgeton, all of the WSCR communities are rural, with a relatively low population density. The combined population of the 12 communities in 2000 was slightly over 63,000, making up 43% of the County's population. Very little population growth has occurred since 1990, with virtually all of the growth due to the prison population. Unlike much of the rest of New Jersey, the WSCR area has seen only modest suburban development. The study area offers some of New Jersey's most important natural resources: 80,000 acres of prime farmlands concentrated in the north and west sections of the study area, and pristine rivers and coastal watersheds in the south. The area has great natural beauty, and the many small historic villages and hamlets add to the region's appeal. The traditional industries still remain  such as oystering, fishing, sand mining, glass making and food processing  but these offer a smaller share of employment than they once did, and a need exists for a greater diversity and number of industries and services. Historically rural, the study area communities lack the larger concentrations of poverty found in the urban communities of Vineland, Millville and Bridgeton. Economic development in desirable in these communities, and some development has already been spurred by the establishment of the Empowerment Zone and Urban Enterprise Zone encompassing these areas. At the  The Plan - Draft Western/Southern Cumberland Region Strategic Plan December 2003  Page 3    There will be two Public Meetings conducted during the study, at the halfway point and shortly after preparation of the draft Plan. For each public meeting, a formal presentation is made, followed by a question and answer period. Attendees are also surveyed. A series of newsletters has been published throughout the study to inform the public. These have been made available in hard copy and posted on the CDC website. The CDC website has made meeting minutes and reports available to the public at large. As described in the section below, a CD-ROM, video, and poster summarizing planning efforts in Cumberland County were prepared as part of this study, and have also served to inform the public on planning activities. At the beginning of the study, there were surveys of representatives of each municipality to identify key planning goals for the region. The surveys expressed broad agreement in many areas, as follows:      All of the responding communities identified open space, agricultural and environmental resources as main assets; All of the responding communities identified the lack of infrastructure as a main concern, with lack of ratables and job opportunities a close second; Most communities would consider planning tools to limit the loss of farmland; Most communities would like to see tourism related development, as well as light industry and agricultural industries; The communities would welcome a variety of development programs, including funding for infrastructure, tax incentives, assistance with permitting, loan programs, and others.  summary is made available by the Cumberland County Planning Department on a CD-ROM entitled Planning for the Future: A Summary of Cumberland County Planning Initiatives. A poster is also being prepared to highlight County planning efforts. In conjunction with this task, a video was prepared, also entitled Cumberland County: Planning for the Future. The video, intended for the layperson, describes the process of strategic planning in Cumberland County. The video project was the recipient of the 2003 Public Education Award from the New Jersey chapter of the American Planning Association. The County plans to show the video in a variety of venues. A series of reports established the foundation for the Plan: Municipal Profiles  these summarize land uses, key demographic trends, and major planning issues within each of the 12 municipalities. The Municipal Profiles were based upon review of municipal master plans and other reports, and interviews with local officials. Regional Profiles  these provide a comprehensive overview of existing and future conditions in the WSCR study area, and highlights prominent issues that should be addressed, within the areas of: Land use  the largest land usea are wetlands and forest ;amds, both with about one-third of the land area. Farming is the most important industry, accounting for 5,000 jobs, and 12,000 of the 68,000 acres in farmland are preserved. Hopewell, Upper Deerfield, Stow Creek and Lawrence have the greatest amount of assessed farmland. Significant sand mining operations are found in Maurice River, Commercial, Downe and Fairfield. State parks and wildlife areas account for over 56,000 acres, four PSE&G conservation sites account for over 10,000 acres, and non-profit lands over 13,000 acres. Historic and natural resources  there are over 200 properties on the Cumberland County Register of Historic Sites, and two historic preservation ordinances, in Bridgeton and Greenwich.  Background Reports The Cumberland County Department of Planning and Development has overseen the preparation of various regional plans in recent years, many of which have focused on the importance of balancing economic development and environmental preservation. As part of the WSCRSP, a summary was prepared of these plans, both as a foundation of the Plan and to increase public awareness of these planning efforts. This The Plan - Draft Western/Southern Cumberland Region Strategic Plan December 2003  Page 5   Transportation  the need for regional transportation projects was cited as the highest priority. Better access to the west was listed by South Jersey Transportation Planning Organization (SJTPO) as a transportation improvement that could facilitate economic growth. Sewer and water infrastructure  CCUA provides sewer service to all of Bridgeton; to parts of Hopewell and Upper Deerfield; and to a small section of Fairfield. Shiloh, Upper Deerfield, Fairfield, and Hopewell are approved for future sewer expansion, and Stow Creek and Greenwich are in the CCUA planning area. The remainder of the study area is within the Rural Wastewater Management Area. Expansion of sewer to serve communities such as Rosenhayn Village in Deerfield and Port Norris is a critical issue. NJDEP has indicated that there appears to be a water supply deficit, but renewal of the Watershed planning process is needed to address this issue. Community facilities the County lags behind the state in educational attainment. Economic development  As of 2000, there were 59,000 jobs in the County, and about 15,000 in the study area. Retail and office development is minor. State planning areas and proposed and designated centers were also discussed. Potentials for Economic Development  this market study analyzed the potential for economic development in the region. The first volume examined various economic data, and the second volume offered strategies for promoting growth. The report noted that that study area is less accessible than other locations with direct access to I-295, and industrial land is thus lower priced. There is not immediate demand for industrial acreage in the WSCR study area, with about 1,200 acres of industrial park land already available  virtually all in Millville and Vineland  and another 1,000 to 1,500 acres in the planning stages. The study recommends that the Cumberland County Improvement Authority establish a loan guarantee program for micro-businesses, and that the Urban Enterprise Zone be extended to cover a proposed intermunicipal industrial park.  Industries that should be strongly targeted and recruited include manufacturing industries such as glass manufacturing, packaging and shipping container manufacturing, or business services such as commercial printing. Potential spin-offs from hospitality include restaurants, cleaning services and specialty stores. Fresh food and value-added food processing should be a priority. To support the production of fruits and vegetables, the study recommends bringing the product directly to its destination, through targeting additional food processors to establish plants, and encouraging the development of a mechanism for direct delivery of produce to food stores and restaurants. Alternatively, farmers markets should continue to be developed as part of an ecotourism strategy. Aquaculture can also support the farming industry by supplying a market for some of its by-products. Ecotourism strategies to build on natural, historic and recreational areas was extensively discussed in the market study.  The Plan - Draft Western/Southern Cumberland Region Strategic Plan December 2003  Page 6   BUILD-OUT ANALYSIS Process An analysis was conducted for the WSCR study area to determine the potential number of housing units and jobs at full build-out. For this analysis, zoning districts for each municipality were organized into composite zoning districts with similar land uses and densities grouped together. The composite zoning districts were then mapped in the Geographic Information System (GIS) to illustrate the generalized zoning in the WSCR (Composite Zoning, Map 3). The districts were classified according to these specifications: Composite Zoning Classifications Residential Uses Definition/ Density Rural Residential 0.1 units/acre Very Low Density Residential 0.25-0.3 units/Acre Low Density Residential Average of 0.5 units/acre Medium Density Residential Average of 2 units/acre High Density Residential Average of 6 units/acre Residential uses permitted with minimum lot size greater than 5 acres Very Low Density Agriculture Residential uses permitted with minimum lot size from 1-5 acres Low Density Agriculture Non Residential Uses Commercial Commercial and business uses Conservation/Institutional/Public Conserved land, institutional and public uses Industrial Industrial Residential and commercial uses permitted in same Mixed Use district  final estimate of developable land's acreage indicates the land that could be developed with housing units or commercial or industrial uses. The residential build-out numbers were calculated by dividing the minimum lot area into the total area available for each actual zoning district. For example, if there is 435,600 square feet of land available in a particular zone and the minimum lot area for that zone is 43,560, ten homes could be built within that zone. The number of housing units built in the years 1996-2000 was deducted from the housing yield to account for units that have been developed since the 1995 NJDEP land use layer was prepared. Potential employment was calculated through multiplying the amount of available acres within each zone by the average number of jobs per acre. Existing employment density in the WSCR study area was calculated to determine the appropriate average. It was determined that the City of Bridgeton could sustain an average of 16.1 jobs/acre while the rest of the municipalities within the study area have an average of 5.8 jobs/acre. For example, in most of the study area it would be assumed that a 10-acre site would yield roughly 60 jobs. For areas of mixed use zoning, both residential and non-residential uses are permitted in the same district. It was assumed that the developable land would be built half residential and half non-residential. There are some exceptions to the above process for the build-out of residential units in agricultural zones. Hopewell, Shiloh, Stow Creek, and Upper Deerfield Townships have restrictions against building new roads in agricultural zones, and these districts thus require special residential build-out calculations. For these districts, the total linear length of existing roads was calculated and divided by the minimum lot width for each municipal agricultural zone. The resulting number was then multiplied by two in the assumption that both sides of the road were undeveloped. For example, if there is a 1,000-foot road in an undeveloped agricultural zone and the municipality's minimum lot width for single family homes was 250, an additional eight homes would be yielded in the agricultural zone.  The total areas of developed and undeveloped land within each municipality were calculated through conducting a GIS analysis of NJDEP 1995 land use/ land cover data. To determine lands that cannot be built upon, all ""constrained"" lands were first identified. Constrained lands are either unsuitable for development  such as wetlands  or permanently protected, such as parks. The constrained lands were merged with the developed lands to form a layer of undevelopable lands. The areas of undevelopable lands were then subtracted from the total areas within each municipality, resulting in a mapping layer that depicts developable lands (Map 4). The areas of developable land were calculated for each composite zoning district, and a 15% deduction was applied in order to account for future infrastructure improvements. The  Analysis Table 1 (Residential Build-out) shows the potential build-out calculations for residential units in the WSCR study area. Almost 70,000 acres are Page 7  The Plan - Draft Western/Southern Cumberland Region Strategic Plan December 2003   developable within the existing residential districts; at current zoning, these areas could yield 36,000 housing units. Table 2 (Jobs Build-out) shows that approximately 6,700 acres are suitable for non-residential development within the WSCR area. This land has the potential to produce 41,000 new jobs in both commercial and industrial uses. Almost 16,000 of the potential housing units could be located in the agricultural zones. Preservation of agricultural lands is a high priority in WSCR municipalities. Acquisition of farming easements will reduce this number; however, alternative and innovative zoning techniques should be considered to direct development to centers. It should also be noted that the build-out analysis was conducted using vacant lands. Lands that are under-utilized and have redevelopment potential were not included. Incorporation of these lands would result in even greater build-out yield.

The issues were organized into the following categories:  Natural Areas;  Historic;  Mining;  Agriculture;  Transportation;  Sewer and Water;  Community Facilities and Services;  Housing;  Economic;  Intermunicipal Cooperation; and,  State Plan Endorsement. Key strategies have been developed for each of these issue areas. As translated into the regional planning and implementation agenday, these form the heart of the Plan. These strategies are presented below.  municipal master plans and the County Open Space Plan should specify and prioritize remaining natural areas that are worthy of preservation. These plans should also indicate when further acquisition of open space areas will not be in a municipality's interest, because such areas are needed to fulfill other important municipal goals. Because these lands are an important public good, and critical to the County's important eco-tourism industry, these lands should be highly accessible. A comprehensive inventory should evaluate the adequacy of the signing for these natural areas, both for tourists trying to locate these areas and for tourists within the natural areas. An inventory should also document whether the roads and other facilities, such as rest areas, are properly maintained. Other, less visible aspects of management, such as proper security, should also be evaluated. Some of these responsibilities fall upon the municipalities, and some on the State or County. In all cases, however, it should be the goal to maintain visitorfriendly natural areas. Following the inventory, needed improvements should be prioritized, and possible funding sources identified, so improvements can occur in a comprehensive manner. PILOT Programs A robust PILOT (payment in lieu of taxes) program is recommended to help pay the cost of needed services or improvements on lands owned by the State or non-profit organizations. As noted earlier, municipalities must pay for services, such as road maintenance or fire protection, for natural areas even though these properties make no contribution to the municipal revenues. This is, of course, true across the state. However, in Cumberland County the lands owned by public entities or non-profit groups are so considerable that an unusual burden is placed on certain municipalities.  Natural Areas Coordinated Planning A significant share of lands in the WSCR study area are permanently preserved, either by the state in parks or wildlife management areas (56,000 acres) or by private for-profit or non-profit groups (24,000 acres). These lands provide both an opportunity and a problem for study area municipalities. Because so many lands are preserved, residents of Cumberland County know that they will always be surrounded by considerable natural beauty, and that a ""critical mass"" exists for an eco-tourist industry. However, the large number of acres in state or non-profit hands also limits the ability of municipalities to foster the development of lands and thus create jobs. Many miles of Township roads run through these natural areas, and the Townships must keep these in good condition, even when taxes are not paid on these properties. Given the large percentage of these lands in the Townships, the most fundamental strategy for natural areas is to improve the coordination of the County and municipalities with the State and non-profit conservation groups, particularly with regards to acquisition. Open space elements in The Plan - Draft Western/Southern Cumberland Region Strategic Plan December 2003  Page 11   A PILOT is an attempt to compensate local governments for lost tax revenue. It is a way to generate funding to help improve access and other needed infrastructure and services for public lands. PILOTS already exist in the study area. To take one example, PSE&G established an estuary enhancement area in Greenwich Township (as well as in Commercial and Maurice River.) Although the estuary enhancement area was set up under a non-profit subsidiary, PSE&G established a PILOT with Greenwich Township whereby it contributes to the Township approximately the amount of money it would have been responsible for if the land were taxed as private, undeveloped land. The PILOT is indexed to the inflation rate, so the contribution will continue to increase in the future. Further, PSE&G provides its own security, by contracting through another natural non-profit group in the area, the Nature Conservancy. It has also contributed to signing improvements in the area. It would be ideal if the PILOTS created by other non-profits in the area were similar to that established by PSE&G. It would also benefit the study area municipalities if the State, recognizing the special circumstances of the large percentage of lands in public ownership and the minimal tax base of much of the study area, would provide or increase PILOT funding for WSCR municipalities. It could be established, as part of this understanding, that the payments to the municipalities would result in direct improvements to infrastructure in, or leading to, the natural areas, as well as for services to the natural areas. PILOT payments could be based, in part, on the percentage of lands within a municipality that are not taxable. Rural Enterprise Zone In addition to an upgraded the creation of a ""Rural management capabilities conservation, maintenance PILOT program, the WSCR should evaluate Enterprise Zone"" to help develop local and generate economic incentives for and revitalization.  be used for marketing, job training, small business loans, or other stated improvements. Centers in rural areas could receive special consideration in such a program. It should be noted that a Rural Enterprise Zone would require policymaking and legislation at the state level, and thus would likely be one of the longer-term strategies. Cohansey Greenway System Concept The Cohansey River is a special resource for the Region. It runs through Upper Deerfield, Bridgeton, Fairfield, Hopewell and Greenwich. The Cohansey River Management Plan (1998) was intended to balance the conflicting issues of environmental protection and economic development along the river. Significant public conservation lands exist along the river including PES&G Estuary Enhancement sites, preserved farmlands, parklands and wildlife management areas. The lower portion of the Cohansey River has been identified as a particularly outstanding example of the CAFRA zone, due to its vast wildlife habitat. Public access along the river is limited and the value of this river corridor could be enhanced with better public access. The Cohansey River Management Plan recognizes the importance of keeping a navigable river channel up to Route 49, and connecting the waterfronts in Bridgeton, Fairton and Greenwich to the Delaware Bay. The Plan also states that people should have access to areas along the river in the developed areas of Bridgeton, Fairton and Greenwich. The development of an intermunicipal Cohansey River Greenway Plan would assist in the planning, implementation and management of a greenway system or multipurpose path to provide access and recreational opportunities along the river. It will serve the Region and can also be an ecotourism destination with links to the Bayshore bicycle trail and the New Jersey Coastal Heritage Trail. There are sections of the Cohansey River Corridor in public ownership which can be established in the initial section of the greenway from Sunset Lake in Upper Deerfield to Cohansey Park and the waterfront promenade in Bridgeton. Other sections may require acquisition of public easements to link current public land holdings. Special techniques may be required such as elevated boardwalks to traverse sensitive environmental areas  Similar to an Urban Enterprise Zone, but in this case intended for lowerincome rural areas, a Rural Enterprise Zone could be established with a number of benefits. Qualified businesses could be made eligible for tax incentives, marketing support and business counseling. Certified businesses would collect a sales tax of only three percent. Funds could be reinvested in municipal business development programs which would  The Plan - Draft Western/Southern Cumberland Region Strategic Plan December 2003  Page 12   such as the wetlands. Funding can be sought through the Green Acres Trust Fund and other sources for planning and development of this greenway system. Marine-Based Industry/Recreation The importance of supporting marine-based industry and recreation activities was identified as a need in the regional vision workshop. A breached dike on the Cohansey River should be restored, and dredging and other maintenance is needed in the Maurice River, Fortescue Creek and Fairton Marina. Study area municipalities should identify other areas in need of improvement, continue maintenance of existing efforts underway and coordinate with NJDEP for priority funding.  historic preservation ordinance. Currently, only Bridgeton and Greenwich have historic preservation ordinances. Municipalities can also establish informal advisory committees if there is not sufficient personnel for an historic preservation commission as provided for in the Municipal Land Use Law. A planning board can also act as an historic preservation commission for smaller towns. Finally, New Jersey can abet historic preservation by creating an historic home tax credit. Currently, tax credits can be used for buildings renovated by county or municipal governments, or non-profit groups. Protecting Scenic Roads As part of a strategy to promote areas of outstanding scenic, natural, recreational, cultural, historic or archaeological significance, an effort to protect those scenic landscapes should be encouraged. These include the open farmlands surrounding Greenwich and Othello, and the marshes visible from CR 553 in Downe or Lawrence Townships. Open views across farmlands and fields and the tidal lands are an important part of the landscape setting. Protecting these unique aspects of the landscape will support ecotourism opportunities drawing visitors to the Region. These features are also important to the quality of life of the study area municipalities. These scenic roads and views can be protected from the encroachment of development, through strategies described in the following section. Scenic Roadways Cumberland County should prepare a Scenic Roadway Plan to sections of county roadways that are attractive, and along which bicycling or walking would be an enjoyable experience. guidelines should be prepared for use in the Cumberland Planning Board's development review process for projects on identify driving, Design County County  Historic Protection of Historic Resources Cumberland County has historic resources which are important to its sense of place and its attractiveness as a visitor destination. These resources make the area a viable destination. There are two historic districts, in Bridgeton and Greenwich. Even outside these two districts, however, there are older centers with numerous historic structures, such as Dorchester and Leesburg in Maurice River Township. Port Norris has a number of fine historic structures on Main Street in need of repair. While many centers may not have the same concentration of historic properties as Greenwich and Bridgeton, taken together, a tour of historic areas can provide an enjoyable driving or bicycling excursion for visitors to Cumberland County. It should also be noted that the rehabilitation of historic structures in disrepair can help generate local economic activity, by employing local craftsmen. Municipalities should thus make an extensive effort to document and evaluate its existing historical resources. Properties could be added to the National Historic Landmarks Register, and the National or New Jersey Register of Historic Places. To fully develop their potential as historic attractions, municipalities can take a more active role through establishing an historic preservation commission, developing a strong historic preservation element in their master plan and adopting an The Plan - Draft Western/Southern Cumberland Region Strategic Plan December 2003  Page 13   roadways. These guidelines can also serve as model guidelines to be incorporated into municipal ordinances. Monmouth County, NJ serves as an example for this strategy. The County adopted a scenic roadway plan, which provides guidelines for developers to follow in installing a wide range of features, including curbs, drainage, grading and clearing, guiderails, bridges and culverts, detention/retention basins, fences and walls, and identification signs. The County can also consider preparing a scenic corridor management plan, which involves mapping the scenic viewshed along a scenic roadway, describing the notable scenic features, and identifying necessary improvements and management tools, such as local ordinances. Municipal Tools Following creation of a County Scenic Roadway Plan, municipalities are encouraged to adopt various guidelines or ordinances to more directly protect desirable landscapes. Among the tools that municipalities can use to preserve scenic roadways and historic resources are:  Scenic corridor overlay district  preserves a viewshed through requiring development to be sited in the least visible location of a viewshed, such as along the periphery of a site or where natural feature can provide screening. Physical structures within a scenic roadway buffer could be strictly regulated;  Agricultural district  restricts development to agriculture or nursery operation;  Design district  regulates the physical appearance of structures; and  Historic district  regulates alteration to historic structures. Scenic Byway Corridor Management Plan A scenic roadway can also be designated at the state or national level. The New Jersey Department of Transportation created the New Jersey Scenic Byways Program in 1995; its principal goal is to preserve the views of the state's landscape from a roadway. A route must be at least five miles in length to qualify, and is nominated by the State Scenic Byways Program Advisory Committee and the Commissioner of NJ DEP. Routes that are designated as state scenic byways may also be designated as a scenic byway at the national level, and be eligible to receive Federal Scenic Byway discretionary grant funding. Recently, a The Plan - Draft Western/Southern Cumberland Region Strategic Plan December 2003  $150,000 grant was provided from the Public Lands Highway Discretionary Funds Program to develop a scenic corridor through the Salem-Cumberland-Cape May area, constituting the Delsea region of the New Jersey Coastal Heritage Trail. WSCR municipalities should support and coordinate with the project to ensure that important local attractions are included, thus promoting the region. A scenic byway plan should include a scenic inventory, long-term management and maintenance recommendations, ""viewsheds"" management, and describe economic benefits and funding needs and sources. Some communities nominate a scenic byway to increase tourism and bolster their economic base; others use it as a way to conserve the byway corridor resources that reflect the community's character. Additional benefits include federal funding, recognition, increased tourism, technical assistance in the scenic byway process, planning for protection and managed growth and consideration for financial assistance for plan implementation. To enhance the economic vitality of communities along the Mullica River corridor and Delaware Bay region, the Pinelands Rural Economic Development Program has suggested designating a New Jersey and National Scenic Byway, which would promote more widespread recognition and appreciation of the natural and cultural assets of the Pinelands.  Mining Proactive Planning Sand mining and glass manufacturing has historically had a profound effect on the economy of Cumberland County. There are almost 2,000 acres of land developed to mineral extraction in the WSCR study area, with most municipalities containing at least one sand mine facility. The mining activities extend beyond municipal borders and have intermunicipal effects. Both public and private lands are the site of sand mines. One of the issues identified for the study area is the need to proactively plan and regulate the activities on, and reclamation of, the mined lands. While many of the Cumberland County municipalities address mining activities in their own zoning ordinances and Master Plans (Downe, Commercial, Fairfield, Lawrence and Maurice River Townships), there has been an expressed interest in developing intermunicipal plans and a Page 14   model countywide reclamation ordinance so that municipalities and the region can establish common policies and goals. Reclamation Plans should be prepared before any mining activities begins and should be used to evaluate the best and future use of the land based upon its current zoning. WSCR municipalities have expressed interest in using reclaimed mine lands for everything from wildlife habitat to an off-road vehicle park. In addition, with mining such an important part of the economic and cultural heritage of the WSCR, it is recommended that the large sand mining companies create a museum or heritage facility that would demonstrate the importance of silica sands to the economy.  Agriculture Preserve Agriculture Agriculture has long been the backbone of Cumberland County's economy, generating over $2 billion per year and employing over 5,000 people. Given the prevalence of agricultural lands in the region, and the role of agriculture in the area's culture, farmland preservation is a critical issue. Because of its potential for combating suburban sprawl, and its assistance in sustaining an agricultural economy, farmland preservation should continue to be promoted in the study area. County Ranking The County should continue to develop its farmland preservation program, which stands as a model in the effort to prioritize parcels for preservation. The County is in the process of revising its farmland preservation program to better identify strategic lands; this effort will place a greater emphasis upon municipal agricultural zoning districts. As with all such programs, the need to develop a critical mass of preserved agricultural lands, and thus better maintain the viability of the agricultural industry, is key. Municipal master plans should also reflect farmland preservation goals and priority areas.  Farmland Easement Values Land values in Cumberland County are relatively low by New Jersey standards, which can be attributed in large part to the lack of development pressure in the area. Indeed, the ratio of accepted easement values to agricultural products sold is lower in Cumberland County than any other county in the state. There is concern that funding made available for farmland easements in Cumberland County by the New Jersey Department of Agriculture may actually be too low, and thus not be sufficient to entice farmers to selling the easement on their property's development rights. A study is thus needed to review the level of assessments on farmland in the County and determine whether these are in the same relationship to purchase offers as found elsewhere in the state. Balancing Development Preserving farming and agricultural activities, and limiting the encroachment of residential development are two of the major issues identified within the WSCR. One of the strategies used to protect farmland is to focus future residential and commercial growth in the existing centers. Many municipal zoning, subdivision ordinances and master plans can be tailored to better to accommodate farming practices and minimize the amount of farmland that is lost to residential and commercial development. Various techniques intended to protect farmland have been successfully implemented in New Jersey municipalities. Development Transfer One planning tool used to encourage farmland preservation is the use of transfer of development rights (TDR). Under this technique, development rights are transferred from one parcel to another parcel. Under New Jersey law, a conventional TDR program is not permissible in Cumberland County. However, a development right can be transferred under a ""non-contiguous parcel clustering"" (NCPC) program. In its simplest form, NCPC works to preserve farmland by clustering all development on one parcel, and by establishing the open space for this  The Plan - Draft Western/Southern Cumberland Region Strategic Plan December 2003  Page 15   development on a non-contiguous parcel. Unlike a TDR, which is available only in Burlington County, a NCPC transfer can be used anywhere in New Jersey. This technique can be used to preserve farmland and concentrate residential and commercial development in designated centers, with the necessary infrastructure to support development at higher densities. The net result is to conserve valuable land, and make centers more viable. For new centers, such as the Planned Village in Stow Creek, new development can be designed to create a walkable and livable community. Examples of innovative new centers in New Jersey include the Town Center in Washington Township, Mercer County. A detailed plan established a design framework for this center, which followed the principles of ""New Urbanism."" Development credits were transferred to the Center, without technically being a TDR. In Chesterfield Township, Burlington County, a town center was created within a large agricultural area through the use of transfer of development credits. There, two developers have plans for transferring 280 units to a town center. Zoning Provisions For residential development, cluster subdivisions can reduce the extent of developed land by reducing the average lot size while preserving farmland or open space. For example, Readington Township in Hunterdon County has mandatory cluster provisions for tracts of 40 acres or more, or for tracts of 30 acres or more that are adjacent to deed restricted farmland or open space. The clusters comprise lots of 1.5 acres in size. A key provision requires a minimum open space setaside of 70 percent and states that land which is currently being farmed shall, to the greatest extent possible, remain farmland. Fredon Township in Sussex County incorporates a six-acre average lot size in its AR-6 zone, with a minimum lot size of one acre, provided that at least 50 contiguous acres of farmland is preserved. At least 75 percent of the preserved farmland must be Class I or II soils. The clustering provision is also available to the AR-2 zone, which has a twoacre average lot size. The entire tract in both districts must be 80 acres or more. Upper Freehold Township in Monmouth County permits ""agricultural preservation subdivisions"" in its Agricultural Residential district. In this district, 75 percent of tract acreage must be preserved as farmland  through the Monmouth County Agricultural Development Board or the State Agricultural Development Board. Up to 50 percent of the homes that would be permitted on the entire tract as a conventional subdivision can be developed on the remaining acreage. Water Supply When the NJDEP reactivates its statewide water supply planning efforts, it should place a premium on the need to prioritize water supply for farms, if increasing demand ultimately leads to allocating water supply. Right to Farm Ordinance Another technique includes ""Right to Farm"" ordinances which establish parameters that permit farmers to conduct essential farming practices that may create nuisances to adjacent commercial or non-residential property owners. Within the Cumberland Region, municipalities including Fairfield, Hopewell and Lawrence Townships have established ""Right to Farm"" ordinances. Develop Industries Related to Farming Part of what makes the Cumberland Region so special is its farmland. The WSCR is one of the largest agricultural regions in the State of New Jersey. The marketing of farm products through produce stands, ""pick your own"" operations, or active farm markets all contribute to the farming identity. One of the issues identified at the regional vision workshop is the need to develop industries that support agricultural priorities of the region. This includes not just agriculture, but also aquaculture, hydroponics, and marine-based industries. Through municipal land use controls, regulations should be put into place that encourage agri-industry types of businesses. Municipal zoning ordinances and performance-based standards should ensure an agri-industry's appropriate location and compatibility with surrounding uses. Zoning districts should explicitly recognize agricultural industries.  The Plan - Draft Western/Southern Cumberland Region Strategic Plan December 2003  Page 16   Agri-Industry The best way of preserving farming in Cumberland is to improve the profitability of farming operations in the region. Given the higher costs of living in New Jersey, farmers that rely upon traditional row crops to survive will increasingly find themselves at an economic disadvantage. Farmers will thus need to better identify farm products that can occupy market niches. For example, farmers can identify products that are prized in the Hispanic community, grow those products, and cooperate with wholesalers to market the products in those areas. In general, foods that are sought after in ethnic communities would be desirable commodities. Nursery and landscape crops are responsible for an increasing share of farming revenues in the County, and farmers should continue to diversify into this area. The state should provide funding for farmers to transition into new products, as the equipment required to grow these new niche products often differs dramatically from existing equipment. Farmers should also take advantage of the proximity of the Food Innovation Research Extension Center in Bridgeton, which is a partnership between Rutgers University and the NJDA. Farmers can be counseled on how to realize a vision they may have for new operations, or can join an Entrepreneurial Network to discover how other farmers in the area are preparing to diversify into new products and operations. Agricultural Enterprise District Another way to maintain farmland viability in Cumberland County and create investment in rural areas is through the use of an Agricultural Enterprise District (AED)1. This would be a state program, but The Agricultural Enterprise District. Prepared for The Cumberland County Agricultural Development Board. Prepared by the Heinrich Hultgren Team. September, 2001. 1  managed at the County level, by the County Agricultural Development Board (CADB). The CADB must establish the area's agricultural viability, calculate the number of farmers willing to enlist and win the support of the municipality. Those with viable, productive agriculture and CADBs with the staff and resources necessary to run the program are qualified. The district is then designated by the State, County or municipality. Farms that voluntarily apply and meet the criteria can be included in the zone, as well as farm-related businesses. Funding would be similar to the UEZ program. The State would return taxes paid by farm landowners (including State inheritance, income or sales taxes). Alternatively, the county or municipality would dedicate property taxes paid by farmers to the program. Benefits could include:  Grant funding or cost-share programs for individual farmers;  Exemption from sales tax on equipment and supplies used in agriculture production;  Exemption from property tax on single-purpose farm buildings and structures;  Regulatory streamlining for all state and county rules;  Strengthened ""Right to Farm"" protection;  Marketing and promotion of major commodities;  A county link with the Statewide Farmers' Market Line computerized database; and  Job training. This would require action by the Department of Agriculture and New Jersey Legislature.  Transportation Roadways Perhaps the greatest transportation priority for municipalities in the WSCR study area is an improved regional connection. However, there are two significant obstacles to improving any regional connection to Cumberland County: lack of funding, and the perceived environmental and demographic impacts of constructing new roadways. Route 40 and County Route 540, among others, have been identified, as offering the greatest potential for improved access to the region. Business stakeholders have also called for improvements to Route 322.  The Plan - Draft Western/Southern Cumberland Region Strategic Plan December 2003  Page 17   More ambitiously, interest has been expressed in a new interstate highway through the region, from Delaware Memorial Bridge to Atlantic City. Such a study could be spearheaded by the New Jersey Turnpike Authority. In the near term, a greater push should be made for more discrete improvements. In some respects, Route 40 would be easier to improve on-alignment than CR 540, as it has a more adequate vertical and horizontal alignment, and there may be few environmental issues. To make better use of Route 40, however, a southern bypass of Woodstown Borough in Salem County is required. Pilesgrove Township, which would be the site of the bypass, is opposed to the bypass. Further, the Woodstown Bypass was eliminated from the State study and development program, as the State is not making sufficient funding available for larger projects. Similarly, the Route 55 extension to Cape May was also eliminated from the State study and development program due to a lack of funding. State legislators have proposed bills to fund concept development and design of the Route 55 extension. A study to improve CR 540 should be added to the SJTPO Unified Planning Work Program. While it would be more difficult to improve CR 540 to NJDOT principal arterial design standards than Route 40, it currently offers perhaps the fastest route from Bridgeton to the Delaware Memorial Bridge. Improvements to Route 77 should also be considered for the State study and development program. A number of the more critical regional roadway improvements have been clearly identified. At this point, less emphasis should be placed on a transportation needs assessment, and more on securing the funding needed to advance the projects through the NJ DOT project development process. A priority should be to restore Route 55 and Woodstown Bypass projects to the State study and development program. At the same time, the environmental impacts of major roadway projects, whether the Route 55 extension or a new east-west  roadway, would need to be addressed. For any local access roadways in Cumberland, efforts should be made to discourage strip development. In addition to those improvements that enhance access to Cumberland County, it would also be desirable to improve east-west roadways within Cumberland County, especially to facilitate access to Route 55. It may be feasible in the near future to implement needed improvements to a cross-county route, CR 552. This roadway is currently under study by the SJTPO, and the needed improvements have not yet been identified. Improvements to Route 56 should also be considered. Development along key roadways in the future may erode roadway capacity and safety. An access management study could identify actions to preserve the capacity of CR 552, Route 56, Route 77 and other major roadways even in the absence of major physical improvements. An access management strategy would provide guidelines on the frequency and spacing of driveways, and would encourage adjacent land uses to provide internal roadway links. Transit The Cumberland County Improvement Authority has applied for funding for a new fixed-route transit line which would extend from Carll's Corner in Upper Deerfield to Vineland. This will help address the need for an east-west transit line in the northern part of the county; the SJTPO should be encouraged to support this program. Under this grant program, funding is guaranteed for only one year following an award; presuming that funding is initially authorized, funding should be extended for an additional year. The Cumberland County Improvement Authority has received an award from the Federal Transit Administration for a Jobs-Access Reverse Commute (JARC) program. This would support a ""demand-response"" system, in which transit-dependent County residents could request the CCIA van to pick them up at pre-scheduled times. Although typically created to respond to the transportation needs of social service clients, this service could be used to transport persons from their home in more rural areas to their workplace, every day from Monday through Friday, if necessary. Until population density increases in certain areas thus making fixed route transit service more viable, innovative transportation systems such as the use of demand-response transportation should be  The Plan - Draft Western/Southern Cumberland Region Strategic Plan December 2003  Page 18   used to meet the needs of transit-dependent County residents. Funding should be sought to continue and expend transit programs. Rail The Winchester & Western Railroad has been identified as an important asset, particularly for major bulk good companies in the county, such as minerals. The Winchester & Western service could be further encouraged if the State adopted a program similar to that found in Pennsylvania, and helped fund the construction of rail sidings for new industrial customers. The State could also take on a greater share of rail maintenance, over its existing 70% share. Bike Routes Possible bike routes have been identified through the Cumberland County Bike Plan. However, a number of actions must still take place. Roadways that are currently suitable for bike travel must be signed. A bikeway brochure should be prepared. Along with indicating bikecompatible roadways, possible rest stops for bicyclists should be indicated. The County Tourism Department should also integrate the bikeway plans with other County attractions. More ambitiously, the County should evaluate acquiring easements to develop an off-road bike path system within the WSCR municipalities. The Cohansey Greenway would be part of this effort. Municipalities should also plan for bike facilities as part of the circulation plan in their master plans.  public sewer regardless of the amount of discharge. This public sewer service area largely corresponds to the area within the planned Bridgeton Regional Center, and expansion will be critical to realize the goal of concentrating a greater amount of development within the center. Financing the expansion of public sewer within this area should thus be a municipal priority, with assistance from the State and from the US Rural Development Administration. NJDEP has indicated that it will more rigorously screen any future request for needed permits, if this leads to significant growth outside centers. Municipalities in the WSCR should thus review the center boundaries currently proposed to ensure that any area that could possibly benefit from public sewer in the future is included within these centers. Package treatment plants should also be more widely employed in the study area as an ""interim"" measure between septic facilities and public sewer systems, or even as a final measure. Package treatment plants have increased in reliability in recent years, and NJDEP regulations should be more flexible in permitting their use. Package facilities will permit a somewhat greater density of development in centers that could not feasibly be included in a public sewer service area in the near future, while avoiding the health or technical problems that sometimes arise with septic systems. Package plants also have the benefit of returning water to the same watershed from which it was drawn, and thus benefit water supply planning. Additional sewer service strategies include: to amend the Rural District Wastewater Management Area by adding Deerfield to the CCUA sewer service area; to purse the construction of sewage treatment plant and/or pipeline in Port Norris and Laurel Lake and to identify a feasible sewerage treatment plan for Fortescue. Sewer facilities in Port Norris and Fortescue are critical to support ecotourism services in those communities. Water A major issue in the study area is whether development could be limited by the water supply. The large part of Cumberland County falls within Watershed Management Area 17, which was projected by the NJ DEP in its 1995 Water Supply Plan to have a ""dependable yield"" water supply deficit of 9 MGD in the year 2010. Unfortunately, the Area 17  Sewer and Water Sewer A relatively small area of the WSCR study area is currently sewered, with the Cumberland County Utilities Authority (CCUA) being the sole public sewer provider. The major obstacles to expansion of the CCUA sewer service area are financial and environmental. Significant public sewer expansion could still take place within the CCUA planned sewer service area; the Borough of Shiloh and parts of Hopewell, Upper Deerfield and Fairfield Township are approved for The Plan - Draft Western/Southern Cumberland Region Strategic Plan December 2003  Page 19   Watershed Management Plan study which was to have more definitively resolved the nature and extent of the water supply deficit in the area was disbanded by the State. This effort could also have identified the most feasible means of addressing the water supply deficit in the County, if indeed it exists. A critical priority, therefore, is for the State to revitalize the watershed management planning effort. However, a number of actions can be taken to better preserve water resources in the area, even in the absence of a more comprehensive planning effort. Greater use can be made of recycled water and different water conservation techniques. The CCUA plant in Bridgeton, which currently discharges treated effluent to the Cohansey River, should ideally discharge to ground water, and thus recharge the aquifer. This action would be expensive, requiring the infusion of new capital equipment and the purchase of land. This should thus be a priority for funding, with any action to be phased in over a reasonable period of time.  County Park/Open Space Plan Cumberland County is already in the process of developing a County Open Space Plan. Such a plan should explore the possibility of a County park system. It should also incorporate a prioritized list of open space and recreation priorities to serve as a planning tool for state, county and municipal open space and recreation acquisition. Education Cumberland County College is seeking to become one of the 10 new technology incubators designed by the State of New Jersey. Practices that require specialized training, such as aquaculture, are receiving great attention from the County College. The County should promote development of new and innovative technologies, such as solaraquatics and wetlands management. A Food Innovation Research Extension Center has been established by Rutgers University in Bridgeton; to complement this center, food industry technology should be an emphasis at the County College. In addition to the agricultural related jobs and economic opportunities, employment training initiatives should also capitalize on the region's glass making heritage by offering glass training programs.  Community Facility/Services Public Recreation Facilities Intermunicipal/County Parks There is a limited amount of municipally owned parkland within the WSCR. One of the issues identified is a need to develop a greater number of active recreational facilities within the region. As a result, the WSCR should consider developing an intermunicipal park system to help increase the amount of parks and open space within the region. Benefits of an intermunicipal park system include shared costs of land acquisition, park development and on-going maintenance. Shared park systems and services offer the greatest potential for smaller, geographically compact communities. This is particularly true of smaller communities with resource limitations, such as those in the Pinelands or CAFRA region. The Cohanzick Zoo in Bridgeton is one of the prized recreational amenities in the WSCR area, and visited by households from all over the County. This could serve as a test case for shared financial support from WSCR communities, as shared and regionalized services are considered.  Housing Affordable Housing The housing opportunities within the WSCR reflect the diverse nature of the area and the historic development patterns. Bridgeton, as the urban center, offers a variety of generally older housing stock, ranging from apartments and multi-family units to row housing and single-family housing. There are also settlements along the Delaware Bay including both seasonal and year round housing. River based communities in Maurice River Township and other larger settlements in Port Norris, Fortescue, Fairton, Laurel Lake, Rosenhayn, Seabrook and Cedarville provide diverse housing stock in their centers. In New Jersey each municipality has an obligation to provide its share of affordable housing needs as determined by the Council of Affordable Housing (COAH). To meet the obligations, COAH has established affordable housing targets for all municipalities in the State. As of April 2003, only two municipalities within Cumberland County have New Jersey COAH certification: Commercial Township and Vineland  The Plan - Draft Western/Southern Cumberland Region Strategic Plan December 2003  Page 20   City. Upper Deerfield is a `court town' and is currently under litigation. Other municipalities in the WSCR area should prepare or update their individual Housing Plan elements and achieve COAH certification. This would have two important effects: 1) certification would remove the threat of court action that could accompany new housing developments; and 2) it would enable the municipality to receive Plan Endorsement from the Office of Smart Growth. The WSCR should also identify ways for the municipalities to cooperatively address their COAH housing obligations. As one example, municipalities could investigate regional contribution agreements (RCAs), through which the construction of new affordable housing units in one community is subsidized by another municipality. To prepare the housing plans, municipalities should pursue housing grants through the State. Migrant Housing An issue of particular concern to the study area is housing for migrant workers. Although there are no farms within Bridgeton, people working on farms in the surrounding areas have often come to locate within the City. It is estimated that as many as 3,000 to 5,000 migrant workers are housed in Bridgeton every growing season. The lack of short-term rental space creates significant over-crowding, neglected housing and other associated problems. Ideally, the need for updated housing for migrant workers could be addressed through a regional effort involving the County, and municipalities surrounding Bridgeton.  Vineland and Millville. As identified in the Potentials for Economic Development report, there are a number of potential industries that could grow in the WSCR communities with the infrastructure to support them. Among them are certain sectors of the glass industry and food processing. However, large areas of the WSCR lack the infrastructure necessary to accommodate large-scale economic development. In these areas, the primary activity may be agriculture, including nurseries, specialized produce, or aquaculture. In other areas, with scenic vistas, historic structures, bird watching fishing and other recreational activities, ecotourism is an appropriate economic generator. Ecotourism The County produced an Ecotourism Plan in 1996. The County's Ecotourism Plan identifies six themes that build on the county's historic and natural resources. These include marine-based industries and recreation amenities: tracing Cumberland County's Maritime Heritage; boating adventures in Cumberland County; hunting, fishing and crabbing opportunities; birding, biking and hiking; and tracing the natural history of glass in the County. The County has initiated a number of efforts to promote this plan. In 2002, a $300,000 marketing campaign to promote Cumberland County both to the local residents and visitors and investors was completed. However, there is a need to go further to attract the tourism dollars. The lodging expenditures in Cumberland County fall well below the State average. Cape May generated over 96% of tourism related expenditures in the Southern Shore Region that includes Cape May and Cumberland Counties. A goal to increase tourism activity by 20% over the next five years through targeted marketing and promotional activities would have dramatic economic impact on the rural areas of the region. Lengthening the stay of tourists  at a minimum, accommodating a greater number of overnight stays  is a key element to gain tourism dollars. Since Cumberland County does not have major attractions, it will be critical to package destinations together for potential tourists to entice them to extend their stay. The WSCR needs to implement a comprehensive tourism package that will do the following:  Economy The WSCR has been economically stagnant since the decline of its historic major industries: glass and fishing. It has experienced a slower rate of growth than the State, with a higher unemployment rate and a lower income level; indeed, its median family income and per capita income were lowest in the State in both 1989 and 1999. Cumberland County has had success targeting industry for areas with adequate infrastructure, especially in The Plan - Draft Western/Southern Cumberland Region Strategic Plan December 2003  Page 21          Dramatically increase the number of hotel rooms and restaurants, especially along the Bayshore Route and its historic villages; Encourage strategic planning for towns on the Bayshore bicycle trail to focus future business opportunities; Establish a County based website to coordinated ecotourism opportunities and program; Provide strong coordination of tourism events and attractions, both year-round and seasonal; Identify and seek funding for key attractions that will draw visitors to the region, such as a Regional Nature Center; and Strengthen the County Office of Tourism and coordinate activities with special emphasis of the WSCR.  To support these businesses, the zoning should be evaluated to ensure that appropriate performance standards are in place to accommodate ag-industries in appropriate locations. Intermunicipal revenue sharing could serve to concentrate these industrial facilities in the regional industrial parks where infrastructure and services are available. The County College and County Technical School should continue and expand educational offerings to support these businesses. Develop Businesses Which Complement the Region Real estate development in rural areas not appropriate for agriculture or aquaculture should focus on micro-businesses and those that support the growing recreation and ecotourism industry. There is a need to identify financial assistance programs available to smaller business in the rural areas. The Region should look at innovative solutions to support these businesses, such as through the CCIA by establishing a loan guarantee program for micro-businesses that would serve as an incentive for bank lending. In additional, funding to support micro-businesses should be pursued. A pilot program possibly funded through the USDA Rural Development or the New Jersey Department of Commerce should be pursued to support a business assistance pilot project in the CR 553 corridor. CR 553 is the most important roadway linking together the shore communities. To expand tax advantages beyond the limited Urban Enterprise Zone in Bridgeton, the WSCR should work with the legislature to extend the boundaries of the UEZ zone in the county to include the proposed intermunicipal industrial park or similar areas which could include an infusion of revenue and loan guarantees. Better still, the Rural Enterprise Zone, discussed in an earlier section, should be vigorously pursued. Alternatively, sites could be selected in the UEZ for development, but should be coupled with a revenue sharing agreement.  As one possibility for increasing coordination, there could be consideration of creating a Cumberland County Vacation Bureau, consisting of any business that would benefit from increased tourism. This would provide a forum in which area businesses could cooperate and creatively plan to link their attractions or services as part of an overall package. Agri-Tourism As part of the ecotourism effort planned for the Cumberland County area, an agri-tourism campaign should be planned. A brochure should be prepared identifying the farms open to public sales in the County, along with the products sold there, and the days and hours of operation. This could be combined with a list of bed and breakfast operations, motels/hotels, campgrounds, and wildlife management areas. This has worked well in the Skylands Region of northwest New Jersey. Develop Industries that Support Agriculture Food processing, especially small scale, value added processing of fresh foods and aquaculture, including recent efforts in shell fishing and tank farming hold potential to generate limited real estate development in the rural areas. The growing nursery business in the County can spawn spin-off businesses that serve the nursery industry including truck, fertilizer, seed, burlap and other related goods and equipment.  The Plan - Draft Western/Southern Cumberland Region Strategic Plan December 2003  Page 22   The aquaculture industry Aquaculture can support some of the by-products the lengthy lead-time in industry, the CDC should  holds promise in the rural areas of the WSCR. the farming industry by supplying a market for which can be used as fish food. Because of establishing a cash flow in the aquaculture develop an outreach program to local bankers.  Continue Revitalization Efforts The New Jersey State Development and Redevelopment Plan strongly supports redevelopment and revitalization of our urban areas. Bridgeton, the center of the WSCR, has a redevelopment program underway with funding available through the Urban Enterprise Zone and Empowerment Zone programs, in addition to recent Hope VI federal funding for housing and commercial development.  Minnesota Approach The Minnesota approach includes only non-residential properties created after the date on which the program was first adopted. Sixty percent of added assessed values are retained by the community where the new properties are located, and 40 percent are place in the pool to be shared by all communities. This division recognizes that the host community must bear most of the added costs of servicing that property, but also that other communities may also have to bear some added costs. The distributions are independent of expenditure needs. Joint Intergovernmental Agreements Joint Intergovernmental Agreements have been allowed in Virginia, Kentucky, Colorado, Michigan and Ohio through State enabling legislation. This approach permits local governments to enter into a contractual agreement for a specific development, or an area where development might occur. The contract described contributions in terms of services or infrastructure and the revenues to be received from the development. Hackensack Meadowlands A regional commission, the New Jersey Meadowlands Development Commission, controls development and apportions property tax revenue among 14 municipalities. This tax-base-sharing program is aimed at ensuring that those communities that contain valuable tidal wetlands do not suffer financially because the wetlands cannot be developed for business or industrial development. The 1972 Hackensack Meadowlands Development Commission and Redevelopment Act provide the legal basis for the tax base sharing program. Forty percent of the increase in each municipality's tax base over the initial 1970 valuation is subject to the tax-sharing program. Redistribution is based on the number of school children and the proportion of property each town has in the Meadowlands District. All affected municipalities equitably share in the new financial benefits and new costs resulting from the development of the Meadowlands District as a whole. WSCR Revenue Sharing CDC Intermunicipal Industrial Park The Cumberland Development Corporation has initiated development of an industrial park to serve as a revenue sharing mechanism for the Region. Most of the CDC municipalities have relatively limited  Intermunicipal Cooperation Establish Intermunicipal Revenue Sharing Revenue sharing can help in successful implementation of the WSCR plan. It can temper ratable chasing and inefficient, uncoordinated planning. It can also help balance the benefits of development with the less tangible quality of life amenities for which the WSCR is known. The basic purposes of tax revenue sharing are:  To reduce competition among communities for attracting nonresidential properties;  To create a fair distribution of tax benefits from development in each community; and  To permit a `smart growth' approach to regional land-use planning to be undertaken in a rational manner curtailing haphazard and conflicting development. Cost and revenue sharing agreements have been very successful elsewhere. The two most outstanding examples are in Minnesota, where Minneapolis and St. Paul (with seven counties and 187 jurisdictions) entered into an agreement under the State ""Fiscal Disparities Act"" in 1971; and New Jersey, where the Meadowlands are being planned and developed by the New Jersey Meadowlands Commission, a regional agency. Other approaches have been implemented through Joint Intergovernmental Agreements. The summary of these cost and revenue sharing agreements are presented below. Their applicability to the WSCR is then addressed.  The Plan - Draft Western/Southern Cumberland Region Strategic Plan December 2003  Page 23   commercial potential, and the infrastructure and supporting improvement costs of an industrial park would exceed the financial abilities of an individual host community. The proposed intermunicipal industrial park is an innovative approach to revenue and cost sharing. The exact parameters of the revenue sharing approach are currently being assessed. This can serve as a demonstration project of revenue sharing techniques or development policy strategies that could be replicated in other places as a possible answer to problems of urban decay and suburban sprawl. WSCR Revenue Sharing District Through the WSCR strategic plan, it is apparent that other options are needed to help share the revenues of the region. The extent of constrained lands in the Region, the lack of infrastructure and limited accessibility all have established a dichotomy of have and have-nots in the Region, in one of the poorest counties in New Jersey. The need to more equitably distribute revenue and to share benefits was a main impetus for this study. As shown in the prior examples, both nationally and in New Jersey at the Hackensack Meadowlands, opportunities exist to expand approach to revenue sharing looking for unique innovative solutions. Property tax reform, if ever implemented in New Jersey, would help stem the ratables chase for more non-residential development and help guide development to appropriate areas. But it will not solve the revenue disparities of the WSCR municipalities. The nature of the Region, with the unique Bayshore habitat and extensive natural lands precludes significant development for many of the WSCR municipalities. These untaxed lands provide recreational and environmental benefits for the Region and the State. There is a need to balance the areas which can appropriately handle large-scale development  such as in the Bridgeton Regional Center - with the public lands in those other Bayshore municipalities. This presents an opportunity to derive a regional solution, with innovative ways to share the wealth - both in tangible revenues and the wealth of the quality environment. Shared Services The WSCR municipalities have identified the need to reduce costs of providing public services through a shared services approach. Currently the level of municipal services varies for the WSCR municipalities. Bridgeton, as an urban community provides a full range of services to its  residents. Most of the other municipalities have much more limited services. As an example of intermunicipal cooperation, there are limited public works services sharing staff between Bridgeton and Fairfield. With all the towns, there are mutual aid agreements between EMS service providers. As the WSCR area grows in the future, there will likely be greater demand for services such as trash removal, road maintenance, parks and recreation, and building inspection. Services such as tax collection, animal control, and courts can also be shared. Sharing services can help to lower costs and provide a greater level of services to the residents. The WSCR study participants acknowledge that these programs should be further explored. Funding would be needed through the State, likely through the Department of Community Affairs, to develop a workable plan and program for the WSCR. Certain services may be intermunicipal, serving adjacent municipalities or regional in aspect. For example, the need for Animal Control may require that the County or the Region lead the efforts. The only municipal Police Department is in Bridgeton; the other 11 municipalities in the WSCR rely on the State Police for policing and security. Given that the State has discussed charging municipalities for police services, the need to explore a regional police department would be a possible option. Cooperative shared road maintenance agreements should be considered since many towns do not have road departments. The Interlocal Services Act and the Consolidated Municipal Services Act allow any two or more local units to contract to provide jointly any service or function which any one of them can provide for itself. These laws are available to any combination of municipalities, counties, school districts, and, under certain conditions, local public authorities. As noted in the WSCR Region Profile, due to the rural nature of the region, funding for community services, such as parks, is rather difficult. Regional Efficiency Aid Program According to DCA, New Jersey has provided $19.54 million in direct credits to residential taxpayers whose towns or schools have participated in shared service agreements.  The Plan - Draft Western/Southern Cumberland Region Strategic Plan December 2003  Page 24   The funding is being provided through the state's Regional Efficiency Aid Program, or REAP, which offers property tax relief as an incentive for local officials to combine services and cut costs and taxpayers will continue to receive a benefit as long as the shared service activity is in place, as well as credit for any additional actions taken by their municipality or school district. REAP, and its companion program, REDI, the Regional Efficiency Development Initiative, are designed to help municipalities and school districts reduce spending and save taxpayer dollars. Legislation creating the two programs was signed into law in April 1999. (It should be noted, however, that the REDI program was put on hold in 2002 due to a lack of state funding.) The state has devised formulas to calculate the amount of tax relief a specific shared services action would generate under REAP. The formulas take into consideration such factors as the type and difficulty of the shared service, as well as the fiscal stress and population of the community. A tax credit is applied to property tax bills for each calendar year in which the shared services agreement is in effect. Property owners whose home is their principle residence, and tenants in dwellings of five or more units, are eligible for the REAP assistance. Bridgeton Regional Center Partnership To support Bridgeton's efforts and to enable an expansion of the Bridgeton Regional Center to encompass Upper Deerfield and Hopewell, there needs to be a cooperative planning effort undertaken. A Bridgeton Regional Center Partnership should be formed to address issues and needs of the Center in a comprehensive manner. The Partnership should meet on a regular basis to coordinate on intergovernmental issues and services.  As part of the WSCR strategic plan, a planning and implementation agenda has been developed. Funding should be sought to implement the planning agenda.  State Plan Endorsement Obtain Plan Endorsement Status The WSCR Plan will most greatly benefit those communities that follow through with the actions necessary to gain Plan Endorsement. Each municipality must individually approve the WSCR Plan to receive Endorsement. Municipalities should also take steps to ensure that their municipality receives plan endorsement and centers are established under NJ Office of Smart Growth guidelines. The Plan - Draft Western/Southern Cumberland Region Strategic Plan December 2003 Page 25   CENTERS Centers are a key element of the New Jersey State Development and Redevelopment Plan. Centers are defined as a ""compact form of development with one or more cores (pedestrian-oriented areas of civic or commercial uses) and residential neighborhoods."" As stated in the New Jersey State Plan, ""centers are the preferred vehicle for accommodating growth"" for a whole host of reasons. They preserve more land than sprawling development patterns, reduce the number of vehicular trips, support pedestrian activity, and have many other benefits. In some ways, centers actually assume more importance for the WSCR communities than for the much more densely populated municipalities in northern and central New Jersey. In Cumberland County, there is a greater opportunity to use centers to concentrate development, and to avoid the sprawling patterns that characterize so many areas elsewhere in the state. By the same token, a greater share of existing farmland can be preserved than elsewhere in the state. Following is a list of centers for the Western /Southern Cumberland Region. It should be noted that some centers may not always meet the State Planning Guidelines for what constitutes a center, in terms of employment density or residential density. There is a greater amount of vacant land in a number of the centers than found elsewhere in the State. This reflects the historically rural character of the communities in the study area, with modest population bases and sparse commercial services. To provide the opportunity for a reasonable level of commercial development, and for residential development to meet the needs of the next generation, it is important to provide sufficient space in the centers for expansion over the currently, extremely limited development. Redevelopment will not yield the same potential in jobs and housing units as it would in more urban areas elsewhere in New Jersey. Further, the preservation of agricultural lands has been called out as a high priority. The centers can serve as receiving areas to transfer density from the agricultural lands throughout the study area. All centers, proposed and designated, are depicted in Map 5. All proposed centers are depicted in aerial photographs in the Appendix.  Bridgeton Bridgeton Regional Center The City of Bridgeton serves as the heart of the Bridgeton Regional Center, which also includes Hopewell Township and Upper Deerfield Township. The proposed town center of Gouldtown and the proposed village center of Fairton in Fairfield Township are also adjacent to the City of Bridgeton. It is the one urban center within the Western/Southern Cumberland region, and the only municipality in the WSCR area consisting wholly of Planning Area 1. Bridgeton is the only municipality to be completely sewered. Bridgeton contains numerous residential neighborhoods, small commercial centers, an historic CBD, and several industrial areas, including the South Woods State Prison, a major employer. It is also the County seat. The City Park is the largest municipal park in the region, and, particularly because of the presence of the Cohanzick Zoo, a great amenity. Revitalization is a pressing need in Bridgeton, and WSCR communities have acknowledged that economic redevelopment in the city is needed to help lift up the economic status of the entire region.  Commercial Township Laurel Lake Village Laurel Lake is a designated village along CR 670 in Commercial Township, directly below Millville. It lies in Planning Area 5. It comprises one of the larger residential neighborhoods in the region. It also contains a general store, gas station and liquor store. The use of on-lot sewerage for small lots has resulted in septic failures, and improved sewerage infrastructure is needed. Mauricetown Village Mauricetown is a designated village located in PA4 in Commercial Township. It lies along CR 744 and CR 676, next to the Maurice River. Page 26  The Plan - Draft Western/Southern Cumberland Region Strategic Plan December 2003    Mauricetown is a predominantly residential center and also contains several small commercial and community services such as a post office and fire hall It is an historic community, with well-preserved 19th century homes, and antique shops, and fits well into the region's ecotourism theme. Sand mines immediately to the west will ultimately present a reclamation and redevelopment opportunity. Port Norris Village Port Norris is a mixed use residential and commercial center in Commercial Township along Maurice River, proximate to the Delaware Bay, and at the terminus of CR 553. It is a designated village in PA 5. The Commercial Township municipal hall is here, as is the post office, several restaurants and other commercial uses. It is an historic fishing center. With its maritime heritage, Port Norris is an important part of the County ecotourism plan. Public sewer is needed for both modern industries and maritime-oriented tourist services. It has a number of historic homes along main streets in need of rehabilitation, as well as more modern houses.  Carmel Village Carmel, located in PA5 in the south central part of Deerfield Township, is a proposed village. It is the subject of a municipal plan endorsement application to the State Planning Commission. The village straddles CR 552, an important east-west county route. Residential development is sparse, and the village has several small commercial uses, a small school, and a volunteer fire department, among other land uses. Public water and sewer is needed to help support a more concentrated residential population, and to thus accommodate residential development that otherwise might be attracted to outlying areas. Covering an area of 1.17 square miles, with a developable area of .72 square miles, it encompasses a population of 282 and 107 dwellings. Employment exceeds 50. Design controls are needed to ensure its appearance and function as a mixed use village. Rosenhayn Village Rosehayn, located in PA 4 in the north central part of Deerfield Township, is a proposed village. It lies on Route 56, one of the few state highways in Cumberland County. Further, the village is in relatively close proximity to Route 55, the only limited access highway in the County. Its population is 1,143, with 416 housing units and more than 200 jobs. It covers an area of 2.3 square miles, with 1.59 square miles of developable land. It is home to manufacturing/warehousing operations including trucking companies, a refrigerant manufacturing plant, and farm produce processors. It also has commercial firms, including retail sales, a bank, insurance office, and gas stations. Community services include a post office and the Township school, municipal complex and fire hall. Similar to Carmel, public water and sewer are needed to help support a more concentrated residential population. The Master Plan suggests considering multi-family housing in southern Rosenhayn, next to the Township school. Also similar to Carmel, design controls are needed to develop its image and function as a mixed use village.  Deerfield Township Deerfield Township wishes to maintain its overall character as a rural farming community. One of its primary planning objectives is to focus growth into ""the existing centers of Carmel and Rosenhayn or specifically planned areas meant to prevent an indiscriminate sprawl"" (2002 Master Plan). The Township thus wishes to nurture the growth of Carmel and Rosenhayn as vital, mixed use communities. These villages are proposed to be the ""main receiving area within the Township of a variety of housing types at varying densities."" Both proposed centers are being processed separately from the WSCRSP, in a municipal plan endorsement application.  Downe Township Much of Downe Township is covered by low-lying meadows, and by private or state conservation lands. Development potential is minor, and the proposed centers will accommodate future residential growth and limited commercial development in a traditional rural setting. Dividing Creek Village and Newport Village are among the string of historic mixed use villages along CR 553 that have traditionally provided homes Page 28  The Plan - Draft Western/Southern Cumberland Region Strategic Plan December 2003   and limited commercial services to workers in oystering, lumbering and farming industries. Dividing Creek Village The proposed village of Dividing Creek is located at the intersection of CR 553 with CR 555 and CR 676. The village lies in PA 4, with wetlands bordering the village to the south, with some wetlands inside the center boundary. Covering an area of 384 acres, it contains 19 acres of developable land. It has a population of 425 in 170 housing units. It contains some historic homes, a gas station, an historic Baptist church, an old school, and the fire hall. The Master Plan calls for a mixed use center, with commercial uses targeted for the outskirts of the village. The village center boundaries would be consistent with the V-1 and V-2 zoning districts that encompass Dividing Creek. The V-1 district permits homes on 20,000 square foot lots, and the V-2 district on 30,000 square foot lots. There is no public sewer or water, and none planned. Fortescue Village The proposed village of Fortescue rests on the Delaware Bay, at the end of CR 637. It lies within PA 5. It is an old fishing village, and was a popular summer resort. Today there is a residential area, marina, service oriented commercial businesses, and a hotel/restaurant. It has a population of 275, in 396 housing units. It covers an area of 120 acres, with 7 acres of developable land. Fortescue has great potential as a tourist center, and the 1995 Master Plan calls for a community of small retail shops, tourist services and family-oriented recreational activities. The State Marina and a commercial redevelopment area with parking is envisioned for the northern end, and another commercial redevelopment area to the south. There is no public sewer; none is planned in the near future, but there is an increasing recognition that sewer would be desirable to accommodate the tourist facilities. The Cumberland County Rural District Wastewater Management Plan calls for new sewer facilities at Fortescue. These could conceivably take the form of a package plant. The proposed center boundary is the same as the NJDEP coastal village boundary in the CAFRA regulations. By redeveloping a bay resort community, Downe Township will reclaim its heritage and make a valuable contribution to a developing ecotourist strategy that safeguards the area's natural resources.  Newport Village The proposed village of Newport is located at the intersection of CR 732 and CR 637, just off CR 553 at the western border of Downe Township. It lies within PA 4. It covers an area of 457 acres, with 89 acres of developable land. It has a population of 615 in 286 housing units. It has a small commercial area, with a general store and gas stations, as well as a school, fire hall, and churches. It contains a densely populated residential area with large Victorian homes built by persons in the oystering industry. The center boundary would include portions of the V-1, V-2 and I-1 districts around Newport, but not the entirety of any. The sparsely populated areas in the west of the V-2 district are not included, nor is the southern portion of the I-1 district. There is no public water or sewer, and none anticipated. Newport would continue its role as a small, mixed use village with limited residential and commercial growth. Gandy's Beach Hamlet This proposed hamlet is a small residential community on the Delaware Bay, close to Nantuxent Creek. It is in PA 5. It is 40 acres in size, with a population of 196. There is no public water or sewer, and no new development is envisioned. Gandy's Beach would continue as a small residential community. Money Island Hamlet This proposed hamlet is a small residential community on the Delaware Bay, adjacent to Nantuxent Creek. It is in PA 5. It is 46 acres in size, with a population of 101. There is no public water or sewer, and no new development is envisioned. Money Island would continue as a small residential community.  Fairfield Township Fairfield Township is directly east and south of the City of Bridgeton. Fairfield is currently coordinating with the State Planning Commission to designate Fairton as a village center and Gouldtown as a town center. Given the proximity of both centers to the City of Bridgeton, it would be desirable to ultimately consider folding these two centers into the Bridgeton Regional Center along with Bridgeton, Hopewell and Upper Deerfield. Fairfield is seeking center designation to focus growth in these two centers, and to relieve pressure for developing agricultural  The Plan - Draft Western/Southern Cumberland Region Strategic Plan December 2003  Page 29   lands in the environs. Both centers are being processed separately from the WSCRSP, in a municipal centers petition. Fairton Village The proposed village of Fairton is an historic community, situated at the crossroads of CR 553, CR 609, and CR 692. It is an old fishing community and the Fairton Marina is located on the Cohansey River. The village is located within PA 4. There is no public sewer or water, and no infrastructure is envisioned for Fairton in the near future. The boundaries for the Village Center extend from the historic center north to the township border with Bridgeton, with the west boundary being the river and east boundary being the Winchester and Western Railroad. The center covers an area of 1.59 square miles, encompassing 382 acres of developable land. It has a population of 1,935 in 353 housing units. A mix of residential, commercial and industrial uses are found within the center, as well as an 18-hole golf course. The center also accommodates the Township municipal complex, recreational area, elementary school and post office. The village presents redevelopment opportunities with vacant or underutilized properties. Gouldtown Town The proposed town of Gouldtown is an older suburban community centered on Route 49 to the east of Bridgeton. It contains Planning Areas 1, 2 and 4. The center of Gouldtown actually consists of four distinct neighborhoods, with an area of 3.28 square miles. It has a population of 2,332 in 771 housing units, and about 185 jobs. The primary use is residential, although there are commercial uses along Route 49. There are also sand mines in the center, reclamation of which should be an important land use planning strategy. There is essentially no public sewer or water; the one exception is Tips Trailer  Park adjacent to Bridgeton, which is served by the City of Bridgeton. Public sewer and water is desired in this center, partly to serve the new elementary school, and should be extended to support medium- and high-density residential and commercial development in appropriate locations. Seabreeze Hamlet This proposed hamlet is located in PA 5, about seven miles southwest of Fairton on the Delaware Bay. It is a residential community, with a number of housing units strung along the Bay. Fairfield Township has coordinated with NJDEP on restoring the bulkhead in this hamlet. Seabreeze is one of the few communities directly on the Delaware Bay, and could have a valuable role in introducing ecotourists to this ecosystem through the provision of extremely limited commercial services, such as a marina. However, its primary role will be to continue as a traditional, small residential resort community. The center boundary is defined by the Bay with the marsh forming a barrier behind the main road. Seabreeze is 35 acres in size, with a population of 97.  Greenwich Township Limited growth is anticipated for all three centers in Greenwich Township. The center boundaries are drawn with sufficient space to allow transfers of residential density from outlying areas, and thus preserve farmland and a viable agricultural industry in the environs. Greenwich Village Greenwich Village is located in PA 4 in Greenwich Township, on the Cohansey River. This proposed village is relatively isolated, at four miles from the nearest state highway, and from any appreciable county roadway. The village is perhaps the best preserved historic residential settlement in the WSCR area, with many 18th and 19th century houses, and the Teaburners monument. It also has a general store and vital community services, such as a Post Office, school, marina, library and fire hall. It has no public sewer or water, with no installation anticipated. It is 262 acres in size, with 87 acres of developable land. It has a population of 379 in 162 housing units, and about 15 jobs. The proposed village center boundaries correspond to the Historic Conservation district. It also incorporates a small portion of the Commercial Recreation district adjacent to the Historic Conservation district, in order to include the Greenwich marina, one of the important recreation facilities in the area. Page 30  The Plan - Draft Western/Southern Cumberland Region Strategic Plan December 2003   Othello Hamlet Othello Hamlet is located in PA 4 in Greenwich Township, along CR 650. It incorporates several homes, one church and an antique shop. It is 30 acres in size, with developable land of 16 acres. It has 67 residents in 29 housing units, and 10 jobs. It has no public water or sewer, with none anticipated. The boundaries correspond to the Historic Conservation zoning district. The hamlet would accommodate limited residential development. Development applications are evaluated to ensure consistency with nearby historic structures. Springtown Hamlet Springtown Hamlet is located in PA 4 in Greenwich Township at the intersection of CR 620 and CR 650. It is a residential community, with two churches and a small park. It covers an area of 107 acres, with 79 acres of developable land. Its population is 102 in 47 housing units, with 6 to 10 jobs. It has no public water or sewer, with none anticipated. The center boundaries fall within to the R-1 district.  and HCI districts are linear districts extending along Route 49 between CR 621 and the border with Shiloh Borough. As one of the relatively few areas in the WSCR area with public sewer, and extending along one of the few state roadways, these districts are logical places to concentrate higher intensity commercial and industrial activity. At the same time, it will be important to create design guidelines to prevent sprawling development along this roadway. The sewered areas of Hopewell and Upper Deerfield, together with the City of Bridgeton, will likely be the most significant economic generators within the WSCR area for some time to come, so it will be desirable to encourage coordination between these three municipalities within the Bridgeton Regional Center. Roadstown Hamlet This proposed hamlet is located in PA 4 in Stow Creek Township Hopewell Township. The village is a residential center with a building, antique shop and church. It is located at the intersection of 620 and CR 626. It covers 139 acres, with developable land of acres. It has a population of 262 in 102 housing units. and fire CR 103  Hopewell Township Bridgeton Regional Center The central eastern portion of Hopewell Township, adjacent to the City of Bridgeton, is proposed to be part of the Bridgeton Regional Center. The center lies between CR 694 to the north, and CR 699 to the south. The Route 49 corridor, which accommodates much of the commercial development in the township, runs diagonally through the center. The center contains Planning Areas 1 and 2. A portion of the township along Route 49 and directly west of Bridgeton is sewered. The center boundaries are drawn to be consistent with the planned sewer service area of the CCUA. The center within Hopewell covers 4.6 square miles, with 2.8 square miles of developable land. It has a population of 2,876 in 1,096 housing units. Hopewell is predominantly a single-family residential community, although there is zoning for garden apartments, townhouses and mobile homes. Commercial uses such as office buildings and industrial parks are found along the Route 49 corridor, and the Township plans to continue the development of commercial uses in this area. Zoning districts within the center include an Agriculture-Industry district, medium density (1/2 acre lots) residential districts, Highway Commercial Business (HCB), and Highway Commercial Industry (HCI). The HCB The Plan - Draft Western/Southern Cumberland Region Strategic Plan December 2003  There is no public water or sewer, with none anticipated. The center boundaries coincide with the Village district in Hopewell. In Stow Creek, the center includes the Historic Residential district, but moves beyond it 400 feet to the west in order to permit development of a parallel roadway. In Hopewell, the existing Village district would also permit use of a parallel roadway, in this case to the east of CR 620. The Townships seek to maintain its historic, compact character, as a mixed use settlement in the midst of agricultural lands. The zoning for Roadstown in Stow Creek is  acre lots; zoning in Hopewell has not yet been established. The hamlet is intended to enhance and complement the agricultural character of the surrounding lands.  Lawrence Township Cedarville Village This designated village lies Township, and includes PA 4 residential community with a hardware store. It has well representative of the small through the County.

Much of the Township is located within the Pinelands. Port ElizabethBricksboro Village This is a designated village, located partly in PA 5 and partly in the Pinelands. It is a predominantly residential community located primarily along Route 47. There is no public water or sewer. Cumberland-Hesstown Village This designated village lies directly on Route 49, within the Pinelands. It has a church, volunteer fire company, store, and residences. There is no public water or sewer. Heislerville Village This designated village lies on a dogleg of CR 616, on the route to East Point Lighthouse, a local attraction on the New Jersey Coastal Heritage trail. It is in PA 5. It has residences, a church, Post Office fire hall, community hall and several businesses. It has no public water or sewer. Delmont Village This designated village lies on Route 47, straddling the Pinelands and PA 5. It has a market, volunteer fire department and steel fabricator. It is zoned as medium and high density residential. Dorchester-Leesburg Village This designated village  really a combination of the two villages of Dorchester and Leesburg  lies along CR 616. Dorchester is the home of the Dorchester Ship Building Company and a small residential community, with a church and volunteer fire station. Leesburg is a The Plan - Draft Western/Southern Cumberland Region Strategic Plan December 2003  mixed residential-commercial-industrial area, with a gas station, post office, and Township building and small recreation area. It is located in PA 5. The village center contains some well-preserved historic structures.  Shiloh Borough Shiloh Village The Village of Shiloh is located in PA 4 in Shiloh Borough, on Route 49. The village center encompasses the residential, commercial and industrial districts, but stops short of Hopewell to the south and Stow Creek to the north, to prevent continual development along Route 49. The center covers an area of 227 acres, with 113 acres of developable land. It has a population of 527, in 202 housing units. There is no public water or sewer, but the Borough would eventually like to have public sewer extended to the community, along Route 49 from Hopewell. The Borough would like to maintain agricultural lands on the environs, and the village center should thus be used to transfer density from this area. It is a mixed use village, with two general stores, a post office, municipal buildings, a bank and several other businesses. The Borough would like to maintain its character as a rural center with limited businesses and mixed uses. Lower density lots are envisioned because of dependence on septic, but medium density lots are possible if public sewer is extended. An important planning issue to resolve in the future is the commercial district along Route 49 on the south side of the Borough, next to Hopewell Township. As noted in the 1998 Master Plan, development of the Route 49 corridor between Bridgeton and Shiloh may eventually distract from the sense of village of the Borough. A rural buffer is called for between the developing areas of the Route 49 corridor and the village center. Further, design guidelines, incorporating parking lot design, access and landscaping need to be applied to the commercial areas along the Route 49 corridor to prevent strip development.  Stow Creek Stow Creek Village A planned village is proposed for the northwestern section of Stow Creek, along Route 49. The center would fall totally within PA 4. There is residential development at the intersection of Route 49 and CR 617, along Seeley Road, and adjacent to Lake Arrowhead. The center also Page 32   has several commercial uses along Route 49. It covers an area of 1.16 square miles, with .86 square miles of developable land. It has a population of 481 in 187 housing units. The population density would not currently meet the criteria for a village. However, the planned village would serve as the focus for future residential development in the township, and would be the receiving area for any transfer of residential density from agricultural areas in the environs. Medium density development would be desirable if public sewer is extended northwest from Bridgeton along Route 49 through Shiloh. The planned village would also strive to build on the small town character already found within the village. Most of the center would include the Residential zone, which permits homes on  acre lots. Provisions should be made for homes on smaller than  acre lots, depending upon sewer availability. A village center district should be established for some or all of this center to promote a traditional mixed use character. Design standards should promote attractive, pedestrian-scaled development. In so doing, the planned village would complement and strengthen the surrounding agricultural areas. Roadstown Hamlet Roadstown Hamlet lies in PA 4 in both Hopewell Township and Stow Creek Township. Its role in the WSCR area was discussed earlier under Hopewell Township.  schools, and the municipal complex. Upper Deerfield Township has seen more development than any other community within the WSCR study area. Excluding institutionalized population, it had a higher population gain from 1990 to 2000. It also saw the greatest nonresidential development, as exemplified by big box retail development in the Route 77 corridor. Significant portions are served by public sewer and water, and all of the regional center falls within the CCUA sewer service area. Initially, in the last round of cross-acceptance, discussion of centers had focused on keeping Seabrook Village separate from the Bridgeton Regional Center area within Upper Deerfield. Increasingly, however, the distinction has proven more difficult to maintain. This is partly because the upper part of the regional center was identified as the most desirable location for an intermunicipal industrial park , and the site would, in fact, extend a little north of the originally conceived boundary, toward Seabrook Village. Further, there are several retail properties on Route 77 immediately south of the original Seabrook boundary. Two of the three uses are abandoned. Redevelopment of these properties are desirable, and would be encouraged by inclusion into a center. A compost recycling site has since built between the two centers. Because of these land developments, it has become less useful to try to distinguish between the two centers. Inclusion of Seabrook village within the Regional Center would also enable the Township complex, the highestdensity residential neighborhood, recreational fields and schools to be within the regional center. The Bridgeton Regional Center area would accommodate the large majority of future residential and commercial development within Upper  Upper Deerfield Bridgeton Regional Center The southern and central part of Upper Deerfield is proposed to be part of the Bridgeton Regional Center. The center spans Upper Deerfield from the northern border with Bridgeton to Seabrook Village. The center includes Planning Areas 1 and 2, and a small portion of PA 4. The center in Upper Deerfield covers an area of 7.3 square miles, with 4.43 miles of developable land. It has a population of 4,505 in 1,762 housing units. Route 77 is the most important roadway within the Upper Deerfield center. The center also includes the western terminus of Route 56; the intersection of Route 77 with Route 56  at Carll's Corner  has been at the heart of much of the new commercial development within recent years. The corridor includes small businesses, banks, light industry, The Plan - Draft Western/Southern Cumberland Region Strategic Plan December 2003  Page 33   Deerfield. It should be used to transfer development from the agricultural areas in the environs surrounding the Center. Several challenges should be addressed in the future with the Bridgeton Regional Center in Upper Deerfield. An effort should be made to incorporate neighborhood-based commercial services in some residential developments. Design guidelines need to be improved to discourage excessive strip development, and to make growing retail and office corridors more attractive and functional. Access management is one means to accomplish this. The Township needs to focus on improving accessibility for pedestrians and bicyclists, especially in the major retail areas. Such accessibility is consistent with centers. Deerfield Village The proposed village of Deerfield Village is located north of Bridgeton Regional Center, at the intersection of Route 77 and CR 540 in Upper Deerfield Township. It is located entirely in PA 4. It is a traditional mixed use village in the agricultural areas in west Cumberland County, with residential uses, a general store, farm equipment business, Post Office, and the Soil Conservation Service Office. It has no public sewer or water, with none anticipated in the future. The boundaries are consistent with the two residential zoning districts and the B-2 Business district at Deerfield Village, although the village boundaries have been revised since originally proposed to exclude preserved farmland that falls within the east side of the B-2 zone.  The Plan - Draft Western/Southern Cumberland Region Strategic Plan December 2003  Page 34   REGIONAL AGENDA  PLANNING  AND  IMPLEMENTATION  A planning and implementation agenda (PIA) has been prepared for the Western/Southern Cumberland Region. Issues were preliminarily identified for the Region through interviews with local stakeholders and review of master plans and other planning reports. The issues were fleshed out in the Advisory Committee workshops held as part of the public involvement process. Strategies for addressing each issue were then developed. The ""Lead"" column identifies the level of government  local, county or state  that is responsible for taking the lead on each strategy. Other agencies that can help facilitate the accomplishment of each strategy are identified. The ""time frame"" classifies strategies by the time needed for their accomplishment, which is partly a function of their complexity. The ""targets"" column denotes the end product of each strategy. The Regional PIA is consistent with the Strategies Report presented earlier in the Plan. By presenting each strategy individually, a clear blueprint is provided for the region to move forward and to simultaneously evaluate its progress over the coming years. The Regional PIA is categorized into many different areas. There is, however, one over-arching theme: maintain and improve the economic and social viability of the region's centers  ranging from the many small, historic villages to the economically diversified corridors stemming from Bridgeton  while providing good stewardship for the area's rich agricultural and natural resources in the environs. The Regional PIA is divided into the following areas: Natural Areas  the Region cherishes its natural areas, which are among the most unspoiled in the State. The protection of the varied natural areas is an important smart growth goal. At the same time, the natural areas should be made accessible to visitors to help maintain the ecotourist industry, and the state should recognize the value of these areas by contributing funds to the municipalities to maintain services. Historic/Cultural  Historic properties are another important resource in the region. If well preserved, they have the ability to stabilize neighborhoods in many centers, maintain community pride and spur the  ecotourist industry. The cataloging of historic sites, establishment of historic preservation commissions, and ordinances can do to much to protect this heritage. Mining  Sand mining has long been a basic industry; proper planning will maximize the potential of mined sites once the mining ends. Agriculture  Maintenance of the agricultural industry is a top priority for the region. By continuing to support farmland preservation activities, receiving equitable payments for farm easements, protecting farm properties through zoning techniques, increasing the value of farming operations through the development of new practices and products, the WSCR area can retain its rural character. In so doing, there will be a clear line between the centers and the environs in the County, particularly in the west side of the county where agricultural uses predominate and development pressures are strongest. Transportation  Improvements are needed to improve access to, and within, the WSCR area. The study area is relatively isolated from other employment centers in the greater region, and it will be easier to attract businesses to fully employ Cumberland residents with improved roadways. Bike and pedestrian facilities are also needed to accommodate residents in centers and attract ecotourists. Sewer/Water installation of businesses, characteristic  Expansion of public sewer and water, and the package treatment plants, are needed to serve potential and to accommodate residents on smaller lots of village centers.  Economy  A multi-pronged strategy is called for to ensure the economic viability of the region's many centers. An active ecotourist industry, agriculture and aquaculture industries, food processing, back office services, manufacturing niches, a healthy retail sector  all are needed to improve the economic condition of New Jersey's poorest county. By targeting programs for low-income rural areas, particularly centers, the State will help make these centers desirable places to live and lessen pressures for suburban sprawl. Community Facilities/Services  Educational levels in Cumberland County lag behind the rest of the state. Improved education, and other  The Plan - Draft Western/Southern Cumberland Region Strategic Plan December 2003  Page 35   community facilities, such as parks, are needed to make the centers more attractive to a wide range of households. Housing  Many houses in the WSCR area need rehabilitation. Housing plans prepared with the assistance of the state will enable WSCR communities to pro-actively plan for low and moderate income households. Intermunicipal Cooperation  Beginning with an intermunicipal industrial park and extending through regional cost and revenue sharing agreements, the WSCR communities have the opportunity to plan in a rational fashion, with the development of land uses in places best suited to accommodate them. Sharing government services will cut costs and make the municipalities more efficient. State Plan Endorsement  By implementing the PIA that has been presented here, the WSCR communities can follow through on State Plan guidelines for enhancing centers and preserving environs. The issues discussed in the Regional PIA are presented in the WSCR Plan Map (Map 6).

GX240-77-0168777	"DRAFT MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT by and among HYUNDAI MOTOR AMERICA, CITY OF CALIFORNIA CITY and DESERT TORTOISE PRESERVE COMITTEE, INC. and CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND GAME And U.S. FISH AND WILDLIFE SERVICE regarding DESERT TORTOISE HABITAT ACQUISITION, ENHANCEMENT, AND MANAGEMENT THIS MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT (""Agreement"") is made and entered into as of the ____day of __________, 2003, by and between Hyundai Motor America, a California corporation (Hyundai); the City of California City (City) (collectively ""Proponents""), the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (""Service""), the California Department of Fish and Game (""CDFG""), and the Desert Tortoise Preserve Committee, Inc. (""DTPC""), a California Public Benefit Corporation, hereafter referred to collectively as the ""Parties."" Execution of this Agreement by the Parties supersedes and terminates any prior agreements executed by and between the Parties. The Hyundai Automotive Test Track Project (""Project"") consists of an automobile test track located in the City of California City, Kern County, California, comprising 4300 acres of private land. The Project is expected to result in incidental take under the federal and state Endangered Species Acts of the federal and state threatened desert tortoise and the state threatened Mohave ground squirrel from an otherwise lawful activity. This Agreement governs the implementation of certain off-site habitat compensation conditions of federal and state incidental take permits to be issued to Proponents by the Service and CDFG. For and in consideration of the mutual covenants and conditions contained herein, the Parties hereto do hereby agree as follows: July 8 2003 DRAFT Management Agreement Hyundai Motor America / City of California City Page 1 of 11   I. RECITALS A. LISTING  The desert tortoise (Gopherus agassizii), is a species listed as ""threatened"" under the federal Endangered Species Act (ESA) and the California Endangered Species Act (CESA), and the Mohave ground squirrel (Spermophilus mohavensis) is a species listed as ""threatened"" under the CESA. . B. LEGAL REQUIREMENTS UNDER FEDERAL AND STATE PERMITS  The Service has determined, under Sections 7 and 10(a)(1)(B) of the federal Endangered Species Act, and the CDFG has determined under Sections 2080.1 and 2081 of the California Fish and Game Code, that Proponents likely will impact 3,228.5 acres of desert tortoise and Mohave ground squirrel habitat. The Service and CDFG each has required Proponents to provide for the acquisition, enhancement, and management of 3,228.5 acres of desert tortoise and Mohave ground squirrel habitat.The Parties anticipate entering into a separate agreement to provide for acquisition, enhancement, and perpetual management of additional Mohave ground squirrel replacement habitat as required by CDFG. The Project Impacts involve ""incidental take"" of desert tortoise and Mohave ground squirrel as that term is defined under the federal and state Endangered Species Acts. C. COOPERATIVE EFFORT  To fulfill the legal requirements set forth in Paragraph B hereof, each Party to this Agreement agrees to perform certain duties. This Agreement thus describes a cooperative program between the Parties to conserve the desert tortoise and Mohave ground squirrel. It is understood and agreed among the Parties that the DTPC, in performing all of the activities delegated to it under this Agreement, is acting as the authorized agent for Proponents for the limited purposes of acquiring, enhancing and managing replacement habitat for the desert tortoise and Mohave ground squirrel. It is understood and agreed that the Proponents will provide full funding for the activities under this Agreement. D. PURPOSES  The purposes of this Agreement are: 1. To assure the implementation and adequate funding of the habitat acquisition, enhancement, and management requirements set forth in Paragraph I.B;  July 8 2003 DRAFT Management Agreement Hyundai Motor America / City of California City  Page 2 of 11   2. To contractually bind each Party to fulfill and faithfully perform the obligations, responsibilities, and tasks assigned to it pursuant to the terms of this Agreement; and 3. To provide remedies and recourse should any Party fail to perform its obligations, responsibilities, and tasks as set forth in this Agreement. II. TERM A. EFFECTIVE DATE  This Agreement shall become effective on the date that all Parties execute this Agreement and shall remain in full force and effect until the earlier of (1) full satisfaction of each of the Agreement's terms and conditions or (2) termination of the Agreement pursuant to Paragraph II.C. This Agreement may be extended with the written consent of all the parties. B. CONTINUING DUTY TO PERFORM  The Parties agree that the DTPC's acquisition, enhancement and management of the 3,228.5 acres of replacement habitat shall be permanent and the duty to manage the compensation habitat for the desert tortoise and Mohave ground squirrel shall be required into perpetuity. C. TERMINATION  DTPC shall work diligently and in good faith to ensure that its responsibilities under this Agreement to acquire the compensation land are completed within twelve (12) months of the initiation of habitat disturbing activities. DTPC agrees to provide progress reports to Proponents every thirty (30) days for the first year or until all land is acquired. If, within six (6) months of the date of this Agreement, DTPC fails to enter into binding agreements to acquire fifty percent (50%) of the land to be acquired pursuant to Paragraph I.B, Proponents may, at their election, terminate this Agreement and stop all construction and operations at the Project. In the event of early termination, the DTPC's duties to enhance and perpetually manage replacement habitat it has acquired shall survive termination and Proponents shall be responsible for providing adequate enhancement and management funding to the DTPC for such acquired habitat.  July 8 2003 DRAFT Management Agreement Hyundai Motor America / City of California City  Page 3 of 11   III. OBLIGATIONS OF THE PARTIES A. ACQUISITION, ENHANCEMENT AND PERPETUAL MANAGEMENT OF REPLACEMENT HABITAT.  The Parties shall undertake and fulfill the following responsibilities and obligations: 1. Proponents (a) Escrow Accounts. Proponents shall establish an Escrow Account in order to adequately fund the habitat acquisition, enhancement, and perpetual management activities under this Agreement. At the direction of Proponents, CDFG and the Service, monies will be paid out of such Escrow Account to DTPC or to a Purchase Escrow Account under certain conditions cited below. (i) Acquisition Fund. To effectuate acquisition of 3,228.5 acres of replacement habitat, Proponents will allocate $3,061,586.50 ($948.30/acre) for the cost of acquiring and transferring desert tortoise and Mohave ground squirrel habitat into two (2) categories for payment. (1) Acquisition Management Fee. A firm-fixed acquisition management fee of $252,791.55 (9% of $2,808,795) will be paid to DTPC from the Escrow Account for professional fees, travel expenses, and other administrative costs required to implement this Agreement (collectively ""Acquisition Management Fee""). Payments to the DTPC will be made in pro-rated installments upon DTPC's successful acquisition in fee title of replacement habitat. The following example will illustrate the pro-rata formula for payment to the DTPC of its Acquisition Management Fee: ""A total of 3,228.5 acres is required to be acquired. DTPC acquires 323 acres in fee title and submits all settlement documents to Proponents. DTPC's acquisition at that time constitutes ten percent (10%) of the total acreage required. Therefore, DTPC presents a written request to Proponents, CDFG and Service for release from the Proponents' Escrow Account of a total amount equal to ten percent (10%) of the stipulated $252,791.55 Acquisition Management Fee amounting to $25,279.16."" (2) Direct Acquisition Costs. Proponents will direct that Escrow Account monies in the amount of $2,808,795 ($870/acre) be paid to or on behalf of DTPC from the Escrow Account into a Purchase Escrow Account to pay for the purchase price, outstanding taxes July 8 2003 DRAFT Management Agreement Hyundai Motor America / City of California City Page 4 of 11   and other liens and encumbrances, escrow fees, title fees, Phase I Environmental Report, and documentary and recording fees (collectively ""Direct Acquisition Costs"") of replacement habitat identified by DTPC and approved by the Proponents, the Service and CDFG. DTPC shall, prior to requesting a release of funds from the Escrow Account to the Purchase Escrow, submit to Proponents, the Serviceand CDFG for approval a ""Proposed Lands for Acquisition Form"" (""PLFAF"") as described in Exhibit ""A"", an Estimated Closing Statement, a Preliminary Title Report, and a Conservation Easement Deed as described in Exhibit ""B"" (collectively ""Escrow Documents""). Once the Proponents, the Service and CDFG provides written approval to DTPC of such Escrow Documents, monies held in the Escrow Account shall be transferred to a Purchase Escrow Account to finalize acquisition of approved replacement habitat. (2) Excess Direct Acquisition Funds. In the event that excess funds remain in the Escrow Account or the Purchase Escrow Account after the requisite acres of replacement habitat have been acquired (""Surplus Funds""), such Surplus Funds shall remain the property of Proponents and may, at the direction of Proponents, be used to purchase additional desert tortoise and Mohave ground squirrel habitat acreage in excess of the acres required to mitigate the Project Impacts. The Parties agree that any such excess acreage may be used at Proponents' direction for other future projects requiring mitigation for impacts to desert tortoise and Mohave ground squirrel or their habitat. (3) Additional Direct Acquisition Funding. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, if the funding budgeted by Proponents for Direct Acquisition Costs is not sufficient to accomplish the acquisition of 3,228.5 acres of replacement habitat, Proponents shall be responsible for providing additional funding necessary to complete its replacement habitat acquisition requirements. In the event that additional direct acquisition funding is required, the DTPC agrees that no additional funding will be required for its Acquisition Management Fee. (ii) Enhancement Fund. Proponents will pay to the DTPC $500,417.50 ($155/acre) for DTPC's use in performing activities designed for the initial protection of 3228.5 acres of habitat acquired (hereinafter ""The Enhancement Fund""). Monies from the Escrow Account shall be released to the DTPC on a pro-rated basis upon DTPC's acquisition of a percentage of the total required replacement habitat. The amount required for the Enhancement Fund is subject to change based on an  July 8 2003 DRAFT Management Agreement Hyundai Motor America / City of California City  Page 5 of 11   independent analysis to be performed by the DTPC and agreed to by all the parties. (iii) Management Fund. Proponents will pay to CDFG or to the DTPC $1,275,257.50 ($395/acre) for use in performing activities designed for the management in perpetuity of 3228.5 acres of habitat acquired (hereinafter ""The Endowment Fund""). Monies from the Escrow Account shall be released to CDFG or to the DTPC on a pro-rated basis upon acquisition of a percentage of the total required replacement habitat. The amount required for the Endowment Fund is subject to change based on an independent analysis to be performed by the DTPC and agreed to by all the parties.  (b) In the alternative, Proponents may establish letters of credit, in the amounts described in Subsection (a) above, to provide financial assurance for the acqusition, enhancement and endowment of 3,228.5 acres of compensation lands. The form of the letters of credit will be subject to the approval of Proponents, the Service, CDFG and DTPC. 2. DTPC (a) DTPC shall, within thirty (30) days of receiving a request by Proponents, prepare on behalf of Proponents, a Land Acquisition Implementation Plan that satisfies the requirements of the USFWS and CDFG. (b) DTPC shall, as authorized agent for Proponents, within Three Hundred and Sixty-five (365) days from the effective date of this Agreement, acquire fee title to the acreage required under Paragraph I.B. pursuant to its Land Acquisition Implementation Plan; or within any other area acceptable to Proponents, the Service and CDFG. DTPC shall exercise good faith efforts to acquire the mitigation lands at fair market value. (c) DTPC shall convey to the State of California a Conservation Easement Deed for the replacement habitat acquired in a form acceptable to CDFG. The documents conveying such interests in lands and the conditions of title shall be approved prior to acceptance by either the Fish and Game Commission or the Wildlife Conservation Board. A copy of the proposed Conservation Easement Deed is attached as Exhibit ""B."" (d) Until all of the compensation land is acquired, DTPC shall provide a monthly report to Proponents, and any interested party authorized by Proponents to receive such reports, that accounts for any expenditures of the funds and any activities taken by the DTPC under this Agreement. (e) DTPC shall, prior to undertaking any activities that are inconsistent with or materially differ from the terms and conditions of the Service or CDFG incidental July 8 2003 DRAFT Management Agreement Hyundai Motor America / City of California City Page 6 of 11   take permits, the Proponents' Habitat Conservation Plan, or this Agreement, obtain prior approval by the Parties to this Agreement. (f) With respect to any habitat acquired under this Agreement, the DTPC shall issue an annual report describing its enhancement and management activities for the replacement habitat, the condition (both improvements and negative impacts) of the replacement habitat, and a financial report concerning the Enhancement and Endowment funds. IV. REMEDIES AND ENFORCEMENT A.

A law on immovable property registration has recently been introduced to parliament and the government has requested that the next step be the implementation of a pilot registration project. To facilitate work on the design of the pilot system and provide the technical assistance team more information for the initial design phase of the system, a brief study was conducted in March 1996 on the existing arrangements for recording rights in immovable property. This report highlights key aspects of the three existing registration systems and concludes that the key to the success of the pilot project will be cooperation among the many agencies involved in immovable property registration.   EXECUTIVE SUMMARY  This report on the existing systems for recording rights in immovable property is part of the preparation for the pilot registration project in the Kyrgyz Republic. The input is aimed at reducing the amount of time the technical assistance team spends familiarizing itself with basic existing arrangements for immovable property registration. Presently, registration of immovable property objects is fragmented among agencies and dependent on the category of the immovable property object. Two different systems exist for recording urban land and agricultural land and yet another is used for recording ownership and other rights in apartments, homes, and buildings. The report focuses on the mapping, documentation, records, and transactions aspects of the three registration systems. Some similarities do exist between the existing systems and the pilot project proposed for the country. First, rights to immovable property are recorded at the local level.   Second, all systems feature some basic components and capabilities that will be utilized in the pilot project: base maps, records, archives, and documentation. The pilot project= s biggets challenge will be unifying all documents issued by various agencies in the privatization processes into a single system. Additionally, understanding the rights granted in immovable property, how to record those rights, confronting the issue of high notary taxes on transactions with immovable property, and fostering cooperation among the various agencies involved in registration are considered key issues to be addressed during the pilot project. Attachments 1-10 provide an understanding of the information gathered by the agencies involved in registration.   Existing Systems for Recording Information on Objects of Immovable Property in the Kyrgyz Republic INTRODUCTION The transition to a market economy in the Kyrgyz Republic has resulted in the transfer of property rights from the State to individuals and enterprises. Since 1991, when private rights were created in land, apartments, and buildings, a market in immovable property has slowly evolved along with the establishment of a legal foundation allowing the transfer of such rights. A key to facilitating the development of this market and protecting the rights held in immovable property by individuals, families, enterprises, and organizations, is the establishment of a property registration system. Such a system should be characterized by simplicity of use, affordable fees for registering transactions, and most importantly should provide those holding rights in property with a sense of security in knowing that when a right is registered it is protected. A unified property registration system that registers private rights in all types of immovable property is a new concept to officials in the Kyrgyz Republic. That there should be a single office assigned solely a record-keeping function is difficult for even specialists to comprehend, since the recording of rights has always been fragmented among various agencies that each have responsibility for a specific type of immovable property. In the past the State had sole responsibility for assigning rights in agricultural and urban land and heavily regulated the transfer of rights in homes and apartments. In fact, the systems that existed for recording rights to property were designed to provide information to the State on the use of properties and, more importantly, the quantitative and qualitative characteristics of properties. Thus, the notion of establishing one office where all immovable property objects are registered is unique to the Kyrgyz experience. With the exception of private homes, which were presumably held in private ownership throughout the Soviet era, all immovable property was considered property of the state and given to enterprises in use for an indefinite period of time. Apartment complexes were commonly the property of a ministry, state agency, or state enterprise, which provided housing for its employees. The sale of homes was permitted and the exchange of apartments was common. 1 However,  1   Howev er, a   person could   sell, and   presum ably   own, only   one home.   There are no   longer restricti   ons on the   number of   homes one   legislation prohibited an active, unregulated immovable property market. 2. EXISTING SYSTEMS At present there are three known systems that are administered by three separate agencies for maintaining records on objects of immovable property in Kyrgyzstan. Two different systems exist  may own.   for recording use-rights held in agricultural and urban land and still another system is used for recording the ownership of 2 private homes, apartments, and buildings. Records on agricultural land parcels are maintained by the rayon Centers for Land and Agrarian Reform (CLARs) 3; records on urban land parcels are kept by the rayon architect= s office (Architectura ), and records on private homes, apartments, and privately-owned buildings are held by the Bureau of Technical Inventory ( BTI ) offices at the rayon level.4 Lastly, records on state-owned buildings are kept by the State Property Fund (SPF). However, after these buildings are privatized the right to ownership is then registered with BTI and the official record on the right to use the land around the building is recorded at Architectura . 5 All offices recording such rights are branches of a larger network and have counterparts at the oblast and national levels that offer methodological and procedural support. Most of the actual recording of rights and changes in rights to immovable property, however, is done at the rayon level. 6  2  It is not known where mineral rights are recorded now. However, the March 1996 version of the draft Law on Mining stated that such rights were to be licensed and recorded in a separate registry maintained by the State Committee on Geology and Minerals. 3 The rayon-level offices receive assistance from the State Institute on Land Resources and Land Engineering in Bishkek. This institute was recently transferred out of the Ministry of Agriculture and placed under the new State Land Inspection Agency. 4 Initially it was thought that recording of rights to immovable property occurred only at the rayon-level offices. However, the 1991 Land Code states that rural, village, and city councils (the local legislatures) also allocate and record rights to land within their respective jurisdictions. 5 In registering ownership of a building, BTI also records land assigned in use to the owner of the building. Thus, records of use-rights around a building would be recorded in two places, the official record being with the Architect= s office. 6 BTI and Architectura devote an entire office to larger cities , where there are a large number of properties. Most of the cities however, are covered by the rayon-level offices.   None of the offices= recording rights to immovable property can be considered the analog of a registration office in a western country (BTI would probably most resemble a registration office as it seems to have little or no responsibility for policy formulation). As mentioned above, the rayon offices of the various agencies are each part of a larger system that performs many functions in addition to recording the owners and users of immovable property. National-level offices collect quantitative and qualitative data on land and buildings to make policy recommendations to the government in areas such as land reform and urban planning. These systems are vestiges of the Soviet administrative apparatus that were created to facilitate economic planning and keep authorities informed of the quantity and quality of the country= s assets and natural resources. Thus, information recorded by these separate systems focused not merely on interests held and by whom, but on detailed characteristics of immovable property as well. A brief summary of functions performed by these various agencies follows. The Architect= s office performs a land-use management and planning function within the limits of a locality and is subordinate maintains records on the holders of land use-rights in urban areas and assists the local administration in processing requests for To obtain use-rights to urban land a person or enterprise must submit an application to the head of the local administration that the intended purpose, and period of use. Architectura must then respond to the request on the basis of whether the requested planned development and zoning of the city. These offices have no jurisdiction over agricultural land. to the local administration. It also grants of use-rights to urban land. describes the location of the parcel, use-rights are compatible with  BTI maintains records on the technical characteristics of buildings, such as the extent of infrastructure development serving the structure, construction material of walls, ceilings, floors, description of the land parcel around a structure (assigned in use to owner), and amount of land under pavement, in orchards, gardens, etc. BTI also verifies the ownership of properties in transactions involving homes, apartments, and buildings. Each rayon CLAR maintains an inventory of land resources that forms the basis for an annual report that is prepared for the oblast CLAR and further sent on to the government in Bishkek. On the basis of this information, the government makes changes in agricultural, land reform, and land-use policy. The CLARs exist at the rayon, oblast, and republic levels and have specific tasks related to the land reform. They are responsible for surveying parcels of individuals and enterprises applying for land allocations. CLARs issue the State Akts on the Right to Possess/Use a Land Parcel, which serve as evidence of use-rights granted. Until recently, rayon and oblast CLARs were organs of the local administration, now they are subordinate to the Republican CLAR in Bishkek within the Ministry of Agriculture. A project institute in Bishkek, the State Institute for Land Resources and Engineering (Kyrgyzgiprozem ) provides methodological assistance to the oblast and rayon offices. The mapping, records, and documentation used by the existing systems will be outlined briefly below. 3. MAPPING  Base maps for urban and rural land are provided by Kyrgyzgeodesia , the State Enterprise for Geodesy. Architectura and Kyrgyzgiprozem adapt the base maps to suit their needs. Maps for urban areas are produced at a scale of 1:2,000 and 1:5,000 for rural areas. Large urban areas such as Osh and Bishkek are divided into sections, each map presumably covers several city blocks or perhaps entire quarters of a city. The average number of properties and area covered by each base map in urban areas is unknown. In rural areas one map exists for each former state or collective farm, the territory over which the rural committee for land and agrarian reform has jurisdiction. Such territories average about 30,000 hectares - perhaps 5,000 hectares of arable land with most of the remainder in pasture. All three agencies have their own teams of geodesists who prepare the larger scale and individual parcel maps. It is assumed that BTI uses base maps produced by Kyrgyzgeodezia as well, but this should be confirmed. In addition to producing base maps for numbering and indexing properties, surveyors at the rayon and local level offices produce sketches of the individual parcels allotted to individuals. The sketch is usually attached to the document issued on use-rights. Likewise, BTI surveyors produce sketches of the buildings, apartments, and homes held in private ownership. Sketch maps for agricultural parcels are produced at the 1:10,000 scale; for urban parcels and homes, apartments, and buildings, the sketches are done at a 1:500 scale. (note, this information should be confirmed) Architectura notes the coordinates of individual parcels on the State Akts - the document that serves as proof of the right to use a land parcel. Such coordinates were not noticed on those State Akts issued by the CLARs, nor were coordinates noticed on BTI documents. It is likely however, that all agencies use the same system of coordinates for determining the location and providing a legal description of an immovable property object.(information should be confirmed) All three agencies have a unique numbering system for the properties identified on base maps. These are linked to a system of records containing information on the properties. Each numbering system is different: Architectura numbers urban land parcels, BTI numbers private homes and buildings, and the agricultural land   parcels are coded according to Kyrgyzgiprozem =s numbering system. Even Architectura and BTI use different systems, although it would seem logical for them to use a single system.7  Architectura divides urban areas by blocks and gives each separate parcel a distinct number. BTI also labels properties according to the block and the parcel number (probably the street address). Agricultural parcels are labeled with a five-character code according to oblast, rayon, zone, parcel number, and order number (perhaps State Akt number). For example, parcel N-Zh-10-N4-61 where N = Naryn oblast, Dzh = Dzhumgal rayon, 10 = zone, N4 = parcel number four, and order number 61. 4. 4.1 DOCUMENTATION OF RIGHTS Homes, Apartments, and Privately-owned Buildings  Each immovable property object has a document which serves as evidence of ownership or use-rights. A Technical Passport exists for each home, apartment, and privately-owned building and contains detailed information on the structure. It is not clear whether this document proves ownership of a structure. In the case of a purchase-sale transaction on a home for example, BTI proves ownership by checking its records and determining whether the person wanting to sell the property is indeed is the owner. Other documentation on the property includes a sketch map, as described above in the section on mapping. This sketch will include the basic property object, any land assigned in use to the owner of the property, and any other structures on the land parcel.  7  Officials at Architectura insisted that the numbering systems are different, however the difference may be in that BTI adds a third, registration number to the block-parcel code. The registration number does not appear on the base map, only on the registration folder and in the registration book.   4.2  Urban Land Use-rights  An individual or enterprise seeking permission to use a parcel of land must apply to the head of the local administration (rayon, city, village) to request use-rights to the parcel. If the local administration approves the application, Architectura issues a State Akt, the document confirming the use-right. A State Akt on the Right to Possess/Use a land parcel is, in principle, issued for indefinite (99 years) use-rights, and Certificates for the Right to Temporary Use of a Land Parcel are issued for fixed-term use-rights, typically 5-10 years. Both documents are identical to those issued for agricultural parcels. The Akt contains information on the terms and conditions of land use, name of the land user, and a sketch map of the parcel. The Akt is issued in two copies, one to the user and one for Architectura files. Official coordinates are only written on one example of the Akt, the one kept by Architectura . The Architect= s office will then serves as arbiter in any dispute over property boundaries. Temporary use rights are documented with the Certificate on the Right to Temporary Use of a Land Parcel. Maps are produced at a 1:500 scale and a physical description, map, and payment figure for the parcel are included. 4.3 Agricultural Land  The Centers for Land and Agrarian Reform are responsible for the survey of land parcels allocated to farm units and the issue of the State Akts on the Right to Use a Land Parcel. State Akts are in theory issued only for those enterprises holding land in 99-yr. use, but in practice have been issued for short-term rent agreements. In addition, the CLARs issue Certificates on the Right to Use a Land Share to heads of households. These Certificates are in principle issued for abstract shares of land located within a larger parcel of land belonging to a collective. In practice however, these Certificates sometimes have a sketch map of a defined parcel of land surveyed by the CLAR. Additionally, the CLARs issue a Certificate on the Right to Temporary Use of a Land Parcel. These are, in theory, issued for all land use arrangements less than 99 yrs. As mentioned   above,however, State Akts are sometimes issued for short-term rent agreements. Information on the State Akt includes a sketch map of the parcel at a 1:10,000 scale and a metes and bounds description. The purpose of use, period of use, name of land user, and the enterprise from which land has been given in use is recorded on the Akt (if indeed the land has been taken from another enterprise). Each Akt has a unique number and each time the boundaries of the enterprise= s land-holdings change a new Akt is to be issued. In practice however, the existing State Akt is merely updated to reflect the change. There is a section on both the State Akts and Certificates for noting transactions with the land share or land parcel. Thus far, mortgages are recorded only with the local notary office. 5. RECORDS  Detailed records on urban land parcels, homes, buildings, and apartments are maintained by Architectura and BTI respectively. In addition to the size, ownership, and location characteristics one would expect to find, information on land parcels includes soil types, ground water levels, extent of tectonic activity. BTI records contain such information as construction material of a building or apartment, infrastructure attributes (such as water and electricity availability), and information on the land parcel assigned in use to the owner of the home or building. Old records for individual agricultural parcels featured such information as soil analyses, proper crop rotations for achieving optimal soil fertility, and distance to market for various crops produced. Current records were not reviewed and likely do not exist, since the number of agricultural land-users has risen from roughly 500 in 1991 to over 26,000 in 1996. 5.1 BTI Records  BTI maintains a separate record for each privately-owned home, apartment, and building. The records of BTI consist of four components: a folder, a card catalog, map, and the archives.   Each property has a unique folder containing all documents (technical passport, building permits, agreements) issued for a building, house, or apartment. The folders are catalogued according to block then by street address of the structure. The folder contains a map of the property, information on technical characteristics of the structure, property value, and qualitative and quantitative characteristics of the land around to the structure. The folder contains records on mortgages, restrictions, and court decisions on the property or on the owner= s rights to conduct transactions with the property. The numbering system of properties is done according to block and parcel number.8 When entered into the registration book, the property then receives a registration number. For example, a certain property has the following number 1440 (Block) 24 (parcel), 45902 (registration number). The name of owner is written on front of folder. It is not clear what happens when ownership changes, whether the number remains the same and the new owner= s name is written on the front of the folder, or whether a new number is given to the folder. Folders viewed at BTI had a list of several successive owners with all owners names crossed out on the folder except for that of the current owner. The registration books were not examined in detail and therefore cannot be described in detail here. Presumably, the information entered is: date of registration, registration number, owner, address of the property, and rights held in the property. The property 1440 24 45902 is recorded in volume 23, the number of the registration volume has no significance. A person registering a property receives a copy of the folder with a stamp placed on the registration paper when the process is completed. BTI= s card catalog or kartoteka offers a quick reference to properties and is alphabetized  8  This parcel number is probably the street address. However, it was repeatedly referred to as the parcel number.   according to owner and street address. A potential buyer may visit kartoteka to inquire about the status of a property, whether there is with the property or whether the owner is under so-called A arrest@ conducting any transactions with the object. The kartoteka offers a interests in a property that have been registered with BTI.  BTI and look through the an A arrest@ on transactions and thus prohibited from brief summary of all existing  The Bureau maintains close ties with notary offices and the Tax Inspectorate. The local notary office informs BTI of the existence of a mortgage and the mortgage is then recorded in the BTI database. Sometimes this process occurs within a few days of pledging the property, sometimes it takes 15-20 days. BTI has plans to computerize its entire system, but as yet does not have sufficient funds. The noting of mortgages on a property is done by computer making inquiries for this information much easier. 5.2 Architectura Records  The information on each State Akt is recorded in a A registration book@ , which contains the following information: the number of the Akt, name of applicant, client, and the location of land (i.e. example shown had following information: applicant = small enterprise, client = office, and location = Moscow street). The parcel number is recorded in the registration book and corresponds with the number for the folder containing information on the parcel. Included in the folder is the document upon which the land use-right has been granted. A folder is created for each land parcel and is labeled with the parcel number. The folder contains a map of the parcel, information on what rights exist on the parcel, name of the land user, and also information on types of activities allowed on the structures (i.e. administrative buildings, garages, etc.). There is a card catalog, indexed to a map of properties at a scale of 1:5,000. A single index card exists for each land parcel and holds information such as the owner of the use-rights to a land parcel, the type of rights held, and all documents stating which rights an enterprise has to which parcel of land. This catalog is similar to that found at BTI and displays the key information on the   land parcel. 5.3 Records on Agricultural Land  The Registration Book for agricultural land parcels was not viewed. It is not known for sure whether the Registration Book referred to in legislation differs from the annual report on landholdings sent up to the oblast. It is likely, however, that there is a Registration Book for recording the date of registration, number of the State Akt, name of land user, and the number of the parcel assigned to the user. The type of rights granted and period of use are also probably recorded. 6. TRANSACTIONS -- NOTARY OFFICES  Notaries are part of the Ministry of Justice system and certify all documents on transactions involving immovable property. There is one notary office in each rayon. At the farm level the rural council (legislative body at the farm level) is empowered with some, but not all, of the functions performed by the notary offices.9 Notaries now record all transactions involving homes, apartments, and buildings. Their role in the buying and selling of land use-rights is less clear, however. Each sale of a house, apartment, or building requires that a special appraisal committee meet to determine whether the property value reported by the owner is accurate. This is done to prevent the seller from understating the value of the property, thereby reducing the notary tax on the transaction, which is set at ten percent of the appraisal value of the  9  Rural committees are not allowed to handle inheritance transactions. Moreover, it is possible that pending legislation will restrict the activities of the rural councils in transactions.   property. 10 Most (90 percent) of the money collected from such transactions goes to augment the local budget, ten percent goes to the Ministry of Justice to fund the development of the court system. 6.1 Transactions with Houses, Apartments, and Buildings  In principle, the purchase, sale, lease, or mortgage of a home, private apartment, or privately owned building requires two visits to BTI and one visit to the local notary office. For example, if a person wishes to sell his home, he would need first to bring his proof of ownership documents to BTI in order for that office to issue the verification that he indeed is the legal owner of the property. A fee is assessed depending on the urgency of the transaction. 11 Both parties to the transaction then take the BTI verification paper to the notary= s office, where the notary certifies and records the transaction. The notary assesses a fee of 10 percent of the value of the transaction unless it is a gift or inheritance. The certification issued by the notary is then taken back to BTI, where the new owner= s name is recorded on the certificate of ownership in the registration book, on the folder, and in the kartoteka. 6.2 Urban Land Use-Rights  Transfers of use-rights require approval of the local administration, but it is not clear whether a purchase-sale agreement on the land use-rights is subject to confirmation by a notary. For example, if an enterprise in the city of Bishkek is sold, registration of the building to the new  10  Inheritance transfers and gifts of property to relatives are assessed at three percent of appraisal value. A gift to a stranger is assessed at 20 percent of the appraisal value. 11 Fees are assessed depending on the urgency. Urgent transactions, those recorded in course of one hour, cost 52 som, in the course of one day - 31 som , and in the course of one month - 10 som .   owner requires two visits to BTI and one visit to the notary. To transfer use-rights for the land parcel, the new owner must file a formal application with the local administration and upon approval, Architectura must prepare a new State Akt in the name of the new land-user. It is possible that land use-rights are now purchased and sold freely. However, it is likely that all such transactions must be approved by the local administration before land use-rights are transferred.12 Architectura has initiated work on a system to record mortgages of land parcels. The information recorded includes the name of the use-right holder, the land pledged, address and amount of mortgage, and the folder number of the mortgaged property. Unlike BTI, which relies on communication with the notaries for receiving news on mortgages, Architectura relies on the banks to report the existence of a mortgage. A bank, however, may grant a mortgage on a land parcel without ever contacting Architectura . Thus, only in cases where the bank contacts Architectura to report that a mortgage has been granted against the parcel does Architectura have full information on existing mortgages. 6.3 Agricultural Land Use-Rights  Many of those owning Certificates on the Right to use a Land Share have rented out their shares to a farm enterprise. The head of the farm enterprise simply gathers the documents of those persons from whom he is renting the shares and registers them with the CLAR when he applies for a land parcel. No visit to a notary is required in such transactions. Purchase and sale of a physical parcel of land, in essence the transfer of a State Akt,  12  A more fundamental question is from whom are the use-rights purchased, the current user or the local administration? Further, the 1991 Land Code prohibits purchase-sale, and mortgage of land parcels. However, urban parcels are being mortgaged, either on the basis of more recent legislation, or in anticipation of enabling legislation.   is more complicated. It is not even clear in the existing legislation whether this is legal, however there are provisions for transfer of these parcels in the draft Land Code. Officials at Kyrgyzgiprozem argue that sale of such parcels is permitted and that the transaction occurs on the initiative of the parties involved. A State Akt, however, cannot be sold without the approval and signatures of all those contributing land shares to the enterprise. The procedure for such a sale is unclear largely because such a sale is not known to have happened in Kyrgyzstan. Further, it is quite possible that such a sale also requires approval of the head of the local administration. Moreover, mortgage of agricultural land parcels has only occurred when the mortgagee has been registered by the government via the rayon Departments of Agriculture. No transactions have been reported where the mortgagee is a bank. Rural banks claim that they are not willing to accept land as collateral because there is not yet a law regulating the practice. Conversely, urban land is pledged as collateral. It is likely the perceived inability of farmers to repay the credit or the perception that in the case of default the land would not fetch much in a sale makes banks hesitate in providing loans backed by land. CONCLUSION The pilot immovable property registration project will face the challenge of gathering all documents issued thus far by the various privatization programs and recording them in one system. The most difficult tasks will include understanding the rights created, since they have changed steadily in the last four years and devising a way to record them such that future changes and tendencies will be foreseen. Cooperation among the various agencies involved, especially for purposes of obtaining base maps of properties, will be a key factor in the success of the pilot project. Further, the issue of notary fees will have to be   addressed, as the current rates provide a sure deterrent to registering property transfers. The ultimate task of the pilot project will be to name an agency to oversee and monitor registration activities. This agency could be : an existing agency at the national level such as BTI or Architectura, a new agency at the national level, or local administrations empoered with full control over registration activities, subject to annual review by a national advisory group. In short, there are many questions that remain unanswered about the allocation, transfer, recording, and documentation of rights to immovable property. It is expected that the pilot registration project will clarify these questions and lay the institutional foundation for an immovable property registration system to operate throughout Kyrgyzstan.   ATTACHMENT S   (Folder for all documents on a privately-owned building, house, or apartment) Block No. __________ Parcel No. _________  ATTACHMENT 1  Rayon _________________ City of Bishkek Inventorization Folder on Home Ownership  Street _____________________________________________  Building No. _________  Owner ___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ _________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ ___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ ___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ ___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ ___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ ___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ ___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ ______ ___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________   ___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ ___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ ___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ ___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ _____________________________________________________________ Note: Each structure has a separate folder in which all information on the building is filed.

SUMMARY: This rule requires a minimum number of business hours for permit holders under the Florida Drug and Cosmetic Act, Chapter 499, Florida Statutes. SUMMARY OF STATEMENT OF ESTIMATED REGULATORY COST: This rule will not impact the vast majority of permit holders because they currently meet the minimum business hours proposed in this rule. However, some businesses may have to hire additional staff in order to meet these requirements. Even though businesses are currently required to designate business hours on the application, for ease of calculation, the economic impact will be based on hiring an additional staff person at minimum wage. The impact may amount to either $2,678 ($5.15 per hour X 10 hours per week X 52 weeks) or $5,356 ($5.15 per hour X 20 hours per week X 52 weeks) annually depending upon whether the business must hire additional staff to meet the 10 or 20 hour minimum.

The purpose of the Fund is to provide a stable and ongoing source of reimbursement to insurers for a portion of their catastrophic hurricane losses and thus protect homeowners' from the loss of reliable property insurance coverage. The yearly hurricane season runs from June 1 through November 30. The Fund enters into reimbursement contracts with insurers, effective June 1, to ensure coverage for the hurricane season. This year, during the Legislative Session, several bills were passed which affect these reimbursement contracts and the exposure information reported to the Fund. Specifically, coverage under the reimbursement contracts was added for certain collateral protection policies and certain additional living expenses. These emergency rules amend Rule 19-8.010, F.A .C. and 19-8.029, F.A.C. including the reimbursement contract, Form No. FHCF-2002K, incorporated into Rule 19-8.010, F.A.C., the insurer reporting requirements, Form Nos. FHCF-D1A and FHCF-D1B, the interim loss report, Form No. FHCF-L1A, the proof of loss report, Form No. FHCF-L1B and the reinsurance recovery worksheet, Form No. FHCF-L1C, all of which are incorporated into Rule 19-8.029, F.A.C. The amendments are necessary because CS/SB 1418 became law on May 9, 2002 and CS/H B 385 became law on May 29, 2002. The reimbursement contract (incorporated into Rule 19-8.010, F.A.C.) must be signed and returned by June 1, and the insurer reporting requirements (incorporated into Rule 19-8.029, F.A.C.) are due September 1. These dates cannot be met under the normal time frame for promulgating rules. The interim and proof of loss reports and the reinsurance recovery w orksheets (incorporated into Rule 19-8.029, F.A.C.) must be ready for insurers use when  NAME OF PERSON ORIGINATING PROPOSED RULE: Board of Respiratory Care NAME OF SU PERVISOR OR PERSON WH O APPROVED THE PROPOSED RULE: Board of Respiratory Care DATE PROPO SED RULE APPRO VED BY AGENCY HEAD: January 11, 2002 DATE NOTICE OF PROPOSED RU LE DEVELOPMENT PUBLISHED IN FAW: January 25, 2002 FLORIDA HOUSING FINANCE CORPORATION RULE NOS.: RULE TITLES: 67-38.002 Definitions 67-38.0025 Notice of Funding Availability 67-38.003 Application Procedures 67-38.004 Selection and Rejection Criteria 67-38.005 Scoring and Ranking Guidelines 67-38.007 Terms and Conditions of the Loan 67-38.008 Eligible Uses for the Advance and Loan 67-38.010 Credit Underwriting Procedures 67-38.011 Fees 67-38.012 Sale, Transfer or Conveyance of Project 67-38.014 Disbursement Procedures 67-38.0145 Compliance and Monitoring Procedures  2802 Section IV - Emergency Rules   Florida Administrative Weekly hurricane season begins on June 1 so that if a catastrophe occurs, no delay will be encountered in reimbursing insurers for their losses. REASONS FO R CONCLUDING THAT THE PROCED URE USED IS FAIR UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES: The emergency procedure will allow the Fund to enter into reimbursement contracts on June 1, will allow maximum notice to insurers of the new law changes prior to the due date of the insurer reporting requirements on September 1, and will ensure that if a catastrophic hurricane occurs early in the season, insurers will be able to report their losses and the FHCF will be able to ascertain and pay losses. SUMMARY OF THE RULES: Rule 19-8.010, F.A.C. and the reimbursement contract incorporated therein, Rule 19-8.029, F.A.C. and the insurer reporting requirements (Data Call), the interim loss report, Form No. FHCF-L1A , the proof of loss report, Form No. FHCF-L1B and the reinsurance recovery worksheet, Form No. FHCF-L1C, incorporated therein, will be amended to include Fund coverage for certain collateral protection coverage and certain additional living expenses and will, likewise, require these exposures to be reported.

Printed on recycled paper.   Executive Summary Introduction In June 2001, the Office of the Inspector General initiated a review of a public works project in Melrose, Massachusetts in response to a complaint alleging procurement law violations and mismanagement. The project, undertaken by the City of Melrose in May 2000, entailed the delivery by a private contractor to the Mount Hood Memorial Park and Golf Course of 690,665 tons of glacial till soils, or ""fill,"" excavated from the Central Artery/Third Harbor Tunnel (CA/T) Project for the purpose of constructing playing fields and golf course improvements. The CA/T Project had contracted with Modern  Continental Construction Company, Inc. for excavation of the fill. The City contracted with Gator Hood, LLC for delivery of the excavated fill and related construction services. The fill was delivered to the site by Modern Continental under a separate contract between Modern Continental and Gator. The Office's review covered the period of April 2000, one month prior to the commencement of fill deliveries to Mount Hood, through August 2001, one month after fill deliveries to Mount Hood ended. This report also summarizes significant projectrelated contracts and events through December 2001. The principal focus of the  Office's review was the process by which fill deliveries and related construction services at Mt. Hood were procured, contracted for, and managed at Mount Hood. The Office's review did disclose both procurement law violations and mismanagement. A confidential draft of this report was provided to the Mayor of Melrose on September 27, 2002. The Mayor's response is included in Appendix A of this report. During the course of this review, the Office sent three letters to the City. These letters are included in Appendix B of this report.  i   Findings 1. The City embarked on a project involving major alterations to Mount Hood without adequate planning, reliable cost estimates, or an executed contract protecting the City's interests. N The Park Commission authorized fill deliveries at Mount Hood without determining the scope, requirements, or cost of the improvement project. N The fill delivery agreement with Gator was not subject to any competitive procurement law. N The Park Commission authorized fill deliveries at Mount Hood for three months without executing a written contract. 2. The Park Department bypassed legal requirements and internal controls governing City contracts in order to expedite the acceptance of fill. N Prior to August 2000, the Park Department obtained CDM's services through an inappropriate contract between CDM and Gator. N Beginning in May 2000, the Park Department procured supplies and services for the project without the required appropriations by the Board of Aldermen. 3. Project accountability was undermined by the City's failure to establish a revolving account for the fill payments owed to the City by Gator. 4. 5. 6. The City's noncompetitive contract with Gator, although legally permissible, was ill advised. The City's contract with Gator contained poorly drafted and unfavorable provisions that undermined the City's financial interests. The City's contract with Gator did not include detailed plans identifying fill delivery locations and boundaries, nor did it include fill placement instructions or specifications. The City's contract with Gator did not specify fill delivery schedules or limit fill delivery hours. The City's contract with Gator lacked the prevailing wage rate schedule required by M.G.L. c. 149, 26 and 27, the prevailing wage law.  7. 8.  ii   9.  The City did not obtain the contractually required performance and payment bonds securing Gator's satisfactory performance and securing full payment of its obligations to the City.  10. Shortly after being ordered to comply with environmental restrictions on the haul road construction work, the Park Department obtained contaminated loam for the golf course from another source. 11. Supervision of the fill deliveries at Mount Hood was inadequate. N The Park Department did not collect and maintain shipping tickets corresponding to fill deliveries, as required by the July 2000 contract with Gator. N The Park Department directed ELM to provide clerk of the works services without establishing systematic oversight procedures or executing a written contract specifying ELM's hours, duties, and compensation. N For seven months, trucks delivered more than 321,000 tons of fill to Mount Hood without supervision by a clerk of the works. 12. The Park Department authorized Gator to use funds owed to the City to pay for apparently illegal Park Department procurements of supplies and services at Mount Hood. 13. Lack of planning, supervision, and documentation by the Park Department contributed to the failure of a drainpipe installed on the twelfth fairway. N Installation of the drainpipe without final design documents violated the November 2000 Order of Conditions and exposed the City to construction problems. N The drainpipe installation contractor was hired on a no-bid basis, in apparent violation of Massachusetts construction bid law. N The drainpipe installation was conducted without a written contract between the City and Dami and Sons, in violation of municipal finance law and sound business practices. N City records provided to the Office contained no reports, analysis, or other documentation of the drainpipe failure. 14. Unsound contracting procedures and deficient internal controls undermined the City's capacity to resolve the ongoing problems at Mount Hood in a costeffective, accountable manner.  iii   N Contractors hired without appropriations, bidding, or written contracts continued to perform construction work at Mount Hood after the release of the draft audit identifying procurement violations. N During the month following the Parks Superintendent's departure, fill deliveries and construction work at Mount Hood continued to be unsupervised. N The City made payments of more than $56,300 in June and July of 2001 for services procured in apparent violation of public procurement laws. 15. Contracts with two consultants were executed after contracted services had been performed. 16. Resolution of Gator's financial obligations to the City was complicated by the City's incomplete project records. N The City's calculation of Gator's outstanding financial obligation was inconsistent with the City's own records of the fill delivery project. N The City's fill delivery records did not comport with the records on file at the Central Artery/Tunnel Project. N Although Gator notified the City of a $17,500 credit to be deducted from Gator's obligations to the City, the Office's review disclosed that no such credit was warranted. 17. Throughout the review period, the City lacked consistent contract approval procedures that complied with municipal finance law for Mount Hood-related contracts. Conclusion and Recommendations In May 2000, the City of Melrose authorized a contractor to begin delivering Big Dig fill at the Mount Hood Memorial Park and Golf Course for the purpose of constructing new playing fields and improving the golf course. The substantial revenues to be generated for the City by this arrangement would be devoted to the new fields and golf course improvements. As of December 31, 2001, the project cost to the City was estimated to be $1.8 million. This amount was far greater than anticipated and created a financial strain on the City. The report delineates many of the factors contributing to the unexpectedly high project  iv   cost. However, the Office notes that the $1.8 million estimate is lower than the cost that the City would have incurred if it had paid market rates for the fill. The Office's review indicates that the cost of purchasing 700,000 tons of fill would have been approximately $3 million. Rather than paying for fill, the City agreed to receive $0.70 per ton for the fill, translating to approximately $490,000. Thus, the $1.8 million cost to the City of a remediated site, a seeded athletic field, and completed golf course improvements may represent an economically fair cost, largely due to the avoidance of fill costs and receipt of fill revenues. Nevertheless, the unanticipated financial burden has had a deleterious effect on Melrose. The Office's review found no evidence that any City official promoted or executed this project for any purpose other than to benefit the City of Melrose by taking advantage of an opportunity that had been presented. City records reviewed by the Office, and  statements made to the Office by key participants in the decision-making process  including the former Mayor, the former Chairman of the Park Commission, and the former Parks Superintendent  imparted a clear sense of urgency and a perception that the Park Commission had to act quickly in order to take advantage of a unique opportunity to obtain fill and generate revenue for a public improvement project. To realize these benefits, the Park Commission accommodated the contractor's schedule by authorizing fill deliveries without first preparing environmental studies, project designs, or cost estimates; without testing the competitive marketplace; and without executing a written contract containing terms and conditions that protected the City's financial and environmental interests. By July of 2000, when the City executed a written contract with Gator, 199,449 tons of fill had already been deposited at Mount Hood. By August of 2001, when fill deliveries ended, the Park Department had completed reconstruction of the thirteenth hole, prepared plans for a new baseball field, and developed the baseball field ""pad."" However, no funds remained from the fill revenues received from Gator to finish the playing fields or to complete the golf course improvements. Although the value of the delivered fill was $483,466, the City had already spent more than this amount. The Office's review shows that as of August 31,  v   2001, the City's project-related costs and contractual obligations exceeded the value of the delivered fill by $291,620. (See Appendix C.) The public officials responsible for this massive public works project acknowledged that they underestimated its scope and complexity. Neither the Park Commission nor the three-person Park Department had the necessary resources to plan, execute, and effectively oversee this project. In interviews with the Office, the former Mayor, the former Chairman of the Park Commission, and the former Parks Superintendent acknowledged that, in hindsight, the Park Department should not have been expected to provide the necessary project supervision. It is important to recognize that the decision to generate revenue for a public improvement project by accepting fill for that project can be advantageous. Jurisdictions often incur substantial costs for fill needed for construction projects. However, the unanticipated costs and problems encountered on this project illustrate some of the drawbacks of moving too quickly to accept an attractive offer. Careful planning, best value contracting, a well-drafted contract that protects the owner's interests, and full-time supervision are important owner protections for any major construction project, whether public or private. The decision to undertake a complex project entailing substantial alterations to public parkland without these safeguards was risky. As Melrose's experience makes clear, it is unlikely that the benefits of such a complex revenue-generating arrangement can be realized without prudent project planning, contracting, and management. More broadly, the history of this project demonstrates the importance of adhering to legal requirements, sound contracting practices, and principles of public accountability. Fill revenues were spent without the required appropriations by the Board of Aldermen. Contractors were hired without competition and allowed to work at Mount Hood without written contracts. Consulting contracts were executed after contracted services were performed. Contract approval procedures were inconsistent and did not comport with municipal finance law. Project records were incomplete. If not corrected, the practices  vi   documented in this report could continue to render the City vulnerable to waste and mismanagement on future projects. Recommendations to the City of Melrose To assist the City of Melrose in its ongoing and future contracting efforts relating to public improvement projects at Mount Hood and elsewhere, the Office offers the following recommendations: 1. The City should resolve any outstanding financial disputes with Gator. 2. The City should resolve any outstanding financial disputes with other project contractors. 3. The Park Commission should ensure that public works contracts at Mount Hood are subject to full-time supervision by trained professionals who are cognizant of the legal requirements governing these contracts. 4. The City should take steps to ensure that all City officials with contracting responsibilities, including Park Commissioners and Park Department staff, are fully apprised of the legal requirements governing contract funding, procurement, execution, and administration. 5. The City should take steps to strengthen administrative controls over major contracts. Recommendations for Other Public Jurisdictions The problems created by the public works project at Mount Hood in Melrose offer some valuable lessons for other jurisdictions that may be contemplating revenue-generating contracts for the purpose of improving public property. It is important to recognize that this type of contract must be planned, executed, and overseen as carefully as any other major public works project. Melrose's experience underscores the importance of  instituting the following measures to protect the public interest on such projects, regardless of the compensation terms or financing arrangements: N Front-end planning by qualified professional staff or consultants should generate information on existing site conditions, a professional assessment of the potential environmental impacts, a well-defined project scope, and a detailed cost estimate. This information is essential to the development of a vii   realistic project budget that includes the cost of full-time professional oversight as well as a contingency for unforeseen circumstances. N If the project is deemed logistically and financially feasible, the jurisdiction should establish the major contract terms and conditions and incorporate these provisions into the specifications for a competitive selection process. N Both the solicitation and the final contract should include detailed plans and should comply with applicable laws, including procurement and prevailing wage laws. N Before the contractor begins work, the jurisdiction should develop an oversight plan that clearly defines the roles, responsibilities, and reporting relationships of those responsible for project supervision. N The jurisdiction should assign a project manager to serve as the locus of responsibility and accountability for the project. The project manager should be responsible for coordinating the contract, supervising the clerk of the works or other on-site supervisory personnel, monitoring the contract budget and contractor payments under the contract, and maintaining all project records. N The jurisdiction should invest in full-time, professional project supervision. Detailed documentation of project activities and decisions in the field should be prepared by the designated clerk of the works or other on-site supervisory personnel and reviewed by the project manager. N Significant changes to the contract price, scope, and/or schedule should be reflected in contract amendments signed by both parties. Instructions to the contractor issued by the project manager or his/her designee should also be recorded. N The jurisdiction should ensure that all project participants are fully apprised of and held accountable for compliance with the legal requirements and administrative procedures governing the project.  viii   Introduction In June 2001, the Office of the Inspector General initiated a review of a public works project in Melrose, Massachusetts in response to a complaint alleging procurement law violations and mismanagement. The project, undertaken by the City of Melrose in May 2000, entailed the delivery by a private contractor to the Mount Hood Memorial Park and Golf Course (hereinafter, ""Mount Hood"") of almost 700,000 tons of glacial till soils, or ""fill,"" excavated from the Central Artery/Third Harbor Tunnel (CA/T) Project for the purpose of constructing playing fields and golf course improvements. The CA/T Project had contracted with Modern Continental Construction Company, Inc. (hereinafter, ""Modern Continental"") for excavation of the fill. The City contracted with Gator Hood, LLC (hereinafter, ""Gator"") for delivery of the excavated fill and related construction services. The fill was delivered to the site by Modern Continental under a separate contract between Modern Continental and Gator. The principal focus of the Office's review was the process by which the City procured, contracted for, and managed the fill deliveries and related construction services at Mount Hood. The Office's review did disclose both procurement law violations and mismanagement. Background Melrose is a city of 27,134 located approximately seven miles north of Boston and covering 4.76 square miles. 2 1  Under Melrose's MayorBoard of Aldermen form of  government, the Mayor, the four Aldermen-at-Large, and the seven Ward Aldermen are elected every two years. The Board of Aldermen approves the City budget, all Mayoral appointments, and all appropriations by City departments. The City's Park Department, overseen by the five-member Park Commission, manages Mount Hood Memorial Park and Golf Course as well as other City parks. 1 2 3 3  The Park Department also provides  U.S. Census Bureau, Census 2000. Massachusetts Department of Housing and Community Development website, 2001.  Annual Report: City of Melrose  2000.  1   maintenance and oversight of all school fields and playgrounds. 5  4  During the period  covered by this review, the Park Department was staffed by three employees: a superintendent, a secretary, and a park maintenance worker. Mount Hood is a 230-acre city park that includes an 18-hole golf course, a clubhouse, and various other recreational features including hiking trails, an observation tower, and a playground. The park is funded primarily through revenues from the golf course, leases, and grants. Under Chapter 124 of the Acts of 1936, the enabling legislation for Mount Hood, the Park Commission has exclusive control over the use and management of the park. The five Park Commission members are appointed by the Mayor with the approval of the Board of Aldermen. Chapter 124 requires all revenues from Mount Hood to be deposited into a separate City account and appropriated for park uses by the Board of Alderman, upon recommendation by the Park Commission and subject to approval by the Mayor. The City completed a Master Plan for Mount Hood Memorial Park and Golf Course in April 1995. The Master Plan, which was prepared by the City's Office of Planning and Community Development, Camp Dresser & McKee, Inc. (CDM), and Armstrong Associates, identified ""a critical need to address the overall state of disrepair in which most Park and Golf Course elements are found."" 6  The Master Plan recommended  improvements to strengthen Mount Hood's ""successful balance of passive, public recreation, golf and environmental education that is highly visible and publicly accessible."" 7 8  The City's 1998 and 1999 Annual Reports show that in recent years, the  Park Department completed capital improvements consistent with those recommended 4 5  Annual Report: City of Melrose  1999 (p. 88).  This position was held in succession by two individuals during the review period: the Superintendent of Parks resigned on April 4, 2001, and an Interim Superintendent of Parks assumed responsibility for the Park Department on May 1, 2001.  City of Melrose, Master Plan for Mount Hood Memorial Park and Golf Course, 1995, p. 3. 7 8  6  Ibid, p. 8.  The City's 2000 Annual Report contained no information on the Park Commission, the Park Department, or Mount Hood. 2   in the 1995 Master Plan, including construction of a parking lot and a new play structure, replacement of some irrigation lines, development of a well to ensure adequate water for irrigation, and reconstruction of several holes of the golf course. The Park Commission has contracted out the operation and management of the Mount Hood park and golf course for many years. In March 2000, the Park Commission contracted with Environmental Landscape Management, Inc. (ELM) to manage Mount Hood, including the snack bar, pro shop, function hall, playground, ponds, and trails. Under the terms of its contract, ELM collected revenues from golf course operations and deposited them into a City account designated for Mount Hood. The City then paid ELM a portion of the monthly revenues in accordance with the terms and conditions of the management contract. Under the contract, the City was responsible for capital 9  improvements to the Mount Hood golf course. In the 1999 calendar year, the City's portion of revenues from golf receipts  including memberships, greens fees, golf cart rentals, tournament cart rentals, and water fees  was $220,037. In addition to the revenues collected through the golf course operations, Mount Hood receives approximately $70,000 per year from lease agreements. Scope and Methodology The Office's review covered the period of April 2000, one month prior to the commencement of fill deliveries to Mount Hood, through August 2001, one month after fill deliveries to Mount Hood ended. This report also summarizes significant projectrelated contracts and events through December 2001. During the course of this review, the Office obtained documents and information from the Park Commission, the Board of Aldermen, the Conservation Commission, the Park Department, the Department of Public Works, the City Auditor, the City Clerk, the City  9  The financial information that follows is drawn from the City's 1999 Annual Report.  3   Solicitor, the CA/T Project, Gator, Modern Continental, CDM, and ELM.  10  The Office  conducted interviews with City officials and other project participants, including the former Mayor, the then-Chairman of the Park Commission, the former Superintendent of Parks, the Interim Superintendent of Parks, the Public Works Superintendent/Acting City Engineer, and representatives of the CA/T Project, Gator, Modern Continental, CDM, and ELM. The Office toured the project site in September 2001. The Office appreciates the cooperation and assistance provided by all of those listed above. A confidential draft of this report was provided to the Mayor of Melrose on September 27, 2002. The Mayor's response is included in Appendix A of this report. During the course of this review, the Office sent three letters to the City. These letters are included in Appendix B of this report. This review was conducted in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.  10  The Office's review was impeded by incomplete project documentation. During the course of this review, the City was unable to locate some Park Department records that were reportedly moved to City Hall in April 2001. In some cases, the Office obtained project records from other sources that should have been on file at the Park Department. ""Project records"" referenced in this report include records obtained from the City, Gator, and Modern Continental.  4   Findings Finding 1. The City embarked on a project involving major alterations to Mount Hood without adequate planning, reliable cost estimates, or an executed contract protecting the City's interests. 11  On April 12, 2000, a principal of Gator Development Company, Inc. 12  (hereinafter,  ""Gator,"") sent a memorandum addressed to the Mayor of Melrose, with a copy to the Deputy City Engineer, offering to deliver 200,000 cubic yards (approximately 300,000 tons) of material excavated from the Central Artery/Tunnel (CA/T) Project to the City of Melrose. 13  The memorandum described the material as ""Cohesive Glacial Till/Boston  Blue Clay"" and indicated that Gator was proposing to pay the City $0.60 per ton to accept the material at a rate of 3,500 to 4,000 cubic yards per day over a six- to eightmonth period. Attached to the memorandum were specifications for the material  (hereinafter, ""fill"") excerpted from the excavation contract between the CA/T Project and Modern Continental as well as the results of tests performed on the fill. In a memorandum dated April 19, 2001 addressed to the Mayor, the Parks Superintendent summarized the outcome of the Parks Superintendent's meetings with Gator and Modern Continental regarding the logistics of delivering the fill to Mount Hood. In the memorandum, the Parks Superintendent recommended to the Mayor that the City ""hold out for at least 70 cents per ton or more,"" noting that:  11  According to corporate Development Company, February 1995 as Gator, Treasurer, and Agent/Cle  records filed with the Secretary of the Commonwealth, Gator Inc. was a Melrose-based corporation originally organized in Inc. During the period covered by this review, its President, rk was Charles F. Madden, Jr.  12  Two individuals served in succession as Mayor of Melrose during the period covered by this review. In this report, ""Mayor"" refers to the individual holding the office of Mayor at the time of the reported events or activities. The current Mayor was elected in November 2001. According to Gator principals interviewed by the Office, Gator had been seeking a site for CA/T Project fill, and a Gator principal had contacted the Mayor of Melrose to solicit interest in the fill. Based on the Mayor's positive response, Gator forwarded the April 12 memorandum to the City.  13  5   We have to consider that no money was available for any reconstruction project from the Master Plan. Any project that we commit to must be fully funded by the income from the fill. . . . Ultimately we could live with 62 cents, but it would create a project that would be economically tighter than would be comfortable. Attached to the memorandum was a list of tasks included in the project scope of work; all of the listed tasks related to the reconstruction of the twelfth fairway of the Mount Hood golf course. The Parks Superintendent's memorandum estimated the City's  revenues from Gator at $210,000 (300,000 tons at $0.70 per ton) and itemized the tasks for which the City would be responsible under the proposed arrangement with Gator, including engineering, conservation permitting, wetland protection, and drainage irrigation. According to the minutes of a Conservation Commission meeting held on April 20, 2000, the Conservation Commission read a letter at that meeting from the Superintendent of Parks (hereinafter, ""the Parks Superintendent""), 15 14  alerting the  Commission to the Park Commission's plan to file a Notice of Intent (NOI) for a project at Mount Hood. The Parks Superintendent's letter stated that the project entailed  improvements to the twelfth fairway of the golf course, which was located near an identified wetlands resource area. It also stated that some work was being proposed within the 100-foot buffer zone surrounding the resource area but that no work was being proposed in the resource area itself. The Parks Superintendent's letter advised the Conservation Commission: ""It is probable that material will begin arriving on site for this and other projects as early as Monday, April 24, 2000."" The letter stated that the 14  The Parks Superintendent also served as the Tree Warden. In an interview with the Office, the former Parks Superintendent stated that he reported to the Park Commission and the Mayor in his capacity as Parks Superintendent and that he also reported to the Public Works Commissioner in his capacity as Tree Warden.  According to a publication of the Massachusetts Association of Conservation Commissions entitled The Massachusetts Wetlands Protection Act, the Massachusetts Wetlands Protection Act, M.G.L. c. 131, 40, prohibits the removal, dredging, filling, or altering of any wetland or land within 100 feet of a wetland without a permit from the Conservation Commission. To obtain a permit, called an Order of Conditions, a project proponent must submit a Notice of Intent application to the Conservation Commission and the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP), according to the DEP website.  15  6   project work would commence on the opposite end of the fairway in relation to the wetland and that no work would be performed within the buffer zone for many months.  Gator sent a proposed Memorandum of Understanding to the City on April 21, 2000. On April 21, 2000, Gator sent a proposed ""Memorandum of Understanding"" (MOU) to the Mayor, with copies to the Deputy City Engineer and the Parks Superintendent, listing 11 items purportedly reflecting discussions between the City and Gator over the previous week. The document set forth proposed terms under which Gator would pay the City $0.70 per ton for the first 300,000 tons of fill originating from two specific CA/T Project contracts between Modern Continental and the CA/T Project and $0.65 per ton for all additional fill generated under these contracts. The City would be responsible for all site preparation work, including tree clearing, installation of hay bales, and lighting. On that same day, the Parks Superintendent sent letters to Gator and to Modern Continental, advising them that the City of Melrose intended to proceed with an agreement to accept no less than 300,000 tons of fill from the two CA/T Project contracts, that the Park Commission would vote on the proposal on April 24, 2000, and that an affirmative vote was expected. The Parks Superintendent's letter stated that the City would be responsible for any required conservation permits and that ""[a]t the present time and well into the foreseeable future no conservation permits are required to commence operations."" Finding 1a. The Park Commission authorized fill deliveries at Mount Hood without determining the scope, requirements, or cost of the improvement project. The minutes of a Park Commission meeting held on April 24, 2000 show that the estimated quantity of fill to be delivered to Mount Hood had increased from 300,000 tons  the amount cited in Gator's April 12 memorandum to the Mayor  to 790,000 tons. As the following excerpt from the minutes makes clear, there was no project plan, design, or cost estimate.  7   A total of approximately 790,000 tons of blue clay and glacial till will be delivered along with the machine time for all the rough and fine grading th for whatever the Park Commission constructs. The 12 hole would be rebuilt which we had wanted to rebuild this year but at the time it was engineered we didn't have funds to do it. . . . The Mayor thinks building new fields would be the best way to go. [The Parks Superintendent] proposed a full-sized baseball field and two full-sized soccer fields along with parking. . . . The exact configuration isn't important at the moment as we have six months before anything is decided. The elevations and the amount of fill will be the same no matter what is constructed. . . . Tonight [the Parks Superintendent] wants to know if the Park Commission likes the theory and do they want to sign an agreement with Gator to take the fill. . . . They wanted to start to truck this week but th won't actually start until May 8 . Modern Continental was given a letter of 16 intent last Friday saying we did want to proceed. [Emphasis added.] The Park Commission minutes also show that the Park Department had not yet commissioned professional engineering design services: [The Parks Superintendent] will be getting someone in to do the engineering on the project but isn't sure if it will be Camp Dresser & McKee or someone else. According to the minutes, members of the Park Commission raised questions about the impact on wetlands, and the Parks Superintendent stated that he had assured the Conservation Commission that ""a small wetland area"" would be protected. The Park Commission voted to proceed with the fill delivery project subject to a final vote. The Park Commission again discussed plans to accept the fill at Mount Hood at a meeting held on May 1, 2000. The meeting minutes show that the Parks  Superintendent described the scope of the proposed project as ""massive"": [The Parks Superintendent] discussed the many meetings, problems, discussions and plans of the ""Big Dig"" project happening on a daily, hourly, etc. basis. . . . He discussed the engineering aspects of this entire project with the Mayor it being more than he and [his assistant] could handle in house. He will be bringing Camp Dresser and McKee in to see what input they could offer. If we contract with them it would be under the existing contract and it would be at the approval of the Commission. The 16  Records provided to the Office included a letter of intent dated April 21, 2000 from the Parks Superintendent to the Vice President of Modern Continental.  8   scope of this project is massive with roads, parking lots, electrical power, and irrigation. [Emphasis added.] According to the meeting minutes, Modern Continental had already begun work on constructing the access road  referred to as the ""haul road"" in project records  to the fill delivery site on Mount Hood. The minutes reported that the Parks Superintendent advised the Commission that it had to ""demonstrate to the Big Dig [the CA/T Project] that we have the ability to accept this material quickly and with easy access."" The unsigned MOU contained no reference to the haul road, nor were plans or specifications developed for the haul road. The minutes also show that the Parks Superintendent advised the Commission that project oversight would be a significant task that he would be unable to perform without contracted assistance: [The Parks Superintendent] discussed ""oversight"" of the project, as he doesn't have time to personally do it. The most sensible way to go is to have ELM do the oversight because they are here all the time and manage the site anyway. Every truck has to have paper work, which needs to be checked, and directions given to the drivers as to where the load is to go. . . [The Parks Superintendent] said this project really needs ""a project manager as he can't devote all day every day to it."" According to the minutes, the Parks Superintendent read a draft agreement between the City and Gator and requested that the Park Commission vote on the draft agreement. The Parks Superintendent told the Commission that the final agreement would include an indemnification clause to be provided by the City Solicitor and noted that he would request a $5 million performance bond. The Park Commission voted to approve the agreement with the addition of the indemnification clause and the City Solicitor's final review.  Fill deliveries to Mount Hood began on May 3, 2000. On May 3, 2000, two days after the Park Commission's vote, Modern Continental began delivering fill to Mount Hood, according to City records. The City had not executed the  9   April 21 MOU or any other written fill delivery contract with Gator. According to City records, 4,035 tons of fill were delivered to Mount Hood on May 3. The minutes of a Conservation Commission meeting on May 4, 2000 show that the Parks Superintendent read a letter at that meeting advising the Conservation Commission that the project plan had changed since the Parks Superintendent's April 24 letter to the Commission: the twelfth fairway improvements had been deferred until the fall to enable construction of a new ballfield complex. The letter advised the 17  Conservation Commission that the Park Department had retained the services of Camp, Dresser & McKee, Inc. (CDM) as project engineer, that the Park Department was requesting a Negative Determination of Applicability for an area next to the haul road Modern Continental was building, and that the fill delivery project was ""extremely time sensitive."" According to the meeting minutes, the letter stated, in part: The Notice of Intent for the 12 hole project will be filed at a later date as the project is now planned for this fall. The plan as it is now being formulated includes the construction of a ball field complex between the Slayton Tower and the easterly border of the park. We have retained the 19 services of Camp Dresser & McKee as engineers for this project. As we have proceeded with the preliminary work in anticipation of accepting clean fill from the Central Artery/Tunnel Project we have encountered a 17 th 18  All fill quantities reported in these pages were derived from an analysis of fill delivery records provided to the Office by the Park Department in February 2002. In late 2001 the Office advised the City of discrepancies between the City's records of fill deliveries to Mount Hood and records on file at the CA/T Project and recommended that the City take steps to resolve these discrepancies. The Park Department subsequently conducted a detailed examination of CA/T Project excavation logs pertaining to the fill delivery project and produced the February 2002 analysis, which does not comport with either the City's previous fill calculations or the CA/T Project's fill calculations.  According to The Massachusetts Wetlands Protection Act (the previously cited publication of the Massachusetts Association of Conservation Commissions), project proponents submit a form called a ""Request for Determination of Applicability"" to the Conservation Commission in order to determine if an area is a resource area protected by the Wetlands Protection Act. 19  18  As will be discussed, the work CDM performed in May and June was billed and paid under a contract between CDM and Gator, which then was permitted to deduct its payment to CDM from fill payments owed to the City. The City did not execute a contract with CDM until August 4, 2000.  10   depressed area in close proximity to the access road that will be used to transport fill to the site. Although we are very confident that this small area is non-jurisdictional, we are always concerned about how our actions may be viewed by others. Therefore, we feel that a Negative Determination of Applicability by the Conservation Commission would be the proper way to proceed. The Park Department will file a plan and study with our application for this determination at the next meeting of the Conservation Commission. For the time being the area will be protected with hay bales and silt fencing until such time as the Conservation Commission properly makes this determination. This project has become a high priority for the city and the Mayor and it is our intention to proceed very cautiously yet very quickly as the agreement with the Central Artery/Tunnel Project is extremely time sensitive. The minutes indicate that the Parks Superintendent emphasized the need to react quickly to the offer of Big Dig fill in order to allow the City to receive half a million dollars in revenues: The plan is very conceptual. I had the first meeting today with my engineer from Camp Dresser McKee. But what we have to act on very quickly is the fill portion of it as other communities were vying for this fill. . . We really don't like to operate so quickly at the Parks Department. We like to take time to plan things and get them all on paper and get them done that way, but when a project like this is given to us and the ability to take in  million dollars, we can't give it up. There was about a two week window and we had to react to this offer, and we did react. [Emphasis added.] In an interview with the Office, the former Mayor stated that he had been concerned that the City might lose the opportunity to obtain a great deal while state funds for accepting Big Dig fill were available. He stated that he knew that the timing was also important because of the difficulty of working during the winter months. In retrospect, however, he stated that it would have been more appropriate to proceed more slowly. On May 5, 2000, Gator sent a letter to the Parks Superintendent accompanied by a $437,500 purchase order for fill and a document labeled ""Addendum to Purchase Order"" setting forth amended terms of the fill delivery agreement that had been proposed by Gator in the unexecuted April 21 MOU. Gator's letter stated: Pursuant to our discussion concerning the above referenced operation, I hereby submit for your review and execution the attached documents. 11   Please note that every effort has been made to incorporate all changes requested by you and [the Mayor]. Please sign both originals and return one copy to our office. The May 5 Addendum contained the same fill prices as those stated in the previous MOU and stated that the City would be responsible for site preparation work. The Addendum also contained several new terms, including provisions stating that: N ""Melrose will only receive clean material pursuant to this contract."" N Gator would pay Melrose ""as and when paid by Modern."" N Requisitions would be submitted to Gator on the first and fifteenth of every month. N Melrose would receive ""an advancement"" of $10,000 ""upon execution of this contract."" This amount was to be deducted from the first submitted pay requisition. N No other material would be allowed at Mount Hood location during the term of the agreement without the express written consent of Gator and barring the City from competing with Gator to obtain fill from the CA/T Project. Like the previous MOU, the Addendum contained no reference to the haul road that Modern Continental was in the process of constructing on Mount Hood. Finding 1b. The fill delivery agreement with Gator was not subject to any competitive procurement law. The Park Commission accepted the financial terms of Gator's proposal  and permitted Modern Continental to begin building a road on and delivering fill to City property  without testing the competitive marketplace through an open, advertised bid process. Under most circumstances involving work on public property by private construction contractors, public jurisdictions are legally required to conduct a formal, advertised bidding process. In this case, however, the Park Commission's unsigned agreement with Gator to have Modern Continental deliver fill to Mount Hood and to construct a haul road for this purpose was not subject to competitive bid requirements. M.G.L. c. 30, 39M, the bid law governing contracts for public works construction services and materials, requires an advertised bid process but applies only to contracts costing 12   $10,000 or more. Based on the language of the statute, the Office of the Attorney General has concluded that M.G.L. c. 30, 39M is not applicable to a contract resulting in a net payment to an awarding authority. 20  Because the City's agreement with Gator  entailed no payment by the City, the requirements of M.G.L. c. 30, 39M did not apply. Nevertheless, the Park Commission could and should have attempted to foster competition in the private marketplace for the fill and public works construction services offered by Gator. Finding 1c. The Park Commission authorized fill deliveries at Mount Hood for three months without executing a written contract. City records provided to the Office show that the Addendum, like the MOU it had amended, was signed by a Gator representative but not by any City official. Thus, from May 3, 2000, when the fill deliveries began, until July 12, 2000, when the City executed a contract with Gator, the Park Commission allowed fill to be delivered to Mount Hood without an executed, enforceable contract. During this period, City records show that 199,499 tons of fill were delivered to Mount Hood. In an interview with the Office, the Chairman of the Park Commission recalled that the Commission had voted to approve a fill delivery agreement with Gator and expressed surprise that the Commission had not signed any such agreement prior to July 2000. 21  Similarly, the former Parks Superintendent told the Office that he believed at the time  See In Re: Town of Southbridge, Barefoot Road Sanitary Landfill, A.G. Opinion dated December 7, 1999. 21  20  The minutes of a Park Commission meeting held on June 19, 2000 indicate that the Park Commission was erroneously informed that the agreement with Gator had been signed. The minutes stated, in part: ""He [the City Solicitor] noted that a Memorandum of Agreement had been signed and is going forward with producing a contract that will protect the City. He noted that there were still several issues to be ""hammered"" out: i.e. provisions regarding bonding, insurance, protection against default of the contractor, hazardous materials, and monitoring of the site. He assured those in attendance that the final document will be proper and will protect the City.""  13   that the agreement with Gator had been signed. In an interview with the Office, Gator's principals stated that they regarded the Park Superintendent's signed April 21 letter of intent as a sufficient basis on which to proceed with the fill deliveries to Mount Hood.  On May 18, 2000, the Melrose Conservation Commission issued a Cease and Desist Order and suspended enforcement of the Order provided that specific protective measures were implemented. At a Conservation Commission meeting held on May 18, 2000, the Parks Superintendent provided a conceptual rendering of the project in support of the Park Department's request for the Negative Determination of Applicability for the resource areas near the haul road. The meeting minutes indicate that citizens attending the meeting expressed shock and outrage over the removal of trees and the dumping of fill at Mount Hood without a master plan, appropriation, or vote by Melrose citizens. Members of the Conservation Commission examined photographs of the site that reportedly showed encroachment of silt into a resource area. The Parks  Superintendent acknowledged that trucks had been ""coming in as fast as they could"" and that ""[w]e absolutely could have done a better job of protecting the beginning of that resource."" According to City records, 47,467 tons of fill had been delivered to Mount Hood as of May 18, 2000. After discussing the need to institute immediate measures to protect the resource areas, the Conservation Commission voted to issue a Cease and Desist Order barring further work at the site but suspending enforcement of the Order provided that specific measures were taken to protect the affected resource areas, including installation and maintenance of hay bales and jersey barriers, prior to performing further work on the site. The minutes of a Park Commission meeting held on May 22, 2000 indicate that citizens attending the meeting again raised concerns about the removal of trees and the lack of a project appropriation. Citizens also voiced concerns about the lack of competition for the fill and the perceived conflict between the 1995 master plan  which had envisioned enhanced ""passive recreation"" facilities at Mount Hood  and the Park Commission's goal to create three playing fields. 14   According to the minutes, the Chairman of the Park Commission stated that the Mayor, through the Parks Superintendent, had presented an opportunity to get clean fill for the construction of playing fields. The Chairman noted that ""there had been a `small  window of opportunity' on the part of the contractor and that we had to act quickly so as not to lose the fill."" In response to citizens' concerns regarding the potential cost of the project, the Chairman stated that ""the  million dollars we anticipate receiving would be used towards the building of the fields and not from the taxpayers of the City of Melrose,"" according to the meeting minutes. The former Chairman told the Office that the Park Commission was never provided with an estimate of the site preparation costs the City would incur in order to accept the fill. He stated that his understanding was that the City would pay for tree clearing and hay bales and that Gator would pay the cost of constructing the haul road. He assumed that fill revenues received by the City would be sufficient to pay for three playing fields. In an interview with the Office, CDM representatives stated that two individuals from CDM examined the fill delivery site and the Isolated Land Subject to Flooding (ILSF) 22  near the haul road on May 23, 2000. By that time, trees had been removed, the haul road had been constructed, fill deliveries had begun, and the Cease and Desist Order had been issued. CDM subsequently prepared and filed the NOI for the haul road. However, although the Conservation Commission had been told that CDM would be the ""project engineer,"" CDM did not prepare  and was not asked to prepare  estimates of required fill quantities, plans and specifications for the haul road, plans and specifications for the fill deliveries, or project cost estimates. The former Parks Superintendent confirmed that CDM had not been asked to provide detailed planning information or specifications. He told the Office that he himself did quantity ""takeoffs,"" or estimates, from conceptual plans that had been prepared by CDM for the 1995 Master Plan in order to develop the rough estimate, provided to the Park  22  According to the DEP website, Isolated Land Subject to Flooding (ILSF) includes areas that flood due to ponding of run-off or high ground water. These resource areas are regulated under the Wetlands Protection Act.  15   Commission, that the City needed 790,000 tons of fill to complete the playing fields and golf course improvements that were contemplated. He also said that the construction of the playing fields and golf course improvements work was envisioned as an in-house project that could be completed by the Park Department without detailed engineering designs.  On June 2, 2000, CDM filed a Notice of Intent (NOI) for the Mount Hood haul road with the Conservation Commission and the DEP on behalf of the City's Department of Public Works. The minutes of a meeting of the Conservation Commission on June 1, 2000, at which the previously filed Request for Determination of Negative Applicability for the resource areas near the haul road was discussed, show that a CDM representative accompanied the Deputy City Engineer to the meeting. According to the meeting minutes, some City officials and citizens once again raised concerns about the removal of trees, the lack of planning, and the lack of references to playing fields in the 1995 master plan for Mount Hood. The CDM representative advised the Conservation Commission that the The Conservation  resource areas in question were, in CDM's opinion, ILSF.  Commission subsequently voted to find a Positive Determination of Applicability for the resource areas. This finding required the City to file a NOI with the Conservation  Commission and the DEP. On June 2, 2000, CDM filed the Mount Hood Haul Road NOI. In a cover letter to the NOI, CDM stated: On behalf of the City of Melrose Department of Public Works, Camp Dresser & McKee Inc. (CDM) is pleased to submit this Notice of Intent for the above referenced project. This NOI is submitted to authorize temporary deposition of fill into an isolated depression on Mount Hood property assumed to be regulated as Isolated Land Subject to Flooding (ILSF). This incidental filling occurred during construction of a gravel haul road adjacent to the isolated depression. The NOI Project Narrative clarified that two depressions within the vicinity of the filling activity appeared to meet the definition of ILSF and that ""placement of fill adjacent to the southerly depression for construction of a haul road resulted in the accidental  16   deposition of fill in approximately 300 square feet of the depression.""  The NOI  described the proposed project activity and listed several mitigation measures that had been instituted and would be instituted in the future ""to prevent the sloughing off of soil off the haul road and into the southerly depression."" At a June 19, 2001 meeting of the Park Commission, some citizens continued to raise questions about the project scope, the availability of other sources of fill, the manner in which CDM had been hired, the cost of the project, and the lack of planning preceding the clearing of trees on Mount Hood, according to the meeting minutes. The minutes show that other citizens expressed support for the City's willingness to capitalize on an offer that could enable the construction of new playing fields. According to the minutes, City officials told those in attendance that the City had not yet decided what was to be built, that CDM would be brought on board ""under an open contract,"" that the City would be paid as fill was delivered, and that ""with the funds generated which could amount to half a million dollars we should be able to finish the work."" Finding 2. The Park Department bypassed legal requirements and internal controls governing City contracts in order to expedite the acceptance of fill.  Finding 2a. Prior to August 2000, the Park Department obtained CDM's services through an inappropriate contract between CDM and Gator. The Park Department did not execute a contract with CDM until August 4, 2000, two months after CDM filed the NOI for the Mount Hood haul road. Records reviewed by the Office showed that CDM and Gator signed a $20,100 contract dated May 1, 2000 that required CDM to meet with Gator to ""obtain input for recommended revisions to the Master Plan for conceptual design of Athletic Fields and Recreation Improvements"" at Mount Hood, to prepare the NOI and obtain environmental permits for the haul road, and to:  17   Create an illustrative conceptual site plan that provides the OWNER with target final grade and related finish subgrade elevations for presently ongoing earth moving and filling operations. Under the terms of the contract, the ""owner"" was Gator. Although Gator's contract with CDM was dated May 1, 2000, CDM representatives advised the Office that CDM had worked without a contract for a period of time after May 1, 2000 and that the contract between CDM and Gator was backdated. Gator officials provided the Office with several documents pertaining to the contract between CDM and Gator: a July 31, 2000 letter from the Vice President of CDM to the Parks Superintendent and an August 3, 2000 letter from a Gator Principal to the Parks Superintendent. CDM's letter began: In order to expedite this project, we negotiated and submitted an Agreement to Gator Development Company, Inc. (GDC) to lay out a conceptual arrangement of one baseball field and a multi-use soccer field to provide enough information for you to establish subgrade elevations for receipt of Central Artery fill. Also, assistance was requested to secure the necessary environmental permits for the haul road. Attached to CDM's letter was a copy of CDM's invoice to Gator for $20,100 as well as a breakdown of project hours and costs incurred. CDM's letter was copied to the Deputy City Engineer and a Gator Principal. City records show that Gator paid CDM $20,100 on August 2, 2000 and deducted this amount from the fill payments owed to the City. Two days later, on August 3, 2000, a Gator Principal wrote a letter to the Parks Superintendent, with copies to the Deputy City Engineer, the City Solicitor, and the President of ELM, stating: Attached please find an executed copy of the contract between Camp Dresser & McKee and Gator Development Company, Inc. dated May 1, 2000 (Contract). All costs associated with said Contract will be fully reimbursed by the City of Melrose, pursuant to our contract entitled ""Contract for the Acceptance of Fill to create Recreational Facility at Mount Hood Memorial Park and Golf Course By and Between the City of Melrose and Gator Hood LLC."" Please sign below as acknowledgment of the above and return a copy to our Office.  18   The letter was signed by the Parks Superintendent and a Gator Principal. Gator's Principal told the Office that he wrote this letter in order to document that Gator had nothing to do with the contract with CDM and that Gator would be fully reimbursed by the City for the contract cost. Under Chapter 124 of the Acts of 1936, the enabling legislation for Mount Hood, Mount Hood expenditures require appropriation by the Board of Aldermen. Also, under M.G.L. c. 43, 29, all contracts over $5,000 must be in writing and approved by the department head and the Mayor. In this case, however, City funds were used to pay CDM without an appropriation from the Board of Aldermen and without an executed contract signed by the Mayor. 23  Although CDM attended Conservation Commission meetings and  prepared the NOI on behalf of the City, CDM was being paid by Gator using funds owed to the City. In addition to bypassing the legal requirements and internal controls  governing City contracts, this inappropriate arrangement created a potential conflict of interest for CDM. Finding 2b. Beginning in May 2000, the Park Department procured supplies and services for the project without the required appropriations by the Board of Aldermen. During the period between May 3, 2000, when fill deliveries began, and July 12, 2000, when the City executed a contract with Gator, private contractors invoiced the Park Department for site preparation supplies and services totaling more than $33,000 relating to the project, including tree removal, land clearing, roadway paving, baled straw, and fencing. Table 1 lists these costs. There is no evidence that the Board of Aldermen appropriated funds for these procurements, as required by Chapter 124 of the Acts of 1936.  23  Design services that do not entail work on a public building project are not subject to any procurement law, although the Office recommends such contracts be awarded using the competitive procurement procedures of M.G.L. c. 30B.  19   Table 1. Park Department Procurements Lacking Appropriations Prior to the July 2000 Contract with Gator Invoice Date 5/4/00 5/13/00 5/15/00 5/15/00 undated 6/30/00 6/30/00 Total Source: Invoices provided by the City of Melrose. (1) This invoice was date-stamped May 25, 2000.  Vendor Arbor Tree Service Foley's Custom Sawmill D&R General Contracting, Inc. Greenwood and Sons Dan Cappellucci, Jr. J.M. Cook Co., Inc.

Supplies/Services Wood removal Unspecified Roadway paving Construction services Chain link fence Land clearing Unspecified  (1)  Amount Invoiced $ 2,800 2,588 8,857 2,918 1,300 12,000 2,556 $33,019  The Park Department's $12,000 procurement of land clearing services from J.M. Cook Co., Inc. appears to have violated other statutory requirements as well. City records contain no evidence that bids were solicited for this work under M.G.L. c. 30, 39M or M.G.L. c. 30B and no evidence that the Park Department executed a written contract with this contractor in accordance with M.G.L. c. 43, 29. 25 24  City records show that the roadway paving services  for which the City was billed $8,857  were procured through a competitively bid contract awarded by the Department of Public Works. 26  A number of other procurements were below the $5,000 27  threshold for written contracts and the $10,000 threshold for construction bidding.  24  Public works construction contracts costing more than $10,000 but not more than $25,000 must be competitively bid under either M.G.L. c. 30, 39M or M.G.L. c. 30B, 5. Public works construction contracts costing more than $25,000 must be competitively bid under M.G.L. c. 30, 39M. Public works construction contracts are subject to numerous other statutory requirements, some of which are discussed later in this report. This contract contained estimated quantities and specified that any City department could procure the contracted services at the bid price listed in the contract. As previously noted, local awarding authorities are not required to solicit competitive bids or quotations for public construction services costing less than $10,000, although obtaining competitive quotations is a sound business practice recommended by the Office.  25  26  27  20   Finding 3.  Project accountability was undermined by the City's failure to establish a revolving account for the fill payments owed to the City by Gator.  Although the City's stated intention was to use the fill payments from Gator to build playing fields and improve the golf course at Mount Hood, the City did not establish a revolving account into which to deposit Gator's payments and from which to appropriate project expenditures until June 2001  more than a year after the fill deliveries began. In an interview with the Office, the former Parks Superintendent stated that he did not want Gator to pay the City until the revolving fund was established because any payments from Gator would have been deposited in the General Fund and, thus, would have been unavailable to the Park Department to pay for site preparation and other project-related expenses. Gator officials interviewed by the Office confirmed that Gator received no payment requisitions from the City for many months. According to City records, the City did not send a pay requisition to Gator until May 2001. City records contained a copy of a signed letter from the Parks Superintendent to the Mayor dated July 6, 2000 in which the Parks Superintendent stated: The Park Department respectfully requests that a revolving fund be created and authorized under MGL Chapter 44, Section 53N to receive and expend funds generated from the contract between the City of Melrose Park Department and Gator Hood, Inc. for the purpose of construction at Mount Hood. The Park Department requests a spending limit of FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS ($450,000) with the Park Commission as the sole agent to expend funds from the account. On January 31, 2001, six months after the Parks Superintendent's written request, the Mayor submitted a request to the Board of Aldermen to establish a revolving account for the purpose of constructing playing fields at Mount Hood. On June 27, 2001, five  months after the Mayor's request, the Board of Aldermen approved the order. Thus, the fill delivery project proceeded for more than a year after fill deliveries began without the appropriate mechanism for accepting fill revenues owed by Gator. In an interview with the Office, the former Mayor stated that his initial assumption, which proved to be mistaken, was that Gator would fund the project start-up costs and that fill  21   revenues would not be paid until the start-up phase was complete. He stated that, in retrospect, he should have submitted the order for the revolving fund early in the project so that the public could see that the project was generating revenue every month. In the absence of a mechanism for accepting and expending funds paid by Gator, the Park Department procured project-related supplies and services and forwarded the invoices for these supplies and services to Gator. Beginning in July 2000, Gator paid the invoices and deducted the dollar amounts of these paid invoices from its calculation of fill payments owed to the City. This arrangement, which was not terminated until March 2001, circumvented the appropriation process required by the enabling legislation for Mount Hood. In addition, as will be discussed, some procurements made under this arrangement violated procurement and municipal finance laws. The City received no payments from Gator until April 6, 2001, shortly after an independent audit commissioned by the Board of Aldermen found that the City had received no fill revenues from its contract with Gator. According to the City Auditor, the funds received from Gator after that date were deposited into a newly created reserve account pending the Board of Aldermen's approval two months later of the order establishing a revolving fund for the fill revenues.  Three months after fill deliveries began, the City executed a contract giving Gator Hood, LLC the exclusive right to deliver up to one million tons of fill to Mount Hood. On July 12, 2000, the City executed a ""Contract for the Acceptance of Fill to Create Recreational Facility at Mount Hood Memorial Park and Golf Course By and Between the City of Melrose and Gator Hood, LLC."" Corporate records on file with the Secretary of the Commonwealth show that Gator Development, Inc. and Gator Hood, LLC shared the same address and corporate officers. (The remainder of this report will refer to both Gator Development Company, Inc. and Gator Hood, LLC as ""Gator."") The City's 28  contract with Gator was signed by the Mayor, all five members of the Park Commission,  28  According to corporate records on file with the Secretary of the Commonwealth, Gator Hood, LLC was a limited liability corporation organized on July 24, 2000. Its agent was listed as Charles F. Madden, Jr.  22   the City Solicitor, the Managing Member of Gator Hood, LLC, and a Vice President of Modern Continental Construction Company, Inc. The contract named Gator as the contractor and Modern Continental as the ""guarantor."" 29  A ""Purchase Agreement""  between Gator and Modern Continental was incorporated by reference into the contract.  The City's July 2000 contract with Gator obligated the City to accept not less than 300,000 tons of fill material from the contractor and provided that the City could, at its option, agree to accept up to one million tons of material. The contract gave Gator the exclusive right to deliver fill to Mount Hood. Under the contract, Gator would pay the City $0.70 per ton for each ton delivered to the site, measured as follows: Measurements. All quantities are estimates only. Measurement is based on an agreed thirty three (33) tons per dump trailer load and twenty six (26) tons per triaxle load. Upon execution of the contract, Gator would pay the City $10,000, and that amount would be credited against the amount owed to the City from fill deliveries. On the first and fifteenth days of each month, the City would make application for payment, and Gator would pay the City within 10 days of receiving each application for payment. Gator's fill delivery payments were to be calculated from shipping tickets generated and signed by Modern Continental at the CA/T Project and submitted by the City with the applications for payment to Gator. 30  29  City records did not include a copy of the Purchase Agreement between Gator and Modern Continental; however, at the Office's request, the City obtained and provided the Office with a copy of the agreement. The contract stated: ""The material shall consist exclusively of natural soil material excavated pursuant to contract C17A1 between the contractor and Guarantor [Modern Continental]. All of the material received shall be tested and certified in accordance with the Contract Documents. The Contractor certifies that no material from any other location shall be delivered to the site and delivery of material from any other source or location shall constitute a material breach of this Agreement and grounds for immediate termination of this Agreement by the City.""  30  23   The contract provided that Gator would be responsible for all temporary haul road construction on the site and all machine grading of the fill. The City would be  responsible for preparing the site to receive the fill, placing and maintaining any hay bales or silt fences, lighting, dust control and wheel washing, and providing survey and engineering services. The contract stated that the City would hire a clerk of the  works/environmental monitor to supervise operations on a daily basis in order to ensure compliance with the contract terms and conditions. The contract required Gator to provide the City with a performance bond and a payment bond (discussed later in this report). The Purchase Agreement between Gator and Modern Continental stated that it was ""made and effective"" on May 1, 2000 but was not signed by Modern Continental until July 13, 2001. However, Gator provided the Office with a four-page purchase order issued by Modern Continental to Gator on May 1, 2000 and signed by both parties. Schedule A of the Purchase Agreement provided the following cost breakdown for the work: N Mobilization $25,000 N Everett Land Development Coordination  Everett, MA $7,249.48 31  N Management Fee  Disposal of material at Mt. Hood Golf Course, Melrose, MA (300,000 tons @ $1.35 per ton) $405,000 Gator did not make the contractually required $10,000 payment to the City upon execution of the July contract. In an interview with the Office, the former Parks  Superintendent stated that this payment was not made because the City had not set up the revolving account into which to deposit the $10,000 payment.  31  Officials of Gator and Modern Continental advised the Office that the line-item in the Purchase Agreement labeled ""Everett Land Development Coordination"" was unrelated to the fill delivery contract. They stated that Modern Continental owed Gator $7,249.48 in connection with another business transaction between the two firms and that the Purchase Agreement was used as a vehicle for that payment.  24   According to City records, 199,449 tons of fill had been delivered to Mount Hood as of July 12, 2000. Finding 4. The City's noncompetitive contract with Gator, although legally permissible, was ill advised.  As discussed in the previous Finding 1b, the City's contract with Gator was not subject to any competitive procurement law. Nevertheless, the City's decision to execute a formal contract entailing major alterations to Mount Hood without a competitive selection process was unwise. From a business perspective, competition is a key element of best value contracting. Research has consistently demonstrated that the discipline of the competitive marketplace promotes efficiency and cost-effectiveness in public contracts with the private sector. Thus, a public jurisdiction should undertake a public selection process for any contract of substantial value to private vendors, even if the contract is not subject to any public procurement law requiring advertised competition. Even where there appears to be only one vendor capable of fulfilling the contract, conducting a public selection process allows the jurisdiction to test that assumption by notifying the private marketplace of the availability of the contract. Thus, competitive contracting is a sound business practice. The City's decision to forgo competition was also unsound from a public policy perspective. The public expects its elected and appointed representatives to conduct the public's business in an open, fair, accountable manner. When public contracts of substantial value are awarded without competition, the appearance of favoritism is created, and public trust is undermined. Finding 5. The City's contract with Gator contained poorly drafted and unfavorable provisions that undermined the City's financial interests.  Reimbursements for site preparation work. The City's contract with Gator contained confusing and seemingly inconsistent language governing the issue of which party would pay for the site preparation work at Mount Hood. As the following provision indicates, the contract stated that the contractor would pay or reimburse the City for its  25   site preparation expenses; however, it also stated that the contractor would deduct those payments or reimbursements from its fill delivery payments to the City: Site Preparation Expenses. The contractor shall pay and/or reimburse the City for any and all expenses incurred by the City for preparation of the site to receive the material, including but not limited to any costs incurred in connection with excavation, cutting or clearing of trees and/or removal of debris. The City shall provide the Contractor with documentation relative to any such expense and the Contractor shall be obligated to reimburse the City in accordance with subparagraph IV(B) [the contract provision governing Gator's payments to the City for fill deliveries] above. Any and all payments and/or reimbursements hereunder shall be deducted from payments made to the City pursuant to Section IV(A) [the contract provision requiring Gator to pay the City $0.70 per ton] herein. [Emphasis added.] Conditional payments. Under the following contract provision, Gator was required to pay the City only if and when Modern Continental paid Gator: Receipt by the Contractor of payment from the Guarantor for any and all portions of the work, whether partial payments, progress payments, final payment or reimbursable amounts shall be a condition precedent to any payment to the City hereunder[. T]he Contractor shall only be obligated to make payment for any approved requisition to the extent of payment received by the Contractor from the Guarantor in respect thereof. Thus, the City's payments from Gator were dependent upon Gator's success in obtaining payment from Modern Continental, even if the City fulfilled its contractual obligations to Gator. Conditional indemnification for costs associated with contaminated or hazardous material. The City's contract with Gator provided that Gator would be responsible for and indemnify the City for costs associated with contaminated or hazardous material only if and to the extent that Modern Continental indemnified Gator. As with the  previously cited provision, this conditional provision meant that the City's ability to protect its environmental and financial interests was dependent on a business arrangement over which the City had no control. The City should have insisted on strong and unconditional indemnification language.  26   Finding 6.  The City's contract with Gator did not include detailed plans identifying fill delivery locations and boundaries, nor did it include fill placement instructions or specifications.  The contract provided no written description of the fill delivery locations other than the following: The parties hereby agree that the City shall receive the material as defined herein at the Mt. Hood Memorial Park and Golf Course, 100 Slayton Road, Melrose, Massachusetts; the location at which said material shall be received is further described in a plan attached as ""Exhibit A"" hereto and incorporated herein. Upon fifteen (15) day written notice to Contractor, the City may, upon Contractor's written approval, change the location at which the material shall be received. Exhibit A to the contract, reproduced on the following page, consisted of a map labeled ""Figure 3. Haul Road Location."" The words ""area to be filled"" were printed in two places on the map, along with arrows pointing to general areas. The map showed the haul road and the area encompassing the proposed baseball field and soccer field locations. Other than Exhibit A, the City's contract with Gator contained no fill  placement instructions or specifications. Moreover, Exhibit A did not show the twelfth hole, where the City planned to receive fill and where Gator would later deliver large quantities of fill. Project records provided to the Office contained no written notices from the City changing the fill locations or written approvals from Gator of any fill location changes. Exhibit A reportedly did not guide Modern Continental's fill delivery operations. In an interview with the Office, Modern Continental's Foreman, who oversaw the fill deliveries to Melrose on behalf of Modern Continental, stated that she had never seen a copy of Exhibit A.  27   Figure 1. Exhibit A to Contract with Gator  28   Thus, two months after fill deliveries to Mount Hood commenced, the City still had not prepared a detailed site plan identifying fill delivery locations, 32  nor had the City  prepared fill delivery specifications to guide Modern Continental. City records show that the City did not prepare any project-related specifications until May 2001, when CDM prepared plans and specifications for a baseball field at Mount Hood (discussed later in this report). Finding 7. The City's contract with Gator did not specify fill delivery schedules or limit fill delivery hours.  The City's contract with Gator set no limits on the hours during which fill would be delivered to Mount Hood nor on the days on which fill would be delivered. To the contrary, the contract required the City to ensure ""uninterrupted,"" round-the-clock access to the delivery site. With respect to the fill delivery schedule, Section V(A) of the contract stated: City shall use its best efforts to ensure uninterrupted, twenty-four (24) hour, seven (7) day per week, access through the property occupied by Waste Management, Inc. [which leased property adjacent to the delivery site from the City]. The City's decision to allow fill deliveries 24 hours per day, seven days per week would prove to have major negative repercussions. The only way for the City to ensure that all fill deliveries were supervised would have been to post a clerk of the works at the fill delivery site 24 hours per day, seven days per week  an approach that could have absorbed a major share of the fill revenues that the City had intended to use for the playing fields and other improvements. Had the contract specified a fill delivery  schedule that met the City's needs, rather than authorizing an unrestricted fill delivery schedule that reflected the contractor's preference for unrestricted access to Mount Hood, effective supervision of the project by the City would have been more feasible  32  Project records provided to the Office by Gator and Modern Continental show that Gator developed its own procedures for identifying and referring to specific fill delivery locations on Mount Hood as Area ""A,"" ""B,"" ""C,"" and ""D.""  29   and affordable.  As will be discussed in Finding 10, the Park Department's on-site  supervision of fill deliveries was inadequate. Finding 8. The City's contract with Gator lacked the prevailing wage rate schedule required by M.G.L. c. 149, 26 and 27, the prevailing wage law.  M.G.L. c. 149, 26 and 27, the prevailing wage law, requires contractors performing work for public construction projects, including transportation of gravel or fill to the site of public works, to pay prevailing wages. The City's July 2000 contract with Gator contained the following provision: Wage Rate. All services provided by the Contractor and the City pursuant to this contract must be in compliance with Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 149, Section 26 through 27F pertaining to prevailing wage rates as determined by the Massachusetts Department of Labor and 33 Industries. However, the contract did not contain the statutorily required prevailing wage schedule for the services to be provided by Gator. Under the prevailing wage law, contractors to public awarding authorities are required to provide the awarding authorities with certified payroll reports on a weekly basis. These records must be maintained by the awarding authority for three years following completion of the contract. The Office requested copies of weekly payroll submitted by Gator and from all other Mount Hood contractors providing services subject to the prevailing wage law; however, the City advised the Office that the City had no such records. Gator officials interviewed by the Office acknowledged that no weekly payroll reports had been provided to the City under the July 2000 contract but pointed out that all workers delivering fill to Melrose were Modern Continental's responsibility. They noted that Modern Continental was required by its contract with the CA/T Project to pay prevailing wages to its workers. 33  This reference to the Department of Labor and Industries (DLI) was obsolete: the DLI was abolished by Chapter 151 of the Acts of 1996. Prevailing wage rates are set by the state Department of Labor and Workforce Development's Division of Occupational Safety.  30   Finding 9.  The City did not obtain the contractually required performance and payment bonds securing Gator's satisfactory performance and securing full payment of its obligations to the City.  The City's contract with Gator contained the following bonding provisions: Bonding. The Contractor shall provide the city with a performance Bond in a form acceptable to the City securing its satisfactory performance, 34 including payment of Liquidated damages, of its obligations under the contract. Such bond shall be submitted to the city no later than seventytwo (72) hours after the execution of the contract. The performance bond shall be issued by a surety licensed to issue insurance in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. The penal amount of the bond shall be equal to one hundred and twenty percent (120%) of the total cost of the 35 contract. Failure to provide said performance bond shall be caused [sic] to immediately terminate the contract. The contractor shall also provide the city with a payment Bond in a satisfactory to the city to secure full payment hereunder. Such bond likewise be issued from an insurance company licensed in Commonwealth of Massachusetts. Failure to provide said Bond be immediate cause for termination of the contract. form shall the shall  This provision shall be satisfied in the event that an appropriate Bonds [sic] are provided by the Guarantor with a written acknowledgment that said bond would be enforceable by the city. [Emphasis added.] Gator submitted a copy of a $200 million performance bond guaranteeing Modern Continental's performance under a contract with the CA/T Project; however, neither the City nor Gator was a party to this bond. 36  Gator also submitted a copy of a payment  bond guaranteeing that Modern Continental would pay its own subcontractors and suppliers under Modern Continental's contract with the CA/T Project; however, neither the City nor Gator was a party to this bond. 34 35 37  On their face, therefore, these bonds  The City's contract with Gator contained no liquidated damages provision.  Since the City's contract entailed no payment by the City to Gator, the intended amount of the performance bond is unclear. A performance bond is a bond obtained by the contractor, from a surety, that is payable to the awarding authority in the event that the contractor fails to perform under the contract. A payment bond is a bond obtained by the contractor, from a surety, that guarantees payment to materials suppliers and/or subcontractors in the event that the general contractor fails to pay the materials suppliers and/or subcontractors. 31  36  37   provided no protection to the City from Gator's failure to perform under the July 2000 fill contract or from Gator's failure to pay the City for the fill.  On July 25, 2000, the Conservation Commission issued an Order of Conditions for the Mount Hood haul road. The Order of Conditions 38  listed the conditions established by the Conservation  Commission for the haul road construction work, including submission of biweekly reports by the ""Environmental Monitor"" to the Conservation Commission, erosion control measures, proper disposal of petroleum products, and restoration of the ILSF and revegetation of the soil slopes. Under the heading of ""Notification,"" the Order of  Conditions contained the following directive: While all activities regulated by this Order are being performed and during the construction phase of this project, an on-site foreman, directing engineer, or designated construction manager, shall have a copy of this Order at the site, familiarize himself with the conditions of this permit, and adhere to such conditions. This Order of Conditions shall be made part of all construction-related documents for this project. The project was also subject to an Order of Conditions issued by the DEP on July 25, 2000. The DEP Order of Conditions, which was signed by the Conservation  Commission, listed general conditions to be met by approved projects, including the requirement that any fill used in connection with the project be clean fill, containing ""no trash, refuse, rubbish, or debris."" The DEP Order of Conditions also stated that the work had to ""conform to the plans and special conditions referenced in this order"" and that the Conservation Commission had to be notified in writing of any changes to the plans in order for the Conservation Commission to determine whether the change was significant enough to require the filing of a new NOI.  38  As previously noted, an Order of Conditions is a permit issued by a local Conservation Commission under the Massachusetts Wetlands Protection Act.  32   Finding 10. Shortly after being ordered to comply with environmental restrictions on the haul road construction work, the Park Department obtained contaminated loam for the golf course from another source. The Office's review found that loam from a Malden site was transported to Mount Hood in late July of 2000. According to Modern Continental's Foreman, she observed the loam being spread over fill material on the thirteenth fairway by an ELM employee and stockpiled at the City's compost area. She told the Office that she saw bricks, a  shopping cart, tires, and gas cans mixed in with the loam, which she said smelled like gasoline. She stated that no one from the City was present at the site on that day; accordingly, she contacted Gator to express concerns about the loam. Project records obtained by the Office include a field report dated August 17, 2000 prepared by Modern Continental's Foreman documenting her observations at Mount Hood between July 27, 2000 and August 7, 2000. Her report stated, in part: On July 27, 2000 I observed foreign material that had been dumped and spread out over CA/T material in Area A [the thirteenth hole of the golf course]. The material contained a lot of trash, wood, stumps, brick etc. The operator in area A running D-3 dozer for Environmental Landscaping [ELM] stated to me that it was free loam coming from a development in Malden to Mt. Hood per [the Parks Superintendent]. . . . Two triaxles hauling material continued to dump into a stockpile in compost area. At this point I took pictures and contacted. . . ""Gator."" Gator contacted City of Melrose  see enclosed letter with test results of material. I received documents on 8-15-00. Gator raised strong objections to the material in a letter to the Parks Superintendent dated July 27, 2000. The Parks Superintendent then hired an environmental consultant, Simmons Environmental Services, Inc., to test the loam. Project records include a letter dated August 4, 2000 from Simmons Environmental Services, Inc. to the Parks Superintendent summarizing the results of the tests conducted on three composite soil samples from the loam stockpile. The letter stated, in part:  33   [T]he soil analyses detected elevated concentrations of TPHs [total petroleum hydrocarbons] and lead that were above the applicable Reportable Concentration RC-S1 as defined in the Massachusetts Contingency Plan (MCP) codified as 310 CMR 40.0000. In addition, low concentrations of pesticides and other metals were detected, but were below the MCP RC-S1 standards. Based upon the results of the soil analyses, SIMMONS does not recommend acceptance of this soil by the City of Melrose. [Emphasis added.] The Modern Continental Foreman's August 17, 2000 field report documented her observation that the stockpiled loam was transported off site by Greenwood and Sons during the period of August 4-7, 2000: On August 4, 2000  Observed material being transported from stockpile off site. One triaxle and 966 loader Greenwood & Sons contractor for city. On August 7, 2000  Material continued to be loaded out. End of day material in stockpile was gone. The Foreman's report made no reference to the loam that had been spread in the thirteenth hole area. City records include two invoices totaling $12,645 from Greenwood and Sons for work performed between July 18, 2000 and August 14, 2000 and an invoice from ELM for $24,835 for construction work on the thirteenth hole. Because the invoices did not provide detailed information on the services provided and City records contained no executed contracts corresponding to these invoices, the precise cost to the project of transporting the loam from the Malden development, spreading the loam on the golf course, and subsequently removing the stockpiled loam cannot be determined from the available records. City records also contained a $1,943 invoice to the Park Department from Simmons Environmental Services for the loam tests. The Park Department forwarded all four invoices to Gator, which paid them using fill revenues owed to the City. As in the case of the services provided by CDM over the  34   previous months, City funds were used to pay these contractors without an appropriation from the Board of Aldermen and without written contracts. 39  Finding 11. Supervision of the fill deliveries at Mount Hood was inadequate. The July 2000 contract with Gator authorized fill deliveries to Mount Hood 24 hours per day, seven days per week. Project records show that fill deliveries took place at varying times during the day and overnight, on weekdays and on weekends. Modern  Continental's Foreman told the Office that fill deliveries took place over both a day shift and a night shift for the first six months of deliveries. For the next five months,  deliveries took place on the night shift with occasional day shifts. In the final four weeks of deliveries, in June and July 2001, fill deliveries took place during the day shift. Massive quantities of fill were delivered to Mount Hood on this variable schedule: City records show that more than 100 truckloads of fill were delivered every day during highactivity months. 40  Modern Continental's variable and often intensive fill delivery  schedule meant that full-time supervision of the contract by the City was logistically difficult and financially burdensome. Under the July 2000 contract with Gator, the City was required to hire a clerk of the works/environmental monitor who would supervise fill operations on a daily basis, report on a daily basis to the City Engineer, and submit biweekly status reports to the Melrose Conservation Commission. The contract stated: Supervision. The City shall hire a Clerk of the Works/Environmental Monitor who shall supervise all operations on a daily basis in order to ensure compliance with all of the terms and conditions set forth in this contract. Said Clerk of the Works shall act as an Agent of the City of Melrose; he or she shall have the authority upon written notice to Contractor identifying cause and source to halt delivery of material for a period of up to seventy-two (72) hours in the event that there is any 39  Finding 12 addresses the Park Department's procurements of supplies and services in apparent violation of multiple statutory requirements. For example, City records show that 183 truckloads of fill were delivered to Mount Hood on June 21, 2000, before the City had even signed the July 2000 contract with Gator.  40  35   contamination or a credible threat of contamination on the site or any other substantial or material breach of the terms of this Agreement by the Contractor. Said Clerk shall report not less than daily his observations to the City Engineer or his designee and shall submit written bi-weekly status reports to the Melrose Conservation Committee [sic] with a copy to the Contractor. The appointment of said clerk shall be in accordance with all ordinances of the City of Melrose. Although the Park Department initially hired ELM to provide clerk of the works services, the Park Department terminated this arrangement after six months. For the next seven months, no clerk of the works was assigned to supervise the fill deliveries. In an interview with the Office, the former Mayor stated that he had assumed that the fill deliveries were being supervised. He stated that, in retrospect, the Park Superintendent could not have been expected to monitor the fill deliveries on Modern Continental's schedule. He noted that the lack of a clerk of the works for the project was later corrected. Finding 11a. The Park Department did not collect and maintain shipping tickets corresponding to fill deliveries, as required by the July 2000 contract with Gator. Project records show that beginning on May 3, 2000 (the first day of fill deliveries to Mount Hood), Modern Continental maintained detailed logs of truck departures from the excavation site, arrivals at Mount Hood, departures from Mount Hood, and arrivals back at the excavation site. Under the July 2000 contract, Gator's payments to the City were to be calculated on the basis of 33 tons of fill per ""dump trailer load"" and 26 tons per ""triaxle load."" The contract specified the following procedure for tracking fill deliveries and documenting Gator's financial obligations to the City: Measurement/payment will be calculated from shipping tickets as generated and signed by Guarantor [Modern Continental] at Project 41  The unexecuted Addendum forwarded to the City by Gator on May 5, 2000 contained a provision stating that all trucks to the site would ""submit a signed slip from CA/T and Modern to verify origin"" and that these slips would be used ""for payment purposes."" As noted earlier, the Addendum was not signed by the City.  41  36   jobsite and collected and submitted by the City with the City's applications for payment. No payment will be made for unexecuted or missing shipping tickets. Thus, it appears that the tickets were intended to serve as the City's documentation of the number and the type of trucks delivering fill to Mount Hood and to enable the City to compute Gator's financial obligations to the City. As the contract provision states, the City was supposed to submit the tickets along with its payment requisitions to Gator. However, the Office's review shows that the Park Department did not retain the shipping tickets collected at the fill delivery site. Although ELM reportedly collected the shipping tickets from trucks arriving at Mount Hood, the tickets were turned over to Modern Continental rather than being retained by the Park Department and submitted to Gator along with requisitions for payment. After ELM's clerk of the works services were  discontinued, no one collected tickets on behalf of the Park Department until May 2001, when the Park Commission hired a new clerk of the works. This individual supervised the project until fill deliveries ceased in July 2001 and collected some tickets during this period. Project records show that shipping tickets were collected from the trucks arriving at Mount Hood. In interviews with the Office, project participants described the ticket system as follows: before leaving the CA/T Project excavation site, each truck was given a numbered ticket by Modern Continental. The ticket showed the name of the trucking company, truck number, truck type (tractor trailer or triaxle), excavation site number, excavation date, shift number, and time of the truck's departure from the excavation site. When the truck arrived at Mount Hood, the arrival time was marked on the ticket, and the ticket was collected by someone at the site, such as ELM, a Park Department employee, or Modern Continental's Foreman. The Foreman advised the Office that she retained all tickets collected from trucks arriving at the site, whether or not the tickets were collected by a representative of the Park Department or by Modern Continental. According to the Foreman, she called Modern Continental's field personnel 42 42  According to Modern Continental officials, Modern Continental had subcontracts with private trucking companies to deliver the fill to Mount Hood.  37   in Boston at the end of her shift in order to reconcile the number of tickets collected at Mount Hood during the shift with the information recorded at the excavation site in Boston. She stated that she then delivered the tickets to Modern Continental's Boston office. CA/T Project officials advised the Office that Modern Continental submitted the tickets to the CA/T Project, which recorded the ticket information in a log and returned the tickets to Modern Continental. City records provided to the Office show that the Park Department did not maintain its own logs or other records of fill deliveries until May 2001, when the City hired a new clerk of the works. An independent audit commissioned by the Board of Aldermen in early 2001 (discussed later in this report) found that the Park Department did not retain or make copies of the shipping tickets collected at the fill delivery site during the ninemonth audit period of May 2000 to January 2001. The Office's review of the City's fill delivery records from the period of January 2001 through June 2001 identified tickets corresponding to nine days in May 2001. In interviews with the Office, the former Parks Superintendent and ELM's President acknowledged that the Park Department did not implement systematic monitoring and documentation procedures but stated that they used informal methods of tracking and verifying the number and type of trucks arriving at Mount Hood. Finding 11b. The Park Department directed ELM to provide clerk of the works services without establishing systematic oversight procedures or executing a written contract specifying ELM's hours, duties, and compensation. ELM submitted a one-page proposal to the Parks Superintendent on April 29, 2000 to provide clerk of the works services for the fill delivery project at a rate of $900 per week. The proposal outlined a series of tasks but did not specify the number of hours on which the weekly rate of $900 was premised. The Park Department did not execute a written contract with ELM. However, the  Office's review indicates that the Park Department did hire ELM in May 2000 to provide  38   clerk of the works services as well as other project-related services. Between May and October 2000, ELM submitted two invoices to the Park Department that included charges totaling $28,184 for clerk of the works services. ELM's first invoice, which was dated August 11, 2000 and covered a 13-week period between May 6, 2000 43  and  October 1, 2000, contained charges of $11,640 for ""day/night clerk"" services approximately $900 per week  but did not specify an hourly rate or the total hours billed for these services. ELM's second invoice, which was dated October 31, 2000 and covered the 10-week period between August 1, 2000 and October 6, 2000, billed the Park Department $16,544  approximately $1,650 per week  for 661.75 hours of ""day/night clerk"" services at a rate of $25 per hour. The second invoice thus billed an average of 66 hours per week for clerk of the works services over the ten weeks between August 1, 2000 and October 6, 2000. 44  In an interview with the Office, ELM's President confirmed that ELM billed the Park Department and was paid by Gator for a variety of tasks performed at the direction of the Park Department, including monitoring fill deliveries and collecting fill delivery tickets from Modern Continental's trucks, hiring a private security company to provide security services at the site, paying ""safety starters"" that provided shuttle service to golfers in a fill-impacted area between the twelfth and thirteenth holes of the golf course, reporting on erosion control measures, and performing construction work on the golf course. He 45  43  ELM's first invoice did not show the date on which services commenced. ELM's President advised the Office that ELM began providing these services on May 6, 2000. According to ELM's President, the high number of hours billed for clerk of the works services in this invoice reflected the work performed by three or four people simultaneously assigned by ELM to the project at certain times during the period covered by the invoice.  44  45  City records reviewed by the Office included several handwritten site reports prepared by ELM during this period. City officials and other project participants interviewed by the Office provided conflicting accounts of the nature and extent of reporting by ELM during this period. In the absence of a written contract or other document specifying the scope of ELM's clerk of the works duties, the Office was unable to determine whether ELM's assigned tasks included preparation of the biweekly status reports referenced in the contract between the City and Gator. The Office was also unable to reconcile the discrepant accounts offered by project participants.  39   acknowledged that all services were provided by ELM without a written contract. He stated that ELM billed the Park Department on a time and materials basis and took the risk that the invoices might not be paid. The Park Department's unwritten arrangement with ELM for clerk of the works services and related project services did not comply with Chapter 124 of the Acts of 1936, the enabling legislation for Mount Hood, which requires Mount Hood expenditures to be appropriated by the Board of Aldermen, or with M.G.L. c. 43, 29, which requires all contracts over $5,000 to be in writing and approved by the department head and the Mayor. City records show that ELM billed a total of $97,717 for the above-cited clerk of the works, construction, and other services between August 11, 2000 and July 30, 2001. Of this amount, the Park Department forwarded ELM invoices totaling $75,760 to Gator, which paid them out of the fill revenues owed to the City. Later ELM invoices totaling $17,148 were paid directly by the City. As of August 31, 2001, a $4,810 invoice from ELM for construction services remained unpaid. Finding 11c. For seven months, trucks delivered more than 321,000 tons of fill to Mount Hood without supervision by a clerk of the works. City records show, and ELM's President confirmed, that ELM provided no clerk of the works services to the Park Department after October 6, 2000. Asked why ELM's clerk of the works services were discontinued, the former Parks Superintendent stated that Modern Continental's round-the-clock fill deliveries were difficult for the Park Department's staff to cover; and paying ELM to work both days and nights proved to be very expensive, raising concerns that the cost of supervision might exceed the fill revenues. Thus, for approximately seven months beginning on October 6, 2000, no clerk of the works was assigned to monitor the fill delivery project on behalf of the Park 46 46  ELM's invoices to the Park Department for construction services during the fill delivery period totaled $59,905. The Park Department's apparently illegal procurements of construction services from ELM and other contractors are discussed later in this report.  40   Department. Project records show that a new clerk of the works began work on May 14, 2001 and that the Park Commission executed a written contract with the new clerk of the works on May 16, 2001. Both the former Parks Superintendent and the park maintenance worker employed by the Park Department told the Office that they attempted to supervise the fill deliveries during the period of October 2000 to May 2001 to the extent they were able and that the fill delivery project often required them to work overtime, in addition to performing their regular duties. In an interview, Modern Continental's Foreman told the Office that  during this seven-month period when the Park Department had no clerk of the works, her practice was to collect the tickets and log the deliveries that had taken place over the night shift when she arrived for the day shift. Massive quantities of fill were delivered to Mount Hood over this seven-month period of unsupervised fill deliveries: approximately 321,208 tons, which amounted to nearly half of the total amount of fill delivered to Mount Hood, according to City records. Figure 1 shows the fill delivered to Mount Hood during each month of the project, based on City records. As the figure shows, fill deliveries declined significantly in the fall of 2000, when the Park Department discontinued ELM's clerk of the works services, but they increased again beginning in December 2000, peaking at more than 75,000 tons delivered in February 2001. Modern Continental's excavation logs show that trucks departed for Mount Hood approximately every five minutes on peak fill delivery days.  41   Figure 2.

At a meeting on May 15, 2001, the Park Commission voted to approve a ten-week contract with the new clerk of the works requiring a minimum of 40 hours of service per week at a compensation rate of $1,400 per week, which amounted to $35 per hour. The contract, which was executed on May 16, 2001, required the clerk of the works to work during a ""core of time"" at the construction site between 4 a.m. and 8 a.m. and then report to the Public Works Superintendent for daily reassignment during the balance of the workday. 47  The contract scope of services included a range of oversight tasks,  including on-site observations of the progress and quality of the work, monitoring of the contractor's construction schedules, maintaining records at the construction site, 47  Clerk of the works services in connection with a public works construction project are not subject to any competitive procurement law. Although the value of the contract exceeded $5,000, the Mayor did not sign the clerk of the works contract, as required by M.G.L. c. 43, 29.  42  Jul-01   maintaining a ""logbook"" of activities at the site, submitting daily written reports to the Superintendent of Public Works, and assisting with inspections. As Figure 1 shows, fill deliveries had declined to the lowest fill amounts quantities since the inception of the project when the new clerk of the works began work. City records show that the new clerk of the works maintained a log of fill deliveries and prepared written reports containing site observations, as required by the contract, until early June 2001. 48  In total, the new clerk of the works was paid $19,600.  As noted earlier, the contract with Gator required the City to hire a full-time clerk of the works with a clearly defined set of responsibilities, including site control, monitoring of the type and placement of delivered fill, collection and verification of delivery slips, documentation, and record-keeping. As has been discussed, the Park Department did not provide the staff-intensive level of supervision necessitated by the round-the-clock fill deliveries authorized by the City's contract with Gator. The Park Department's  makeshift approach to supervision was inadequate to protect the City's interests on the fill delivery project  and would have been inadequate on any major public works project. ELM and the clerk of the works hired in May 2001 were paid a total of $47,784 to supervise the project. Because of the unrestricted fill delivery schedule authorized by the July 2000 contract, the cost of full-time clerk of the works services would have consumed a much larger share of the fill revenues owed by Gator. Correspondingly, the fill revenues available to pay for site preparation work or to fund the promised playing fields and golf course improvements would have been substantially reduced.  Two weeks after executing the contract with Gator, the Park Commission voted to issue a request for proposals (RFP) for clean fill at Mount Hood. According to the minutes of a Park Commission meeting held on July 25, 2000, the Parks Superintendent told the Commission at that meeting that he had recommended to the Mayor that a competitive solicitation for fill be issued when the amount of fill 48  City records show that fill deliveries ceased on July 20, 2001.  43   delivered to Mount Hood approached 300,000 tons.  (As previously discussed, the  City's contract with Gator required the City to accept not less than 300,000 tons of fill and provided that the City could, at its option, accept up to one million tons.) The Parks Superintendent advised the Commission that the Mayor had agreed with his recommendation, the minutes stated. The Park Commission then voted to issue an RFP to accept clean fill at Mount Hood when the amount of delivered fill ""approached"" 300,000 tons. In an interview with the Office, the former Mayor stated that, although the City Solicitor had advised him that the contract with Gator did not require bidding, he ordered the RFP in order to dispel the impression that the City was not obtaining a good deal on the fill. He stated that he believed that a competitive process would help to restore public trust in the project.  In August 2000, the Parks Superintendent signed a contract with CDM to prepare a site plan of modifications to the golf course and of the proposed athletic fields. Prior to August 2000, CDM had provided services to the Park Department under a contract between CDM and Gator (discussed in the previous Finding 2a). However, on August 4, 2000, the Parks Superintendent signed a $25,000 contract with CDM that required CDM to: Meet with OWNER to discuss project objectives and obtain input for recommended revisions to the Master Plan for conceptual design of Athletic Fields and Recreation Improvements at Mt. Hood Memorial Park 49 and Golf Course. The overall initial intent is to create an illustrative conceptual site plan that provides the OWNER with target final grade and related finish subgrade elevations for ongoing earth moving and filling operations. Delivery of fill materials, quality control and compaction activities are hereby presumed to be proper for intended site uses and will be performed as approved by OWNER.  49  However, CDM officials advised the Office that CDM's work products under this contract did not include recommendations for Master Plan revisions.  44   The contract also required CDM to document existing physical conditions at the site, assess the need for and extent of any relative wetland delineation survey, and develop a ""preliminary illustrative conceptual site plan for Phase I work. . . ."" In an interview, CDM officials advised the Office that the scope of the contract entailed further development of the conceptual site plan that CDM had already prepared and for which CDM had received payment under the May 1, 2000 contract with Gator.  The Park Department advertised for fill proposals in September 2000 but received no responses. On September 11, 2000  approximately two months after executing the July 12, 2000 contract with Gator  the Park Department published a solicitation in the Goods and  Services Bulletin50 for ""procurement of clean fill for golf course construction"" under a 12month contract for up to 350,000 tons of clean fill. The request for proposals (RFP), which was issued by the Park Department on behalf of the Park Commission, did not include the convoluted reimbursement procedure, the conditional payment provision, or the conditional indemnification provision contained in the July 12, 2000 contract between the City and Gator. Moreover, the RFP required the contractor to assume logistical and financial responsibility for a number of tasks that were either unspecified or specified as City obligations in the June 2000 contract with Gator. For example, the RFP explicitly stated that the contractor would be required to control mud and dirt generated by hauling activities and, if deemed necessary by the City, to remove access roads at the completion of the contract. The July 2000 contract with Gator did not address these issues. In addition, the RFP stated that the contractor would be responsible for dust control and lighting, whereas the July 2000 contract assigned these responsibilities to the City. In these respects, a contract executed pursuant to the RFP would have been more advantageous to the City than the July 2000 contract.  50  The Goods and Services Bulletin, which advertises public contracting opportunities in Massachusetts, is published by the Secretary of the Commonwealth.  45   However, the Park Department reportedly received no proposals in response to the RFP, and Gator continued to deliver fill under the July 2000 contract. 51  According to the  former Mayor, the RFP process showed that there was no other fill available to the City that would generate more revenue than the amount Gator was required to pay. By the time the Park Department issued the RFP, more than the 300,000 tons of fill had been delivered to Mount Hood under the July 2000 contract with Gator. Although the contract allowed the City to accept additional fill up to a total of one million tons ""at its option,"" the City was under no obligation to do so. At this point, the City could have taken steps to renegotiate its contract with Gator to better protect the City's interests. Instead, the City elected to continue accepting fill under the terms of the July 2000 contract.  CDM submitted a Notice of Intent to the Conservation Commission in September 2000. On September 21, 2000, CDM submitted a Notice of Intent (NOI) to the Conservation Commission on behalf of the Park Department to authorize clearing, grading, and filling ""to accommodate new sports fields and relocate fairways on the golf course."" According to the NOI, some work would take place within the 100-foot buffer zone to three wetland resource areas located in the twelfth fairway area. the following description of the project to be constructed: N One baseball field; N One soccer field; N One parking lot for the proposed fields; N Access road improvements; 52  The NOI contained  51  Gator officials advised the Office that Gator prepared a proposal in response to the RFP; however, when Gator's Principal arrived at the designated location for proposal submissions and learned that there were no other proposers, Gator's Principal decided not to submit the proposal. The twelfth fairway was not denoted for fill deliveries on the map attached to the City's July 2000 contract with Gator.  52  46   N Drainage facilities; and N Grading and contouring to relocate the twelfth tee and green. In October and November of 2000, CDM submitted additional information refining the scope of work. An October 19, 2000 letter from CDM stated that the work within the 100-foot buffer zone to Wetlands 2 and 3 would be limited to ""clearing; placing fill; grading; placing drainage material and loam; seeding the loam; and installing a drain line to maintain on-site drainage patterns."" The other project work, including  construction of a baseball field and associated grading, a parking lot, and a detention basin, would not impact the buffer zone, according to CDM's letter. A November 2, 2000 conceptual site plan filed with the Conservation Commission was stamped by CDM and labeled: ""Plan for Permitting Purposes Only."" 53  One of the  improvements shown on the conceptual site plan was a drainpipe, 24 inches in diameter, extending from Wetland 2 to a field drain and from the field drain to Wetland 3. According to an internal CDM memorandum dated November 2, 2000, the pipe length between Wetlands 2 and 3 was estimated at 540 feet. Subsequent problems concerning this drainpipe are discussed later in this report. On November 2, 2000, the Conservation Commission issued an Order of Conditions in response to the revised NOI. The Order spelled out nine conditions governing the work outlined in the NOI, including required erosion control measures, limitations on use of pesticides and fertilizers, and measures relating to the storm drainage system. The Order of Conditions stated that the contractor responsible for filling and grading activities would be ""jointly responsible"" for any violation of the Order as well as any associated penalties. It appears that the Conservation Commission incorrectly believed that the project was being supervised by a clerk of the works. The Order of Conditions stated:  53  According to CDM representatives interviewed by the Office, no fill was delivered to the twelfth fairway area prior to the preparation of the November 2000 conceptual site plan.  47   A written report may be requested from the Clerk of the Works from time to time by the Melrose Conservation Commission and submitted to the Melrose Conservation Commission within 7 days. However, when the Order of Conditions was issued on November 2, 2000, the project lacked a designated clerk of the works. As previously discussed, no clerk of the works was assigned to supervise the project until the following May. The nine conditions cited in the Order of Conditions also included reporting and documentation requirements that, had they been adhered to by the Park Department, would have strengthened project controls. 54  However, City records show that several  key conditions were not met. For example, the Order of Conditions required preparation of construction documents  i.e., detailed plans showing a 100 percent complete design  and submission of these documents to the Conservation Commission before any work could begin. The Order of Conditions stated: No work shall begin on site until the Melrose Conservation Commission has received copies of the construction documents to be used for field construction. Any variance between the conceptual site plan and the final design documents will require the filing of a revised notice of intent. However, City records contain no evidence that the Park Department ever prepared additional designs beyond the conceptual site plan prepared by CDM or that the Park Department submitted construction documents of any kind to the Conservation Commission. The Order of Conditions also contained the following requirement: While all activities regulated by this Order are being performed and during the construction phase of this project, an on-site foreman, directing 54  As in the case of the previous Order of Conditions for the haul road, the project described in the September 2000 NOI was subject to DEP conditions as well as the Order of Conditions issued by the Conservation Commission. As before, the November 2000 DEP Order of Conditions required the work to conform to the ""plans and special conditions referenced in this order"" and required that the Conservation Commission be notified in writing about any change to such plans.  48   engineer, or designated construction manager shall have a copy of this Order at the site, familiarize himself or herself with the conditions of this permit, and adhere to such conditions. As previously discussed, the project was administered by the Parks Superintendent, with assistance from the park maintenance worker assigned to the Park Department, between October 2000 and May 2001; no clerk of the works was assigned to supervise the project during this period.  The Conservation Commission issued a second Cease and Desist Order in February 2001. At its meeting on February 1, 2001, the Conservation Commission discussed environmental problems caused by the fill in the twelfth fairway area of Mount Hood. According to the meeting minutes, some of the streams and wetlands in the area had been contaminated with silt. Accordingly, the Conservation Commission issued a ""12 th  Fairway Enforcement Order"" prohibiting further filling operations within 100 feet of Wetlands 2 and 3 and on or over the steeply sloped fill areas between the twelfth fairway and the area designated for the future soccer field. The Order specified ten requirements, including fortification of erosion controls and installation of a rock retaining wall adjacent to Wetland 2, compliance inspections by Conservation Commission members, and the preparation by a professional wetland scientist of an environmental assessment and wetland restoration plan for all resource areas abutting the project. 55  The City commissioned an audit of Mount Hood in early 2001. At a meeting of the Board of Aldermen on February 7, 2001, an alderman introduced an order requesting a full audit of Mount Hood municipal receipts, according to the meeting minutes. Pursuant to this order, the City commissioned the services of a CPA firm, Powers & Sullivan, to examine the contract with ELM to manage Mount Hood and the  55  As will be discussed, funds were appropriated for this purpose in April 2001, and a contract with a wetland specialist, Epsilon Associates, Inc., for preparation of a wetland restoration plan was executed in August 2001.  49   contract with Gator for acceptance of fill at Mount Hood.  56  With respect to the contract  with Gator, the engagement letter identified two major areas for examination: N Revenue activity related to the City's contract with Gator from inception through January 31, 2001; and N Internal controls over the revenue generated at Mount Hood as they related to reporting, record-keeping, and fiscal safeguards.  Beginning in early 2001, Gator repeatedly requested a ""closure plan"" from the City showing the remaining scope of work at Mount Hood. Documents provided to the Office by Gator indicate that Gator requested a complete closure plan for all of the fill areas at Mount Hood in a January 30, 2001 letter to the Parks Superintendent, copied to the Mayor and the Public Works Superintendent. The letter from Gator's Principal stated: Gator Hood, LLC has recently received notice that within the next 30-45 days, all excavation on the Modern Continental/CA/T Contract #C17A1 will be completed. Subsequently, all deliveries of CA/T material to MT Hood shall cease within the same period. In order to facilitate a seamless transition, please furnish Gator Hood, LLC with a complete closure plan for all of the fill areas. Please take some time to review the project and compile all necessary information. Within 15 days of your receipt of his notice, please furnish Gator with a draft closure plan for our review. Thank you for your attention to this matter. Beginning in early February 2001, Gator directed its written and e-mail correspondence to the Public Works Superintendent, while copying the same correspondence to the Mayor and the Parks Superintendent. On February 13, 2001, a Gator Principal wrote to the Public Works Superintendent, with copies to the Mayor and the Parks  56  The engagement letter for the work was prepared and submitted to the City by Powers & Sullivan on February 23, 2001 but was not signed by the City until March 23, 2001, by which time the draft audit was nearing completion. Although the $12,000 fee specified in the engagement letter exceeded the $5,000 threshold contained in M.G.L. c. 43, 29 for contracts requiring the Mayor's signature, the engagement letter was signed only by the City Auditor. City records show that Powers & Sullivan submitted an $8,000 invoice to the City on May 25, 2001 for its audit services pertaining to the City's fill delivery contract with Gator. 50   Superintendent, notifying him that deliveries of CA/T material would cease on or about March 15, 2001. The letter stated: [I]t is imperative that Gator receives a closure plan of the entire facility ASAP. Gator would like to review the proposed closure plan prior to its completion, in order to accurately determine our scope of work. Gator's letter cited a series of outstanding issues affecting the remaining fill operation, including the Conservation Commission's Cease and Desist Order restricting fill deliveries in the twelfth fairway area, drainage-related construction being undertaken on the twelfth fairway (discussed in the next finding), and Gator's need for direction as to where to place fill that was being delivered at an average rate of 2,800 tons per night. Documents provided by Gator show that the Gator Principal wrote to the Public Works Superintendent again on March 9, 2001, with copies to the Mayor and the Parks Superintendent, advising him that ""regular delivery"" of CA/T material to Mount Hood would cease on March 14, 2001 but that ""sporadic deliveries"" would continue through May 1, 2001. The letter stated that the total remaining fill amounted to 60,000 tons and reiterated Gator's need for direction: We still await a ""punch list"" of closure items to be performed prior to final demobilization. On April 10, 2001, a Gator Principal sent a letter to the Public Works Superintendent requesting  for the fourth time  a closure plan for the Mount Hood fill operation. The letter stated: Said closure plan should include, but not be limited to, elevations and limits of material. It is imperative that Gator/Modern fully and clearly understand what is required of them over the remaining three weeks of the contract. Gator officials interviewed by the Office stated that the City never provided the requested closure plan. City records reviewed by the Office contained no documents responding to Gator's requests.  51   Finding 12. The Park Department authorized Gator to use funds owed to the City to pay for apparently illegal Park Department procurements of supplies and services at Mount Hood. As has been discussed, the Park Department forwarded invoices to Gator for payment at various points during the fill delivery project. Gator then returned these invoices to the Park Department along with notification that Gator had paid the invoices and deducted the payments from Gator's calculations of its payment obligations to the City. The former Parks Superintendent told the Office that, from the inception of the project, the Park Department maintained detailed records tracking the amount of fill delivered, the dollar amount of the invoices from City vendors forwarded to and paid by Gator, and Gator's outstanding financial obligation to the City. Although the City advised the Office that it was unable to locate hard copies of any such records in response to the Office's request, the Office's examination of disks provided by the City containing some Park Department computer files confirmed that the Park Department maintained detailed spreadsheets tracking this information from the inception of the project until early March 2001. The Park Department appears to have relied on Modern Continental's logs to generate this information. Between May 20, 2000 and March 29, 2001, the total dollar value of the invoices that Gator sent back to the Park Department with notification that they had been paid out of funds owed to the City was $278,308. The Office's review of these invoices revealed that they included payments totaling $31,342 for supplies and services that the Park Department apparently procured from four contracts that had been competitively bid by the Department of Public Works. 58 57  However, the invoices paid by Gator also reflected  expenditures of City funds that violated numerous statutory requirements. Table 2 is a partial list of Gator payments to Park Department vendors from funds owed to the City. The supplies and services listed in Table 2 were procured by the Park Department in apparent violation of one or more of the following laws:  57 58  The computer files did not contain project information beyond that date.  These contracts, which contain estimated quantities, specify that any City department may procure the contracted supplies or services at the bid prices listed in the contracts.  52   N Chapter 124 of the Acts of 1936, 3 requires all income from be paid to the City Treasurer and kept in a separate account. for the development, maintenance, and operation of Mount made by the Board of Aldermen, upon recommendation Commission and subject to the approval of the Mayor.  Mount Hood to Appropriations Hood must be by the Park  N M.G.L. c. 43, 29 requires all contracts over $5,000 to be in writing and approved by the department head and the Mayor. N M.G.L. c. 30, 39M requires advertised, sealed bidding for public works construction contracts estimated to cost more than $10,000. M.G.L. c. 30B bid procedures may be used for construction contracts estimated to cost more than $10,000 but not more than $25,000. N M.G.L. c. 149, 26 and 27 requires contractors performing work for public construction projects, including the transportation of fill to the site of public works or the removal of surplus gravel or fill from the site, to pay prevailing wages. Before soliciting bids for any public construction project, an awarding authority must obtain a prevailing wage sheet. Awarding authorities are responsible for monitoring contractors' compliance with the prevailing wage law, collecting weekly payroll records, and maintaining these records for three years following completion of the construction project. Prevailing wage requirements also apply to all equipment leased or rented by an awarding 59 authority to be engaged in public works. The prevailing wage law has no minimum dollar threshold. It should be noted that Table 2 provides only a partial summary of apparent violations of procurement and contracting laws. All of the listed procurements violated the Mount Hood enabling statute (Chapter 124 of the Acts of 1936, 3). In addition, public  construction contracts are subject to other statutory requirements not listed below or in Table 2, including provisions governing payment procedures (M.G.L. c. 44, 31C); change orders (M.G.L. c. 30, 39F(1)(a)-(h)); claims (M.G.L. c. 30, 39O); submission of payment bonds (M.G.L. c. 149, 29); financial record-keeping by contractors (M.G.L. c. 30, 39R(b)(1)-(3); and certification of tax compliance (M.G.L. c. 62C, 49A(6)).  59  M.G.L. c. 149, 27F.  53   Table 2.

(1) This invoice, paid from funds owed to the City, was addressed to Gator and referenced CDM's May 1, 2000 contract with Gator. (See the previous Finding 2b.)   Finding 13. Lack of planning, supervision, and documentation by the Park Department contributed to the failure of a drainpipe installed on the twelfth fairway. The November 2000 conceptual site plan depicted a proposed drainpipe that would drain water from Wetland 2 to Wetland 3 in the twelfth fairway area. During the course of this review, the Office was told by the former Superintendent and other project participants that the Park Department had hired a private contractor, Dami and Sons, to install the pipe; that in early 2001, Dami and Sons partially installed the pipe in an area where peat 60  was present; and that portions of the installed pipe became dislodged  when the peat moved, or ""heaved"" underneath the drainpipe. Dami and Sons' efforts to reinstall the pipe were reportedly unsuccessful, and the pipe was abandoned and ultimately covered over with fill at the direction of the Park Department. Over the  months following the failure of the pipe, the City hired professional engineers and wetlands specialists to assess and redesign the drainage system in the area, among other tasks. Although the construction work was subject to legal requirements mandating certain public protections, these legal requirements were not met. From a management  perspective, the failure of the pipe  with the attendant costs, schedule delays, and environmental problems  illustrates the risks associated with the previous failures to institute effective project safeguards, such as adequate planning, design specifications, written contracts, supervision by a full-time clerk of the works, and effective recordkeeping procedures. Finding 13a. Installation of the drainpipe without final design documents violated the November 2000 Order of Conditions and exposed the City to construction problems. As previously discussed, the plans accompanying the September 2000 NOI were conceptual drawings labeled ""for permitting purposes only."" The November 2000 Order  60  The term ""peat"" refers to a dark-colored mass of partially decomposed plant debris that is often found in wet areas such as marshes and bogs.  55   of Conditions issued by the Conservation Commission required preparation of detailed design documents prior to the commencement of work on the Mount Hood site. However, City records show that the Park Department directed Dami and Sons to install the pipe without providing Dami and Sons with detailed design documents. Indeed, Park Department records reviewed by the Office contained no written instructions to Dami and Sons concerning the pipe installation. Without a detailed design, the Park Department had no assurance that the pipe installation work would meet the City's drainage objectives, and the Park Department's ability to hold Dami and Sons accountable for proper installation of the pipe was weakened. Finding 13b. The drainpipe installation contractor was hired on a no-bid basis, in apparent violation of Massachusetts construction bid law. Public works construction contracts of $10,000 or more are subject to numerous statutory requirements, including advertising, bidding, performance and payment bonds, and payment of prevailing wages. However, City records contained no evidence that the pipe installation work was competitively bid or that any other statutory requirements were met. 61  The contractor responsible for this work, Dami and Sons, invoiced the City  for more than $216,096 over the course of the fill delivery project, but 67 of the 70 invoices submitted by Dami and Sons contained no information on the tasks corresponding to the invoiced amounts. On January 26, 2001, Dami and Sons did submit a $7,276 invoice for 520 feet of 24-inch drainage pipe and related supplies. Although the Office was unable to determine the amount charged for the pipe  This agreement did not constitute an emergency contract under M.G.L. c. 30, 39M. An awarding authority may dispense with the normal bid process for M.G.L. c. 30, 39M only in cases of ""extreme emergency caused by enemy attack, sabotage, other such hostile actions or resulting from explosion, fire, flood, earthquake, hurricane, tornado or other such catastrophe."" Only work necessary for ""temporary repair and restoration to service of any and all public work in order to preserve health and safety of persons and property"" may be performed under an emergency contract. [M.G.L. c. 30, 39M(a)] The awarding authority must obtain a written waiver of the public notice requirements from the Division of Capital Asset Management (DCAM). [M.G.L. c. 149, 44J(6)]  61  56   installation work, it is highly improbable that the combined cost of labor and materials fell below the $10,000 threshold for bidding under M.G.L. c. 30, 39M. Finding 13c. The drainpipe installation was conducted without a written contract between the City and Dami and Sons, in violation of municipal finance law and sound business practices. The Park Department allowed Dami and Sons to undertake major construction work on City property without an essential protection: a written contract specifying the scope of services Dami and Sons was required to perform and the major terms and conditions governing the arrangement. This arrangement afforded the City no protection against poor performance or excessive charges. It also violated M.G.L. c. 43, 29, which  requires all municipal contracts in the amount of $5,000 or more to be in writing and approved by the department head and the Mayor. Finding 13d. City records provided to the Office contained no reports, analysis, or other documentation of the drainpipe failure. City records provided to the Office contained no design documents, written contracts, written instructions, meeting notes, or project logs documenting the installation of the pipe or the pipe failure. The interviews conducted by the Office indicate that no City official was present at the site when the installed pipe first moved out of position. These interviews also indicated that project participants held differing views of the causes of the pipe failure. Because the City lacked the detailed documentation that would  normally be kept by a public jurisdiction on a public construction project, the Office was unable to reconstruct the specific actions and events preceding the pipe failure. Unlike the City, Gator and Modern Continental did prepare and retain records from the period during the pipe failure occurred. Their records indicate that the pipe failure took place shortly after March 27, 2001. In a March 27, 2001 e-mail addressed to Gator and copied to the Public Works Superintendent, the Parks Superintendent advised Gator  57   that the Park Department's contractor would be covering the pipe to allow Modern Continental to fill over it. His e-mail to Gator stated, in part: As of today the walls are complete and the pipe connections made. th Material can be pushed onto the 12 fairway. Use only the existing disturbed areas to access the fairway. On Thursday I will be marking the fairway areas and providing a plan for the fill there. In the meantime all th material pushed onto the 12 will have to be kept away from the drainage pipe. Our contractor will be covering the pipe to allow Modern's equipment to fill over it. [Emphasis in the original.] Gator also provided the Office with undated photographs showing the installed pipe covered with sand and stone, an excavator mired in peat, and fill on the slope of the twelfth fairway. Project logs maintained by the Modern Continental Foreman for March 28, 2001 indicate that the foreman met with a Gator principal, the Park Superintendent, and the Park Department laborer on that day to discuss the plan for covering the pipe. The Foreman's notes, excerpted below, indicate that the plan called for Dami and Sons to ""backfill"" the pipe and build a ten-foot bridge sufficient to enable Modern Continental's bulldozer to cross over the pipe. The notes also state that the foreman requested a written release from the City before crossing the pipe: Was told we could push material up to pipe. . . . [Dami and Sons] on excav[ator] and D5 will back fill pipe -- also build bridge min. 10' for D6 dozer to cross over. I told. . . [the Park Superintendent and Gator's principal] etc. I will not cross over pipe until we get a release from city that pipe is secure and in place. . . . The foreman's log for March 29, 2001 stated that Dami and Sons' excavator was ""buried"" in the fairway and that Modern Continental was continuing to push material to build a road to the excavator. The log noted that the foreman had taken photographs of the excavator and the pipe: Went to get camera to take pictures of the pipe before we fill over it. The foreman's log for April 2, 2001 recorded a problem with the pipe on the fairway and reiterated:  58   I'm not crossing it without a release from liability from city. The foreman's log for April 3, 2001 recorded her concern that Modern Continental would be blamed for the pipe failure: . . . [Dami and Sons] said that the pipe had moved because dozer was pushing material and it was too heavy. Funny that the pipe on Thursday [March 29, 2001] had already buckled up. Thank God I took pictures. . . . In interviews with the Office, representatives of Dami and Sons, Gator, and Modern Continental stated that after Dami and Sons' efforts to reinstall the buckled pipe proved unsuccessful, the decision was made to abandon the failed pipe and to cover it with fill. City records indicate that the Conservation Commission did not receive timely notification that the pipe had failed. A report to the Conservation Commission from the Public Works Superintendent dated April 19, 2001 stated: ""The diversion drainage pipe is installed."" However, the minutes of a Conservation Commission meeting held on May 3, 2001 reported that a Conservation Commission member had reported visiting the fill delivery site with another Commission member and that they had observed that the pipe was not functional and had not been completed. In a report to the Conservation  Commission also dated May 3, 2001, the Public Works Superintendent reported that the pipe was no longer necessary and would be abandoned in favor of an alternative plan: The drainpipe is no longer needed either as a construction feature or permanent feature. At my request and direction, CDM and EPSILON [the City's consultants] are preparing a modification request that will be submitted to the Conservation Commission. The request, supported by engineering and scientific data, will be to abandon a piped outlet and offer instead to make beneficial use of the newly expanded resource area at the ponded ""Wetland 2."" . . . Members of the Conservation Commission advised the Office that the failure of the pipe contributed to flooding and silt deposits in the areas of Wetlands 2 and 3. Thus, in addition to wasting City funds, the mismanaged and undocumented drainpipe installation work appears to have led to unnecessary environmental problems.  59   The independent audit of the Mount Hood fill delivery project identified legal violations and internal control weaknesses in the City's management of the fill delivery project at Mount Hood. On April 2, 2001, the independent auditors issued a draft report containing a series of findings of violations of law, internal control weaknesses, and other problems in connection with the fill delivery project. Among the findings reported by the independent auditors were the following: N the City had procured fill without an approved contract until July 12, 2000; N the City had executed a contract with Gator without following proper 63 procurement laws; N the City had not applied for or received any direct payments from Gator, as required by the July 12, 2000 contract; N the City's internal control procedures had been circumvented by the arrangement under which City invoices were forwarded to Gator for payment and subsequent reimbursement by the City; N City funds owed by Gator had been expended for site preparation work without appropriation by the Board of Aldermen. N the City had relied on the records of Modern Continental to account for all fill deliveries; and N the independent auditors had been unable to determine who monitored all aspects of the fill delivery project. 62  On April 4, 2001, the Mayor addressed the Appropriations Committee, the Parks Superintendent resigned, and the City received its first check from Gator . According to the minutes of a meeting of the Appropriations Committee of the Board of Aldermen, held on April 4, 2001, the Mayor advised the Appropriations Committee at that meeting that the draft audit conducted by Powers & Sullivan had revealed serious 62  The final version of the audit provided to the Office was undated except for a cover letter from the auditors dated March 30, 2001. The information discussed in the audit included a payment dated May 9, 2001, indicating that the final audit was released after May 9, 2001.  63  As discussed in the previous Finding 1c, the Office's position is that no public procurement law governed the City's fill contract with Gator.  60   flaws in the process used to build athletic fields on Mount Hood. According to the minutes, the Mayor characterized the contracting and internal control problems disclosed in the draft audit as ""real, inexcusable, and unacceptable"" and advised the Appropriations Committee that he had taken certain steps to address these problems. The minutes contained the following summary of the Mayor's presentation to the Committee: There are two substantial problems that have been made apparent. They are real, inexcusable, and unacceptable, and he [the Mayor] says that as the city's chief executive he accepts responsibility for them. Internal controls were not followed  record keeping, day-to-day management, contracts. There is real accountability and consequences if the highest standards are not followed. All appropriations of funds should have come before this Board first. Looking back, there were orders filed in January to set up a revolving fund and to accept funds that should have been sent down long before that. He realizes that it will take some effort in restoring the Aldermen's and the public's trust in this process and has taken the following steps: Asked for and received the resignation of [the] Park Superintendent . . . All Park Commission matters with substance should come before the Board of Aldermen. Funding mechanism to accept money is in place, currently in committee, and the Board should accept that it recommends passage of the Order. Mount Hood budget works differently than any other department's budget, and an annual breakdown will be provided. Closure plan that will secure the ball fields and allow limited access to the back nine be completed, but no other work to be done until this Board deems it appropriate. Things thought to be in place were not, and he apologizes. The project is a worthy one, but the process needs to be made better to restore the public's trust. In an interview with the Office, the former Mayor stated that it was the City's standard practice to follow the bid laws wherever applicable. He expressed the view that the violations of law on the Mount Hood project were inexcusable and that public employees are legally and ethically bound to comply with public bidding laws. He told  61   the Office that, while the Mayor does not typically get involved in the details of a project, he should have handled the project differently at the outset by conducting a structural impact study, preparing a detailed project plan and design, soliciting bids for the fill, ensuring that a clerk of the works was assigned to the project, and establishing a revolving fund for the fill revenues. Nevertheless, he stated that because of the fill payments to the City, the final construction cost for the project will prove significantly lower than if the City had paid for the fill. City records show that Gator paid the City $106,635 on April 4, 2001 the same day on which the Mayor addressed the Appropriations Committee and the Parks  Superintendent resigned. In an interview with the Office, the City Auditor stated that these funds, along with subsequent Gator payments to the City, were deposited in a new reserve account that he had created pending the Board's approval of the order, requested by the Mayor in January 2001, establishing a revolving fund for the fill revenues. 64  According to City records, 631,489 tons of fill had been delivered to Mount  Hood as of April 4, 2001. Finding 14. Unsound contracting procedures and deficient internal controls undermined the City's capacity to resolve the ongoing problems at Mount Hood in a cost-effective, accountable manner. 14a. Contractors hired without appropriations, bidding, or written contracts continued to perform construction work at Mount Hood after the release of the draft audit identifying procurement violations. City records show that Dami and Sons and ELM continued to perform construction work at Mount Hood after April 4, 2001, although no funds had been appropriated for this work; the work had not been advertised and bid in accordance with M.G.L. c. 30, 39M; and no written contracts with these contractors had been executed. The City was billed more than $86,000 for these services: 64  According to the Board of Aldermen minutes, the Board granted approval for the revolving fund on June 27, 2000.  62   N Between April 5, 2001 and June 16, 2001, Dami and Sons submitted 22 invoices for construction services at Mount Hood totaling $64,793. These charges included 104 hours of bulldozer time billed at $125 per hour, 146 hours of excavator time billed at $100 per hour, 566 hours of pump operation 65 billed at $55 per hour, and 175 laborer hours billed at $35 per hour. N Between April 27, 2001 and July 30, 2001, ELM submitted three invoices for construction services at Mount Hood totaling $21,958. The services listed on these invoices included loam installation, final grading, tree installation, cart path installation, tee repair, irrigation work, and stabilization services. 14b. During the month following the Parks Superintendent's departure, fill deliveries and construction work at Mount Hood continued to be unsupervised. According to the Public Works Superintendent and the park maintenance worker assigned to the Park Department, no City official or representative supervised fill deliveries to or ongoing construction work at Mount Hood during the month of April 2001  i.e., after the departure of the Parks Superintendent on April 4, 2001 and before the Interim Superintendent of Parks began work on May 1, 2001. Nevertheless, City  records show that fill deliveries continued during this period: according to City records, 17,940 tons of fill  690 26-ton truckloads  were delivered between April 4, 2001 and May 1, 2001. City records also show that private contractors invoiced the Park  Department for construction supplies and services totaling approximately $99,000 during this same period. The invoices indicated that approximately $75,000 of this amount was billed for supplies and services provided between April 4, 2001 and May 1, 2001. In addition to working without supervision, these contractors were working  without written contracts.  65  The Office's review of these invoices identified some questionable charges. For example, on 14 occasions between April 20, 2001 and June 11, 2001, Dami and Sons billed nine hours of a laborer's time for each 24-hour period of pump operation. When asked by the Office to explain these labor charges, Dami's principal stated that the labor charges reflected time spent checking and refueling the pump during the 24-hour period. However, 16 previous invoices submitted by Dami and Sons in March and early April had billed only three laborer hours for each 24-hour period of pump operation.  63   The Board of Aldermen appropriated $87,000 to fund professional planning, design, and wetlands consulting services at Mount Hood. The minutes of the meeting of the Board of Aldermen held on April 17, 2001 show that the Board of Aldermen appropriated a total of $87,000 that day to fund professional services at Mount Hood. According to the minutes, the Public Works Superintendent stated that the funds would be used to prepare a design plan, drawings, and specifications in anticipation of construction bidding. The funds would also be used to procure professional services from engineers, biologists, and wetlands specialists. The minutes stated: He [the Public Works Superintendent] said that he would almost certainly have to request additional funding but would not know the full cost until the design plan was complete. He stated that the concept plans were not detailed enough to be used for the actual construction of the site. On April 23, 2001, a Gator Principal wrote to the Park Commission Chairman, with copies to the Mayor and the Public Works Superintendent, regarding the fact that Gator's contract with the City was scheduled to expire on May 1, 2001. On the same day, the Public Works Superintendent wrote to Gator regarding the contract expiration date, expressing the City's concern that Gator's plan to deliver up to 50,000 tons of additional fill within the short period of time remaining in the contract period could cause difficulty at the site. The letter raised the possibility of extending the contract to allow the same 50,000 tons to be delivered over a six- to ten-week period. The letter was copied to the Mayor, the Park Commission, the Board of Aldermen, and the City Solicitor.  The Interim Superintendent of Parks began work on May 1, 2001. The City Auditor sent the first of four payment requisitions to Gator on May 3, 2001. City records show that the City Auditor sent Gator a payment requisition on May 3, 2001 for $52,703, which reflected the value of fill deliveries made between February 16, 2001 and April 18, 2001. This was the first payment requisition the City had issued since the fill deliveries began in April 2000. The City Auditor sent three subsequent payment requisitions to Gator over the following three months; as of August 31, 2001, the City  64   had received a total of $175,043 from Gator. Gator made no further payments to the City during 2001. (Gator's financial obligations to the City are discussed in greater detail in Finding 16.)  On May 15, 2001, the Park Commission voted to extend the City's contract with Gator and to approve a contract for clerk of the works services at Mount Hood. At a meeting of the Park Commission on May 15, 2001, the Park Commission voted to accept an amendment extending the City's contract with Gator, which had a termination date of May 1, 2001, for a 20-week period. City records show that the amendment, which was undated, was signed by four members of the Park Commission as well as the Gator representative. The minutes indicate that one member of the Park Commission advocated for ""plans that tell what tonnage we need."" The minutes indicate that a Gator representative  advised the Commission that it should ""act within days because time lines are driven by Central Artery."" The minutes stated: ""[The Gator representative] wants to go on record saying there is a sense of urgency."" The minutes also show that the Park Commission approved and executed a ten-week contract with a new clerk of the works, selected by the Public Works Superintendent, at a compensation rate of $1,400 per week.  In late May 2001, Gator presented the City with a new fill delivery proposal under which the City would receive $1 million to acquire one million tons of additional fill at Mount Hood. The meeting minutes of the Park Commission's May 22, 2001 meeting show that a Gator representative distributed a document entitled ""Mount Hood Fill Project  Phase II"" to the Park Commission at that meeting. According to the minutes, Gator's proposal offered the City ""[a]n additional million dollars plus and 2 to 3 years to bring in all the fill with no up front costs to the City."" Documents provided to the Office show that Gator's proposal entailed the delivery of additional CA/T Project fill to the City's existing compost site. According to the meeting minutes, the Gator representative told the Park Commission that the timeline for delivering the additional fill was dictated by the Central Artery Project, that the City had two to three weeks to decide on Gator's proposal, and that it would take six months to ""work out logistics.""  65   The meeting minutes indicate that the Park Commission was supportive of Gator's Phase II proposal: We are short of money to complete the field and we don't necessarily want fill but we do want the money and we do want a second field. The Park Commission voted to accept the ""concept"" and ""to make sure that we have an access route and that plans be developed and refined over the next five months regarding drainage and safety."" Finding 14c. The City made payments of more than $56,300 in June and July of 2001 for services procured in apparent violation of public procurement laws. The Office's review indicates that in June and July of 2001, the City paid $56,303 for services procured in apparent violation of M.G.L. c. 30, 39M. 66  Massachusetts law  prohibits payment by a governmental body for services rendered in violation of a public procurement law.  N City records show that the City paid ELM $15,298 on June 5, 2001. As previously discussed, ELM had invoiced the Park Department for construction services that had not been bid and for which no written contract was executed. N City records show that the City paid Greenwood and Sons $20,780 on June 5, 2001. There is no evidence that the construction services invoiced by Greenwood and Sons were bid or that a written contract was executed. N City records show that the City paid Dami and Sons $20,225 on July 9, 2001. On June 20, 2001, Dami and Sons had submitted an invoice totaling $188,609 for construction services provided between December 2000 and June 2001. These services had not been competitively bid, nor had the City executed a written contract with Dami and Sons. The Interim Superintendent advised the Office that the City's $20,225 payment reflected the amount of funds remaining in the revolving account containing Gator's fill payments to the City as of July 2001. In a letter to the City Auditor dated July 23, 2001, the Office advised the City to make no further payments to Dami and Sons.  66  See Majestic Radiator Co. v. Commissioners of Middlesex, 397 Mass. 1002 (1986).  66   (A copy of this letter is included in Appendix B of this report.) As of December 67 2001, the City had made no further payments. On June 14, 2001, an alderman wrote to the other members of the Board of Aldermen regarding the proposal under consideration by the Park Commission to accept one million tons or more of additional fill at Mount Hood. The alderman expressed concern that an advisory group created by the Park Commission to review this proposal lacked the necessary planning information to evaluate the need for and cost associated with delivery of additional fill to Mount Hood: Although the Park Commission did decide to create an advisory group to look into the acceptance of this additional fill with members invited from our Board, the Conservation Commission, and citizen representation, the crux of the problem with this approach is that no comprehensive plan has been developed and costed out for this massive project. Without a detailed plan of what is being proposed, how it fits into the other uses of the park, and how much it will ultimately cost, there is absolutely no way that any advisory group can reasonably evaluate whether further acceptance of fill is in the best interests of the Park or the city as a whole. The minutes of a Park Commission meeting held on June 18, 2001 show that a Gator representative warned the Park Commission at that meeting that other entities were interested in the fill being offered to the City and that, if the City issued a letter of intent, there would be substantial penalties for delays thereafter: [The Gator representative] informed the Commission that there were other entities interested in fill (2.2 million tons of historic fill and 400,000 tons of glacial clay) to be delivered over a 2-3 year period beginning January/February. A letter of intent could get a commitment from the [Central] artery within 60-120 days. We would have until about January to come up with a definitive plan. We would be responsible for not causing a delay  delays could cost up to $1 million per day. The Park Commission had still not decided on the scope of the construction work to be undertaken at Mount Hood, as the following excerpt from the meeting minutes shows: [W]hen the project was first presented a ball field and 2 soccer fields were proposed. We should at least be able to get one soccer field. We had 67  City records show that in February and March of 2001, Gator had paid Dami and Sons a total of $27,488 from fill payments owed to the City.  67   plans but because of Conservation issues we had to revise our plans. There is a lot of interest and there is room for a soccer field and it should be a priority. Also on June 18, 2001, the Board of Aldermen ordered the Park Commission to cease and desist from accepting fill at Mount Hood. City records show that as of June 18, 2001  the day the Board passed the order  there had been no fill deliveries on Mount Hood for 10 days.  The Park Commission solicited bids for construction of the baseball field on June 20, 2001. On June 20, 2001, the Park Commission issued an invitation for bids (IFB) for the baseball field construction contract. The plans and specifications, which were prepared by CDM, did not include an access road, parking lot, or amenities such as restrooms, bleachers, or concession stands. The notice of the project published in the Central 68  Register69 listed a project cost estimate of $750,000. According to City records, the Park Commission received six bids, the lowest of which was $737,350. However, the Park Commission did not award a contract for construction of the baseball field. According to the Interim Parks Superintendent, the Park Commission did not award the contract because it lacked a source of funding for the project.  On June 22, 2001, the Park Commission voted to extend the clerk of the works contract. At a meeting held on June 22, 2001, the Park Commission voted to extend the clerk of the works contract at an estimated cost of $8,000, according to the meeting minutes. City records contained no evidence that the contract with the clerk of the works was amended to reflect the extension. According to the Interim Superintendent, the contract extension covered a five-week period from July 23, 2001 through August 24, 2001.  68  On June 28, 2001, the City executed a $35,150 amendment to its contract with CDM for a baseball field design that CDM had already prepared. (The City's practice of executing contracts after receiving the contracted services is discussed in Finding 15.)  Under M.G.L. c. 30, 39M, the City was required to publish a notice inviting bids on the baseball field project in the Central Register, a publication of the Secretary of the Commonwealth.  69  68   Fill deliveries, which had been suspended since June 8, 2001, resumed on July 2, 2001. City records show that fill deliveries resumed on July 2, 2001, two weeks after the Board of Aldermen's June 18 order to stop fill deliveries.  On July 9, 2001, the interim Mayor was sworn in. On July 10, 2001, the City Solicitor wrote to the President of the Board of Aldermen stating, in part: It is my opinion that this order is beyond the authority of the Board of Aldermen and is not a lawful order. On July 16, 2001, an attorney representing Gator wrote a letter to the Board of Aldermen regarding its June 18 order. In the letter, the attorney stated that the City Solicitor had informed the Board that its order was unlawful. On behalf of Gator, the attorney asked the Board to reconsider and clarify its order. The letter warned: Otherwise, Gator will seek relief in Court . . . for the Board's admittedly intentional interference with Gator's ongoing business with the City. City records show that 760 26-ton trucks delivered 19,760 tons of fill to Mount Hood between July 2, 2001, when fill deliveries recommenced, and July 20, 2001, when fill deliveries ended. A total of 690,665 tons of fill were delivered to Mount Hood over the course of the project, according to City records. Finding 15. Contracts with two consultants were executed after contracted services had been performed. City records show that contracts with CDM and Epsilon Associates were signed after some or all of the contracted services had already been completed. N As noted earlier, the Park Commission issued an IFB on June 20, 2001 for construction of a baseball field on Mount Hood. The plans and specifications were dated June 1, 2001 and stamped by CDM, which also prepared the $750,000 cost estimate that appeared in the Central Register. CDM apparently performed much or all of this work without a signed contract with the City. On June 28, 2001, the Park Commission executed a $35,150 amendment to the August 2000 contract with CDM. The scope of services for the work included planning and designing the baseball field; preparing final  69   plans and specifications suitable for bidding; and assembling the final bid package. All of the foregoing tasks had apparently been completed by the time the amendment was executed. N On August 8, 2001 the City executed a $19,900 contract with Epsilon Associates, Inc. for wetland restoration consulting services. The contract itself indicated that several tasks within the contract scope of services had, in fact, been performed by Epsilon more than three months earlier. For example, the contract scope of services contained the following descriptions of the first two tasks: Task 1: Wetland Delineation and Preliminary Erosion Control Recommendations Report. Under Task 1, Epsilon conducted a site visit at Mt. Hood, performed a wetland delineation in selected areas as directed by the Department of Public Works, and prepared a preliminary impact analysis report identifying three specific impacted wetland resource areas. . . . The letter report, dated May 2, 2001, also provided some short term recommendations for stabilizing areas of the site and preventing further erosion and sedimentation into the wetlands. . . . Task 2: Meeting with Client. Also at your request, Epsilon attended a meeting on April 27, 2001 at the office of Camp Dresser & McKee, Inc. (CDM) to analyze the current site status and formulate project strategies such as slope grading and stabilization, final site layout and grades, construction access points, erosion and sedimentation controls, conceptual wetland restoration plans, and wetland hydrology details. This meeting established immediate site plan and survey needs as well as the responsible parties for performing each component. Requesting or allowing private vendors to provide services to the City before executing written contracts with those vendors is an unsound business practice. In the absence of a written contract, there is no assurance that the vendor will provide the specific services needed, nor is there a binding agreement on the price for those services. Under this scenario, the execution of the contract is an after-the-fact exercise that deprives those signing the contract of the opportunity to exert control over the terms of the contract.  In August 2001, the Park Commission contracted with CDM for golf course design services. On August 13, 2001, the Park Commission executed a second amendment to the August 2000 contract with CDM. This amendment specified a lump-sum fee of $42,000  70   for professional engineering services relating to the design for golf holes 11 and 12 at Mount Hood. The scope of services included: N Obtaining input for recommended revisions to the Master Plan; N Engaging a professional golf course architect to perform specific work tasks; N Preparing final plans and specifications for two separate bid packages: tees and fairway for hole 12 and green for hole 11; and N Submitting a final draft of ""the plans, specifications, cost estimate and list of qualified contractors"" for review.  In October 2001, the Park Commission advertised for bids for golf course construction, wetlands restoration, drainage, and earth stabilization work. The Park Commission issued an IFB in October 2001 for ""construction of golf tees and a golf fairway with wetland restoration areas, drainage, and earth stabilization improvements"" on a portion of Mount Hood. The October 17, 2001 Central Register notice of the IFB estimated the cost of the contract at $1.5 million. City records show that the Park Commission received five bids, the lowest of which was $1,199,875. As of December 31, 2001, the contract had not been awarded.  In October 2001, the Park Department filed a Notice of Intent for the golf course wetland restoration project. On October 4, 2001, the Park Department filed a NOI for the Mount Hood Golf Course Wetland Restoration Project. The NOI, which was prepared by Epsilon Associates, Inc. in association with CDM, described the final wetland restoration plan relating to four resource areas impacted by the filling and grading operations at Mount Hood and addressed the final proposed grading and stabilization plans for all the filled and disturbed areas. The NOI provided descriptions of the impacts of sedimentation and filling on the four resource areas: two areas designated as ILSF adjacent to the baseball field ""pad,"" and Wetlands 2 and 3 along the twelfth fairway. For example, the NOI stated that in the upper terrace of the northerly ILSF, approximately 32 inches of sediments had settled on top of the natural topsoil horizons and that ""[m]ature trees and shrub vegetation were observed to be dead or severely stressed."" With respect to Wetland 2, the NOI stated: 71   [D]ue to modifications from filling operations in the adjacent 12 Fairway, the area both received additional surface flows from the bare slopes and had its normal overland outlet swale cut-off by the fill placement. As a result, the wetland and adjacent upland area has been flooded above normal conditions since the filling operations have been underway. The height and duration of the flooding has caused some woody vegetation in the buffer zone to die-off or be stressed. The NOI proposed a restoration plan to address each of the impacted wetland resource areas. In general, the plan included installation of erosion and sedimentation controls, sediment removal, use of ""equipment"" (such as small, specialized excavation equipment and a truck-mounted sediment vacuum system) in the resource areas, replacement of soil and/or organic materials, and vegetative plantings. The proposed work would be completed by a site contractor with oversight and direction from a qualified wetlands scientist. With respect to the ILSF, the restoration plan included pumping water;  th  removing sediment; replacing soil; and installing trees, shrubs, and herbaceous vegetation around the perimeters. With respect to the twelfth fairway, the plan called for grading and stabilizing the slopes; installing a new drainpipe ; removing sediment from the Wetland 2 area; planting trees, shrubs and herbaceous vegetation in the Wetland 2 buffer zone; removing sediments from the stream channel in Wetland 3; replacing soil and installing trees, shrubs, and herbaceous vegetation in the Wetland 3 buffer area; and establishing a wetland replication area near Wetland 3. Finding 16. Resolution of Gator's financial obligations to the City was complicated by the City's incomplete project records. Although fill deliveries ended in July 2001, the financial status of the City's contract with Gator was not resolved. During the course of the Office's review, the Office identified discrepancies in the project records on file at the City and at the CA/T Project, and the Office notified the City of these discrepancies. The City's incomplete project records contributed to the discrepant calculations of fill delivered to Mount Hood. 70  70  The failed drainpipe discussed earlier in this report had been intended to connect Wetlands 2 and 3.  72   16a. The City's calculation of Gator's outstanding financial obligation was inconsistent with the City's own records of the fill delivery project. The Office's analysis of records provided to the Office by the City as of October 12, 2001 indicated that Gator owed the City $42,179 more than the amount reported to the Office by the City. A spreadsheet provided to the Office in August 2001 listed Gator's outstanding financial obligation to the City as $20,821. However, the spreadsheet  showed neither Gator's financial obligations to the City prior to February 16, 2001 nor any of Gator's payments to Park Department vendors from fill revenues owed to the City. The Office's analysis of City records provided to the Office in July 2001 indicated that Gator had delivered 679,644 tons of fill to Mount Hood between May 3, 2000 and July 20, 2001. At $0.70 per ton, the dollar value of the delivered fill totaled $475,751. The City's records also showed that Gator's payments to the City totaled $175,043 and that Gator's payments to Park Department vendors totaled $237,708. Deducting those  amounts from $475,751 would have yielded an unpaid financial obligation to the City of $63,000  $42,179 more than the $20,821 listed in the spreadsheet. 16b. The City's fill delivery records did not comport with the records on file at the Central Artery/Tunnel Project. The Office also compared the City's fill delivery records provided to the Office in July 2001 with Central Artery/Tunnel (CA/T) Project records of fill deliveries to Mount Hood. Both the City and the CA/T Project had computed total tonnage on the basis of daily delivery logs prepared by Modern Continental, which delivered the fill to Mount Hood under an agreement with Gator. However, there was a 7,697-ton discrepancy between the two sets of fill delivery records. The CA/T Project records, which constituted the basis for the CA/T Project's payments to Modern Continental, listed fill deliveries on certain days for which the City had no records of fill deliveries. The additional 7,697 tons of fill reported on the CA/T Project records represented a $5,388 increase in Gator's financial obligation to the City. 73   In a letter to the Mayor dated October 12, 2001, the Office outlined its analysis of discrepancies in the City's financial analysis of funds owed by Gator and discrepancies between City records and Central Artery/Tunnel Project records of fill deliveries to Melrose. Based on City records and CA/T Project records of fill deliveries, the Office calculated that Gator's unpaid financial obligation to the City would be $68,388. (A copy of this letter is included in Appendix B of this report.) In the letter, the Office  recommended that the City review its fill delivery and payment records and take immediate steps to ensure that the City received full payment for all fill delivered to Mount Hood. On October 22, 2001, at the Mayor's request, the Office met with the Mayor, the City Auditor, and the City Solicitor to provide a detailed explanation of the Office's analysis. In a letter to the Mayor dated October 13, 2001, Gator stated that it had paid City vendors $40,600 between February 28, 2001 and March 30, 2001 and that these payments had not been factored into the calculations of Gator's financial obligations prepared by the City. Attached to Gator's letter were copies of the paid invoices, none of which had previously been provided to the Office by the City. The City Auditor advised the Office that he had been unaware of these invoices, which were billed to the Park Department and apparently approved for payment by the Parks Superintendent prior to his departure on April 4, 2001. 16c. Although Gator notified the City of a $17,500 credit to be deducted from Gator's obligations to the City, the Office's review disclosed that no such credit was warranted. Gator's letter to the City dated October 13, 2001 also discussed a ""$17,500 credit against the City of Melrose."" The letter stated, in pertinent part: 72 71  71  This date appears to be a typographical error: the letter was apparently written after October 19, 2001. The invoices were marked ""OK to pay,"" and all were initialed or signed by the Parks Superintendent.  72  74   Finally, as we discussed in our last meeting on October 10 , the CA/T has taken a credit from Modern Continental against the total quantity of fill excavated from the job site and delivered to Mount Hood. The total amount of the credit is 25,000 ton[s] which translates into a $17,500 credit against the City of Melrose. As discussed, the CA/T documentation on this matter is attached (see attachment). It is not clear to me if the Inspector General factored the 25,000-ton deduction into his findings. Attached to this letter was a letter to Gator from Modern Continental, dated October 19, 2001, accompanied by a page taken from a CA/T Project report dated August 24, 2001. In the letter, Modern Continental's Senior Project Manager stated that the CA/T Project had taken a credit from Modern Continental due to an overrun of Type D material transportation and disposal. He stated that the adjustment represented ""a quantity  th  reduction of approximately 25,749 tons"" and that, consequently, Modern Continental would reduce its payment to Gator by $33,750. In a letter dated December 14, 2001, the Office advised the Mayor of the Office's findings regarding Gator's proposed $17,500 reduction in its payment to the City. (A copy of this letter is included in Appendix B of this report.) According to the information obtained by the Office, the CA/T Project had taken a credit from Modern Continental for payments erroneously made under an unrelated contract pay item: pay item 001.183. According to CA/T Project officials, that adjustment did not reduce the estimates of material delivered to Melrose under the pay item under which the CA/T Project paid Modern Continental for the transportation and disposal of Type D material to Melrose and other locations. Therefore, the adjustment in pay item 001.183 did not warrant a $17,500 reduction in Gator's payment to the City. In addition, the Office's letter advised the Mayor that, based on the Office's review of the contract between the City and Gator and the contract between Gator and Modern Continental, it appeared that any adjustment in the tonnage agreed to in the future by the CA/T Project and Modern Continental should have no bearing on the amounts due the City and Gator. The Office's letter noted that both contracts stated that the tonnage of material accepted at the disposal site would be calculated on the basis of the number and size of the trucks delivering material. Under the contracts, both the City and Gator were to be credited with 33 tons for each dump trailer load and 26 tons for each triaxle 75   load. Consequently, the Office's letter concluded, any negotiations between the CA/T Project and Modern Continental regarding the measurement of tonnage through other means appeared irrelevant to the amount owed to the City by Gator and to Gator by Modern Continental. As of December 2001, the issue of Gator's financial liability to the City had not been resolved. In letters sent to the Mayor and City Auditor, Gator stated that it had been informed the City would not ""sign off"" on a final fill quantity on which payment would be made until after the Office had completed its review of the fill delivery project. Finding 17. Throughout the review period, the City lacked consistent contract approval procedures that complied with municipal finance law for Mount Hood-related contracts. In the course of this review, the Office requested copies of all executed memoranda of agreement and contracts (including all executed amendments) pertaining to Mount Hood during the review period. The documents provided to the Office by the City, which had been executed between March 2000 and August 2001, revealed major contract approval inconsistencies. For example, as has been noted, M.G.L. c. 43, 29 requires all City contracts of $5,000 or more to be signed by the Mayor. Although the Mayor signed the March 2000 management contract with ELM and the July 2000 fill delivery contract with Gator, the Mayor's signature did not appear on the $25,000 contract with CDM executed in August 2000; nor did it appear on either of the amendments to that contract executed in June 2001 (for $35,150) and August 2001 ($42,000), or on the $14,000 contract with the clerk of the works executed in May 2001, or on the May 2001 contract amendment extending the contract with Gator. 73  However, the August 2001  contract with Epsilon Associates, Inc. for $19,900 was signed by the Mayor. The Park Commission signed all Mount Hood-related contracts reviewed by the Office with the exception of the City's August 2000 contract with CDM. There appears to have 73  In an interview with the Office, the former Mayor stated that he was unaware that these contracts required his signature. He stated that he assumed that contracts requiring his signature would be put on his desk for his signature before the contracted work began.  76   been no consistent practice regarding the Parks Superintendent's signature on Mount Hood-related contracts. The Parks Superintendent did not sign either the March 2000 management contract with ELM or the July 2000 contract with Gator, but he did sign the August 2000 contract with CDM. The Interim Parks Superintendent signed the May 2001 clerk of the works contract but not the May 2001 amendment extending the contract with Gator; nor did he sign the June 2001 amendment to the CDM contract, either of the two amendments to that contract, or the August 2001 contract with Epsilon Associates. Similarly, the City Solicitor's signature appeared on some contracts but not others. The City Solicitor signed the March 2000 management contract with ELM and the July 2000 fill delivery contract with Gator Hood, LLC. However, the City Solicitor did not sign either the August 2000 contract with CDM, the May 2001 clerk of the works contract or the May 2001 amendment to the contract with Gator. However, the City Solicitor did sign both amendments to the contract with CDM and the August 2001 contract with Epsilon Associates. The City Auditor signed no Mount Hood-related contracts other than the engagement letter with Powers & Sullivan and both amendments to the CDM contract. These inconsistent practices have the potential to foster confusion and disorganization. They suggest the continuing need for improved control and accountability measures with respect to contracts involving Mount Hood.  77   This page intentionally left blank.  78   Conclusion and Recommendations In May 2000, the City of Melrose authorized a contractor to begin delivering Big Dig fill at the Mount Hood Memorial Park and Golf Course for the purpose of constructing new playing fields and improving the golf course. The substantial revenues to be generated for the City by this arrangement would be devoted to the new fields and golf course improvements. As of December 31, 2001, the project cost to the City was estimated to be $1.8 million. This amount was far greater than anticipated and created a financial strain on the City. The report delineates many of the factors contributing to the unexpectedly high project cost. However, the Office notes that the $1.8 million estimate is lower than the cost that the City would have incurred if it had paid market rates for the fill. The Office's review indicates that the cost of purchasing 700,000 tons of fill would have been approximately $3 million. Rather than paying for fill, the City agreed to receive $0.70 per ton for the fill, translating to approximately $490,000. Thus, the $1.8 million cost to the City of a remediated site, a seeded athletic field, and completed golf course improvements may represent an economically fair cost, largely due to the avoidance of fill costs and receipt of fill revenues. Nevertheless, the unanticipated financial burden has had a deleterious effect on Melrose. The Office's review found no evidence that any City official promoted or executed this project for any purpose other than to benefit the City of Melrose by taking advantage of an opportunity that had been presented. City records reviewed by the Office, and  statements made to the Office by key participants in the decision-making process  including the former Mayor, the former Chairman of the Park Commission, and the former Parks Superintendent  imparted a clear sense of urgency and a perception that the Park Commission had to act quickly in order to take advantage of a unique opportunity to obtain fill and generate revenue for a public improvement project. To realize these benefits, the Park Commission accommodated the contractor's schedule by authorizing fill deliveries without first preparing environmental studies, project designs, or cost estimates; without testing the competitive marketplace; and without  79   executing a written contract containing terms and conditions that protected the City's financial and environmental interests. By July of 2000, when the City executed a written contract with Gator, 199,449 tons of fill had already been deposited at Mount Hood. By August of 2001, when fill deliveries ended, the Park Department had completed reconstruction of the thirteenth hole, prepared plans for a new baseball field, and developed the baseball field ""pad."" However, no funds remained from the fill revenues received from Gator to finish the playing fields or to complete the golf course improvements. Although the value of the delivered fill was $483,466, the City had already spent more than this amount. The Office's review shows that as of August 31, 2001, the City's project-related costs and contractual obligations exceeded the value of the delivered fill by $291,620. (See Appendix C.) The public officials responsible for this massive public works project acknowledged that they underestimated its scope and complexity. Neither the Park Commission nor the three-person Park Department had the necessary resources to plan, execute, and effectively oversee this project. In interviews with the Office, the former Mayor, the former Chairman of the Park Commission, and the former Parks Superintendent acknowledged that, in hindsight, the Park Department should not have been expected to provide the necessary project supervision. It is important to recognize that the decision to generate revenue for a public improvement project by accepting fill for that project can be advantageous. Jurisdictions often incur substantial costs for fill needed for construction projects. However, the unanticipated costs and problems encountered on this project illustrate some of the drawbacks of moving too quickly to accept an attractive offer. Careful planning, best value contracting, a well-drafted contract that protects the owner's interests, and full-time supervision are important owner protections for any major construction project, whether public or private. The decision to undertake a complex project entailing substantial alterations to public parkland without these safeguards was risky. As Melrose's experience makes clear, it is unlikely that the benefits of such a  80   complex revenue-generating arrangement can be realized without prudent project planning, contracting, and management. More broadly, the history of this project demonstrates the importance of adhering to legal requirements, sound contracting practices, and principles of public accountability. Fill revenues were spent without the required appropriations by the Board of Aldermen. Contractors were hired without competition and allowed to work at Mount Hood without written contracts. Consulting contracts were executed after contracted services were performed. Contract approval procedures were inconsistent and did not comport with municipal finance law. Project records were incomplete. If not corrected, the practices documented in this report could continue to render the City vulnerable to waste and mismanagement on future projects. Recommendations to the City of Melrose To assist the City of Melrose in its ongoing and future contracting efforts relating to public improvement projects at Mount Hood and elsewhere, the Office offers the following recommendations: 1. The City should resolve any outstanding financial disputes with Gator. 2. The City should resolve any outstanding financial disputes with other project contractors. 3. The Park Commission should ensure that public works contracts at Mount Hood are subject to full-time supervision by trained professionals who are cognizant of the legal requirements governing these contracts. 4. The City should take steps to ensure that all City officials with contracting responsibilities, including Park Commissioners and Park Department staff, are fully apprised of the legal requirements governing contract funding, procurement, execution, and administration. 5. The City should take steps to strengthen administrative controls over major contracts.  81   Recommendations for Other Public Jurisdictions The problems created by the public works project at Mount Hood in Melrose offer some valuable lessons for other jurisdictions that may be contemplating revenue-generating contracts for the purpose of improving public property. It is important to recognize that this type of contract must be planned, executed, and overseen as carefully as any other major public works project. Melrose's experience underscores the importance of  instituting the following measures to protect the public interest on such projects, regardless of the compensation terms or financing arrangements: N Front-end planning by qualified professional staff or consultants should generate information on existing site conditions, a professional assessment of the potential environmental impacts, a well-defined project scope, and a detailed cost estimate. This information is essential to the development of a realistic project budget that includes the cost of full-time professional oversight as well as a contingency for unforeseen circumstances. N If the project is deemed logistically and financially feasible, the jurisdiction should establish the major contract terms and conditions and incorporate these provisions into the specifications for a competitive selection process. N Both the solicitation and the final contract should include detailed plans and should comply with applicable laws, including procurement and prevailing wage laws. N Before the contractor begins work, the jurisdiction should develop an oversight plan that clearly defines the roles, responsibilities, and reporting relationships of those responsible for project supervision. N The jurisdiction should assign a project manager to serve as the locus of responsibility and accountability for the project. The project manager should be responsible for coordinating the contract, supervising the clerk of the works or other on-site supervisory personnel, monitoring the contract budget and contractor payments under the contract, and maintaining all project records. N The jurisdiction should invest in full-time, professional project supervision. Detailed documentation of project activities and decisions in the field should be prepared by the designated clerk of the works or other on-site supervisory personnel and reviewed by the project manager. N Significant changes to the contract price, scope, and/or schedule should be reflected in contract amendments signed by both parties. Instructions to the 82   contractor issued by the project manager or his/her designee should also be recorded. N The jurisdiction should ensure that all project participants are fully apprised of and held accountable for compliance with the legal requirements and administrative procedures governing the project.  83   This page intentionally left blank.  84   Appendix A: Response of the Mayor of Melrose  The attached response letter has been scanned for electronic publishing.  A-1    Appendix B: Letters from the Office of the Inspector General to the City of Melrose  The attached letters have been formatted for electronic publishing.  B-1   July 23, 2001 Mr. Joseph Tassone Auditor City of Melrose 562 Main Street Melrose, Massachusetts 02176 Dear Mr. Tassone: This letter confirms our telephone conversation on Friday, July 20, 2001, regarding a pending payment by the City of Melrose (City) to a private contractor, Dami Construction, in the approximate amount of $170,000. You informed me that competitive bids were not solicited for the public works construction services for which the City intends to authorize the payment. As you may know, Massachusetts law prohibits payment by a governmental body for services rendered in violation of a public procurement law.1 Accordingly, this Office advises the City to make no further payments to Dami Construction. This Office is currently reviewing the City's contracting practices with respect to payments to contractors in connection with the Mount Hood Memorial Park and Golf Course. This Office will advise the City of our findings and recommendations under separate cover when our review is completed. Please feel free to contact me with any questions you may have in this regard. Sincerely,  Barbara J. Hansberry General Counsel cc: Mayor Richard Lyons Board of Aldermen Donald Conn, Jr., City Solicitor David Nalven, Chief, Bureau of Business and Labor Protection Office of the Attorney General  1  See Majestic Radiator Co. v. Commissioners of Middlesex, 397 Mass. 1002 (1986).   October 12, 2001  Richard D. Lyons, Mayor City of Melrose Melrose City Hall 562 Main Street Melrose, MA 02176 Dear Mayor Lyons: As you know, my Office is reviewing a number of issues pertaining to the Mount Hood Memorial Park and Golf Course. Although our review is still ongoing, we have identified a matter with potential financial implications for the City: our analysis indicates that the City is still owed at least $63,000 for fill delivered to Mount Hood, and may be owed more than $68,000. I have decided to bring this matter to your attention at this time in order to enable the City to take prompt and appropriate action to protect its financial interests. A summary of our analysis is provided below. According to records provided to this Office by the City, Gator Hood, LLC currently owes the City $42,179 more than the amount reported to this Office by the City. The City's agreement with Gator Hood, LLC (Gator) obligates Gator to pay the City $0.70 per ton to deliver fill to the Mount Hood site and provide related construction services. The agreement authorizes Gator to deduct from its payments to the City the cost of site preparation expenses incurred by the City and paid by Gator. A spreadsheet provided by the City on August 13, 2001 in response to the Office's request for documents and financial information concerning the City's agreement with Gator lists Gator's outstanding financial obligation to the City as $20,821. However, the spreadsheet appears to be incomplete: it shows neither Gator's financial obligations to the City prior to February 16, 2001 nor any of Gator's payments to City vendors.   Richard D. Lyons, Mayor City of Melrose  October 12, 2001 Page 2  This Office's analysis of the records provided to this Office by the City shows that Gator delivered 679,644 tons of fill to Mount Hood between May 3, 2000 and July 20, 2001. At $0.70 per ton, the dollar value of the delivered fill totals $475,751. The City's records also show that Gator's payments to the City to date total $175,043 and that Gator's payments to City vendors total $237,708. Deducting these amounts from $475,751 yields an unpaid financial obligation to the City of $63,000. According to Central Artery/Tunnel Project records, fill deliveries to Mount Hood exceeded the fill deliveries shown in the City's records by more than 7,000 tons. The value of the additional fill not shown in the City's records is $5,388. This Office has compared the City's fill delivery records with Central Artery/Tunnel (CA/T) Project records of fill deliveries to Mount Hood. Both the City and the CA/T Project have computed total tonnages on the basis of daily delivery logs prepared by Modern Continental Construction Company, which delivered the fill to Mount Hood under an agreement with Gator. However, there is a 7,697-ton discrepancy between the two sets of fill delivery records. The CA/T Project records, which constitute the basis for the CA/T Project's payments to Modern Continental, list fill deliveries on certain days for which the City has no records of fill deliveries. The additional 7,697 tons of fill reported on the CA/T Project records represents a $5,388 increase in Gator's financial obligation to the City. Based on the CA/T Project records of fill deliveries, this Office calculates that Gator's unpaid financial obligation to the City would be $68,388. We recommend that the City review its fill delivery and payment records and take immediate steps to ensure that the City receives full payment for all fill delivered to Mount Hood. We would be glad to assist in this process by meeting with the City to provide a more detailed explanation of this Office's analysis. If you have questions or if you would like to schedule a meeting, please feel free to contact Pamela Bloomfield of my staff. Sincerely,  Gregory W. Sullivan Acting Inspector General cc: Board of Aldermen Park Commission Joseph Tassone, City Auditor Ray Blanchard, Interim Superintendent of Parks Donald L. Conn, Jr., Esq., City Solicitor   December 14, 2001 Richard D. Lyons, Mayor City of Melrose Melrose City Hall 562 Main Street Melrose, MA 02176 Dear Mayor Lyons: I am writing regarding the December 3, 2001 letter that you received from Michael J. Gill, Esq., who represents Gator Hood, LLC (Gator) in the matter of the Mount Hood fill project. This Office received a copy of Mr. Gill's letter on December 10, 2001. At the outset, I want to reiterate that it is not this Office's purpose or role to engage in negotiations between the City and Gator regarding the amount of fill delivered, payments made by Gator, and any payments due the City. Instead, as we did in our October 12, 2001 letter to you, we are calling your attention to information we have obtained that may affect the City's financial interests. Mr. Gill's December 3, 2001 letter CA/T [the Central Artery/Tunnel Modern Continental was factored was 25,000 tons, which translates to you stated, ""It is not clear whether a credit taken by project] against the total amount of fill delivered by into the IG's analysis. The total amount of the credit into a $17,500 credit against the City.""  On this same point, Mr. Madden of Gator sent you a letter, a copy of which the City Auditor forwarded to this Office on October 25, 2001, stating, in part: [A]s we discussed in our last meeting on October 10 , the CA/T has taken a credit from Modern Continental against the total quantity of fill excavated from the job site and delivered to Mount Hood. The total amount of the credit is 25,000 ton which translates into a $17,500 credit against the City of Melrose. As discussed, the CA/T documentation on this matter is attached . . . . th   Richard D. Lyons, Mayor City of Melrose  December 14, 2001 Page 2  The documentation attached to Mr. Madden's letter, dated October 19, 2001, consisted of a letter to Mr. Madden from Frank Trubiano, Modern Continental Senior Project Manager, accompanied by a CA/T Project report dated August 24, 2001. In the letter, Mr. Trubiano stated that the CA/T Project has taken a credit from Modern Continental due to an overrun of Type D material transportation and disposal. Mr. Trubiano's letter stated that the adjustment ""represents a quantity reduction of approximately 25,749 tons"" and that, consequently, Modern Continental will reduce its payment to Gator by $33,750. Mr. Trubiano enclosed a copy of the CA/T Project report that, he said, verified the credit. Last week, staff of this Office met with CA/T Project officials to review the CA/T Project report enclosed with Mr. Trubiano's letter. According to the information we obtained at that meeting, the CA/T Project report cited by Mr. Trubiano should have no impact on any calculation of payments due the City for receipt of fill. The information cited by Mr. Trubiano relates to pay item 001.183. However, the pay item under which the CA/T Project pays Modern Continental for the transportation and disposal of Type D material to Melrose and other locations is 126.184. According to CA/T Project officials, the CA/T Project has taken a credit from Modern Continental for payments erroneously made under pay item 001.183. This adjustment, according to the CA/T Project officials, does not reduce the estimates of material delivered to Melrose under pay item 126.184. Therefore, the adjustment in pay item 001.183 does not warrant a $17,500 reduction in Gator's payment to the City. This Office also learned from CA/T Project officials that the CA/T Project is reviewing information that may lead to an adjustment in the total tonnage for which the CA/T Project pays Modern Continental. Any such adjustment will be subject to negotiation and will not likely be completed in the near future. Moreover, this Office's review of the contract between the City and Gator and the contract between Gator and Modern Continental suggests that any adjustment in the tonnage agreed to in the future by the CA/T Project and Modern Continental should have no bearing on the amounts due the City and Gator. The contract between the City and Gator states in pertinent part: Measurements. All quantities are estimates only. Measurement is based on an agreed thirty three (33) tons per dump trailer load and twenty six (26) tons per triaxle load. Measurement/payment will be calculated from shipping tickets as generated and signed by [Modern Continental] at Project jobsite and collected and submitted by the City with the City's applications for payment. . . . Similarly, the contract between Gator and Modern Continental states in pertinent part:   Richard D. Lyons, Mayor City of Melrose  December 14, 2001 Page 3  All Unit Price Contract Quantities are estimates only. Payment is predicated on the actual tonnage of material accepted at the disposal site as verified by a Modern Continental Project Manager. Payments will be calculated from received shipping tickets as generated and signed by MCC at the jobsite. . . . Measurement is based on an agreed 33 tons per load via Dump Trailer and 26 tons per load via Triaxle. . . . Thus, both contracts state that the tonnage of material accepted at the disposal site will be calculated on the basis of the number and size of the trucks delivering material. The contracts specify that both the City and Gator will be credited with 33 tons for each dump trailer load and 26 tons for each triaxle load. Consequently, any negotiations between the CA/T Project and Modern Continental regarding the measurement of tonnage through other means appear irrelevant to the amounts owed to the City by Gator and to Gator by Modern Continental. This Office met with you, the City Auditor, and the City Solicitor on October 22, 2001 to explain the analysis provided in our October 12, 2001 letter. We have also provided CA/T Project records to the Interim Superintendent of Parks. We continue to be available to City officials to answer any questions you may have. Sincerely,  Gregory W. Sullivan Acting Inspector General cc: Board of Aldermen Park Commission Joseph Tassone, City Auditor Ray Blanchard, Interim Superintendent of Parks Donald L. Conn, Jr., Esq., City Solicitor Michael Gill, Esq.   Appendix C: Project-Related Costs As of August 31, 2001, according to City records, Gator had delivered 690,665 tons of fill to Mount Hood.

The commission, led by John William Ward, produced a 12-volume report documenting its findings of massive fraud and waste and detailing its legislative recommendations for reform. The Office was the first statewide office of the inspector general established in the country. ""The basic concept behind the Office of the Inspector General is that any institution . . . must build into itself a mechanism for self-criticism and selfcorrection. . . . To prevent and detect (and the emphasis falls as much upon prevention as detection) fraud and waste . . . the Commission designed the Office of the Inspector General to be a neutral, impartial and independent office to fulfill that critical function.""  Ward Commission Final Report, Vol. 1 The Office has a broad mandate under Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 12A to prevent and detect fraud, waste, and abuse in government. M.G.L. c. 12A provides the Office the power to subpoena records and people for investigations and management reviews, and to investigate both criminal and noncriminal violations of the law. The Office employs a staff of experienced specialists, including investigators, lawyers, management analysts, and engineers. Special interdisciplinary teams are formed to meet the unique requirements of the Office's projects. The Office also has assigned a team of procurement specialists to assist local governments with best value contracting. Preventing fraud, waste, and abuse before they happen is the principal objective of the Office. Throughout its pages, this report details examples of our prevention activities, which fall into three broad categories: Capacity building. The Office provides extensive training of public officials, including the Massachusetts Certified Public Purchasing Official (MCPPO) program. The Office also provides technical assistance to public officials by fielding a team of procurement specialists that regularly answer questions related to M.G.L. c. 30B, and publishing instructional manuals on state public purchasing laws  1   as well as a quarterly Procurement Bulletin with information and advice to promote effective and ethical purchasing. Timely intervention. Whenever possible, the Office seeks to intervene in situations before fraud, waste, or abuse occurs. For example, the Office may comment on legislation that exposes the state to financial losses or assist a public agency in devising terms for a request for proposals that will generate robust competition. W ith increasing frequency the Legislature directs the Office to review, comment on, and sometimes approve real property transactions, economic development projects, and other state activities. Similarly, and also with increasing frequency, public officials seek the Office's assistance and comments on proposals before they are implemented. Dissemination of lessons learned. Where the Office identifies issues of potential interest to many public officials, the Office disseminates information to help prevent problems before they occur. For example, when the Office identified significant problems in one town's completed school renovation project, the Office developed recommendations for all school districts to prevent similar problems in the future, and we mailed a copy of the report to each school district. We also use the Procurement Bulletin to inform local officials about the results of our work in other jurisdictions. In 1998, the Office launched an Internet website to facilitate dissemination of lessons learned. New and recent Office reports and instructional manuals as well as all of the Office's Procurement Bulletins are available on the website. The website also provides information on current MCPPO program offerings and schedules. Of course, effective detection of fraud, waste, and abuse is essential. The Office receives many complaints alleging fraud, waste, or abuse in government. The Office evaluates each complaint to determine whether it falls within the Office's jurisdiction and, if so, whether it merits action by the Office. Some complaints are closed immediately or after a preliminary inquiry fails to substantiate the allegations; others lead to management reviews or investigations. When the Office completes projects, we typically issue a letter or report detailing our findings and recommending reforms to prevent future problems. Information concerning criminal or civil violations of law is reported to appropriate authorities, including the Attorney General and the United States Attorney. The Office's budget for fiscal year 2002 was $1,822,662. Although the Office has 118 authorized staff positions, only 27 staff positions were filled in fiscal year 2002 because of budget constraints.  2   Investigations The Office's investigations of criminal and civil violations of law arise from a variety of sources, including complaints received in writing or by telephone, information developed during the course of other Office reviews and activities, and requests for assistance by other investigative agencies such as local and state police. The Criminal Investigations Division includes a computer forensics unit that provides logistical and investigative support. In 2001, the Office received 115 complaints, 74 of which were reported to the Office's toll-free hotline. The Office often forwards complaints to other agencies if a preliminary investigation reveals that the complaints are outside the Office's jurisdiction or would be more appropriately handled by another agency with jurisdiction over the matter. Some of the agencies to which the Office reported complaints in 2001 include the U.S. Attorney's Office, the Office of the Attorney General, the Office of the State Auditor, the State Ethics Commission, the Department of Revenue, and local police agencies. M.G.L. c. 12A restricts disclosure of ongoing investigations as well as referred cases in which no official disposition has been made. The Office also works jointly with other federal and state investigative agencies under nondisclosure agreements that prohibit discussion of a case with anyone not directly investigating the case. Many such joint investigations are long range and encompass the majority of investigative resources within the Office. Accordingly, the cases referenced below constitute only a partial listing of investigations conducted by the Office.  Reading Municipal Light Department Spending Practices In November 2001, following a lengthy investigation, the Office issued an investigative report, entitled Credit Card and Certain Other Spending Practices at the Reading Municipal Light Department, detailing abuses and irregularities in the spending practices of the Reading Municipal Light Department (RMLD), which provides electricity to Lynnfield, North Reading, Reading, and Wilmington. The RMLD has a General Manager who is subject to the direction and control of an elected, five-member Board of Commissioners. The Office's investigation examined all RMLD documents pertaining to use of RMLD issued credit cards and reimbursable expenses for the period of January 1998 to September 2000. The Office obtained additional documents from a complainant and from local and national restaurants and hotels. The documents revealed unchecked spending  3   practices by RMLD management and lack of oversight by the Board of Commissioners. The Office's report included the following specific findings: The RMLD's credit card spending cost ratepayers thousands of dollars in excessive, unauthorized and/or inadequately documented expenditures. Although the RMLD's credit card policy restricted credit card use to documented business-related expenditures, the Office's investigation detailed exorbitant charges  including expenditures for lavish meals and alcohol consumed by RMLD managers and their guests, luxury hotel accommodations, show tickets, and other items  charged to ratepayers by RMLD managers in connection with trips to Las Vegas, Nevada; Scottsdale, Arizona; and San Antonio, Texas. RMLD managers also charged daily lunches, clothing, a bicycle, limousine and car services, and bedding on RMLD credit cards. The Office found that few of the requests for payment of the credit card charges were accompanied by notations, charge slips, or receipts which clearly indicated the business nature of the expense. ""This Office attempted to verify conferences attended in accordance with cardholder entries on monthly credit card statements. In one instance where extraordinary sums were expended, this Office learned from the stated sponsor that no conference was held during the month and at the location noted by RMLD's Assistant General Manager. ""  IG report, November 2001 Records viewed by the Office demonstrated that RMLD management was frequently away on business. The Office found that the General Manager spent a portion of nearly every month of the 33-month investigation period away from RMLD staying in hotels at ratepayer expense. During this period, hotel expenses charged by the General Manager totaled $21,475, while hotel expenses charged by other RMLD managers totaled $19,081. Thus, RMLD management charged ratepayers more than $40,000 in hotel expenses alone during the investigative period. Ratepayers funded expenditures for alcoholic beverages purchased at restaurants, hotels, and conferences by RMLD management. Although M.G.L. c. 44, 58 states that no city or town shall pay a bill incurred by any other official thereof for wines, liquors, or cigars, municipal light departments are not subject to this prohibition. In the absence of a policy prohibiting the expenditure of public funds for employee consumption of alcoholic beverages, RMLD officials and  4   guests frequently consumed alcoholic beverages paid for by RMLD's corporate credit card. The Office's report offered the following recommendations to address the problems identified by the Office's investigations: RMLD's Board of Commissioners should exercise more effective oversight to ensure RMLD is in compliance with all internal spending policies. RMLD's credit card use policy should be amended to place restrictions on credit card use. RMLD's per diem rates should conform to the Town of Reading's reimbursement rates. RMLD should adopt a policy prohibiting reimbursement for the consumption of alcohol. RMLD should provide supporting documentation for expenditures to the Board of Selectmen and Town Accountant. RMLD should establish a reasonable annual budget for conference attendance and conference-related travel. RMLD should hold employees financially accountable for apparent past personal use of credit cards. ""[T]he lavishness of RMLD's previously undisclosed spending practices should offend the sensibilities of the ratepayers who entrust their best interests in prudent oversight of their Light Department to the Commissioners whom they elect. ""  IG report, November 2001 Following the release of the Office's report, the Town of Reading and the RMLD each contracted separately with independent accounting firms for forensic audits of RMLD expenditures. The results confirmed the Office's investigative findings. Subsequently, the RMLD Board of Commissioners accepted the resignation of the General Manager and terminated the Assistant General Manager. In addition, the Senior Lineman Supervisor took early retirement. The RMLD has also implemented new policies and taken steps to ensure strict adherence to existing policies. This Office will continue working with the Town of Reading and the RMLD Board of Commissioners to assist in the recovery of misappropriated funds.  5   Update: Brockton Golf Course Investigation In 2000, a joint Office investigation with the Massachusetts State Police and the Plymouth County District Attorney's Office disclosed mismanagement and misappropriation of resources at the City-owned D.W. Field Golf Course in Brockton. The City instituted new internal control and accounting changes in response to these disclosures. Based on the Office's recommendations, the City installed a point-of-sale accounting system and video cameras enabling closer monitoring of the daily financial transactions at the golf course. These changes proved instrumental in improving the City's management and control of the golf course and in generating increased revenues for the City. According to news accounts, the D.W. Field Golf Course generated more revenue during the 2001 golf season than it had generated during any other year in its 66-year history; the Mayor of Brockton cited the new point-of-sale system as a one factor contributing to the increased revenues.  Preliminary Investigation Reports to Other Agencies In those instances in which the Office determines that a matter would be best handled by another agency, the matter is initially investigated by the Office and then reported to another agency. Examples during 2001 include the following: Alleged conflict of interest: The Office reported to the State Ethics Commission an allegation that the director of a state agency had granted no-bid contracts to family members. Alleged conflict of interest: The Office reported to the State Ethics Commission an allegation of impropriety in the granting of a building permit and the nonenforcement of town zoning rules and bylaws by a town building inspector. Alleged conflict of interest. The Office reported to the State Ethics Commission an allegation that a Chief of Police promoted a family member within his department. Alleged violations of state agency rules. The Office reported to the Inspectional Services Division of the Department of Revenue alleged violations of a state agency's rules and use of property for the personal benefit of a public official. Alleged pollution of a river in central Massachusetts. The Office reported to the Department of Environmental Protection Strike Force an allegation of river pollution and illegal disposal of sludge by employees of a public wastewater facility.  6   Financial Oversight Review of Central Artery/Tunnel Project Finances ""Records show that local FHWA officials acted in partnership with state officials to downsize the Big Dig cost estimate for public relations purposes.""  IG report, March 2001 In March 2001, after a yearlong review of Central Artery/Tunnel Project (Project)  also known as the ""Big Dig""  cost overruns, the Office issued a detailed report to the Treasurer of the Commonwealth, entitled ""A History of Central Artery/Tunnel Project Finances 1994-2001."" The report addressed issues related to the $1.4 billion Big Dig cost overrun announced in February 2000. The announcement of this overrun followed a December 1999 bond issuance and was prior to a February 2000 bond issuance. By October 2000, Big Dig officials announced that the overrun had increased to $2.5 billion. This Office examined the history of this overrun and found that it resulted from budget assumptions made in 1994 and 1995 that were accepted by Federal officials. This Office also examined what role federal, state, and project officials had in creating and maintaining the assumptions after 1995 and what role they had in failing to disclose the overrun to the state Legislature and the financial markets. Although the Office of the State Treasurer had conducted an extensive due diligence review in preparation for the December 1999 bond issuance, the Office's investigation uncovered information that was not disclosed to the Office of the State Treasurer. During the pre-sale period for those bonds, the Turnpike Authority's outside counsel acknowledged to Project officials, but not publicly, that the Big Dig faced an almost $1.4 billion overrun. A late night fax sent by the outside counsel for the Turnpike Authority seven days before the bond sale stated: ""These are `hard' numbers  not worse case #'s [numbers]."" This fax was sent the night before the Governor and other state officials met with Wall Street analysts to discuss the Commonwealth's bond rating. The Turnpike Authority's outside counsel initially withheld this disclosure document from the Office under a purported claim of attorney-client privilege. In June 2000, while the Office's yearlong review was still ongoing, the Office brought this document to the attention of the Turnpike Authority Chairman.  7   ""These are `hard' numbers  not worst case #s [numbers].""  Document faxed by Turnpike Authority outside counsel identifying undisclosed cost overruns before December 1999 bond sale, December 1999 The Office reviewed more than 100,000 pages of documents related to the period 1994 to 2000, including internal Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) documents related to a detailed budget review conducted in 1995 by FHWA officials. The Office's review revealed the following: In 1994, Bechtel/Parsons Brinckerhoff (B/PB), the state's management consultant responsible for administering the Big Dig, provided the Governor and state officials with a Big Dig cost estimate of almost $14 billion, a figure uncannily close to the current estimate. B/PB's $14 billion estimate in 1994 starkly contradicted the $8 billion estimate offered publicly by Big Dig officials1 at that time. After B/PB presented its $14 billion estimate in 1994, state managers directed state and B/PB staff to undertake a cooperative effort to maintain the fiction of an ""on-time"" and ""onbudget"" $8 billion project. Records showed that they did so by applying a largely semantic series of exclusions, deductions, and accounting assumptions that covered-up the $6 billion difference. Internal FHWA records showed that in 1995, B/PB officials disclosed to local FHWA officials all budget assumptions that Big Dig officials had used to shrink the cost estimate from $14 billion to $8 billion. Records showed that local FHWA officials acted in partnership with state officials to downsize the Big Dig cost estimate for public relations purposes. In early 2000, federal officials investigated the cause of the Big Dig cost overrun; they concluded that state officials had deceived local FHWA officials. FHWA records contradicted this conclusion. Big Dig and local FHWA officials shirked their fiduciary responsibilities by not disclosing all relevant financial facts to the public, the State Legislature, and the bond markets. Big Dig files were reportedly missing, computer hard drives had allegedly been destroyed, and many documents continued to be shielded from the public by attorney-client privilege. 1  ""Big Dig officials"" refers to senior Massachusetts Highway Department and Massachusetts Turnpike Authority managers, including the Turnpike Chairman and Project Director, charged with the administration of the Big Dig and the Commonwealth's contract with B/PB. 8   The Office of the State Treasurer ultimately forced Big Dig officials to disclose the cost overrun through its due diligence review of February 2000. The Office's report called for an independent federal investigation by Congress into the FHWA's role in downsizing the Big Dig cost estimate and for a re-examination of the FHWA-imposed funding cap that has saddled the citizens of Massachusetts with billions of dollars in added debt. As a result of the Office's report, the entire Massachusetts Congressional delegation signed a letter to the Inspector General for the U.S. Department of Transportation requesting an investigation into the allegations contained in the report. Senator John McCain and Congressman Harold Rogers also sent letters to the U.S. Department of Transportation requesting that an investigation be undertaken. The Joint Committee on Transportation of the Massachusetts Legislature called for a hearing into the matter. At this hearing, B/PB's Big Dig Manager confirmed that the Governor was told in 1994 of the $14 billion cost projection and he also stated that he told the former Project Director that he was concerned ""that information should flow higher than [the Director]."" During the remainder of 2001, the Office provided documents and information in connection with investigations undertaken by the Office of the Attorney General, the Securities and Exchange Commission, the U.S. Department of Transportation Office of the Inspector General, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation.  9   This page intentionally left blank.  10   Effective and Ethical Contracting University of Massachusetts Computer Science Center Review In March 2001, the Office issued A Report on the Design and Construction of the University of Massachusetts Computer Science Center, a detailed review of a design-build project procured by the Division of Capital Asset Management (DCAM) on behalf of the University of Massachusetts (UMass). The Computer Science Research and Development Center (Computer Science Center), which was completed in July 1999, is a flatroofed, steel-framed, three-story building encompassing approximately 80,000 gross square feet on the UMass Amherst campus. DCAM, the state's centralized construction management agency, was responsible for planning, procurement, and contract administration for this project. In response to the study designer's recommendation of a design-build approach to shorten the project schedule, DCAM used the state's modular building procurement law to award a contract to Suffolk Building Corporation (Suffolk) for the design and construction of the UMass Computer Science Center. The study designer projected that the UMass Computer Science Center could be completed in 18 months using a design-build approach. However, the project took 37 months to complete. DCAM's contract with Suffolk contained a completion deadline of September 9, 1998 and a total design and construction cost of $9,231,000. Suffolk completed the project in July 1999, 10 months late. In the course of the project, DCAM approved change orders that increased the contract cost by $475,985. In October 1999, three months after project completion, Suffolk submitted a claim to DCAM seeking an additional $2,733,674. In total, the change orders sought by Suffolk would increase the cost of the project by more than one third. Moreover, the completed project fell short of UMass's standards for construction quality in at least two significant respects. In its claim, Suffolk alleged that DCAM and UMass caused project delays by failing to approve design submissions in a timely fashion, by delaying design decisions, and by requesting design changes. DCAM contracted with a consultant to analyze Suffolk's claim and, based on the consultant's recommendation, initially agreed to pay Suffolk $1.4 million to settle the dispute. However, the Office's review found that the delays and cost overruns were largely caused by factors under Suffolk's control. In addition, the Office found that the Suffolk claim was inflated by charges for damages not  11   permitted under Suffolk's contract, by overstated indirect costs, and by more than $300,000 in charges for undocumented design services that cannot be verified. After the Office raised concerns about the claim, DCAM decided not to execute the $1.4 million settlement agreement. DCAM retained a law firm to assess the consultant's report and recommendations, and the law firm reportedly recommended conducting a new analysis of Suffolk's claim. ""By not scrutinizing change orders and claims and by not enforcing the requirements of its own contracts, the Commonwealth undermines fair competition for its future construction contracts.""  IG report, March 2001 The major findings presented in the Office's March 2001 report are summarized below: Although DCAM used the modular building procurement statute to contract for this project, the UMass Computer Science Center is not a modular building. The term ""modular building,"" as defined in M.G.L. c. 149, 44E, refers to buildings that are either factoryassembled into three-dimensional modules or portable structures. The UMass Computer Science Center was not constructed as a modular building. Instead, it is a conventionally constructed building that used steel components provided by a pre-engineered metal building systems manufacturer for the third-floor and roof structure. Most delays and cost overruns on the UMass Computer Science Center were caused by factors under Suffolk's control. The findings in this report show that, contrary to Suffolk's claim, the problems contributing to delays and cost overruns were not caused by major design changes initiated by DCAM or by UMass after the project began. Rather, most major problems were attributable to Suffolk's failure to ensure that design work was complete, accurate, and timely; Suffolk's continual efforts to reduce construction costs through design revisions; and Suffolk's failure to take timely steps to replace nonperforming subcontractors. The design-build approach was not appropriate for the UMass Computer Science Center project. The major disadvantage of the design-build project delivery method is that the owner must give up control over final design, increasing the risk that the completed building will not meet its needs or standards for quality. UMass's efforts to ensure that the building met its standards for quality and functionality were met with resistance by Suffolk and resulted in disputes, despite  12   clear contract terms that required Suffolk to submit final design work to DCAM for approval. The Office also found that Suffolk and its design subcontractor were engaged in a dispute over design fees throughout most of the project, showing that the design-build approach, which is intended to foster collaboration between the designer and the contractor, does not guarantee a harmonious relationship between them. Top DCAM management did not support efforts of DCAM project personnel to enforce contract requirements and maintain control over the project. Project records showed that DCAM project personnel attempted to enforce design review and other contract requirements, including requirements for Suffolk to obtain approval for its proposed schedule. Nevertheless, Suffolk failed to meet its own proposed schedule for submissions or to submit complete, revised design documents for approval as required by the contract. In many instances, top DCAM management waived these contract requirements. Top DCAM management failed to conduct a rigorous assessment of the merits of Suffolk's $2.7 million claim. Many costs rejected by DCAM project personnel in change orders proposed by Suffolk were later incorporated into Suffolk's $2.7 million claim. Top DCAM management hired a claims consultant under an agreement that contained no written instructions or scope of work to analyze the claim. The work product produced by DCAM's claims consultant and DCAM's subsequent negotiations with Suffolk reflect a lack of any substantial assessment of the legal merits or the costs included in Suffolk's claim. A draft of the report was provided to the newly appointed DCAM Commissioner  who had had no responsibility for the Computer Science Center project. In his written response to the draft report, the DCAM Commissioner acknowledged that the report contained a number of valid concerns. He assured the Office that the report findings would receive careful consideration as DCAM proceeded with the disposition of the claim and with future DCAM construction projects. ""The report was extremely thorough, and the process of reviewing the draft was very constructive for me and my staff. Your report contains a number of valid concerns, and I can assure you that the findings will be considered very carefully as we proceed with the disposition of this particular matter, and as we proceed on future projects.""  DCAM Commissioner response to draft IG report, February 2001  13   Lynn Wastewater Privatization In June 2001, the Office issued a report, entitled Privatization of Wastewater Facilities in Lynn, Massachusetts, on the procurement by the Lynn Water and Sewer Commission of two long-term design-build-operate (DBO) contracts: one for a combined sewer overflow (CSO) project and the other for a 20-year wastewater treatment plant.  Lawrence Water Treatment and Supply System Privatization RFP In July 2001, the City of Lawrence published a notice in the Central Register for a Request for Proposals (RFP) for capital improvements, operations, maintenance, and management services for its water treatment and supply system. The RFP was issued pursuant to Chapter 390 of the Acts of 2000, which required the City to conduct the procurement under M.G.L. c. 30B, with excepted sections. The RFP notice listed a fee of $7,500 to obtain the RFP. In response to an inquiry by the Office, the City advised the Office that the non-refundable fee was intended to allow the City to recoup not only the cost of reproducing the RFP, but also the cost of hiring a consultant engineer to compile and analyze data and to prepare various reports provided to prospective proposers in the RFP package. In late July 2001, the Office wrote to the Supervisor of Public Records in the Office of the Secretary of the Commonwealth, requesting an opinion as to: whether an RFP was a public record for purposes of the public records law, M.G.L. c. 66, and, if so, whether the public records law restricted the City to charging prospective proposers, or anyone else interested in obtaining the RFP package, only reasonable reproduction costs. In an August 2001 letter to the Supervisor of Public Records, the City Attorney explained that the $7,500 fee charged to all prospective proposers covered the costs incurred by the City in producing documents necessary for prospective proposers to submit competitive proposals, such as background documents, a survey of the water treatment plant site, and an asbestos report of the existing water treatment plant. The City Attorney's letter also noted that the background documents were provided to prospective proposers on CD-ROM. In September 2001, the Office wrote to the City regarding the RFP, which was similar in many respects to a wastewater privatization RFP issued in February 1999 by the Lynn Water and Sewer Commission and discussed  14   in the Office's June 2001 report entitled Privatization of Wastewater Facilities in Lynn, Massachusetts (discussed earlier in this section). The Office urged the City to take steps to protect its interests as it proceeded with its privatization plans. On February 19, 2002, the Acting Supervisor of Public Records issued an advisory opinion to the City regarding the $7,500 fee for copies of public records relating to the RFP. The opinion noted that the enabling legislation for the procurement did not provide for the City to attempt to recoup its costs of preparing the proposal documentation from all parties who requested the information. The opinion also stated that once a record exists, developmental costs cannot be assessed against future requesters of the information, and those individuals may only be assessed the actual reproduction costs of complying with their request. The Acting Supervisor's letter warned the City that failure to restructure the City's fees in conformity with the opinion would result in the issuance of an administrative order to do so.  Melrose Public Works Project In May 2001, the City of Melrose entered into an arrangement with a private contractor, Gator Development Corporation, Inc. (Gator), under which Modern Continental Construction Corporation (Modern Continental) would deliver almost 700,000 tons of fill excavated from the Central Artery/Third Harbor Tunnel (CA/T) Project to and provide related construction services at the Mount Hood Memorial Park and Golf Course (Mount Hood) in Melrose. The City subsequently entered into a formal contract with Gator Hood, LLC (Gator). The City's original intent was to use the fill, for which Gator agreed to pay the City $0.70 per ton, to construct playing fields and golf course improvements at Mount Hood. Under the City's contract with Gator, Gator was authorized to pay City vendors for site preparation work at Mount Hood with funds owed to the City under the contract. The Office's review of the project was still ongoing as of the end of 2001. However, during 2001 the Office wrote three letters to the City of Melrose regarding the fill delivery project. In July 2001, the Office learned that the City was preparing to pay a private contractor, Dami and Sons, approximately $170,000 for public works construction services reportedly performed at Mount Hood. Dami and Sons had previously been paid more than $47,000 for similar services. In response to the Office's inquiry, the City advised the Office that the City had not solicited competitive bids for any of the work performed by Dami and Sons. In a letter dated July 23, 2001, the Office advised the City that Massachusetts law prohibits payment by a governmental body for services rendered in violation of a public procurement law and, therefore, that the City should make no  15   further payments to Dami and Sons. In accordance with the Office's recommendation, the City made no further payments to Dami and Sons. On October 12, 2001, the Office wrote to the City regarding discrepancies in the City's records of the fill delivery project. The Office's review of records provided to this Office by the City showed that the City's calculations of the amount still owed by Gator were based on incomplete information. Moreover, based on the City's records of fill deliveries and payments made, the Office's analysis indicated that Gator owed the City more than the amount reported to the Office by the City. The Office's letter also highlighted a discrepancy between the City's fill delivery records provided to the Office and the CA/T Project's fill delivery records obtained by the Office. The Office recommended that the City review its fill delivery and payment records and take immediate steps to ensure that the City received full payment for all fill delivered to Mount Hood. Subsequently, at the City's request, the Office met on October 22, 2001 with the Mayor, the City Auditor, and the City Solicitor to provide a detailed explanation of the Office's analysis. In response to the Office's letter, Gator advised the City that the City's calculations had omitted more than $40,000 of Gator payments and provided documentation supporting its contention. The Office subsequently confirmed that the records provided to the Office by the City should have included the documentation provided by Gator and that the City's calculations should be adjusted to reflect these documents. On December 14, 2001, the Office sent a third letter to the City responding to a letter from Gator to the City advising the City of a $17,500 credit that Gator planned to assess against the City. According to Gator's letter, the CA/T Project had taken a $17,500 credit from Modern Continental against the quantity of fill excavated from the job site and delivered to Mount Hood; thus, Gator intended to reduce its payment to the City accordingly. However, the Office's review of the situation revealed that the CA/T Project credit from Modern Continental was unrelated to the delivery of fill to Mount Hood. CA/T Project officials advised the Office that the CA/T Project had erroneously made payments to Modern Continental under an unrelated pay item and that the credit represented an adjustment to correct this error. The adjustment, according to the CA/T Project officials, does not reduce the estimates of material delivered to Melrose and should have no impact on any calculation of payment due the City for receipt of fill. As of the end of 2001, the financial status of the City's contract with Gator remained unresolved.  16   MBTA Design-Build Construction of the Greenbush Line Corridor Project Chapter 125 of the Acts of 2000 authorized the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA) to undertake a pilot construction project using an alternative procurement process and required the MBTA to determine the procurement process in consultation with the Inspector General. Chapter 125 also required the Inspector General to comment in writing on the procurement process. In April 2001, the MBTA solicited the Office's comments on a preprocurement document entitled ""Transportation Improvements in the Greenbush Line Corridor - Procurement Process for Pilot Program,"" summarizing the procurement process proposed for the Greenbush Line Corridor Project. In an April 2001 letter, the Office provided the MBTA General Manager with detailed comments on and recommendations for improvement of the MBTA's proposed procurement procedures. For example, the Office recommended that a detailed description of the evaluation process be incorporated into the project request for qualifications; that the MBTA ensure sufficient documentation at each stage of the evaluation process; and that the MBTA limit the scope of the contract negotiations conducted with the selected team. In May 2001, the MBTA solicited the Office's comments on review drafts of a Request for Qualifications (RFQ) and Volumes I and II of a Request for Proposals (RFP) for design-build services for Transportation Improvements in the Greenbush Line Corridor. In a May 2001 letter to the MBTA, the Office offered the following comments: The procurement documents provided inadequate and inconsistent information regarding the scope of the contract, thereby creating the potential for confusion among proposers and for an unfair selection process. The vague evaluation criteria contained in the procurement documents provided little assurance that the process would be fair or that the selected team would be highly qualified to undertake this project. The omission from the RFP of explicit project performance requirements established by the MBTA was inconsistent with the design-build project delivery approach and exposed the MBTA to significant performance risks. The RFP procedures for determining the proposal offering ""best value"" were inconsistent, irrational, and unfair.  17   The MBTA's draft design-build contract contained provisions that could unnecessarily heighten the financial risks of this contract to the MBTA and state taxpayers. Variations in terminology among the procurement documents were likely to undermine fair competition by generating confusion and proposal disparities. ""The design-build project delivery method requires the project owner to relinquish design control to the design-builder and hold the design-builder accountable for project performance. The project performance standards established by the owner are thus of paramount importance in assuring the owner (and the public) that the completed facility will meet the owner's needs and expectations. However, [the] Office's review of the procurement documents identified few meaningful performance requirements or objectives.""  IG letter to MBTA, May 2001 The Office recommended against proceeding with the procurement process until the MBTA had reviewed and resolved the issues raised in the Office's letter. In response to the Office's comments, the MBTA noted that the document provided to the Office had been a working draft and that the MBTA had incorporated a number of the Office's suggestions into the final procurement documents. The Office's review of the final RFP confirmed that the MBTA had made numerous revisions in response to the Office's comments.  18   Operational Reviews Somerville Charter School Review In January 2001, the Office issued a report entitled Somerville Charter School: Management Issues and Recommendations. The report summarized the findings stemming from the Office's review of certain aspects of the Somerville Charter School's business operations previously identified by the Office as sources of risk. The Office's November 1999 report on 24 charter schools, entitled A Management Review of Commonwealth Charter Schools, had identified weaknesses in the Somerville Charter School's contracting practices, procurement procedures, and financial management. The Office's 2001 report disclosed that the Board of Trustees had provided inadequate governance of the School and oversight of its contract with its private management contractor, the Minnesota-based firm of SABIS Educational Systems, Inc. (SABIS Inc.) ""The Board's delegation of excessive financial control to SABIS Inc. has precluded meaningful Board control and oversight of the public funds that have been appropriated and designated for School operations.""  IG report, January 2001 The Office's report also found that the Board's contractual arrangement with SABIS Inc. had not enabled the Board to control, safeguard, or obtain full information regarding the School's finances. Specifically: The Board of Trustees had given SABIS Inc. excessive control over the School's operating funds. The School's management organization had impeded Board oversight of the SABIS Inc. contract and full Board access to essential School documents and information. The Board of Trustees had inappropriately ceded responsibility to SABIS Inc. for selecting and engaging the services of the School's auditor. The surplus provision contained in the School's 1996 contract with SABIS Inc. was disadvantageous to the School.  19   The Board's Finance Committee Chair and the Director of the School appeared to hold conflicting views of loan agreements between the School and SABIS Inc. Although the Board maintained detailed minutes of its regular meetings, it did not maintain records of its executive sessions. ""[S]trong, effective Board governance is essential to the School's long-term capacity to achieve its educational mission and to protect the interests of its students, their parents, and the taxpayers whose dollars fund the School.""  IG report, January 2001 The report offered a series of recommendations designed to strengthen the Board's capacity to oversee and control the School's business operations, including its contract with SABIS Inc. In a January 2001 response to a draft version of the report, the Board of Trustees noted that the State Department of Education had endorsed its charter and contract with SABIS Inc. The Board also expressed appreciation for the Office's review and recommendations and indicated that it planned to use the Office's report as a resource. ""We plan to continue our work providing quality educational services to students and believe that your report provides us with information that will assist us in our efforts.""  Response of Somerville Charter School Board of Trustees to draft IG report, January 2001 After the Office's report was released, the Somerville Charter School Board of Trustees took steps to separate the business and educational management functions of the School, according to an April 2002 letter to the Office from a Board Trustee. The Board hired an independent certified public accountant to provide financial advice and to perform the annual audit of the School; the Board also adopted written procedures to ensure the Board's compliance with the open meeting law. During the Board's contract negotiations with SABIS Inc., the Board proposed several changes to its management contract with SABIS Inc., including clear performance requirements for student achievement and clarification of the services included in the six percent management fee. In response, SABIS Inc. expressed disagreement with the proposal to incorporate academic performance requirements into the contract,  20   declined to specify the services included in the management fee, and pointed to SABIS Inc.'s financial investments in the School as justification for the contract provision allowing SABIS Inc. to retain the year-end surplus. In September 2001, the Board voted to turn over contract negotiations to the School's attorneys, to secure the School's funds, and to place limitations on SABIS Inc.'s ability to spend School funds pending the Board's review. According to the Board Trustee, SABIS Inc. rejected the Board's new financial controls, refused to abide by the terms of the Board's new financial policies, refused the Board and its representatives access to accounting and financial records of the school, demanded immediate payment of $1.4 million, and threatened lawsuits against the School. On November 20, 2001, the Board voted not to pursue contract negotiations with SABIS Inc. and to assume full responsibility for the business and educational management of the School as of December 1, 2001. Subsequently, the Board hired an interim Director of Business and Finance and assumed responsibility for the annual budget as well as financial reporting and control functions. ""[T]he Inspector General's report on the Somerville Charter School clearly identified serious management and financial issues that required immediate attention. The Board of Trustees had the unenviable task of trying to adhere to the recommendations of the Inspector General while negotiating with a recalcitrant vendor who was also its landlord. . . . The Board of Trustees of the Somerville Charter School appreciates the genuine concern shown by your office and appreciates your recommendations. We hope that other schools will be forewarned and forearmed by our experience.""  Letter from Somerville Charter School Trustee to IG, April 2002  Review of DOE Draft Fiscal Policies and Procedures Guide for Charter Schools At the request of the Department of Education (DOE), the Office conducted a brief review of a draft Recommended Fiscal Policies and Procedures Guide prepared by the DOE to assist charter schools in establishing sound financial controls and procedures. In a March 2001 letter to the DOE's charter school office, the Office provided comments and suggestions for strengthening portions of the draft Guide, including sections relating to internal control policies; policies related to assets, liabilities, and fund equity; procurement policies; consultant and contractor  21   services; and property and equipment acquisitions. The DOE subsequently issued the final version of the Recommended Fiscal Policies and Procedures Guide, which incorporated several of the Office's recommendations.  Update: SABIS International Charter School In November 2000, the Office issued SABIS International Charter School: Management Issues and Recommendations, a report detailing deficiencies in the business operations of the SABIS International Charter School in Springfield. Since 1995, the School had contracted with a private company, SABIS Educational Systems, Inc. (SABIS Inc.) to manage the School. The report found that the Board had not employed sound business and contract oversight practices in administering the School's financial relationship with SABIS Inc. during the first five years of School operations and that the new contract with SABIS Inc. negotiated by the Board would significantly increase the School's exposure to fraud, waste, and abuse. The report also found that the Board had not accurately documented its official actions and policies. Subsequently, in a December 2000 letter to the DOE Commissioner, the Office identified major flaws in a revised version, which DOE planned to approve, of the new contract between the School and SABIS Inc. The final contract approved by the Board of Education in March 2001 had been amended in several respects in response to the Office's recommendations: for example, the final contract explicitly stated that the management fee covered the cost of the contractor's off-site employees and required the contractor to document reimbursed expenses. However, the final contract  like the earlier version criticized by the Office  required the Board to negotiate the School's budget with the contractor, gave the contractor excessive control over the School's operating account, provided that the contractor would retain all surplus School funds, allowed the School and the contractor to renegotiate the contract without competition, contained no provisions governing internal controls, and provided that the name of the School would be The SABIS International Charter School.3 In an April 2002 letter to the Office, the Board's attorney advised the Office that the Board had instituted several administrative changes in response to the Office's November 2000 report. For example, it discontinued the practice of authorizing unspecified and undocumented ""corporate support"" payments to SABIS Inc. It also selected and engaged the services of an independent auditor rather than allowing SABIS Inc. to do so, and it hired an independent company to tape and transcribe meeting minutes. The 3  The Office had expressed the view that incorporating a trademark symbol or other corporate logo into the name of a public school was inappropriate. 22   Board's attorney also advised the Office that the Board had amended its student enrollment policy and no longer provided preferential treatment to the children of Board members. In April 2002, the Board's independent auditor wrote to the Board reporting that although the School continued to owe funds to SABIS Inc. on June 30 of every year, due to the reduction in the School's cash flow just prior to receipt of tuition payments from the state, the School's financial condition had steadily improved since 1998. The auditor also reported that several internal control deficiencies in the School's operations identified in the Office's November 2000 report had been corrected.  Update: Contractor Certification In 1998 and 2000, the Office issued reports identifying deficiencies in and recommending improvements to the Commonwealth's contractor certification system. The Division of Capital Asset Management (DCAM) administers the contractor certification system, which is intended to qualify contractors for public building projects and to screen out unqualified contractors. In January 2001, the Office sent a letter to DCAM commenting on the draft version of the Standard Contractor Evaluation Form, which DCAM had recently revised and improved. The Form is completed by awarding authorities and their project architects as part of the contractor certification process; the Form is also used by DCAM staff in conducting telephone interviews with awarding authorities and their project architects. Although the draft Form was responsive to the recommendations contained in the Office's 1998 and 2000 reports, the Office's letter offered several further corrections and suggestions for improvement. DCAM issued the final version of the form in June 2001.  23   This page intentionally left blank.  24   Central Artery/Third Harbor Tunnel Project Monitoring Dewey Square Air Intake Structure Under Section 56 of Chapter 235 of the Acts of 2000, no construction or contractual agreement for construction in connection with the ventilation buildings, utility facilities, and toll booths that are part of the Central Artery/Third Harbor Tunnel (CA/T) Project may begin prior to the review and approval of the Inspector General. During 1991, the Office completed a review of documents related to the $10.9 million Dewey Square Air Intake Structure, a planned three-story building that will provide fresh air supply and exhaust capabilities, and facilities for project control systems. The contract includes the building construction, supports for two ventilation fans, exterior site improvements, temporary street lighting, and maintaining the realigned Atlantic Avenue Bypass Roadway. In a May 2001 letter to the CA/T Project, the Office identified a number of concerns regarding cost, compliance, and planning. The problems disclosed by the Office's review did not merit withholding approval for the contract to proceed into construction and the Inspector General granted approval in May 2001. Nevertheless, the Office urged Project officials to address a number of troubling issues the Office identified as a result of this and previous reviews. The Office warned that if the Project persists in failing to adequately address these and related issues, the Office would consider withholding future approvals: Third-party changes/Architectural features. The Commonwealth assumed the financial risk of future joint development by paying an estimated $300,000 to design and soon to construct a feature (curved vault roof) that was included in the contract to conform with the needs of a specific joint development ""partner"" who may not be able to participate due to lack of funding. The Office expressed concern about the inclusion of architectural features to support plans for future development by third parties that may never materialize and recommended that Project management examine and control carefully the cost of design features for joint development purposes to ensure that public funds are not wasted. Life-cycle cost analysis. The Office's review disclosed no evidence that the Project completed a formal life-cycle cost analysis. Properly conducted life-cycle cost analyses identify all costs for acquisition, construction, operations, and maintenance of a facility for its useful life.  25   Knowing potential operations and maintenance costs also allows the operator to assess and plan for financing these future expenses. The Office recommended that Project staff prepare information pertaining to these costs and provide it to the Turnpike Authority staff charged with managing CA/T-related functions and financing. Contract drawings. The Office criticized the Project, as it has in the past, for failing to comply with the requirements of the Massachusetts Board of Registration for Professional Engineers. The Office also identified errors and inconsistencies in the drawings and urged the Project to correct the problems. Construction interface/Access restraints. The Office expressed concern about the potential for added costs due to contract interface and site access restraints, in part because connecting the air intake structure would be performed under a different contract. The Project has incurred additional costs due to coordination problems in the past. The Office noted that prudent action by the Project, such as efficient site coordination and construction sequencing, would prevent costly delay claims and reduce the risk of change orders caused by additional mobilization and other delay-related costs incurred by the contractor. Claims avoidance review. As a result of the Office's inquiry, Project staff purport to have completed this type of review, which aims to mitigate changes and disputes arising from complex design and construction contract interdependencies. Aggressive cost control should include claims avoidance reviews before bids are opened, not afterwards as occurred on this contract. The Office also noted that the Project had not provided documents to the Office in a timely manner and had not yet complied with certain notification requirements under M.G.L. c. 149.  Cost Recovery Program Review In December 2000, the Office issued a report entitled A Review of the Central Artery/Tunnel Project Cost Recovery Program. In general, ""cost recovery"" is the process by which owners file claims against design and construction management professionals for the costs claimed to be attributable to design errors, omissions, or other unsatisfactory performance. This report assessed whether the Project had developed an independent and viable program, whether staff adhered to procedures, and whether the Project pursued objectives in a prudent and timely manner. The report found that the CA/T Project's cost recovery program showed systemic vulnerabilities to waste and abuse and that the program had recovered only $30,000 of the $80+ million in identified cost recovery  26   related change orders. No cost recovery claim had ever been successfully pursued against B/PB. CA/T Project management concurred with many of the report findings concerning program neglect and inadequate documentation. Notwithstanding CA/T Project management's strenuous objections to many other findings and conclusions, the Office was pleased to note some evidence of steps taken to remedy the problems documented in the report. During 2001, the Office continued to monitor the cost recovery program and cost recovery issues. In June 2001, the Massachusetts Turnpike Authority Board, which oversees the CA/T Project, voted to change the procedures for reviewing and processing contractor claims and CA/T Project change orders. The Office has been reviewing the implementation of the proposed changes, which should improve the cost recovery program.  Request for Qualifications and Proposal (RFQ/P) for Audit Services on CA/T Professional Services Contracts In January 2001, Project staff requested the Office's assistance in developing an RFQ/P for selecting certified public accountant firms to perform federally required audits on millions of dollars in CA/T Project consultant contracts. The request emanated, in part, from the Office's earlier criticism of the flawed audit services procurement and a troubling backlog of audit work. The Office had urged Project management to ensure the organizational independence of the audit function and to aggressively pursue recovery of overpayments to consultants. During February 2001, Project managers provided a rough draft of the RFQ/P to the Office and briefed Office staff on their concerns and objectives in procuring professional audit services. Project staff invited input to help ensure that the RFQ/P appropriately articulated the services required and established a fair and justifiable ranking system. A subsequent draft reflected the Project's efforts to incorporate the Office's recommendations. For example, it required respondents to submit all questions in writing, and required that the proposed project manager and key personnel play a major role at the interviews. In April 2001, the Project provided a newly revised draft of the RFQ/P and requested additional assistance in ensuring that the scope and evaluation criteria are appropriate, fair, complete, and clear. In response, the Office provided more than two dozen suggestions, including more rigorous qualification and experience requirements, provisions for bimonthly status reports, and evidence to demonstrate a history of meeting high performance standards. The Office indicated its willingness to provide additional assistance as needed.  27   Bechtel/Parsons Brinkerhoff Accountability Bechtel/Parsons Brinkerhoff (B/PB) is the state's management consultant responsible for administering the CA/T project. In October 2001, the Office sent a joint letter with the State Auditor to the Board of Directors of the Massachusetts Turnpike Authority. This letter supported the Board's initiative to hold B/PB accountable for its share of responsibility for Big Dig cost overruns. The two offices also offered assistance to the Board for this initiative to recover from B/PB every dollar it owes to the citizens of the Commonwealth. ""We support your initiative to hold B/PB accountable for its share of responsibility for Big Dig cost overruns...B/PB's recent refusal to acknowledge any responsibility for or share in the burden of paying for increasing Project cost overruns is irresponsible and unconscionable.""  Joint letter from Acting Inspector General and State Auditor to the Turnpike Authority Chairman, October 2001 The two offices stated that B/PB was seeking to evade responsibility for the multi-billion dollar cost overruns and to place the entire cost on the tax payers and turnpike users. The two offices stated their mutual intention to obtain previously undisclosed financial information from B/PB to assist in cost recovery actions against B/PB. Since 1990 both offices have reported numerous times that B/PB's contract mismanagement, deficient practices, and poor performance have led to the Project's increased costs. It is unlikely that on the largest and most complex public works project in United States history, B/PB has never made a mistake or failed to meet its contractual obligations. If B/PB has made errors or breached its contract, the Commonwealth should pursue compensation.  CA/T Project Oversight Coordination Commission In October 1996, pursuant to Section 2B of the July 1996 Transportation Bond Bill, the Inspector General, Attorney General, and State Auditor submitted the Supplemental Plan creating the CA/T Project Oversight Coordination Commission (the Commission) to the Legislature. The Supplemental Plan is a scaled-down version of the comprehensive oversight plan the three offices submitted in November 1995 in response to an earlier legislative directive. Both plans provided for joint oversight of the Project, combining the expertise and legal authority of the three offices to identify cost-saving measures; target management difficulties that invite fraud, waste, and abuse; and pursue enforcement and recoupment actions against  28   contractors engaged in fraud or other unlawful activity. The original plan had requested an annual budget of $2.8 million plus one-time start-up costs and increases for inflation. The Legislature authorized $2 million for an unspecified period of time for a scaled-down version of the earlier plan. In keeping with the multi-agency teamwork envisioned by the Supplemental Plan, the Inspector General agreed to absorb administrative expenses and staff support for the Commission. Providing office space and equipment to the Commission has consumed a significant portion of the Office's oversight budget and staff each year since 1997. Beginning in Fiscal Year 2002, the Commission's member agencies have agreed to share the Commission's expenses. The Legislature recognized the need for additional oversight by providing an additional $1 million in the Transportation Bond Bill enacted on July 31, 2000. In an effort to foster information sharing, the bill directed the Commission to submit a report detailing its oversight activities and any resulting savings to the Commonwealth. The report is to be submitted on a quarterly basis to the House and Senate Committees on Ways and Means, the Secretary of Administration and Finance, and the Joint Committee on Transportation. The Commission's September 2001 Summary Report contained a detailed description of Commission and individual member activities. ""The CA/T Project has entered its peak construction period and is now spending about $100 million each month. According to the CA/T Project, the estimated cost of the CA/T Project now exceeds $14.475 billion. Because of the large CA/T Project cost overruns and apparent lack of public confidence in CA/T Project management, a focused and proactive oversight presence is crucial, especially as the CA/T Project moves toward completion.""  Acting Inspector General, State Auditor, and Attorney General letter accompanying third summary report of the CA/T Project Oversight Coordination Commission, September 2001 The following are examples of initiatives that meet the objectives originally cited in the Supplemental Plan. The Office of the Attorney General has been investigating allegations first raised in this Office's report A History of Central Artery/Tunnel Finances 1994-2001. The Office of the Attorney General has been gathering and reviewing subpoenaed documents in connection with this matter. The Office of the Attorney General has  29   benefited from the assistance of the Inspector General staff during this review. In the spirit of cooperation and coordination envisioned by the framers of the Commission, the Inspector General assigned engineering staff to assist the State Auditor. Certain complainant allegations required an engineer's perspective and analysis. The Office notified the State Auditor's staff of its findings in January 2001. The Office was able to supplement the State Auditor's staff efforts and save the State Auditor the time-consuming and potentially costly job of contracting separately for the engineering expertise. Senior staff of the three member agencies continued to meet monthly throughout 2001 to discuss the activities of each of their offices and to share case and Project information. Four times in 2001, the Commission invited members of the Legislature to meetings aimed at coordinating oversight activities, exchanging information (including the progress of legislation), and ensuring that the Commission properly included legislative concerns in its agenda. The Commission continued to pursue another item that was included in the Supplemental Plan: coordination with federal oversight agencies with an interest in the Project. The U.S. Department of Transportation Inspector General launched an inquiry into the allegations made by this Office in the report A History of Project Finances 1994-2001. The Office has cooperated with federal officials and provided information as appropriate.  Air Rights Development on the Central Artery Corridor In June 2001, the Office sent a letter to the Chairmen of the Central Artery Corridor Commission regarding air rights development on the Central Artery Corridor. The Office's letter noted that the law did not require the Massachusetts Turnpike Authority to conduct an open, fair, and competitive process when it selected private developers for the air rights above the Corridor. ""The public deserves a fair deal - and a good deal - when MassPike leases these valuable assets to private developers.""  IG letter to the Central Artery Corridor Commission, June 2001 While the Office did not dispute the Authority's rights in air space over land that it owned, the purpose of the Office's letter was to ensure that the public interest was adequately safeguarded in any disposition process  30   where potential revenues were likely to be significant. The Office urged the Corridor Commission to require a fair, open, and competitive process for the disposition of air rights in the Central Artery Corridor as well as the Central Artery North Area and the Ted Williams Tunnel.  31   This page intentionally left blank.  32   Real Estate Dealings The Office reviews a variety of real property transactions each year to ensure that the public interest is adequately protected. In addition, the Legislature frequently mandates that the Office review and approve independent appraisals of real property interests being conveyed or acquired by the state, counties, and municipalities. The Office provides a report on each appraisal to the Commissioner of the Division of Capital Asset Management (DCAM) for submission to the House and Senate Committees on Ways and Means and the Joint Committee on State Administration. The Office also reviews and comments on the release deeds and agreements effecting the conveyances.  Review of the Greylock Center Project In December 2000, the Office received complaints regarding the proposed disposition of state property in Greylock Glen to Greylock Management Associates, L.P. (GMA) pursuant to a draft Land Disposition Agreement (LDA) and a Master Lease. The Office undertook a limited review of certain aspects of the Greylock Center project dating back to the 1996 developer selection process conducted by the Department of Environmental Management (DEM). In June 2001, the Office issued a report on the Greylock Center Project. The Office's findings supported the Acting Governor's decision, announced two weeks earlier, to cancel the project. The Office's major findings were as follows: The partners in GMA were not the same as those proposed by GMA and accepted by the Commonwealth in 1996, and they lacked the qualifications of the selected team members. Four of the five general development partners named in GMA's 1996 proposal and selected by DEM to develop the project had never executed the GMA partnership agreement, had had no substantial involvement in the project in recent years, and reportedly had no plans to become partners of GMA. Moreover, the current GMA partnership bore little resemblance to and lacked the qualifications of the original partnership proposed by GMA and selected by DEM. The terms of the development plan for the Greylock Center differed substantially from the terms proposed by GMA and accepted by the Commonwealth in 1996. The financing plan for Greylock Center substantially increased the Commonwealth's financial  33   commitment from the funding and terms proposed by GMA and accepted by the Commonwealth in 1996. At the same time, the draft LDA and Master Lease did not assure the Commonwealth that the major components of the project would ever be completed. DEM selected GMA as the Greylock Center developer despite incomplete and inadequate information regarding GMA's financial capacity. The Office found that GMA did not provide the required financial information, that DEM did not obtain required disclosures of legal and administrative actions pertaining to GMA team members, that DEM did not obtain information concerning the level of commitment to the project of each general development partner proposed by GMA, and that DEM's due diligence efforts produced no meaningful information regarding GMA's financial capacity. The project records reviewed by the Office showed that DEM officials and others invested substantial time in planning and supporting the progress of the Greylock Center project between 1996 and 2001. These records reflected DEM's commitment to developing a project that promotes local and regional economic development in a manner that was environmentally responsible and sustainable. In hindsight, however, it was clear that many of the problems that arose during the five-year period since GMA was selected could have been avoided had DEM exercised greater care at key points during the developer selection process. ""Over the years, [the] Office has repeatedly witnessed how difficult it is for public officials to walk away from well-intentioned public-private undertakings that turn out to be bad deals for the public. It is particularly difficult to do so when, as is the case of the Greylock Center project, a community's long-held hopes and expectations are bound up in the project's vision.""  IG letter to DEM Commissioner, June 2001 In June 2001, the DEM Commissioner wrote a letter advising GMA that, based on the Office's findings, it was no longer feasible for DEM to continue to work with GMA on implementation of the Greylock Center project.  Former Belchertown State School Appraisal of Parcels D and E Pursuant to Chapter 353 of the Acts of 1996, the Office reviewed the independent appraisal of Parcels D and E situated on the former Belchertown State School land. In a January 2001 letter to the DCAM Commissioner, the Office approved the methodology used to determine the market values for Parcel D ($280,000) and Parcel E ($290,000) and  34   therefore concluded that the full and fair market value of the parcels to be conveyed by the Commonwealth was $570,000.  Emerson College Easements Chapter 121 of the Acts of 1999 required the Office to review and approve an appraisal of proposed temporary and permanent easements to be granted to Emerson College comprising a portion of Allen's Alley on state land adjacent to the State Transportation Building in Boston. This appraisal involved a unique situation with respect to the site's location and its assemblage value to Emerson College, since development sites for Emerson to expand its Majestic Theatre were limited by the school's special needs and location. In a March 2001 letter to the DCAM Commissioner, the Office approved the appraisal's determination of $1,980,000 as the market value of the easements.  Piano Row Access Easement Pursuant to Chapter 131 of the Acts of 1999, the Office reviewed an appraisal for an access easement to benefit Piano Row LLC, which proposed to construct a 100-unit luxury residential condominium complex on a 14,889 square foot parcel abutting the Service Court owned by the State Transportation Building. The proposed easement area would provide access to off-street loading facilities and a 110-space underground garage providing valet services for the occupants at the Piano Row residences. This access easement would also allow Piano Row LLC full income-generating commercial use of the Boylston Street frontage of the Piano Row development, rather than forfeiting approximately 30 feet of frontage to accommodate access to an underground parking garage directly from Boylston Street. Retail and restaurant space in this area of Boston are leased at premium prices. Condominiums above the tree line adjacent to the Boston Common have sold in excess of $1,300 per square foot. Individually owned parking spaces are assessed for $40,000+. The Office determined that this appraisal which determined the value of the easement to be $160,000, warranted a departure from standard appraisal guidelines, given this unique easement. In the Office's view, the appraiser should have considered the economic impact of the loss of commercial lease space on Boylston Street and the potential physical nuisance an entrance to a 110-space parking garage would create by physically limiting the State Transportation Building's Service Court area. In a May 2001 letter to the DCAM Commissioner, the Office rejected the methodology utilized in the appraisal.  35   Chicopee Land Pursuant to Chapter 210 of the Acts of 2000, the Office reviewed the appraisal of two parcels of land containing approximately 20.58 acres owned by the City of Chicopee. The Commonwealth anticipated purchasing these parcels from the City to construct a regional women's correctional facility to be operated by the Hamden County Sheriff's Office. The appraiser used the sales comparison approach to determine the market value of 18 acres of land and 2.2 acres of land. The appraiser estimated the land area value for the larger parcel at 25 cents per square foot resulting in a total value of $200,000 for 799,979.40 square feet of land. The appraiser also determined the land area value for the smaller parcel at $1.25 per square foot, resulting in a total value of $120,600 for 96,485.40 square feet of land. The smaller parcel was improved with a regional dog control facility. The appraiser used the cost approach procedure to estimate the replacement value of the improvement. The construction costs per square foot less accrued depreciation was calculated. The final depreciated market value of the facility was projected at $1,019,406. The Office determined that the appraisal of the total market value of the subject property was $320,000 for the two parcels of land and $1,019,400 for the improvement, resulting in a total value of $1,340,000. In a June 2001 letter, the Office approved the methodology and final value determination of this appraisal of the subject property.  Ipswich Land Pursuant to Chapter 410 of the Acts of 2000, the Department of Environmental Management (DEM) awarded two appraisal contracts to determine the market value of a 40-acre parcel of unimproved land located in the Town of Ipswich. DEM was authorized to purchase the subject property for assemblage purposes to expand the Willowdale State Forest. Section 4 of the Chapter required the Office to review and approve an appraisal and examine the appraiser's methodology and submit its report to DCAM. According to the two appraisals, the parcel was assessed for $335,800 for fiscal year 2000. The local assessor confirmed that the owners had applied for a tax abatement and reduced assessment after a valuation of $417,400 was assessed in fiscal year 1998. According to the purchase and sale agreement between the owners and the Commonwealth, the agreed upon sales price was $2,500,000. Due to the rural nature of the subject property neighborhood and its lack of negative influence, the first appraisal suggested that the highest and best use of the property would be a unique, high-end residential development  36   ($600,000 - $750,000 homes). The appraisal noted that the 40-acre parcel is under agreement for an undisclosed amount. The estimated market value was based upon review of the ""conditionally approved"" Definitive Plan of the site to support 28 lots. The appraiser used the Development Approach to estimate the market value of the subject property. After estimating gross sales, development costs, and a discounting process, the appraiser indicated a market value of $2,350,000. The second appraisal report also determined that the highest and best use of the subject property would be a 28-lot subdivision serving an upscale sector of the local real estate market. This appraisal included a sales comparison approach to value and an income capitalization methodology (development or subdivision technique) to estimate the market value of the 40-acre parcel. The appraisal considered the income capitalization approach to be the primary valuation method. The sales comparison approach produced a value range of $2,380,000 - $2,650,000 and the income capitalization approach estimate was $2,380,000. The final estimate was rounded to $2,400,000. In a June 2001 letter to the DCAM Commissioner, the Office approved the methodologies utilized and the final estimated market values of the two appraisals.  Former Danvers State Hospital Land Pursuant to Chapter 180 of the Acts of 1997, the Office reviewed three independent appraisals of approximately 75 acres on the former Danvers State Hospital site. The road network divides the subject property into Lot 2A (the Highlands) and Lots 7 and 9 (the Lowlands). DCAM instructed the appraisers to use a hypothetical assumption and value the Danvers site as vacant - no improvements exist - and to estimate the market value in conformity with the as-of-right uses. The Highlands and Lowlands sites were available for redevelopment and the zoning as-of-right uses for the site were restrictive, essentially limiting development to either health care, elder care, educational, or agricultural uses. One appraisal report used the sales comparison approach to determine a market value of $8,750,000 for the larger Highlands land for the multifamily development that it could support. A market value of $1,280,000 was reached for proposed low-rise office development on the Lowlands land. The Office approved the methodology and final estimate of market value of $10,030,000 for the 75-acre site. The second appraisal also utilized the sales comparison approach to value the Danvers site. This appraisal, in accordance with DCAM's instructions, only considered the uses allowed as-of-right for the zoning district. In the appraisal, adjustments were made for land encumbered by wetlands or  37   non-usable due to site topography features or legal issues. The appraiser estimated the market value of the Highlands parcel at $8,930,000 and the two smaller Lowlands parcels at $1,980,000 and $1,970,000. The Office also approved this appraisal methodology and final estimate of market value of $12,900,000 for the site. The third appraisal also utilized the sales comparison approach to value the site and pointed out that consideration was given to only those zoning uses allowed by right and the hypothetical assumption that the subject property was vacant. The appraiser determined a $6,900,000 market value estimate without separately considering market values for the distinct Highlands and Lowlands areas. The Office also approved this appraisal methodology and final estimate of market value for the site. In an August 2001 letter to the Commissioner of DCAM, the Office approved all three appraisal methodologies and determined the average of these three independent appraisals was $9,943,333.  Former J.T. Berry Center Pursuant to Chapter 271 of the Acts of 1998, as amended by Chapter 7, 4 of the Acts of 2001, the Office reviewed the independent appraisal of approximately 87 acres at the former J.T. Berry Center site. The appraisal report described the subject property as a large parcel located in the Town of North Reading with a small portion of the parcel located in the Town of Wilmington. The site had numerous development issues including secondary roadway access, lack of municipal sewer service, wetlands, probable site contamination, and necessary demolition of abandoned structures. According to the report, the Commonwealth had alerted potential developers of these issues through its RFP process. The report depicts the former J.T. Berry Center site as zoned for industrial/office use. The appraiser believed that development potential for the site was financially feasible and could support 875,000 square feet of multi-story office/research/development buildings without structured parking while still allowing for adequate parking and open space. The appraiser utilized a sales comparison approach to estimate a market value of $12,500,000 for the property. In an August 2001 letter to the DCAM Commissioner, the Office approved the appraisal methodology and final value determination for the site.  Silver Lake Regional School District Property Pursuant to Chapter 6 of the Acts of 2000, the Silver Lake Regional School District (District) notified the Department of Education (DOE) of its approval of the withdrawal of the Town of Pembroke from the District. The  38   Act authorized the District to sell two District-owned schools to the Town of Pembroke for a price not to exceed the appraised value of the two parcels. Chapter 6 required the Office to review and approve the two appraisals of the real properties located in Pembroke that are identified as the current and former Silver Lake Regional District Junior High School (SLRJHS) parcels. The 46.14 acre Learning Lane parcel included the current SLRJHS building and various athletic fields and tennis courts. The sales comparison approach was used to determine the $900,000 value of the land as vacant. The cost approach was used to determine the overall value of this special use property. The appraiser estimated the total value of the land and improvements to have a rounded value of $23,300,000. The 38.96 acre School Street parcel included the former SLRJHS building and various athletic fields and asphalt pavement. The sales comparison approach was used to determine the $546,000 value of the land as vacant. The cost approach was used to determine the overall value for this special use property. The appraiser estimated the total value of the land and improvements to have a rounded value of $10,780,000. In correspondence to the Office, counsels representing the Town of Pembroke and the Silver Lake Regional School District stated that the Town and the District agreed that the Town would pay the District the aggregate price of $11,900,000 for the purchase and conveyance of the two SLRJHS parcels. The letter noted that this purchase price paid would not exceed the appraised value of the two properties. In an August 2001 letter to the DOE Commissioner, the Office approved the methodologies used in the two appraisals of the SLRJHS parcels.  Billerica Land Pursuant to Chapter 181 of the Acts of 2000, the Office reviewed appraisals of two parcels of land located in the Town of Billerica. The appraiser stated that the scope of the appraisals was to determine the fee simple, fair market value of the properties according to their statutorily restricted uses. The sales comparison valuation methodology was utilized in each appraisal to estimate the value of the land as the primary component of each parcel's worth. The appraiser found a sufficient number of prior conveyances of land between governmental entities to be used as comparables. The comparables are used to determine value estimates in accordance with the Act's limited future uses of the subject parcels. The subject property in one appraisal included approximately 5.82 acres of land located at 240 Treble Cove Road. According to the Act, the Town  39   was authorized to transfer this site to the Commonwealth for use by Middlesex County's Sheriff's Department. This appraisal report determined that the market value of this parcel as restricted for use by the Sheriff's Department, was $1,600,000. The second appraisal was Commonwealth-owned land located off the River Street Extension in Billerica. This site contains approximately 66 acres of land and was improved with an obsolete sewer treatment plant for the Massachusetts Correctional Facility at Billerica and a local animal shelter. According to the Act, the Commonwealth is authorized to transfer this site to the Town for a water treatment facility. This appraisal report determined that the market value of this parcel, as restricted for use by the Town for a water treatment facility, is $2,800,000. Chapter 181 contained language stating that if the market value of the Town-owned parcel was less than the value of the Commonwealth's land, the Town was required to pay the difference. The Office determined that the State land was worth $1,200,000 more than the Town's property. The Act addressed this potential and authorized the Commissioner to determine that the consideration paid may be less than fair market value provided there was a written disclosure in the Central Register detailing the reasons for such a decision. In a September 2001 letter to the DCAM Commissioner, the Office approved the methodologies and final market value estimates contained in the two appraisal reports.  40   Local Government Procurement Assistance and Enforcement The Office of the Inspector General provides extensive technical assistance to local government officials regarding Massachusetts public procurement laws. The Office encourages effective and ethical public purchasing by local governments by providing training and professional development; publishing manuals, a quarterly Procurement Bulletin, and other publications; and answering inquiries, complaints, and protests. The Office also formulates policy on M.G.L. c. 30B, the local procurement law that applies to supplies, services, equipment, and real property.  Training and Professional Development The Office created and administers the Massachusetts Certified Public Purchasing Official (MCPPO) program, established in 1997 and discussed in the next section of this report. The Office designed the MCPPO program to develop the capacity of public purchasing officials to operate effectively and promote excellence in public procurement. During 2001, in addition to the seminars provided as part of the MCPPO program, the Office provided speakers on public procurement laws at conferences and seminars sponsored by the Massachusetts Collectors and Treasurers Association; the Massachusetts Association of School Business Officials; the Massachusetts Association of Public Procurement Officials; the Association of Government Accountants; the Norfolk, Bristol, and Middlesex Counties Highway Association; the Massachusetts Chapter of the National Association of Housing and Redevelopment Authorities; and the Massachusetts Firefighting Academy. Presentation topics included ""An Overview of the Public Bidding Laws,"" ""An Introduction to M.G.L. c. 30B and the Compensating Balance Law,"" ""The Changes to the Public Bidding Laws Enacted in July 2000,"" and ""An Overview of M.G.L. c. 30B"" at the Annual New Fire Chiefs Orientation.  Publications The Office publishes a wide range of materials designed to educate and inform local procurement officials, provide guidance on best value contracting, and disseminate lessons learned. All publications listed in this section are available from the Office's website: www.mass.gov/ig. In 2001, the Office published four issues of the Procurement Bulletin, a newsletter distributed to approximately 5,400 procurement officials and  41   other interested parties across the state. Launched by the Office in 1994, the Procurement Bulletin summarizes current procurement-related news and issues, addresses frequently asked questions about M.G.L. c. 30B, provides legislative updates, and highlights special topics in procurement. In 2001, for example, the Procurement Bulletin included articles on collective purchasing agreements, using vendor-supplied invitations for bids (IFBs), use of ordered alternates, and prevailing wage updates. In prior years, the Procurement Bulletin has featured articles pertaining to the policy regarding late bids, changes in the public procurement laws, handling exempt supplies and services procurements, information technology procurements, drafting performance specifications, bid protest avoidance tips, and consumer protection resources. Current and past issues of the Procurement Bulletin can be downloaded from the Office's website. Other Office procurement publications available from the Office's website include: Municipal, County, District, and Local Authority Procurement of Supplies, Services, and Real Property. This manual, which was updated in 2000, provides a comprehensive overview of M.G.L. c. 30B and a step-by-step guide to using M.G.L. c. 30B to obtain best value in procuring supplies and services, disposing of surplus supplies, acquiring and disposing of real property, and procuring small construction-related contracts. Designing and Constructing Public Facilities. This manual, which was updated in 2000 to incorporate legislative changes enacted in July 2000, provides detailed information on the statutory requirements governing procurement of design and construction services; it also offers practical advice for public officials who manage or oversee public construction projects. Practical Guide to Drafting Invitations for Bids and Requests for Proposals. This guide, which was updated in 2000, includes general tips for writing IFBs and requests for proposals (RFPs), a model IFB, and instructions on how to modify that model to create an RFP.  Inquiries, Complaints, and Protests In 2001, the Office responded to 2,234 inquiries about M.G.L. c. 30B and other public bidding laws, resulting in over 3,371 telephone calls. The Office's team of procurement attorneys regularly advises purchasing  42   officials on how to obtain best value and increase competition for public contracts. The team also responds to requests from local officials, aggrieved bidders, and concerned citizens by reviewing bid and proposal documents for compliance with M.G.L. c. 30B. The Office uses an informal dispute resolution process to resolve bid protests fairly and efficiently without litigation. The remainder of this section presents examples of various types of local procurement reviews completed by the Office during 2001. City of Boston - Request for Guidance. The Office issued a written opinion in response to a request from the Boston Finance Committee to suggest changes in the Boston School Department's procurement procedures for student transportation services. The Office observed that the City's customary garaging requirements might give an incumbent an unfair advantage because it already had facilities deemed acceptable by the City. The Office suggested that one way to improve competition would be for the City to provide the garaging facilities and make the property available to any successful bidder. The issue of restrictive garaging requirements arises in many communities' procurement of school bus services. The Office also recommended that the City consider whether a longer-term contract (it was proposed as a two-year contract) would allow more vendors to amortize expenses over a long enough period to make it economically feasible to bid. ""One way to generate competition and create a true level playing field is for the City to provide the garaging facilities and make the property available to the successful bidder. By doing this, the City removes a major obstacle in generating competition.""  IG letter to Boston Finance Committee, December 2001 City of Gloucester - Request for Guidance. The City of Gloucester inquired as to whether it could lease City-owned real property to a nonprofit museum group for a 99-year term. The City also asked whether such a lessee would be subject to M.G.L. c. 30B after entering into a real property lease with the City. The City was informed that the leasing of property to a non-profit entity is subject to the requirements of Section 16 of M.G.L. c. 30B. These include a declaration of the availability of the property, establishment of reuse restrictions, and a determination of the value of the interest in real property that will be subject to disposition. If the value of the lease is expected to be in excess of $25,000, a competitive RFP process must be conducted. The Office advised the City that M.G.L. c. 30B, 16 is silent relative to lease term length, but other state and local rules (e.g., M.G.L. c. 40, 3) contain specific restrictions. A  43   lessee of municipal property would be subject to M.G.L. c. 30B only if it met the statutory definition of a ""governmental body"". Town of Milford - Request for Guidance. The Town asked for guidance in determining whether the Milford Geriatric Authority (MGA) was an entity subject to M.G.L. c. 30B. The Office determined that the MGA is a governmental body subject to the requirements of M.G.L. c. 30B. The Office referenced the five-factor test articulated by the Supreme Judicial Court in Globe Newspaper Company v. Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority Retirement Board, 416 Mass. 1007 (1993) in determining that MGA was a public rather than a private entity for purposes of determining the applicability of M.G.L. c. 30B. Based on that test the Office examines the means by which an entity is created, the extent to which it performs an essentially governmental function, the involvement of public funds, the involvement of private interests, and the extent of control and supervision exercised by governmental officials or agencies over the agency. Town of Bernardston - Bid Protest. The Office received a bid protest regarding the procurement of sand by the Bernardston Highway Department. The Town of Bernardston had been part of a regional collaborative bid for sand but chose to obtain its own price quotations, apart from the collaborative bids. A jurisdiction may choose to do its own competitive process rather than take advantage of a collaborative bid provided that the arrangement between the jurisdiction and collaborative and the IFB permit separate procurements. The Office determined that in exercising its right to do an independent quotation solicitation, the Town did not award the contract to the responsive and responsible vendor that had submitted the lowest price quotation. The Town official responsible for the procurement process reported that he had awarded the contract to a higher-priced vendor with which the Town had previously done business and whose product they found satisfactory. There had been no finding that the lower-priced vendor was not responsive or not responsible. Accordingly, the Town's procurement was found to be invalid and, pursuant to M.G.L. c. 30B,  17(b), it was determined that no further payments could be made to the vendor to which the contract had been awarded. City of Haverhill--Request for Guidance. The City requested guidance on issues related to the disposition of the municipally owned Hale Hospital and related parcels of real estate. The City had conducted an initial RFP process for the disposition of the hospital that had mentioned but not expressly incorporated two nearby parcels of property. When a respondent to that RFP indicated that its proposal needed to encompass the related parcels, the City raised the issue of whether those parcels could be incorporated into the parcels to be awarded. The Office found that adding a parcel of property subsequent to the original solicitation  44   process would violate the bidding procedures established in Section 16 of M.G.L. c. 30B. The Office advised the City that it would need to conduct a separate proposal process for the parcels in question. Subsequently the City conducted a separate disposition, which generated price proposals that exceeded the price the City would have received for the parcels under the original process and significantly exceeded the minimum price established in its new solicitation. ""Adding a parcel of property subsequent to the original solicitation is clearly an abrogation of M.G.L. c. 30B bidding procedures. Since all components of the present disposition were never offered publicly, it remains open to speculation whether the City could have entered into a more favorable deal.""  IG letter to City of Haverhill, August 2001  45   This page intentionally left blank.  46   The MCPPO Program The Office of the Inspector General has continued and expanded the Massachusetts Certified Public Purchasing Official (MCPPO) program, now in its fifth year. Since 1997, MCPPO seminars have been attended by more than 4,100 participants from local and state government. The MCPPO program promotes excellence in public procurement by fostering: cost-effective, ethical, and modern purchasing practices; dialogue and exchange of ideas and best practices among procurement officials; stewardship of resources in the public's interest; and compliance with Massachusetts contracting laws. The MCPPO program is an integral component of the Office's prevention strategy. Devoting resources to build the capacity of public purchasing officials to operate effectively, efficiently, and ethically is vastly preferable to relying on post audits and investigations to detect fraud, waste, and abuse. Public purchasing officials are responsible for procuring the supplies, services, and facilities government requires to provide public services. These procurements involve massive expenditures of public funds. The need for government to invest in expertise for this function is especially great now, for the following reasons: With government reinvention and reform, many jurisdictions are granting greater flexibility and discretion to purchasing officials, who are expected to be innovative and use ""best value"" procurement methods. Procurement officials are increasingly called upon to handle nontraditional procurements (including service contracting, privatization, performance contracting, and public-private partnerships) and must deal with rapidly changing markets, such as the deregulated electricity market and the information technology market. The public has a negative perception of public procurement because of the defense procurement scandals of the 1980s, widely reported failures of procurement systems, and periodic ethical lapses by government officials.  47   ""Excellent trainings - well worth the time and effort. All questions get answered - presenters are very knowledgeable and keep classes moving.""  2001 Supplies and Services Contracting seminar participant The MCPPO program and the individual seminars that comprise the program were developed with the assistance of an advisory group comprised of representatives of the Massachusetts Public Purchasing Officials Association, the Massachusetts Association of School Business Officials, and the City Solicitors and Town Counsel Association. The MCPPO program has been designed to meet standards of national organizations. In 1997, the National Association of State Boards of Accountancy (NASBA) registered the Office of the Inspector General as a sponsor of continuing professional education. Registration by NASBA allows the Office to award Continuing Professional Education (CPE) credits for participation in MCPPO seminars. In addition, the Office met the requirements of the International Association for Continuing Education and Training as an authorized sponsor of continuing education units (CEU). Seminars also qualify for professional development points (PDP) required of school business administrators under the state's education reform act. In 1998, the College Credit Recommendation Program of the American Council on Education recommended the MCPPO courses for undergraduate and graduate credit. In June 2000, the Office became a registered provider of continuing education for the American Institute of Architects Continuing Education System (AIA/CES). AIA members who participate in MCPPO program courses will receive continuing education credit from the AIA. The program's seminars, presented in several different locations around the state, attracted almost 1,000 attendees in 2001. The following table lists the number of seminars delivered and total attendance at each seminar throughout 2001.  48   Seminar Public Contracting Overview Supplies and Services Contracting Design and Construction Contracting Bidding Basics and Contract Administration Bidding for Better Results Local Government Real Property Transactions Under M.G.L. c. 30B Spotlight on Schools State Contracting Overview TOTAL  Number 8 4 5 9 6 3 4 2 41  Attendance 179 111 127 290 112 51 86 41 997  Core Seminars The Office continued to offer three three-day seminars in the MCPPO program: Public Contracting Overview, which is a prerequisite for other courses and includes segments on purchasing principles, ethics, and Massachusetts purchasing laws; Supplies and Services Contracting, which trains participants to use invitations for bids and requests for proposals to make best value procurements of supplies and services under M.G.L. c. 30B; and Design and Construction Contracting, which provides in-depth instruction in the procurement laws governing public construction in Massachusetts and in effective design and construction contract administration. ""I gained a wealth of information and feel that everything I learned was relevant and useful in my work (more than I expected). I greatly appreciated the review because the size of the text was daunting. Terrific instructors. They are all articulate and very bright. I will definitely attend future trainings.""  2001 Public Contracting Overview seminar participant In 2001, the Office continued to offer the Massachusetts Certified State Purchasing Official (MCSPO) designation for state employees through the four-day State Contracting Overview seminar, initially developed in 2000. This core seminar, a prerequisite for the advanced seminars, provides instruction in procurement for agencies subject to the jurisdiction of the Operational Services Division.  49   ""Very well presented - the best yet - [the instructor] broke it down into more understandable segments and quizzes were very helpful.""  2001 State Contracting Overview seminar participant Each seminar provides instruction by experts using a variety of teaching methods  including lecture, discussion, and small group exercises  and concludes with a written examination. Seminar attendees use the opportunities to network with other procurement professionals, and benefit from the exchange of knowledge and ideas among the seminar participants as well as the expertise of the Office's procurement specialists.  Designations Each participant who successfully completes a seminar receives a certificate of completion. Public purchasing officials who complete requisite seminars and meet the educational and experience requirements become eligible to apply for various MCPPO designations. In 2001, 85 participants earned one of seven possible MCPPO designation types, bringing the total number of certifications received to 444 since 1998. ""Seminar was very informative. A lot of information in a short time. Gives us the knowledge of where to go to find answers about the various bidding laws. Presenters were exceptional - knew material front and back and presented well.""  2001 Design and Construction Contracting seminar participant  The following table illustrates the designations awarded by the Office in 2001.  50   Designation MCPPO Associate MCPPO MCPPO for Supplies and Services Contracting Associate MCPPO for Supplies and Services Contracting MCPPO for Design and Construction Contracting Associate MCPPO for Design and Construction Contracting MCSPO for Design and Construction Contracting  Number Awarded 53 12 10 2 5 0 3 85  MCPPOs must maintain their knowledge and skills and document at least 60 hours of continuing professional education to achieve recertification every three years. ""The IG's office gives some of the best training I've ever attended. The knowledge and enthusiasm of the instructors (not to mention innovative review techniques) make it a delightful learning experience. And it's a relief to know they're only a phone call away if I forget anything they worked so hard to teach me.""  2001 Supplies and Services Contracting seminar participant  MCPPO Continuing Education In addition to the core curriculum seminars that compromise the certification program, the MCPPO program also includes various non-core curriculum seminars. In 2001, the Office continued to offer Bidding Basics and Contract Administration, a half-day seminar first offered in 1999. Nine seminars were conducted in various locations throughout the state in 2001, with 290 attendees. ""Made an uninteresting subject extremely interesting...pleasantly surprised! Presentation was the key.""  2001 Bidding Basics and Contract Administration seminar participant  51   Since the beginning of 2000, the Office has introduced four new non-core curriculum seminars. The Office developed Bidding for Better Results in response to requests from local jurisdictions for more advanced procurement training. Participants practice writing and critiquing specifications to maximize best value procurements of supplies and services; they also learn how to handle late bids and how to avoid the appearance of bid splitting. This one-day seminar qualifies for continuing education credits toward the MCPPO recertification requirement. Six seminars were conducted in 2001 and over 100 people participated. ""Again, members of the 30B team have made relatively ""dry"" material interesting. I think I know 30B pretty well, but again, I learned plenty.""  2001 Bidding for Better Results seminar participant Local Government Real Property Transactions Under M.G.L. c. 30B, a one-day seminar, was developed to provide advanced training in the request for proposal process for the acquisition and disposition of real property conducted by local public officials. Three seminars were attended by over 50 participants. The seminar qualifies for continuing education credits toward the MCPPO recertification requirement. ""[The Office of the General Inspector] always puts on an excellent, easy to follow, and informative presentation. The IG's staff is one of my most valuable tools and other town managers I deal with echo this. Good job.""  2001 Local Government Real Property Transactions seminar participant In the spring of 2001, the Office introduced a new MCPPO continuing education course, Spotlight on Schools: Procurement Issues, Challenges, and Trends, focusing on the specialized issues confronting school business officials and staff members. During this six-hour seminar, participants apply the principles of public procurement to traditional and emerging areas of school buying. Four seminars were conducted in 2001 and over 85 people attended. ""Presenters were extremely knowledgeable, enthusiastic, up-beat, helpful, respectful. Outstanding program. Thank you!""  2001 Spotlight on Schools seminar participant  52   The Office also introduced Drafting a Model Invitation For Bids, a continuing education course offered in an individualized computer-based training model. In this course, participants are provided with a template Invitation for Bids (IFB) on computer disk, then follow instructions to draft a complete IFB for course credit. Participants work with an assigned attorney to revise their IFBs.  53   This page intentionally left blank.  54   Legislative Reviews The Office is obligated under its enabling statute, M.G.L. c. 12A, to review all legislation filed in each Legislative session. When appropriate, the Office comments in written and oral testimony to the Legislature and the Governor on proposed legislation; often, the Office recommends specific amendments to bills. In the 2001-2002 session, the Office commented on hundreds of pieces of legislation. This section highlights some of the legislative reviews conducted by the Office during 2001.  Design-Build Construction of a Public Safety Complex In December 2001, the Office wrote to the Committee on Local Affairs regarding House Bill 4775, a Home Rule petition to authorize the Town of Sunderland to use design-build methods to construct a public safety complex. As written, the bill would have waived the public construction laws that normally apply to public building projects in Massachusetts and would have substituted alternative procedures for competitive selection of the design-builder. Under the procedures set forth in House Bill 4775, the design-builder would design and build the public safety complex on the basis of quality and performance criteria set forth in the request for designbuild proposals issued by the Town. The bill would have also required the Town to contract with a ""design-build expert"" to prepare the competitive solicitations, pre-qualify design-builders, and evaluate design-build proposals received in response to an advertised request for proposals. The Office's letter warned that the design-build methods are not appropriate for, and pose significant risks when applied to, facilities for which public officials and the public are likely to be interested and involved in the design details. The Office pointed out that this was the case with public safety facilities because of their security requirements and the public safety implications of the building design. ""It is unlikely that public safety officials and the public will be willing - nor should they be willing - to turn over authority and responsibility for these and other detailed design decisions to a design-build contractor.""  IG letter to Local Affairs Committee Chairman, December 2001 The Office also noted that, although House Bill 4775 required the designbuild RFP to include quality and performance criteria for the public safety complex, the criteria specified in the bill related to the procurement of a  55   wastewater treatment plant rather than a public safety complex. For example, the bill referred to ""daily volume capacity"" and ""required effluent characteristics."" Finally, the Office expressed concern about the absence of provisions in the bill governing professional oversight of the contractor's work while constructing the facility. The Office recommended that House Bill 4775 be amended to require professional oversight on behalf of the Town until the project reached final completion and to require the design-builder to furnish the Town with a performance bond in the amount of 100 percent of the contract price. ""Contracting for construction without a completed design significantly increases the risks of design flaws and substandard construction on any project. Under these circumstances, professional oversight is an essential public protection.""  IG letter to Local Affairs Committee Chairman, December 2001 The Joint Committee on Local Affairs ordered House Bill 4775 to a study.  Waiver of Competition for Municipal Leases In March 2001, the Office wrote to the Committee on State Administration to express opposition to legislation authorizing the Town of Plymouth to lease and extend existing leases of municipal property on Plymouth Beach without competition to named private parties who already leased or occupied the property. Such leases would be for initial periods not to exceed 20 years, with extensions for consecutive 10-year terms notwithstanding M.G.L. c. 30B. The Office recommended that the Committee issue an adverse report on House Bill 2424. Subsequently the bill was amended to prohibit the assignment of the leases, require that any further dispositions of the parcels be subject to competition following M.G.L. c. 30B, and require annual rent equal to the taxes that would be due if the parcels were privately owned. The redrafted bill was signed by the Governor to become Chapter 94 of 2001.  Town of Barnstable Land Conveyance In October 2001, the Office commented to the Joint Committee on Local Affairs on House Bill 4622, which would authorize the Town of Barnstable to convey land to a named party in exchange for a parcel of land.  56   The Office recommended that House Bill 4622 be amended to require that the value of the parcels be determined and either that the parcel to be conveyed to the Town be of equal or greater value than the parcel that the Town would convey, or that the private party pay to the Town an amount equal to the difference in values. After meeting with Town officials, the Office reached an agreement with the Town that House Bill 4622 would be amended to require that the named party be responsible for all costs associated with any appraisal, survey, or other expenses associated with these conveyances and that the chief assessor's valuation on both parcels would suffice for determining the market values. House Bill 4622 was redrafted to incorporate the Office's recommendations and the Office's agreement with the Town and signed by the Governor to become Chapter 207 of the Acts of 2001.  Privatization of Municipal Sewer Works System In July 2001, the Office wrote to the Committee on State Administration in opposition to legislation authorizing the City of Holyoke to enter into a 20year contract for the lease, operation and maintenance, repair or replacement, financing, design, construction, and installation of new facilities or systems as well as modifications to the existing sewer works system. The Office cautioned that House Bill 4271 would put in place a complicated procurement process and that a contract awarded pursuant to this proposed legislation would have a major financial impact on ratepayers for many years to come. To ensure full public consideration of the project, the Office recommended that House Bill 4271 be amended to require any contract award to be approved by the City Council in addition to the Mayor as proposed in the bill. As of December 2001, House Bill 4271 remained in the Joint Committee on State Administration. In February 2002, the Office staff met with City representatives and agreed to amendments to protect the public interest, including the deletion of a reference to a potential sale of the project and the addition of language to ensure that performance guarantees would not be diminished during negotiations. The Office wrote to the Committee noting that if the amendments were made, the Office would have no further objection to the bill.  Division of Capital Asset Management Land Conveyance In March 2001, the Office wrote to the Committee on State Administration regarding legislation that would authorize the Division of Capital Asset Management (DCAM) to convey a certain parcel of land located on the  57   site of Tewksbury State Hospital to a named party for the purposes of constructing and operating residential housing. A portion of the housing would be set aside for low and moderate income housing. In return, DCAM would receive a parcel of land from the named party. The Office recommended that House Bill 736 be amended to define the criteria for low and moderate income housing. The Office also recommended that the bill be amended to require that the values of the parcels be determined through an independent appraisal and that the Commonwealth receive a payment equal to the amount, if any, by which the value of the property it transferred exceeded the value of the property it received. The property that the named party proposed to swap abutted the Tewksbury State Hospital property. Although the parcels being conveyed were presumed to be of equal value, this was not stated in the legislation. The Office recommended that House Bill 736 be amended to require that consideration for the property transferred to the named party be at the full market value as determined by an independent appraisal. Alternatively, that in consideration for the property to be conveyed by the Commonwealth, the named party should convey to the Commonwealth a parcel of equal or greater value, as determined by an independent appraisal. The Office stressed that these proposed safeguards would help preserve affordable housing while at the same time protect the Commonwealth's assets. House Bill 736 was redrafted to incorporate the recommendations of the Office. As of December 2001, the bill remained in Senate Ways and Means.  58   Legislative Recommendations: 2001-2002 Session Under M.G.L. c. 12A, the Office of the Inspector General has the authority to recommend policies that will assist in the prevention or detection of fraud, waste, and abuse. M.G.L. c. 12A requires the Office to report annually on these recommendations to the Governor and the Legislature. The previous sections of this report detail many of the problems identified by the Office in 2001 as well as the Office's recommendations for corrective action. This section discusses the Office's legislative proposals considered in the 2001-2002 legislative session.  Procurement Reform The Office filed legislation to give local governments the discretion to utilize a request for proposal process for contracts of less than $25,000. The legislation would also clarify that real property transactions between local governments and the Commonwealth are exempt under M.G.L. c. 30B. House Bill 107, Clarifying the Uniform Procurement Law, Chapter 30B  Construction Reform The Office filed legislation that would require a contract with an owner's representative for any contract for construction, reconstruction, alteration, remodeling or repair of public work estimated to cost more than $500,000. An owner's representative is the official or firm designated by the public agency to serve as the focal point of responsibility and accountability on a public construction project from the study and design phases through the completion of the project. An employee of the public agency could serve as the owner's representative. Training and certification would be required for owner's representatives who oversee construction projects that involve more than $500,000 in state funds. House Bill 104, Providing for reform in public construction  59   The Office filed legislation to require value engineering reviews of larger public construction projects to help ensure that taxpayers receive the best value for every dollar spent. Value engineering is a design review technique that factors in life-cycle costs, including maintenance and energy consumption, to help public agencies make cost-effective design decisions on building projects. House Bill 105, Defining value engineering The Office filed legislation to reform public construction by raising dollar thresholds for bidding requirements on public works and public building construction projects to reflect the rising cost of public construction projects. House Bill 106, Amending public construction bidding thresholds The Office filed legislation to clarify a definition in a section of the designer selection law, M.G.L. c. 7, 38G. Chapter 237 of the Acts of 2000 amended this section of M.G.L. c. 7; however, the terms used are not consistent with those used in other sections of the law. This proposal corrects that inconsistency in order to clarify its meaning. House Bill 108, Clarifying the Designer Selection Law, Chapter 7  Motor Vehicle Registration The Office filed legislation to amend motor vehicle registration procedures in order to improve state tax compliance by individuals and businesses that improperly register their vehicles in another state or in another city or town. This bill establishes criteria to determine whether the owner of a motor vehicle has claimed Massachusetts as his or her principal domicile in order to qualify for an entitlement or benefit reserved for Massachusetts residents. The bill would also require all vehicles operated upon the roads of the Commonwealth to have compulsory motor vehicle liability insurance equal to limits established for Massachusetts motor vehicle owners. The bill provides for an amnesty program during which all penalties customarily imposed for failing to pay motor vehicle excise taxes, sales taxes, and improperly registering a motor vehicle would be waived. House Bill 109, Improving tax compliance associated with the registration of motor vehicles  60   Service of Summonses The Office filed legislation to authorize Office staff to deliver summonses for documents. Currently, Office staff may deliver summonses for witnesses but not for documents. This legislation would protect the confidentiality of investigations and produce cost savings for the Office. House Bill 110, Technical change regarding the Office of the Inspector General  Real Estate Transactions The Office filed legislation to establish open and accountable procedures for the acquisition and disposition of real property by independent state authorities. State authorities, which are currently subject to virtually no statutory rules requiring advertised competition for real property transactions, would be required to undertake these transactions in a prudent, fair, and competitive manner. House Bill 111, Requiring the open and accountable acquisition and disposition of real property by state authorities  Repeal of Exemptions from Competitive Requirements The Office filed legislation to repeal four unnecessary exemptions from competitive procedures governing local procurements of supplies and services. Contracts for police-ordered towing and storage of motor vehicles, trash and recyclable collections, contracts for retirement board services, and the procurement of insurance would be subject to the competitive requirements of M.G.L. c. 30B. House Bill 112, Repealing certain exemptions  Interstate Commission on Cooperation The Office filed legislation to improve exchange of ideas, information, education, knowledge, and training in the prevention and detection of fraud, waste, and abuse in government expenditures and programs. An Interstate Commission on Cooperation would be created consisting of the current and two of the former Massachusetts Inspectors General, Attorneys General, State Auditors, and their designees. The commission would confer both regionally and nationally with local, state, and federal government officials to formulate proposals for professional certification and standardization of practices in areas such as fraud examination, governmental accounting and auditing, performance auditing, law enforcement, criminal justice administration, intellectual property law,  61   public purchasing and procurement, and fair labor standards and practices. Commission members would receive no compensation, and no additional employees or consultants would be hired. The commission would be able to request clerical and technical assistance from the three offices involved, but the offices would provide assistance on a strictly voluntary basis. House Bill 113, Establishing an interstate commission on cooperation  Trust Funds and Off-Budget Accounts The Office filed legislation to establish prudent controls over the creation, administration, and reporting of trust funds and off-budget accounts. The Commonwealth currently lacks effective controls over the creation and use of funds that are not appropriated by the Legislature. The legislation would require legislative approval of the creation of such funds as well as reports to the Legislature on revenues and expenditures associated with trust funds and off-budget accounts. House Bill 114, Regulating the establishment and administration of certain funds by state agencies  Competitive Procurement of Financial Services The Office filed legislation to establish open, accountable, and competitive procedures for the issuance of public debt by the Commonwealth. The use of negotiated sales by the Commonwealth would be controlled, and the role of the Finance Advisory Board would be strengthened to ensure that taxpayers' interests are fully protected. House Bill 115, Improve procedures for the issuance of public debt  Related-Party Transactions The Office filed legislation to restrict and regulate related-party transactions in contracting for goods and services by the Commonwealth. Under this legislation, a principal, officer, employee, board of directors member associated with any contractor receiving $100,000 or more of gross revenues through contracts with the Commonwealth would no longer be able to participate in any procurement when the person or any member of his or her immediate family has a direct or indirect financial interest that conflicts substantially, or appears to conflict substantially, with the contractor's duties and responsibilities to the Commonwealth.

(2) All water delivered by the Seller shall be clean, potable water, meeting all current  Federal, State and Local regulations in effect for the Utility at the time of transmission, relating to the quality of water as such Regulations may apply during the life of this Agreement. Failure of the Seller to provide water of the quality required by this paragraph shall be deemed a breach of this agreement, however, an allegation of failure to meet any such Regulations which is challenged by the Seller, shall not be deemed a breach of the Agreement unless there is a final finding after exhaustion of any appeals that there has, in fact, been non-compliance with said Regulations. (3) During the term of this Agreement, the Seller will undertake to deliver water to the  Consumer in such quantities as are required by the Consumer in the areas hereinafter described, and subject to the conditions herein contained, but only after proper water meter or master water meters are installed by Consumer. The maximum average flow shall be 300,000 gallons per day, per month. However the Seller does not bind itself during periods of water shortage resulting from an emergency condition to do more than deliver water to said metering station in such quantities and pressure as are available throughout the Town. In the event it should become necessary for the Seller to adopt regulations for conservation of water during such time of emergency, the Consumer agrees that it will adopt and use reasonable efforts to enforce in the areas covered by this Agreement the same regulations for conservation of water mandated by either the South Florida Water Management District or, in the case of a facilities emergency, the Town of Davie during such time of emergency. Under all circumstances Consumer will be treated similarly with regard to water conservation measures as other like users of Seller's sytem. (4) The areas to be serviced by Consumer are situated in Broward County, Florida, and  shall be referred to as the ""Hotel/Entertainment Complex Service Area (hereafter ""Service Area"") for the purpose of this Agreement. The Service Area is described as follows: See attached Exhibit A-1 and A-2.   (5)  There shall be a master water meter installed at a point mutually agreeable, through  which all water provided to Consumer shall be supplied, and all water furnished by Seller shall be metered through such meters. The Consumer shall, at its own expense, procure and install a water meter or water meters, the type of such meters to be approved by, and the installation thereof to be approved by the Seller or its authorized agents.

It is the intention of the parties that both the water meter(s) and sewer connection points shall be located on the northwestern boundary of the Hollywood Reservation in the eastern right-of-way of the Florida Turnpike. After installation the Seller will, at its own expense, operate and maintain the master water meter. (6) It shall be the obligation of the Consumer, at its expense, to design, construct and All improvements  install water service, force main and wastewater collection lines, and all necessary appurtenances thereto to connect to Seller's existing municipal lines. constructed on the Reservation shall remain the property of, and be maintained by, the Consumer.

(7) The Seller shall own the water meter as evidenced by a Bill of Sale from Consumer The meter  once construction of off Reservation improvements have been completed.  shall be of standard make and type, pursuant to AWWA standards, installed in a readily accessible location with checking or calibration devices, and the installation shall indicate flow with an error not to exceed plus or minus three percent of full scale reading. If found to be in error exceeding three percent of true accuracy, the meter shall be recalibrated to the satisfaction of the parties hereto. If such error of more than three percent is discovered, bills for the next period following the prior meter accuracy check shall be adjusted to reflect the quantity of over-read or under-read exceeding three percent. In calculating such billing adjustment it will be assumed that the meter inaccuracy existed for one-half of the entire time interval between meter accuracy checks, not to exceed twelve (12) months. The billing adjustment shall be made at the same rate established in accordance with Section (9) hereinafter, but the volume used in the billing calculations shall be adjusted as described above.   The Seller may request and the Consumer agrees to pay to perform a meter accuracy check at any reasonable time acceptable to both parties. The meter accuracy test will be required at least once every two years. If the meter is found to be in error exceeding three percent true accuracy, it shall be recalibrated as described above and the entire cost for such checking and recalibration shall be paid for by the Consumer. (8) The water furnished by the Seller hereunder shall be delivered to the Consumer at  the point of delivery (master meter location) at a minimum head of one hundred (100) feet (+44PSI) except during fire demand. The Seller shall not be responsible for water hammer in any of the pipe lines of the Consumer nor shall the Seller be responsible for meeting any demands for water other than that required by the terms of this Agreement. It shall be the obligation and duty of the Consumer to carry the water at its own expense from each point of delivery to the place or places of ultimate use and, in so doing, to supply and impart to the water adequate pressure as may be necessary to provide adequate pressure at all points beyond such point of delivery, in consequence whereof the Seller shall not be responsible for insufficient pressure, nor be required to correct any fluctuation in pressure, occurring beyond any such point of delivery. (9) The sewage to be delivered by the Consumer to the Seller shall be untreated wastes  only from the Consumer. It shall be the Consumer's responsibility to collect and transmit the sewage to the agreed point of sewage connection.

The sewage rates to be charged by the Seller to the Consumer herein shall be a user rate of 100% of the water usage @ $1.71 per 1,000 gallons. The rates may be adjusted to the Consumer as Seller adjusts its rate structure for all customers of Sellers service. It is the intention of the parties that any future rate adjustments will result in the same rate to retail customers. (11) Readings of the master water meter at point of delivery shall be taken by the Seller  on or about the fifteenth day of each month and shall be used for monthly billing purposes under the provision of this section.

Call to Order  The meeting was called to order at 1:00PM by Janet Snyder Matthews.  Dr. Matthews outlined the goals of the meeting and invited the Planning Group members to introduce themselves and identify their interests.  Meeting goals include a review of what we know, what we will learn, interim and long range management concerns.  Attendees were also invited to introduce themselves and their organizations.    Item II. Greeting by Miami-Dade County Commissioner Katy Sorenson, District 8  Commissioner Sorenson outlined the background of public involvement, acknowledging many of the individuals and organizations involved in the Miami Circle.  Commissioner Sorenson emphasized that the Miami Circle may be one of the most significant sites on the East Coast of the United States.  Commissioner Sorenson outlined financial challenges facing Miami-Dade County as the deadline of November 2001 approaches for repayment of the Trust for Public Land bridge loan.  While $2 are repaid, $6.7 million is the balance due.  Commissioner Sorenson indicated that raising money for a property not owned by the county is very difficult.  Commissioner Sorenson expressed support for efforts by the County and the Historical Museum of Southern Florida to make the property accessible to the public.  She challenged the Planning Group to develop a creative, thoughtful, respectful, and effective way to interpret the Miami Circle.    Item III.  Archaeological Background    John Ricisak, former Miami-Dade County archaeologist, was unable to attend to present the initial discovery and excavation of the Miami Circle by the County Historic Preservation Division and the Archaeological and Historical Conservancy.  Ryan Wheeler, Archaeology Supervisor for the Bureau of Archaeological Research, Florida Department of State, provided background and discussed the State investigation of the site just prior to acquisition late in 1999.   Wheeler emphasized that the discovery of the Circle, while unanticipated, was the result of a strong County historic preservation ordinance that required archaeological investigation and provided county involvement, if necessary.  Wheeler outlined excavations of the Circle and some of the major findings, including radiocarbon dates placing occupation at 2000 years ago and artifacts indicating that the Tequesta and their ancestors participated in long distance exchange networks.  Wheeler noted that the investigation focused on the rest of the 2.2 acre property in an attempt to better identify the context of the Circle.  Maps depicting the site's vertical and horizontal extent were shown.  Results of much of the work  have been reported in the December 2000 issue of The Florida Anthropologist, which Planning Group members received within meeting packets.   Debby Kearney, General Counsel for the Florida Department of State, was not present to discuss the status of the lease and sublease.  Dr. Matthews indicated that this would be a topic for future meeting agenda.   Bob Carr, Executive Director of the Archaeological and Historical Conservancy, discussed progress on the analysis of the materials from the three different studies of the Miami Circle, funded by a Florida Department of State Historic Preservation Special Category grant awarded to the Historical Museum of Southern Florida.  Over 200,000 cataloged objects include some producing radiocarbon dates demonstrating occupation as early as 400 to 700 BC. Other dates indicate occupation during the period of European contact.  Carr called for stringent guidelines to regulate future site studies.  He emphasized the spiritual and scientific aspects of the property, which call for a balance in future considerations.  He underlined the definitive role of the archaeological discovery that led to the preservation of the Circle and the Brickell Point property.  He agreed that the Native American viewpoint requires consideration in developing interpretation.     Item IV.  Current Issues    Ryan Wheeler distributed a draft interim management plan, and discussed the history to date of maintenance and protection of the site.  Issues included security, stabilization of the property, coverings and protection of the Circle feature, stabilization of the sea wall bulkhead and possible assistance from the Miami-Dade County Dept. of Environmental Regulation and Management, mowing and fence maintenance, and the need for public interpretation.   Proposed plans for temporary interpretation:   Andy Brian, President, Historical Museum of Southern Florida, discussed his organization's  role in developing interpretive materials and providing tours.  He indicated that the museum would use funds from the Department of State Division of Historical Resources Historic Preservation Special Category grant to pay for interpretive signage at the Brickell Point site.  He further stated that the museum could coordinate scheduled tours of the site.   Michael Spring, Executive Director, Miami-Dade County Department of Cultural Affairs, discussed the County's plans for moving forward with temporary interpretive signage and public access to the Circle.  This would include a plan for a temporary covering of the Circle, a landscape plan, signage, and scheduled tours.  Any plans would take into account the protection of the archaeological resources.  Relationship with the Miami River Greenway should be considered.  The design concept and cost estimate will be developed prior to the next meeting.   Chris Eck, Director of the Miami-Dade County Historic Preservation Division, presented informal draft drawings representing potential temporary interpretive materials that could be developed.  Mr. Eck also presented examples of other cultural sites (e.g., Casa Grande National Monument, Jamestown Settlement) with protective covering designs, and discussed some of the ways this might be addressed at the Circle.   The City of Miami representative was not present to discuss the Miami River Master Plan, but Brett Bibeau, Assistant Director of the Miami River Commission, discussed the plans for the Miami River walk being developed by the Miami River Commission and the Trust for Public Land.  Mr. Bibeau indicated that the Miami River Commission had been created by the State Legislature in 1998, charged with improving the river.  This includes plans for a Miami River Greenway and riverwalk.  He indicated some elements of the riverwalk that already exist, including an area behind the Sheraton Biscayne Bay hotel with a water taxi stop.  The plans had been approved and substantial funding (4.5 million) secured for the first phase.  He also indicated that the plans included a passage under the south side of the Brickell Bridge, which would potentially tie Brickell Point and other properties on the south side of the river to the riverwalk elements upriver and on the north side of the river.  He indicated that the plan had taken into account the Miami Circle/Brickell Point property, in the hopes of incorporating it into the river walk.  Information on the plan is available on line at: http://www.miamirivercommission.org/     Item V.  Closing remarks    Dr. Matthews thanked the Planning Group and attendees and indicated that the next meeting would be held in two months.   Dr. Matthews invited input from the Planning Group members:   Jennifer Beber asked about bilingual interpretive materials.  Michael Spring responded that English, Spanish, and Creole were often used jointly on materials.   Greg Bush and Becky Matkov asked about the scope of the Planning Group, and if Brickell Park and other nearby properties, such as First Presbyterian Church, could be considered in the broader plans for the Miami Circle and Brickell Point.   Monika Mayer from Biscayne National Park expressed the need for defining how the public anticipated experiencing the property, and stressed that the property be considered in context of other sites and cultural resources.   Patricia Wickman indicated the need for Native American involvement and the desire of the Seminole Tribe to help with interpretation.  She explained that archaeology was a tool, and that the human experience needed to be taken into consideration in developing interpretation of the site as a ""Native American site,"" rather than as an ""archaeological site.""  She stressed the need for an inclusive view of the past.   Jim Miller noted that it might be helpful to consider the different issues in terms of a matrix, with short, middle and long term categories plotted on one axis, and 2.2 acre Brickell Point poperty, Miami River, and region plotted on the other.  This would help Planning Group members as they think about and discuss the different numerous aspects of the project.   Jorge Hernandez raised questions regarding the duration of the Planning Group.  He also talked about the Miami Circle feature in terms of its architectural quality, and the fact that it was unusual in that it was a ""negative"" type feature, sinking into the ground instead of projecting from the ground, as with many other Sacred sites, like the Mesoamerican pyramids (e.g., Chichen Itza).  He noted that this would be a challenge in properly interpreting the site and making it available to the public.  Mr. Hernandez also stated that for such a significant site, the Planning Group needed to find a way to make that significance available and understandable to all the people who come as visitors or who access information in other ways.   Arva Parks emphasized the need to incorporate the human experience of the site into any interpretation, noting that the real connection between visitors and the ancient inhabitants who had lived at and built the Miami Circle was a physical one associated with being at the same geographical place.  She emphasized the need to take other sites and previous research into consideration, including the Granada site on the north bank of the river, for a ""big picture"" approach.   Enid Pinkney noted the need to acknowledge those individuals and organizations that had been involved in the acquisition of the Miami Circle/Brickell Point property.  She also spoke about the spirit of the Circle, and the importance of getting to know the Native peoples involved and their perspectives.   Dr. Matthews then invited input from attendees who had expressed an interest in speaking:   Jack Moller offered advice on possible funding sources and echoed the need to involve other agencies and sites.  He indicated that the ""bed tax"" might be used as a funding source.   Catherine Hummingbird Ramirez indicated her long involvement with the Circle, noting that she held a ritual there every Tuesday at 6:00PM.  She urged the Planning Group to make the right decisions for the Circle, to open the property to the public.  She emphasized the relationship between spirit and science.  She offered several prayers.   Bobby C. Billie expressed his concern over the lack of understanding by the Planning Group of what the Circle is and the lack of Native American representation on the Planning Group [Ed. Note:  James E. Billie of the Seminole Tribe of Florida and Billy Cypress of the Missosukee Tribe of Indians were original appointees to the Planning Group].  Mr. Billie emphasized the relationship of the Miami Circle and Brickell Point with Brickell Park where human burials have been discovered.  He spoke about the spiritual aspect of the site and related sites, and asked for respect for Native people.   Shannon Larson expressed concern over the lack of Native American representation on the Planning Group and objected to the archaeological research that had been conducted.  She indicated that the artifacts should be reburied.   Blanca Mesa was concerned about opportunities for public input and for including those who had first worked to draw public attention to the site.   Billy Cypress indicated the Seminole Tribe's interest in the Miami Circle and offered assistance as needed.  He indicated that it was good for Native Americans to pull together in the preservation of the Circle, and they were standing by to help.   Meeting adjourned at 3:07PM.     Item VI.  Tour    The Planning Group members and public attendees visited the site in a tour led by Ryan Wheeler.     Notes on major topics for future meetings:    Duration of Planning Group.  Some members expressed an interest in understanding the time frame of the Planning Group.  This would seem to largely depend on the length of time needed to develop a plan for the property, secure adequate funding, and carry out the design.   Funding for temporary and long term interpretation of the site.  Despite the suggestion of some group members, it seemed that most people in attendance believed the temporary and final interpretation of the site would involve public access to the Miami Circle feature.   Incorporation of the property into the Miami River Walk being developed by the Miami River Commission and the Trust for Public Land.   Details of temporary interpretation.  Michael Spring's office, Chris Eck, and the Historical Museum of Southern Florida are working together on plans, which they hope to distribute prior to the next meeting.  This would involve signage and a covering for the Circle, as well as guided tours of the site.   Lease and sublease.   Incorporation of other properties into the plan for the Miami Circle.  This seems to largely center on the Brickell Park property, but perhaps extending to the First Presbyterian Church.

'309-173.  Purpose. This Article is intended to operate as a Seniors Housing Overlay District, and will prevail in lieu of the underlying zoning, in appropriate circumstances, as determined by the Town of Salem Planning Board, to provide housing opportunities for elderly persons, and provide opportunity for transitional uses between commercial districts, business districts, the town center district, and abutting residential districts. '309-174.  Definitions. A. Seniors.  Persons age 55 and older. B. Elderly.  Persons age 62 and older, as defined in federal regulations. C. Seniors Housing.  A variety of housing types designed specifically to meet the varied needs of persons age 55 and older.

The Main Street boundary shall be inclusive of the Business Office District commencing at Granite Street. F. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Planning Board may approve placement of an overlay in any rurally or residentially zoned area after employing the development standards in '309-177 (A)-(E). ' 309-177.  Development Standards. A. General Standards.  x. Seniors facilities must be served by municipal water and sewer, or by private systems approved for community use by the Planning Board and the state of New Hampshire.  xi. Facilities designed as dwelling units within the district may have a maximum of two bedrooms.  xii. Open space shall consist of no less than 50% of the lot area.  xiii. A minimum setback of 50 feet shall be provided between any proposed structure and the perimeter of the property on all sides. B. Design and architectural character.  i. Massing and style.  Building massing and style must be distinctively residential in character, drawing on the historical design elements that are contextually consistent with regional New England architecture.  Historical and traditional design elements are encouraged.  Front yards which use boxwood hedges, evergreen hedges, traditional style picket fences, stone walls, or iron picket fences with granite curb and pilasters is encouraged. Fences or hedges should not exceed three feet in height at the fronts of buildings.  Fences and landscaping to screen service areas may exceed this height, consistent with the intent and use of the space.  ii. Roofs.  Preference shall be given to roof pitches consistent with single family, residential design.  New England traditional or vernacular styles are preferred. Material must be consistent with the architecture of the building.  Composition shingle material is acceptable, providing that it is of high quality and provides architectural definition to the tab shingle to emulate traditional wood shingle styles.  Tile, slate, or metal roofing is permitted, provided it is consistent with the architectural style of the building. Gutters and down spouts are encouraged to provide drainage away from foundations, but must be consistent with the other architectural elements of the building. The installation of chimneys on the roofs of all buildings is encouraged to convey the look and feel of residential use.  iii. Facade element.  Design of the facade shall be highly detailed and articulated to be compatible with the scale and sensitivity to the residential uses of the project.  Facades should have a well defined foundation, a modulated wall element, and pitched roof or articulated cornice which defines the character of the building, and provides relation to the human scale of typical family residences.  iv. Entrances.  Building entrances must comply with all current accessibility regulations, however the use of ramps and lifts is discouraged.  Buildings should be designed with entrances that are barrier free for the intended residential or commercial uses.  The use of sloping entry walks, covered entryways, porticos, arcades, and covered porches is encouraged.  Where grade separation of an entrance is required because of site topography, accommodation should be provided in the architectural detail of the entry to allow barrier free use by building residents and visitors.  v. Door and window openings. Doors and windows form the transition from public to private space, and should reflect residential detailing in design and placement.  The use of cornices, architectural moldings, side lights, transom lights, and raised panels in doors is encouraged.  Window openings should vary between buildings, but should not be unbroken and continuous in any circumstance.  The use of opening sash windows with true divided lights, or detailing to convey the character of divided lights is encouraged. The use of shutters consistent with the architecture of a building is encouraged. A wide range of material for doors and windows is acceptable, except that the use of commercial, anodized or painted aluminum or steel storefront assemblies is discouraged.  vi. Materials and design elements.  Material chosen for exterior elements should be consistent with the intent and use of materials traditionally found in residential design in New England.  Siding materials such as clapboard and shingle are preferred, and the use of new materials which reduce maintenance, but emulate the look and feel of traditional materials is encouraged.  The use of a variety of trim material to provide detail at the eaves, corners, gables, pediments, lintels, sills, quoins, and balustrades is encouraged.  The use of bays, towers, cupolas, cross gables, and dormers to provide unique character to a building and provide articulation of the facade is encouraged.  The color palette chosen for any building should be consistent with traditional residential colors.  vii. Paving and curbing.  Granite curbing, gray in color, is required on all public roads, and is preferred, except in areas of very low traffic volume where no curbing will be required.  Rolled asphalt (Cape Code berm) curbing is unacceptable in all public ways.  Curbing is to be sloped or cut to provide a barrier free transition at road crossings and building entrances.  Paving which provides a non-skid surface and is contrasting in design, materials, or color is encouraged at all pedestrian crosswalks and walkways.  viii. Parking.  Parking lots in front setbacks are prohibited.  Parking areas are to be to the side or rear of all buildings. Parking lot layout shall be planned to permit landscaping, buffering, or screening to prevent direct views of parked vehicles from adjacent streets.  The use of traditional picket fencing, hedges, walls, or landscape berms to define parking areas is encouraged.  Parking lot interiors shall be landscaped to provide shade and relief.  In parking areas of eleven or more parking stalls, at least one tree of three inch or greater caliper shall be planted for every six parking places. Adequate tree wells and irrigation shall be provided for all parking lot landscaping. Pedestrian access is to be taken into consideration in parking lot design. The use of separate walkways is encouraged. Textured paving or grade separated (elevated) walkways are desired on all pedestrian access ways.  Separate loading areas are required for service vehicles in all residential projects of twenty or more units and at all other facilities greater than 2500 square feet.  In multi-family buildings of 20 or more units, at least one loading area must be provided for 20-50 units, and one additional loading area for each additional increment of 25 units.  In other facilities, loading areas must be provide at the ratio of one space for each 10,000 square feet of building area on a site, except that all activities of 2500 square feet or more shall have at least one loading area provided.  Loading areas must be at least 20 X 9 feet, and have a minimum overhead clearance of 10 feet.  Screening and landscaping shall be provided to block all views of loading areas (except those specifically designated for emergency vehicles) from the public right-of-way and adjacent properties.  ix. Parking ratios shall be as follows:        ratios per dwelling unit   Active Adult Community    2.2:1   Independent Living Facilities   1.5:1   CCRC      2:1   ALF      1:1    plus 1:each employee   Congregate Care Facility   .5:1   plus 1:each employee   Nursing Home    .25:1 plus 1:each employee   SNF      .25:1 plus 1:each employee   Alzheimer's Facility    .25:1 plus 1:each employee   xi. Signs.  Permitted signs are to be as specified in ' 309-85A. for Residential, Rural, Recreational or Garden Apartment zones.  x. Lighting.  Multi-halide lighting or color corrected sodium lighting is encouraged.  Street lighting, except as required for vehicle entrances and public rights-of-way in '278.8 Q should be pedestal mounted or mounted on adjacent buildings at pedestrian scale heights between 10 and 14 feet. Lights should not illuminate adjacent properties, and caps or cutoffs must be provided to prevent direct lighting of abutting or adjacent properties. The use of porch lights, gate post lights, and bollard lighting to illuminate walkways is encouraged.  xi. Foundation planting and general landscaping.  A broad range of foundation plants and general landscape planting is encouraged.  The intent is to provide an intensity of landscaping that creates a residential character for any project in this district. C. Height.  Dwelling structures may exceed 35' in height to a maximum of 60' in height, where the applicant can demonstrate that the granting of the additional height may provide significant advantage to the community and the residents of the facility.  In order to be considered to provide significant advantage, applicants contemplating building structures exceeding 35' in height must:  i. Provide additional set back from all lot lines a minimum of 10' for each additional foot of height  ii. Provide 10% bonus of open space greater than the 50% open space otherwise required for each full or partial story of any building which exceeds 35' in height. Additional hard scape used as parking area may not be considered as additional open space.  iii. Demonstrate that economic advantage will accrue to the benefit of the community and residents of the housing facility through innovative planning, design, management, and use of the facility.  iv. Present to the Planning Board a three-dimensional massing model of all buildings on the site showing sufficient design detail to provide realistic presentation of the facility in relation to the site plan.  v. In deciding whether or not to grant this approval, the Planning Board shall also consider input received from abutters to the site. D. Development Density.  Seniors facilities will be regulated by the use of Floor Area Ratio (FAR) to control density relative to lot size.  Floor Area is hereby defined as the area of a building interior as measured from the outside of the exterior wall or center line of a party wall.  Typically excluded from the floor area are: accessory parking facilities, attic areas with headroom less than seven feet; basements; open sided porches, decks, and patios; roofed areas covering utility equipment; and projections which may be designed to afford protection from weather at building entries. Floor Area Ration is hereby defined as the ratio of the building interior (Floor Area) to the total area of the building lot, expressed as a decimal. However, in all instances, seniors projects may not maintain less than 50% open space on the lot.  i. The following FARs are permitted:   Active Adult Community    FAR = .18   Independent Living Facilities   FAR = .32   CCRC      FAR = .25   ALF      FAR = .35   Congregate Care Facility   FAR = .32   Nursing Home    FAR = .35   SNF      FAR = .38   Alzheimer's Facility    FAR = .35  ii The following minimum lot sizes are required:   Active Adult Community    10 acres   Independent Living Facilities   5 acres   CCRC      10 acres   ALF      5 acres   Congregate Care Facility   2 acres   Nursing Home    2 acres   SNF      2 acres   Alzheimer's Facility    2 acres E. Open space requirements.  Land within the parcel or lot which is not specifically covered by the buildings, roads, driveways, parking areas, or service areas, and not set aside as private yards, patios, or gardens for residents shall qualify as open space.  Further, all open space shall be unobstructed and open to the sky.  Flagpoles, sculptures, benches, swimming pools, tennis courts, atriums, trees, and similar objects shall not be considered obstructions.  No more than 25% of the minimum required open space may lie within a wetland.  The size, dimension, character, and location of open space shall be suitable to enable its enjoyment and use for conservation, recreation, or agricultural persons by residents or the community.  Such restrictions regarding open space shall be in a form and substance as the Planning Board may prescribe, and shall be recorded in an instrument enforceable by the Town. F. Single family detached dwelling units may be situated on individual lots, may be part of a detached condominium regime, or may be separate rental units. Single family detached projects within the district require a minimum parcel size of 10 acres. In the case of condominium units, condominium projects must be 75% owner occupied. If separate lots are created, they shall not be less than 10,000 square feet, and may have frontage on either town roads or private roads within the overlay district, in which case the roads shall be maintained by an owner's association.  In the case of single family detached dwellings, the density of a district may not exceed one unit for each 10,000 square feet of lot area. G. Multi-family residential structures may be either condominium units or rental units, except that condominium units must be 75% owner occupied. More than one structure may be built on a lot in accordance with the density limits for the project type. '309-178.  Special requirements. The implementation of Seniors Overlay Districts shall be overseen by the Town of Salem Planning Board.  Under the provisions of RSA 674:21, the Planning Board may, by application for a special use permit, provide an exception from the development standards in '309-108 provided that: A. Such exception is consistent with the purpose and intent of this Article; B. The exception is in the public interest; C. The exception will not aggravate or worsen the impact on adjoining residential areas; D. The exception will provide a development opportunity that could not be otherwise obtained. '309-179.  Restrictions. A. ""Private, non-profit"" means a 501(C)(2) or 501(C)(3) non-profit organization as designated by the Internal Revenue Service. B. Residential facilities designed for exclusive occupancy by senior citizens, as a minimum, must meet federal regulations for such facilities. C. Consistent with federal law, 90% of heads of household in seniors facilities must be age 55 or older, or in the case of married couples, at least one spouse must be age 55 or older. D. A unit occupied by surviving members of a household, in which the head of household met the age requirements at time of death, may continue to be occupied by surviving household members regardless of age. E. Residency restrictions for residential projects within the Seniors Housing Overlay District shall be accomplished by restrictions recorded in Condominium Declarations, Restrictive Covenants, or other documents recorded in the Rockingham Registry of Deeds.  All such covenants shall be subject to review by Town Counsel and shall include enforcement provisions in favor of the Town. c:\blubook/zoning.wpd                                Previous message:  [Plan-link] Elderly Housing Regulations      Next message:  [Plan-link] Tree workshop               Messages sorted by:                  [ date ]                 [ thread ]                 [ subject ]                 [ author ]"

Since 1947, this program has assembled well over 400 ULI-member teams to help sponsors find creative, practical solutions for issues such as downtown redevelopment, land management strategies, evaluation of development potential, growth management, community revitalization, brownfields redevelopment, military base reuse, provision of low-cost and affordable housing, and asset management strategies, among other matters. A wide variety of public, private, and nonprofit organizations have contracted for ULI's Advisory Services. Each panel team is composed of highly qualified professionals who volunteer their time to ULI. They are chosen for their knowledge of the panel topic and screened to ensure their objectivity. ULI panel teams are interdisciplinary and typically include several developers, a landscape architect, a planner, a market analyst, a finance expert, and others with the niche expertise needed to address a given project. ULI teams provide a holistic look at development problems. Each panel is chaired by a respected ULI member with previous panel experience. The agenda for a five-day panel assignment is intensive. It includes an in-depth briefing day composed of a tour of the site and meetings with sponsor representatives; a day of hour-long interviews of typically 50 to 75 key community representatives; and two days of formulating recommendations. Many long nights of discussion precede the panel's conclusions. On the final day on site, the panel makes an oral presentation of its findings and conclusions to the sponsor. A written report is prepared and published. Because the sponsoring entities are responsible for significant preparation before the panel's visit, including sending extensive briefing materials to each member and arranging for the panel to meet with key local community members and stakeholders in the project under consideration, particFort Lauderdale, Florida, November 1015, 2002  ipants in ULI's five-day panel assignments are able to make accurate assessments of a sponsor's issues and to provide recommendations in a compressed amount of time. A major strength of the program is ULI's unique ability to draw on the knowledge and expertise of its members, including land developers and owners, public officials, academicians, representatives of financial institutions, and others. In fulfillment of the mission of the Urban Land Institute, this Advisory Services panel report is intended to provide objective advice that will promote the responsible use of land to enhance the environment.

These public entities formed a public/ private partnership with numerous private sector contributors and supporters, who acted as cosponsors for this study, which considers development opportunities for the Central Beach area of the city. A list of these contributors and supporters appears in Appendix A. Cindi Hutchinson, vice mayor, and Tim Smith, District 2 commissioner, provided guidance and support for the panel, as did John Amodeo, chairman of the BRAB, and other BRAB members. Further thanks are extended to Chuck Adams, the city's manager of beach redevelopment, who served as the liaison between the sponsors and project staff from Florida Atlantic University (FAU). Frank Schnidman, senior fellow with the Center for Urban and Environmental Solutions at FAU, led the FAU team that prepared the ULI Advisory Services panel application, assembled the briefing materials, and identified stakeholders in the community. In this way, the staff from the Catanese Center and the Florida Institute of Government at FAU played a significant role in the panel process. Of particular note is the effort by Sarah Shannon, director of the Florida Institute of Government, who provided further support and assistance to the panel.  Other public officials, representing all city agencies potentially involved in the redevelopment effort, offered their time and expertise. The panel appreciated the information rendered by Chris Wren--who was in the process of leaving the position of manager of comprehensive planning to become executive director of the Downtown Development Authority (DDA)--and Chris Barton, the city's principal planner. There was widespread interest among the city's stakeholders. The panel is indebted to the more than 70 community residents, government and business leaders, property owners, and members of the design and legal community who offered unique and valuable insights during the interview process. As a group, they serve as a major asset in advancing the interests of the city. The individual perspectives gained from these interviews were crucial to the success of the panel's efforts. The panel hopes that the community will continue to work with and support initiatives put forth by the city and champion a vision for the Central Beach area of Fort Lauderdale. The public and private sectors' working together to formulate a plan of action will, the panel hopes, result in a revitalization and redevelopment plan that will benefit all segments of the community.  4  An Advisory Services Panel Report   Contents  ULI Panel and Project Staff Foreword: The Panel's Assignment Overview and Summary of Recommendations Market Potential Planning and Design Development Strategies Implementation Conclusions About the Panel Appendix A: Sponsors and Cosponsors Appendix B: Public Officials  6 7 9 12 20 36 45 51 53 58 59  Fort Lauderdale, Florida, November 1015, 2002  5   ULI Panel and Project Staff  Panel Chair William H.

ULI On-Site Coordinator Jason Bell Panel Coordinator, Advisory Services  6  An Advisory Services Panel Report   Foreword: The Panel's Assignment  I  n 1988, ULI conducted an Advisory Services panel study for the city of Fort Lauderdale that focused on a 33-acre area of Central Beach that was severely blighted. That area is zoned and described in the Unified Land Development Regulations as the Planned Resort Development District. It is part of the adopted Community Redevelopment Area (CRA), which consists of approximately 125 acres, as shown in the illustration on page 10. The Central Beach Regional Activity Center (RAC) is one of two designated land use areas in the comprehensive plan, the other being the Downtown RAC. The 125-acre CRA falls within the 425-acre Central Beach RAC. In June 2002, ULI once again was commissioned to study the beach area. This panel met during November 2002 to consider redevelopment opportunities for the entire Central Beach area, as well as additional acreage adjacent to it. The 455-acre study area includes the 425-acre Central Beach RAC, the 125-acre CRA, and the 33-acre core redevelopment area studied by the 1988 ULI panel. It generally consists of the land between the Atlantic Ocean and the Intracoastal Waterway, and between Sunrise Boulevard at the north and Harbor Drive South/Holiday Drive at the south. Where appropriate, the panel also looked at approaches to the barrier island from the mainland, which include the 17th Street Causeway approach as well as Las Olas Boulevard and Sunrise Boulevard. The sponsors asked the new ULI panel to recommend a conceptual plan that would define a vision for the redevelopment of Central Beach and provide a strategy for the city and the community to follow as they continue to pursue improvements in the area. To help the city achieve its public policy goals and objectives, the panel also was asked to evaluate the goals and objectives stated in the 1988 Central Beach Revitalization Plan and the 1989 Beach Redevelopment Plan, as well as proFort Lauderdale, Florida, November 1015, 2002  Pensacola  Tallahassee  Jacksonville  Gainesville  ntic Atla  F  G  L L  ulf  an Oce  of o xic Me St. Petersburg Venice 98 441 17 SARASOTA HIGHLANDS DE SOTO  Tampa  Fort Myers Naples  O O R R  Orlando  I Location map.

The panelists worked in four teams--exploring market analysis, planning and design, development strategies, and implementation--to reach a consensus on recommendations for the redevelopment of Central Beach. It estimated projected market conditions to determine potential future land uses; analyzed existing zoning designations and proposed adjustments to them, including titles, purposes, and locations, to better coincide with the panel's proposed thematic planning districts; described 14 project initiatives--located throughout the study area--as potential catalysts for economic development in the area; and supported these initiatives with proposed transportation and parking strategies. Finally, the panel recommended a time line and proposed actions to be taken over the next five years.  Panelists gathered at the public marina near the site for Palazzo Las Olas include--from left to right--Marshall Kramer, Bill Hudnut, Mark Papas, Mike Buchanan, Don Bredberg, David Malmuth, Tom Lavash, Ross Tilghman, Barbara Faga, David Biggs, and Tom Storrs.  grams established for the CRA and for Central Beach. The city asked the panel to respond to the following two basic questions: ""Are we moving in the right direction? Are we on track or off track with our thinking about the appropriate scale and diversity of uses for the 455 acres located on the barrier island that is the Central Beach community of Fort Lauderdale?""  8  An Advisory Services Panel Report   Overview and Summary of Recommendations  H  ow should the city proceed? The panel answers the city's fundamental question-- are we moving in the right direction?-- with a qualified ""yes."" The panel's response is qualified because it believes that while the city already is moving along the path toward redevelopment, it could be doing so in a more productive fashion. The panel sees two possible futures for Central Beach. The first is a future of ""benign neglect;"" that is, letting things move along as is and waiting to see what happens while enjoying the status quo; studying, discussing, and arguing about confusing signals coming from different segments of the community; micromanaging the present, as it were, without really managing the future; and voting for or against proposals as the pressures of the moment dictate. The second is a future of ""affirmative attention;"" that is, making a concerted effort to articulate and realize a vision for this area; abiding by rules and regulations rather than making exceptions and allowing subjective judgments to come into play; championing the cause of the vision with courage and decisiveness; and remembering that if all possible objections to a project had to be removed before it could begin, nothing would ever be accomplished, and one would remain ""stuck in sand"" forever. The panel believes that choosing this second future, with its implications for proactive rather than reactive action, is the wiser path to travel. But taking this ""higher road"" will require commitment to an overall vision for the study area. The panel suggests that that vision be ""a resort community with a beach lifestyle."" Central Beach should be redeveloped as a resort community that offers an attractive destination for tourists without destroying a blended balance of residential and hospitality development and redevelopment, coupled with appropriate retail development to create an environment of casual sophistication. Such a vision  builds on the considerable assets already in place: the miles of Atlantic Ocean beaches, the Intracoastal Waterway, the pedestrian-friendly scale of most of the existing development, the proximity to downtown and Las Olas Boulevard, and major annual events like the Fort Lauderdale International Boat Show and the Air and Sea Show. Together, these assets contribute to a substantial tax base that could include:  Inns, traditional hotels, condominium hotels, and motels, all catering to tourists (primarily families) and convention goers;  For-sale housing, including single-family houses and condominiums for retired people, working singles, and couples without children;  Rental apartments, condominiums, and timeshare/vacation ownership units;  Retail development oriented to tourists, conventioneers, and residents, ranging from neighborhood-serving convenience stores to fine dining and shopping establishments;  Recreational facilities oriented to water and beach activities; and  Outdoor and indoor entertainment. Certain land uses should be excluded from this area, particularly industrial uses--with the exception of those that serve boating and recreational interests--and schools and hospitals. Only marineand community servicerelated office space (such as real estate and health care clinics) should be located in Central Beach.  Initial Observations The panel believes that the following three observations will help the city achieve this vision. First, the city needs to adopt an updated master plan 9  Fort Lauderdale, Florida, November 1015, 2002   International Swimming Hall of Fame Museum and Aquatic Complex Las Ola s Boulev ard  Intracoastal  Water way Terramar Street  Harbor Drive  Pointsettia Street  Bahia Mar  Sunrise Boulevard  Cortez Street  SBMHA eeze Boulevard Seabr  IOA Sebastian Street Alhambra Street Bayshore Drive Riomar Street Seville Street  PRD  Birch Road  NBRA  Birch Road  SLA  ABA  Hugh Taylor Birch State Park  A1A  ABA  Bonnet House  Breakers Avenue  Atlantic Ocean Key: Key: Shoreline and Waterway Shoreline and Waterway SBMHA: South Beach Marina and Hotel Area SBMHA: South Beach Marina and Hotel Area ABA: A1A Beachfront Area ABA: A1A Beachfront Area PRD: Planned Resort Development PRD: Planned Resort Development IOA: Intracoastal Overlook Area IOA: Intracoastal Overlook Area NBRA: North Beach Residential Area NBRA: North Beach Residential Area SLA: Sunrise Lane Area SLA: Sunrise Lane Area Central Beach Regional Activity Center Central Beach Regional Activity Center Central Beach Community Redevelopment Area Central Beach Community Redevelopment Area ULI Study Area ULI Study Area  North  The study area.  with appropriate design guidelines for qualitative, not quantitative, development. The plan should blend hotel, retail, marina, entertainment, residential, public space, and transportation networks into a coherent whole. The city should adhere to this plan in order to provide developers with clarity and consistency. The panel suggests that the plan for Central Beach be developed in concert with the planning efforts currently underway for the downtown. The panel strongly recommends that beach stakeholders be involved in the development of this master plan. An expansion of the Community Redevelopment Area (CRA) to include the entire study area does not appear to be politically supportable at this time. But the panel believes that it will be possible to identify a good number of catalytic initiatives that will trigger appropriate development in Central Beach, including a more clearly defined and understandable plan review and approval process for proposed development. Second, the panel stresses the importance of phasing. What should be done in the short term, and what must be done over the long term? What steps can be taken now? What needs to be set aside until later? There is no magic bullet that will turn everything around, or accomplish all plans in an instant. Retail and entertainment development follow rooftops, so the plan must focus on attracting new tourists and residents to the study area. The panel determined that the market exists to attract these visitors, whether they stay for one night, 60 days,  or a year. To make the beach a magnet, recreation and retail facilities have to be upgraded, the public realm and green space have to be enhanced, big projects already on the drawing board should be advanced, a commitment to reasonable historic preservation should be made, and transportation and parking must be improved. Third, the panel believes that leaders must step forward to champion the cause of beach development and redevelopment. This cause must be a high priority and it must have the necessary support. Central Beach should not be looked upon as an orphan. Leadership is a job, not a position. It creates positive change. The community has many elected officials, staff members, citizens involved in community-based organizations, and consultants, all of whom can become champions for the vision and the improvements required to make it happen. Without leadership, any community will falter and progress will not be achieved.  Recommendations The panel encourages the city of Fort Lauderdale to focus on its market potential. Central Beach's already strong economic base can be expanded with tourism and marine-related economic engines. Street-level retail establishments should be upgraded and the physical appearance of the area's buildings and streetscape improved to help encourage visitors to extend their stays. Historic properties should be revitalized and woven into the fabric of the community. More moderately priced family housing should be developed and a wide array of activities for families should be offered. An Advisory Services Panel Report  10   Thematic Planning Districts Central Beach should be planned according to five thematic planning districts based on each district's distinctive characteristics: a Marina District, a Beach Entertainment District, a Mid-Beach District, a North Beach Community District, and a Sunrise Lane District. To support this recommendation, the panel proposes that the city's existing zoning districts be modified and realigned to better correspond to the proposed thematic planning districts. (For details, see the ""Planning and Design"" section of this report.) The panel also supports the implementation of the transportation network originally proposed by the 1988 ULI panel. This ""four-plus-two"" network would consist of four lanes of two-way traffic on Seabreeze Boulevard (currently southbound A1A) and two lanes of two-way traffic on Fort Lauderdale Beach Boulevard (currently northbound A1A within the CRA). Implementation of this network should be done in tandem with the enforcement of guidelines to create a pedestrian-friendly environment. Improvements for vehicular, bicycle, and pedestrian circulation should be made together with the addition of a beachfront circulator (shuttle). A parking authority should be established and parking facilities located at six scattered sites identified by the panel, including the four public properties that the city has designated for parking. A range of beachfront facilities for visitors also should be developed. (For details, see the ""Transportation"" and ""Parking"" sections within the ""Planning and Design"" section.) Components of an Updated Master Plan The entire Central Beach area should be revitalized and redeveloped to complement, not compete with, the Las Olas retail strip and the downtown. Central Beach should provide a mix of land uses that foster family activities and recreation while also offering opportunities for the expansion of tourist-related facilities and activities. The intersection of A1A and Las Olas Boulevard is the area's ""100 percent corner"" and the core of the proposed Beach Entertainment District. This location affords the opportunity for a major design statement. The district could be enlivened by the addition of a variety of programmed, family-oriented activities with, perhaps, a concert stage and public market. Fort Lauderdale, Florida, November 1015, 2002  The panel recommends building on the 14 catalytic design initiatives identified to create a top-quality experience for tourists and other visitors and residents alike. (See the ""Development Strategies"" section.) In order to establish a regulatory environment that will encourage development, the city must make the development approval process more open and predictable. It should enact a planned unit development (PUD) ordinance. Independent design reviews, perhaps by outside designers, should be conducted and new projects should be brought before the public in a ""Main Street storefront setting,"" perhaps along A1A. The Need for Leadership There seems to be a sense of urgency among community leaders to move forward with Central Beach development. There is also a need for strong leadership empowered by senior political officials: a person who can build coalitions. Development is going to happen, and the city seems to have lost control. Given these circumstances, the panel believes that a champion should be designated for Central Beach. The community must begin to think positively about the beach. The panel describes this process as ""affirmative attention."" Workable compromises on contentious issues must be found. A commitment of greater public investment is required to foster and leverage private investment. That, together with strong leadership, will build confidence within the development community. Activity is vital to create the perception of growth. Special events should be expanded and new development projects should follow a phasing plan. (See the ""Implementation"" section.) In summary, the panel's major recommendations include planning for Central Beach in terms of five thematic planning districts (with some revisions to existing zoning to enforce these conceptual plans); reconfiguring Seabreeze Boulevard and A1A into a four-plus-two, two-way alignment; establishing a parking authority and scattered parking facilities; and identifying a champion for Central Beach. An update of the master plan should focus on defining a vision for the area: a resort community with a beach lifestyle.  11   Market Potential  T  he panel examined Fort Lauderdale's economy and demographic characteristics and identified the drivers of demand for various types of real estate. It also considered current market conditions and trends across an array of land uses, including hotels and other lodging, residential, retail, and office uses. Since the many stakeholders involved in the development approval process have different degrees of understanding of that process, the panel believes it is important for all stakeholders--citizens, public officials, planning staff, developers, brokers, and the like--to understand the due diligence that goes into specific projects. These key items are defined below and include marketability (that is, the amount of market support available for a project), financial feasibility, economic benefit, and fiscal impact. Marketability is defined as the degree to which various factors (such as population expansion and employment growth) will drive demand for certain types of real estate, such as housing or office space. In other words, it determines how much of a market is available to support such uses. Financial feasibility, from a developer's perspective, is the capacity of a project to be financed. This capacity is determined by estimating an annual revenue stream in the form of rents and operating expenses to arrive at a builder's profit margin and the amount of annual income available for debt service. Economic benefit is determined by an economic impact analysis, which measures the effects of specific market activity (such as new development) on an area's overall economy. Impacts include new residents, additional visitors and tourists, tax revenues, employment earnings, and retail spending. In all cases, the important measure is the net new impacts resulting from the development. That is, what does the development add to the jurisdiction's economy that would not  have occurred otherwise? This measure is especially useful to justify the use and cost of public incentives for private development. Economic benefits include both direct benefits--such as the number of construction and permanent jobs created by the new development and property tax revenues generated for the municipality--and indirect ones-- like the additional retail spending generated by those households occupying new housing and tourists staying at new resort facilities. Lastly, fiscal impact analysis allows the public sector to assess the difference between the costs of providing public services and the revenues generated by a specific project, or by development that may follow changes in public policy. These public costs include the operating expenses--such as salaries, supplies, and equipment--associated with providing ongoing services or maintaining the capacity to provide such services, such as fire protection, and the capital (typically one-time) costs associated with the construction of new facilities or infrastructure needed to ensure that the necessary levels of service are maintained. Revenues that help offset operating costs include source contributions such as property taxes and business license fees and intergovernmental transfers. In some jurisdictions, impact fees generated by a new project are dedicated to pay for the capital improvements required by it. Similarly, tax abatement arrangements or the presence of redevelopment project areas also may affect the revenue stream.  Setting the Context: Economic and Demographic Overview In order to determine the market potential for a range of land uses in the study area, the panel examined demographic and economic conditions and trends across Broward County, the city of Fort Lauderdale and, where possible, in the Central  12  An Advisory Services Panel Report   Beach Regional Activity Center (RAC) area. These trends are highlighted below. Population and Households In 2000, Broward County's population totaled 1.6 million, a 30 percent increase over 1990. Much of this population growth was focused in previously undeveloped portions of the county's western end, such as Weston and Pembroke Pines. By comparison, the city of Fort Lauderdale's population increased by only 2 percent during the 1990s--from 149,400 in 1990 to 152,400 in 2000-- which is indicative of the limited supply of developable land remaining in the city. More recently, however, the city annexed Melrose Park in 2001 and Riverland in 2002, which added between 12,000 and 15,000 new residents to the city, for a current population of approximately 167,000. Fort Lauderdale continues to draw newcomers while existing residents move from one residence to another within the city. Approximately 20 percent of the city's newcomers arrived from outside Broward County. Both trends reflect Fort Lauderdale's continuing attractiveness as a place to live as well as the ongoing economic expansion, which began during the boom years of the 1990s. According to U.S. Census data, just under 2,700 people considered Central Beach (Census Tract 421) their permanent residence in 2000. This is less than 2 percent of the city's total population. The median age of Central Beach residents was 54.1 years. The development of the currently proposed or approved residential projects in Central Beach could add approximately 1,200 new residents. This may reinforce opportunities for supporting uses such as convenience and service retail. Employment, Income, and Consumer Spending The economy of south Florida has grown significantly over the past ten years and reflects a dynamic, diversified region. Following similar trends, the service sector represented the largest and most rapidly growing segment of the region's economy. This includes jobs in tourism as well as legal, engineering, financial, and business services. According to the Florida Bureau of Labor Market Information, the metropolitan area (Broward Fort Lauderdale, Florida, November 1015, 2002  County) contained 702,000 jobs in 2001. This figure includes full-time jobs, based on state unemployment insurance contributions. It does not include another 130,000 or so part-time workers and self-employed people. Employment is concentrated in the service (32 percent), retail trade (22 percent), and government (21 percent) sectors, followed by manufacturing and finance/insurance/ real estate (both 7 percent), construction and retail trade (6 percent), and transportation/public utilities (5 percent). Employment growth is a key measure of the future demand for various types of real estate, including office, industrial, and retail space as well as housing units and hotel rooms. Based on employment forecasts prepared by Woods & Poole, a demographic forecasting firm based in Washington, D.C., the Fort Lauderdale metropolitan area is expected to add approximately 177,500 new jobs by 2010. Per capita income in the city of Fort Lauderdale is almost $31,000 per year, more than 25 percent higher than in the county as a whole. Roughly 10 percent of the city's households have incomes greater than $150,000 per year, suggesting significant disposable income to support specialty retail such as that found on Los Olas Boulevard. Average annual household income in the metropolitan area is around $67,000 per year and is forecast to grow to $72,500 by 2010. Consumer retail spending in the Fort Lauderdale area is almost $34,000 per year per household. This is expected to increase by more than 7 percent, after inflation, by 2010. Economic Engines: Tourism- and MarineRelated Uses Tourism continues to be a mainstay of the region's economy because it continues to reinvent itself. This includes major economic drivers, such as the restoration of historic areas like the Art Deco District of South Beach in Miami Beach. The panel believes that the area zoned as the North Beach Residential Area (NBRA)--which the panel reconfigures as the North Beach Community District--offers the strongest opportunity for historic preservation in the study area. The panel supports policy initiatives designed to encourage the preservation and restoration of the housing and 13   Hospitality Definitions In order to facilitate its discussion of hospitality-related development, the panel offers definitions for the following terms, as used in this report:  Hotel. A hotel is a traditional property with a single owner that provides rooms and/or suites for transient occupancy for one or more nights, plus a range of related amenities and ser vices. This includes luxur y, all-suite, and limitedservice properties, most of which have been developed as a major hotel brand.  Condominium Hotel. This hospitality product contains one- and/or two-bedroom units with kitchen facilities that are designated as condominiums, thus permitting the sale of individual units. These units' owner occupants typically spend a limited amount of time in them, and the units are rented as hotel suites for the balance of the year. Condominium hotels also offer hotel-like amenities and services.  Timeshare/Vacation Ownership Properties. This type of property may include studio, one-bedroom, and/or two-bedroom units with full or limited kitchen facilities. Units are sold in increments of one week or more to individual buyers for owner occupancy or trade through a third party. Unsold or unused weeks typically are rented like hotel rooms. These properties offer hotel-like amenities but more limited services.  Hotel with Condominiums. This is a full-service hotel with on-property residential condominiums. The condominiums are sold for seasonal or full-time residence, with hotel amenities and services available to the owners.  at the convention center and attracted approximately 500,000 visitors to see the $1.6 billion worth of boats, mega-yachts, and marine-related services and accessories on display. The panel understands that a key issue for the boat show is the very limited opportunities for expansion, given a dwindling supply of space available for additional marinas. The panel therefore urges the city to identify locations for future marina expansion.  Real Estate Market Conditions The following section highlights current market conditions in the city's real estate market and outlines the panel's recommendations for Fort Lauderdale's Central Beach. Hotel Market For a number of reasons, including the opening of the new Westin Diplomat Resort & Spa in Hollywood--which added more than 1,000 rooms--as well as the softness in the tourism market following 9/11, and a lackluster economy, hotel occupancy rates for 2002 likely will be slightly lower than they were in 2001. According to the CVB, the average daily rate for all Broward County properties in 2001 was $89.52, up from 2000 prices of $86.26. Occupancy across the nearly 31,000 rooms, however, dropped from 70.1 percent in 2000 to 67.3 percent in 2001. The CVB and local hoteliers have responded by redirecting their marketing efforts away from international travelers and toward domestic visitors, particularly those who live within a day's drive, with good results. On the downside, the recent opening of the luxury 1,060-room Westin Diplomat in Hollywood has taken some business away from the high end of the Fort Lauderdale beach market. While the overall market has shown small rate increases over the past five years (growing from $80.74 to $89.52), with occupancy hovering around 70 percent, several market niches appear to hold excellent upside potential for properties within the study area. The Rainbow Alliance of 32 smaller properties has targeted the gay community and shown impressive gains in rates and occupancy. These hotels have closely coordinated their marketing efforts with those of the CVB. In particular, properties An Advisory Services Panel Report  lodging stock. To some extent, this process is already underway--albeit in its infancy--in the form of restoration of smaller properties as bed and breakfast inns (B&Bs). The panel strongly believes that the city should support and reinforce this economic engine. According to the Greater Fort Lauderdale Convention & Visitors Bureau (CVB), Broward County attracted approximately 7.8 million visitors in 2001 with an estimated annual economic impact of $4.8 billion. This includes more than 1.6 million foreign tourists. Broward County has a service-oriented economy, with a higher proportion of retail and service sector jobs and fewer manufacturing sector jobs than the state and the nation. This reflects, in part, the importance of tourism in the local economy. In fact, more than half of all jobs created during the 1990s were in service industries, a wide-ranging sector that includes lodging, engineering, finance, and professional services. The marine industry also plays a significant role in the region's economy. This industry generates $8.8 billion in annual economic impacts to south Florida and is a strong branding identity for the city. The Fort Lauderdale International Boat Show is an important contributor to the city's (and region's) economy; in fact, the 2002 boat show occupied more than 2.5 million square feet of exhibit space 14   that have undertaken significant renovation, such as the Royal Palms Resort and the FlamingoInn Amongst the Flowers, have achieved some of the highest rates in the market. Even those properties that have invested modest sums in renovation, such as those located along Orton Terrace, have seen a turnaround in operating results following a nearly ten-year period of decline. Importantly, customers at these properties typically have higher disposable incomes and tend to spend more on shopping, fine dining, and cultural activities than other tourists. The panel also believes that moderately priced family hotels are a good market fit. Fort Lauderdale's strong suits--the beach, shopping, and easy access--match well with this audience. In 2001, only 21 percent of the area's visitors were part of a family group, suggesting there is room for significant upside growth in this market segment, and hoteliers have indeed reported that they would like to target this group. What is needed is a more coordinated effort among hotel owners and the city to create a family-friendly itinerary, including child-oriented activities such as programmed sports events and watercraft rentals on the beach. Hotel Development Potential. While a number of hotel development projects--with a total of more than 1,600 rooms--are in the pipeline, no new hotel rooms have been built in the study area in the last ten years. (This excludes condominium hotel rooms and fractional ownership units, which are discussed below.) The total inventory of Central Beacharea hotel rooms is approximately 7,200. The 208 rooms at Marriott's BeachPlace Towers, completed in 1997, are timeshare units. For various reasons, the Gold Coast Hotel, the Saint Regis, the Capri, and others have been unable to start construction even with approvals in hand, and the existing Lauderdale Beach Hotel is in the process of being approved for a residential condominium project. Near-term issues clearly make hotel development financing very difficult. Put simply, very little equity is available for new hotel development and lenders typically require 40 percent or more in equity to a fund a loan. However, the panel believes that issues specific to the study area also make Fort Lauderdale, Florida, November 1015, 2002  hotel development problematic. The costs of new construction, coupled with high land costs, make it very difficult to justify ground-up development in a highly seasonal, moderate-rate market. The uncertain timing of approvals also has made it difficult to attract developers. In addition, concerns exist regarding the near-term viability of five-star properties with an average daily rate above $350. None of the proposed high-end properties are actually on the beach, nor can they boast great amenities outside their property boundaries. In contrast, the panel is more optimistic about prospects for a more moderately priced product such as the Pelican Beach Hotel, which also benefits from a beachfront location. Rather than assuming that a high-rise hotel is the best redevelopment solution, property owners on A1A (Fort Lauderdale Beach Boulevard) might be better served by considering a restoration of their existing properties, particularly those that have some  Above: The Atlantic Hotel Condominium will be developed for both hotel and condominium use, which will make it easier to finance than a traditional hotel.

Although construction was scheduled to begin in 2001, the resort's developers have been unable to start construction. The site is located along A1A and Valencia Street near BeachPlace.  15   Several residential and resort towers can be found along Fort Lauderdale's waterfront.  tion Club units, completed in 1997, are 70 percent sold after five years. The panel could not determine whether this sales performance was the result of pricing, amenities, location, or some combination of these factors. Office Market Significant job growth during the 1990s in officeusing sectors of the economy generated sizable demand for office space in Fort Lauderdale's key commercial locations. Broward County contains approximately 20 million square feet of office space. Major submarkets include the downtown and Cypress Creek, near the Fort Lauderdale Hollywood International Airport. Across the county, office vacancy rates have increased during the past year as a result of factors noted below. According to the National Real Estate Index, the county's vacancy rate is around 15 percent. The highest vacancy rates were in the Hollywood and Southwest Broward markets. Since 2001, approximately 2.4 million square feet of new office space has been built throughout the county. The downtown submarket includes 4.7 million square feet of office space, roughly 25 percent of the county's total office inventory. In late 2002, the opening of the Bank of America Plaza at Las Olas City Centre added 1.3 million square feet of new office space to the downtown stock. Downtown office vacancy rates currently are around 20 percent, reflecting a combination of new supply and tenant defaults in a weakened economy generated by the dot-com implosion, corporate downsizing, and job losses. Beyond some marine-related office space and visitor services located at Bahia Mar, Central Beach is not considered a viable office market. Based on anecdotal information, the panel estimates that there are less than 100,000 square feet of office space in various locations across Central Beach, much of it concentrated at Bahia Mar. Office Development Potential. Until the national and regional economies strengthen, with net job growth in office-using sectors, the continuing overhang of vacant office space likely will continue throughout Broward County. The panel supports the substantial public and private economic development efforts to focus commercial office developAn Advisory Services Panel Report  historic interest. The panel also believes that the addition of meeting space in existing and proposed properties would help balance seasonality. Condominium Hotels and Fractional Ownership A hybrid form of ownership, the condominium hotel, allows units to be sold on a fee simple basis in a project that meets the city code definition of a hotel and the state requirement that 75 percent of all units be available at any time for use by transient visitors. The need to raise equity for hotel development, which is highly problematic under current market conditions, is driving this trend because the residential component currently is easier to finance. This financing option for combined hotel and residential use, and the fundamentals of this real estate transaction, must remain viable for a development that still must work as a hotel, since residential uses are not permitted in the A1A Beachfront Area District. Early market results--based on the performance of the Atlantic Hotel Condominium and the Capri, a hotel, timeshare, and retail complex--suggest that there is support for sales prices for these units ranging from $350 to $500 per square foot. These higher sales prices, relative to typical condominiums, are balanced by the smaller unit sizes typically desired by these buyers. What is unknown is how these properties will perform as hotels. Since the owners will be responsible for the properties' operating costs, they will be very sensitive to cash flow and may be less experienced in providing hotel-type amenities. Fractional ownership--including timeshare and other variants--has not yet demonstrated market viability in the study area. The 208 Marriott Vaca16   ment in the central business district, thus reinforcing the downtown as the region's primary employment center. In addition, the panel believes that efforts to add cultural anchors such as the Broward Center for the Performing Arts, as well as new housing, will meet a key objective of creating a ""living downtown"" and strongly encourages these efforts. In its economic development strategy, the city has appropriately identified the need for continued diversification of the tenant base, branding and marketing, and expanding ongoing efforts to attract corporate office tenants. The city also has rightfully acknowledged the importance of increasing the downtown's position as the region's primary employment center. The panel understands that, with the exception of the North Beach Residential Area, the beach zoning districts allow only office space that serves tourist-related uses. In light of the current weak market conditions, the panel supports an expansion of office space to include marine-related uses. The panel learned anecdotally that demand for marine-related office space is strong, and recommends that opportunities to provide for such expansion be identified. As in many mixed-use projects, other uses may generate sufficient demand to support professional and service-related office space consistent with current zoning regulations. The panel identified certain redevelopment sites--particularly those located near the ""100 percent corner"" of Las Olas Boulevard and A1A and/or adjacent to Bahia Mar --that should provide opportunities for professional/ service and marine-related office space, respectively. Professional/service office space would meet the needs of the study area's growing residential market by providing offices for accountants, doctors, dentists, real estate agents, and other professional service firms oriented to serving residents. Marinerelated office space for yacht financing, brokerage insurance, and the like proximate to Bahia Mar-- a key demand generator for such space--also should be considered. Retail Market The Broward County retail market contains roughly 43 million square feet of retail space, or 26.5 square Fort Lauderdale, Florida, November 1015, 2002  feet per resident, which is above the national average of 17 square feet per capita and reflects the importance of tourist-related spending in the county. According to the National Real Estate Index, the county's retail vacancy rate stood at 11 percent at the end of 2001. This was the highest of the three counties that comprise south Florida (Miami-Dade, Palm Beach, and Broward), and has increased from 9.5 percent in 1999 as a result of new deliveries of retail space, particularly groceryanchored community retail centers in growing areas at the western end of the county. Total taxable retail spending by visitors to greater Fort Lauderdale was $4.1 billion in 2001. This includes almost $2 billion spent in restaurants and another $763 million spent on miscellaneous retail, including apparel, photo supplies, and gifts. This translates into $255 in food and beverage spending and $98 in retail spending per visitor, respectively. Approximately 40 percent of all visitors shop and 32 percent eat out when visiting greater Fort Lauderdale; 46 percent go to the beach. In comparison, the retail inventory in Central Beach is much smaller. The panel estimates that approximately 270,000 square feet of street-level retail space is located along A1A. This includes the 100,000 square feet of retail and restaurants located on three levels at the mixed-use BeachPlace project. The panel understands that the retail component of BeachPlace--the premier retail project along A1A--has exhibited substantial turnover since it opened in 1997, including the loss of the Gap and Banana Republic stores. Its inwardfacing, multilevel design is problematic. Anecdotal information on retail rents for streetlevel space in the study area indicates that, in some locations, rents are above $40 per square foot. The Palazzo Las Olas project has proposed 76,300 square feet of retail space, including the urban grocery prototype for a 25,000-square-foot supermarket. The evolution of Las Olas Boulevard's commercial space into a pedestrian-scale retail corridor containing high-end and specialty retail and destination restaurants is an economic development success story. The panel strongly encourages the city to use public policies to enhance and protect this 17   BeachPlace, a mixed-use project with 100,000 square feet of commercial space located along A1A, suffers from high tenant turnover, which likely is caused by a lack of visibility for the interior retail spaces. The project was completed in 1997 and includes 208 hotel/timeshare units.  as facade improvements. In addition, while the city made substantial strides during the 1990s with streetscape improvements to A1A, these efforts need to be reinforced and refocused with additional improvements to the public realm. Physical improvements and the creation of a high-quality gathering place in Central Beach will convey to the private sector the city's commitment to the beach and should leverage subsequent private investment, particularly for commercial uses such as street-level retail. In addition, the panel believes that high-quality destination restaurants in specific parts of the study area--particularly in the Beach Entertainment District--are an important element in attracting visitors and residents alike, which in turn will help make the beach a destination of casual sophistication. The panel noted with concern the recent turnover associated with several whitetablecloth restaurants such as Evangelines and Mistral (now Pastabilities). This suggests that developers must carefully consider the economic feasibility of future retail and restaurant space, including the judicious use of focused public incentives to enhance the overall feasibility of such establishments. New housing in the study area also will generate some demand for convenience and local-serving retail that meets the daily needs of area residents. Efforts should be made to direct such retail to specific locations that provide high visibility, easy access, and on-street parking. Market analysis suggests that demand generated by new residents will, nevertheless, be limited. Assuming that all proposed housing projects are built, the 800 or so new households will generate approximately $25.2 million in annual retail spending. If Central Beach succeeds in capturing only 5 percent of these expenditures, this translates into roughly 5,000 square feet of supportable retail space, assuming annual productivity of $250 per square foot. Similarly, these new households could be expected to spend $2.4 million in annual restaurant sales. If new restaurants succeed in capturing, say, 10 percent of these expenditures, this would support only 800 square feet of restaurant space, assuming annual productivity of $350 per square foot, which is typical of a good white-tablecloth restaurant. An Advisory Services Panel Report  district. The panel does not, however, believe that extending this specialty retail district to the beach is an appropriate--or market-supportable--action. Retail Development Potential. Opportunities for retail development in the study area need to be very clearly focused. The high tenant turnover at BeachPlace is emblematic of the difficulties associated with capturing the retail expenditures of beach visitors. If 46 percent of the visitors to greater Fort Lauderdale visit the beach during their stay, as reported by the CVB, this suggests annual beach visitation on the order of 3.6 million people. Notably, this excludes local residents, who also visit the beach. Since the panel has not examined information on retail performance (such as sales per square foot) of existing retail tenants located along A1A, it is difficult to gauge the degree to which these retailers succeed in capturing the retail dollars available from beach visitors. The panel's observations, however, suggest that street-level retail in the study area is characterized by limited-quality merchandise and price points. While there is an obvious need to provide beachgoers with convenience and support goods such as t-shirts and sundries, the panel believes that there is substantial retail leakage of these visitor dollars to other retail destinations in greater Fort Lauderdale. This suggests that further research is critical to identify opportunities to extend the stay of beach visitors with additional activities to meet the objective of creating a sustainable resort community. The panel also supports public policy initiatives designed to improve the physical appearance of the study area's street-level retail frontage, such 18   This preliminary analysis reveals the importance of capturing a range of expenditures on dining from various market segments, not only from new residents but also from existing residents, people who live elsewhere in Broward County, beach visitors, and convention delegates. Residential Development The panel also examined housing market conditions and trends. It found that the Central Beach Regional Activity Center (RAC) currently contains approximately 3,200 housing units. The threshold currently allowed by the comprehensive plan is 5,500 units. While approximately 800 units have been assigned in proposed projects currently in the pipeline, this leaves an estimated 1,500 units to be developed in the future. The city estimates that approximately 1,100 housing units have been built in the study area since 1994. This corresponds to annual delivery of 140 units per year and suggests that it would take approximately ten years to build out the 1,500 unassigned units. The panel understands that hard and soft development costs are in the range of $150 to $175 per square foot. Land costs are estimated at $50,000 to $75,000 per unit. According to local brokers and developers, prices of condominium units on the beach range from $250 to $375 per square foot, with pricing dictated by amenities such as unit finishes, location, and water views. Residential Development Potential. The panel concurs that achieving the vision of a resort community with a beach lifestyle requires a blended balance of residential and hospitality development as well as appropriate levels of supporting amenities such as retail and restaurants. To that end, the panel offers qualified support for new housing in Central Beach. However, the panel notes that there is an overarching need to focus on design  guidelines to ensure high-quality, attractive residential projects that enhance the overall physical environment and lifestyle of Central Beach. These issues are discussed further in the ""Planning and Design"" section of this report. The panel believes that the North Beach Residential Area (NBRA), reconfigured somewhat as the North Beach Community District, offers the strongest opportunity for historic preservation in the study area and supports policy initiatives designed to encourage preservation and restoration of this area's housing and lodging stock. To some extent, this process already is underway--albeit in its infancy--as the gay community is restoring smaller properties as B&Bs. This investment is significant, and already is paying dividends in the form of high occupancies and high room rates among lodging properties oriented to gay visitors. The panel therefore feels that judicious public investment in infrastructure, streetscape, and public open-space improvements, as well as housing code enforcement policies and zoning restrictions that limit building heights and prevent the development of high-rise buildings in the NBRA--particularly in a multiblock area adjacent to Birch Road--will serve as effective public initiatives to reinforce private investment in the NBRA's housing (and lodging) stock. The area contains a sufficient number of buildings worthy of historic preservation and protection to create an inviting, attractive residential neighborhood. In addition, the area will require branding to enhance its identity and draw. To this end, the panel suggests that the NBRA be given a name, such as NoBe.  Fort Lauderdale, Florida, November 1015, 2002  19   Planning and Design  W  ith 455 acres of land area as well as two miles of shoreline along the Atlantic Ocean and the Intracoastal Waterway, Central Beach is a complex mixture of building types, land uses, street patterns, and open space. A plan for this area must deal with complex market forces, tourist and resident interests, public spaces, recreation, traffic, and density issues. A strong vision will be needed to guide the area's future development. At the present time, development is happening in response to market forces and a very unpredictable review and approval process. Guidelines for building heights and densities often conflict with the zoning code's intent and purpose. Aside from a general appreciation of the Central Beach area, the zoning code and development guidelines offer no clear plan for civic space, open space, or historic preservation. A vision is needed that will set these priorities in both the public and private realms.  Each of these districts has its own character, based on physical and land use characteristics that include location, street patterns, existing development, traffic, open space, building typology, civic uses, and the waterfront. The panel suggests that an understanding of each district's character will make it easier to guide and regulate new development to achieve the vision the city is seeking to develop. The panel stresses that it is not offering a master plan, but rather a series of design principles and initiatives that begin to arrange land uses. The city will need to develop a more detailed plan to fully explore and refine the recommendations presented in this report. Marina District This district is located at the southern end of the study area, with Bahia Mar at its center. Bahia Mar contains the highest concentration of boat slips in the Central Beach area and is the core of the area's boating industry. It is an important economic generator, not only for the study area but for the city and the region. The annual Fort Lauderdale International Boat Show attracts members of all age and income groups. Bahia Mar is an important anchor and gateway to the southern end of the beach. The panel recommends that the ongoing improvements in this district continue to reinforce the area as a center for hotels, conference facilities, marinas, and other compatible uses. The Marina District also contains the International Swimming Hall of Fame Museum and Aquatic Complex, an internationally known facility that is considering plans to relocate to another city. Across Seabreeze Boulevard is D.C. Alexander Park, the only sizable (1.2-acre) public green space in Central Beach. A portion of the southern end of the study area east of A1A across from Bahia Mar currently is used as a public surface parking lot and is expected to continue as such. The beach there is wide and heavily used. The landscaping along An Advisory Services Panel Report  Thematic Planning Districts To help organize the study area, the panel divided it into five overlapping planning districts. Based on panel members' experiences in similar urban situations, the panel determined that each district's radius should be no greater than the distance people are willing to walk, which is roughly 1,200 to 1,500 feet. Using this criterion, and the distinctive character of each area, the beach can be divided into the following five thematic planning districts:  Marina District;  Beach Entertainment District;  Mid-Beach District;  North Beach Community District; and  Sunrise Lane District. 20   Las Ola s Boulev ard  International Swimming Hall of Fame Museum and Aquatic Complex  Intracoastal Water way  Harbor Drive  Terramar Street  Bahia Mar  Sunrise Boulevard Sebastian Street Alhambra Street Bayshore Drive Seville Street Riomar Street  Pointsettia Street  Cortez Street  eeze Boulevard Seabr  Birch Road  Birch Road  Bonnet House  Hugh Taylor Birch State Park Breakers Avenue  A1A feet  +  1 Atlantic Ocean Key: Shoreline and Waterway 1 Marina District 2 Beach Entertainment District 3 Mid-Beach District 4 North Beach Community District 5 Sunrise Lane District  1,200  4 2 3  5  North  Thematic planning districts.  A1A in this gateway area needs to be improved with special planting and signage that announce one's arrival to the beach from the 17th Street Bridge crossing. Beach Entertainment District This district should become the entertainment center for tourists and residents alike. It presently contains the greatest concentration of retail, restaurant, and entertainment uses in Central Beach. BeachPlace--a 100,000-square-foot shopping, dining, and entertainment complex--has been struggling in its efforts to establish a retail/ entertainment venue. Las Olas Boulevard provides excellent access to this district as well as a direct connection to the downtown across the Intracoastal Waterway. Bus access is readily available. This district also presents the greatest opportunity for new development and redevelopment because of existing vacant sites located within it, the Las Olas Intracoastal Municipal Parking Lot and adjacent redevelopment property, and the Oceanside Municipal Parking Lot, both of which are under city control and are located along Las Olas Boulevard. The panel envisions this district as a mixed-use area composed of entertainment, retail, restaurants, and tourist attractions as well as residential Fort Lauderdale, Florida, November 1015, 2002  Above: With development restricted along the beach side of A1A, Central Beach offers an unobstructed view of the ocean not found in other parts of Fort Lauderdale. Left: The Venetian, a residential property, can be seen in the foreground, next to the International Swimming Hall of Fame.  21   The panel recommends that the beachfront in this district be planned as an active beach, through the addition of volleyball nets; retail kiosks selling sunscreen, bottled water, and other convenience goods; and water sport rentals, as permitted. A new public beach pavilion in D.C. Alexander Park, across from the International Swimming Hall of Fame, could offer more substantial conveniences, such as restrooms, lockers, food concessions, firstaid and lifeguard facilities, and a police substation. This pavilion would be located in the area where the Marina District and the Beach Entertainment District overlap. The panel proposes that A1A be realigned as a two-way traffic route through this district. Landscaping and paving treatments could identify the district as a special place. The sidewalk/promenade space on both sides of A1A needs to be widened to accommodate strollers and outdoor cafs. This could be done by requiring larger setbacks for new development on the west side of A1A, as well as by possibly reducing traffic lane widths, as recommended by proponents of traffic calming. Special lighting and street furniture also would help identify the promenade as a place to see and be seen. Street-level retail space, landscaping, and pedestrian crossing amenities should be developed along Las Olas Boulevard to emphasize this east/west vehicular connector while also accommodating pedestrian movement. Poinsettia and Cortez streets also are particularly critical as east/west connectors. Finally, a public market could be planned for the site west of Seabreeze Boulevard between Las Olas and the International Swimming Hall of Fame. This could become an important public space that caters to local residents and tourists alike seeking fresh fish, flowers, produce, crafts, and other local products in an open-air marketplace setting. Mid-Beach District This district is located at the narrowest section of the barrier island, between Riomar and Cortez streets. It overlaps the Beach Entertainment District to the south and the North Beach Community District to the north. The Mid-Beach District acts as a transitional area leading into the more An Advisory Services Panel Report  Above: The Las Olas Intracoastal Municipal Parking Lot is located near the public marina.

A key component will be the redevelopment of the Oceanside Municipal Parking Lot into a great civic park space designed to accommodate outdoor performances and other public uses and attractions. The panel recommends that this surface lot be replaced with a parking structure integrated into the new development. Retail and restaurant uses could be integrated into the ground floor of the garage. Along with the site north of Las Olas Boulevard envisioned to be redeveloped for retail and entertainment uses as well as public parking, the intersection of Las Olas Boulevard and A1A should become the grand gateway to the beach. A tall ""lighthouse tower"" could mark this gateway and become a landmark for Central Beach. Redevelopment of the Las Olas Intracoastal Municipal Parking Lot as a mixed-use project featuring residential and retail space as well as a marina and public parking will add critical mass to the district. 22   residential community to its north. The area presently is characterized by large-scale projects-- including the Sheraton Yankee Trader hotel and BeachPlace, which is located in the area where the Beach Entertainment District and the Mid-Beach District overlap. The projects now planned for this district are also large in scale and include the 24-story Saint Regis, a timeshare and residential condominium project. Parcels along the Intracoastal Waterway continue to be redeveloped for residential uses. Except for the Intracoastal Waterway frontage, the blocks in this district are large and lend themselves to larger-scale projects, either hotel or residential, along the beachfront. Beach facilities and activities in this area could begin to cater more to families. Public restrooms are needed for beachgoers not staying at local hotels. Within the CRA boundaries, A1A should revert to two lanes in each direction where it currently splits between the intersections of Fort Lauderdale Beach Boulevard and Seabreeze Boulevard on the south, and Fort Lauderdale Beach Boulevard and Alhambra Street on the north. Traffic moves swiftly here. Pedestrian-crossing improvements, including stop lights, are needed in this district, as discussed in the ""Transportation"" section. North Beach Community District This district already is experiencing a certain amount of development, with smaller properties being restored as residences and guest quarters. Its neighborhood scale is unique to this district and is worthy of preservation with selective and compatible new residential and hotel development. The district is located between the historic Bonnet House to the north and Bayshore Drive to the south. The North Beach community is a diverse one composed primarily of one- to four-story residences and small motels and hotels. Also known as Birch Oceanfront Estates, this neighborhood was platted in 1946 and grew to include a collection of architecture from the 1940s through the 1960s. Although only some of the buildings are architecturally significant, the neighborhood's structures together form a cohesive beachfront community. Structures currently are being refurbished and used as quest quarters by local residents as well Fort Lauderdale, Florida, November 1015, 2002  Above: A view of the MidBeach District, as seen from the public marina near the Palazzo Las Olas site.

Demolition has been ongoing as parcels are assembled for larger projects, but the character of the district is still intact and is worth preserving from both an architectural and a marketing point of view. Two other areas exist within the North Beach Community District: parcels adjacent to the Intracoastal Waterway and parcels fronting on A1A and the ocean. These areas may be subject to greater development pressures because of their waterfront location and require further study as to how new construction there can relate to the district's smaller buildings. Birch Road--the north/south spine of this district--currently is wide and not pedestrian friendly. The panel recommends that Birch Road become a narrower, landscaped neighborhood street. It also recommends that Broward County Transit buses be rerouted to Birch Road to better serve neighborhood residents. Finally, the panel recommends that a public square be developed at the intersection of Birch Road and Terramar Street, to serve as a neighborhood park. All the streets in the district should be designed and landscaped at a scale that is consistent with a resort community theme.  Sunrise Lane District The area north of the Bonnet House and south of Sunrise Boulevard has been designated the Sunrise Lane District. This area contains a mix of hotel, retail, and residential uses. The neighborhood is isolated from the rest of Central Beach because of the location of the Bonnet House, which serves to isolate the area. Within the district, Breakers Avenue eliminates an east/west connection through the neighborhood, resulting in residential uses on the west side and commercial, retail, and hotel uses on the east. The entrance to the Bonnet House is located within the neighborhood where Breakers Avenue and Northeast Ninth Street intersect. Thus its entrance is not off a major street and is hard to find. Greater visibility is needed to fully exploit the value of this tourist attraction. A canal off the Intracoastal Waterway bisects the western portion of the district and adds to its ambience. The area east of Breakers Avenue is mostly commercial. Redevelopment has been difficult because of a lack of available parking. The panel suggests that the city develop a public parking facility in this area to serve local businesses as well as beachgoers visiting the northern part of the beach.

The city's land use designations within the Central Beach RAC--which consist of six zoning districts--are discussed below, along with a description of the ""intent and purpose"" of each zoning district.  Planned Resort Development (PRD). This zoning district's purpose is to ""promote the central beach as a destination resort and a world class resort.""  A1A Beachfront Area (ABA). Its purpose is to ""promote high quality destination resort.""  Sunrise Lane Area (SLA). Its purpose is to ""encourage the preservation of existing structures.""  Intracoastal Overlook Area (IOA). Its purpose is to ""encourage the preservation and revitalize existing structures.""  North Beach Residential Area (NBRA). Its purpose is to ""encourage the preservation and revitalize existing structures."" Fort Lauderdale, Florida, November 1015, 2002   South Beach Marina and Hotel Area (SBMHA). Its purpose is to ""promote high quality destination resort uses."" The intent and purpose of these zoning districts clearly reflects two primary goals for redevelopment within Central Beach: the creation of a destination resort and the preservation and revitalization of the existing built environment. Projects that recently have been built, approved, or are under construction have, for the most part, adhered to the uses permitted within Central Beach as defined in the Unified Land Development Regulations (ULDR) zoning code, although there is growing pressure from the development community to introduce residential uses into the ABA zoning district. Although existing ULDR dimensional requirements for the barrier island permit and promote high-density projects, the guidelines for bulk, height, and setbacks are in direct conflict with the intent and purpose of many of the zoning districts, including the concept of promoting preservation and revitalization within the SLA, IOA, and NBRA zones. The conflict between the language in the code and the approved projects creates uncertainty in the development approval process for both the development community and the city's residents.  Proposed zoning.  25   Sailboats anchored in the Intracoastal Waterway await passage under Sunrise Boulevard.  In an effort to rectify this situation, the panel offers the following recommendations:  The city must either change the ""intent and purpose"" language in the zoning code or enforce the present language. Once a decision is made, it must be adhered to. The ULDR design guidelines are contradictory and thus difficult to use and interpret. They must be clarified and made consistent with a vision for the study area.  The PRD zone should be extended north to Alhambra Street and south to Harbor Drive. The descriptions of the IOA, NBRA, and ABA zones should be rewritten to eliminate conflicting statements, and a new approach to height, density, and setbacks should be adopted. The IOA zone should extend only as far north as Riomar Street and the NBRA zone should extend east to the beach. The panel's intent is to create a low-rise community with mid-rise development on the beach-- complete with community-based convenience shops and restaurants, pocket parks, and squares--in this zone.  The SLA zone is in alignment with the zoning code's ""intent and purpose"" language and does not need to be changed.  The SBMHA zone should include more public facilities to complement the southern part of Central Beach. The panel suggests that these should include public restrooms, a centralized police substation, and an information center/ kiosk.  The city should start to develop a building-type zoning code in lieu of the present performancebased zoning code. This approach would better 26  illustrate the actual built environment that is allowed by code. A PUD designation, for example, requires architectural solutions to issues of use, height, setbacks, and the like. The Pedestrian Environment The ultimate goal of the zoning and design guidelines for Central Beach should be to create and protect a pedestrian-friendly environment. The existing zoning and design guidelines present a confusing dichotomy between a zoning code that encourages high-density, high-rise development and design guidelines that promote the development of a low-rise, pedestrian-friendly community but often are not enforced. One example of this ""tug of war"" is the design guidelines for pedestrian portals. Although these guidelines are largely adequate to produce a pedestrian-friendly environment, they unfortunately have not been enforced. What has been implemented to date is a maximum-development (high-density, high-rise), pedestrian-unfriendly strategy. Such competing strategies must be resolved. The required 20-foot sidewalk in the PRD zone appears to be adequate to promote the storefront promenade concept endorsed by the panel. An aggressive canopy/awning/arcade campaign also could help promote this concept. So would the extension of the PRD zone to Alhambra Street and the construction of a new parking facility on cityowned property at the Alhambra-Sebastian Block and Municipal Parking Lot, possibly as part of a mid-sized mixed-use project. Making Central Beach as pedestrian friendly as possible also will require the development of a combination of traffic control (calming) and conveAn Advisory Services Panel Report   nient parking strategies. Parking convenience is measured by the quickness and ease of access to parking from roadways, and then by how close the parking is to the destination. Parking also can be used as an anchor to enhance pedestrian movement. (See the ""Parking"" section below for a more detailed discussion.) Special environmental graphics, including gateway and informational signage and wayfinding systems, also are tremendously important elements in the creation of any pedestrian- and userfriendly community. Entranceway and districtspecific identification and signage help enhance a sense of place and make it easier for people to navigate and use beach-area services. Graphics that identify special events as well as key projects and businesses also can be a revenue generator. To improve the pedestrian environment within Central Beach, the panel offers the following recommendations:  The present design guidelines--which outline how to create and reinforce a pedestrian environment at the streetscape level--need to be adhered to and enforced. Ultimately, adherence to these standards will create a special sense of place from which all residents, visitors, and businesses can enjoy benefits.  In conjunction with architectural guidelines, signage, environmental graphics, and wayfinding systems should be a number-one priority. This will contribute to the strategic goal of creating a ""resort community with a beach lifestyle."" The city should develop a signage code for the various zones or thematic planning districts. This signage code should aim to enhance each area's unique identity. In conjunction with the signage and environmental graphics that will contribute to creating an identity for Central Beach, the city also should encourage the inclusion of public artwork.  The city should develop--in conjunction with the signage code--a landscaping code and strategic landscaping plan. Central Beach needs to be ""greened"" so that it truly feels like a tropical resort community. Fort Lauderdale, Florida, November 1015, 2002  A Resort Community A resort community is defined by its real estate and the associated activities that take place within it. Components of a resort community typically include the following land uses:  Hotels, Motels, and Inns. These lodging facilities cater to vacationing tourists, convention goers, and other travelers.  For-Sale Residential. This category includes single-family houses and condominiums oriented to retired people, working singles, and couples without children.  Rental Residential. This category includes apartments, condominiums, and timeshare units.  Retail. Retail uses in resort communities typically are oriented to meeting the needs of tourists, conference attendees, and local residents. Dining opportunities range from casual to white-tablecloth restaurants. Shopping options range from convenience to tourist-oriented retail. Other retail uses could include services for residents, if the residential population grows along with tourism.  Recreation. Recreational uses in waterfront resort communities typically are oriented to water- and beach-related outdoor and indoor entertainment, such as music, themed events (like those held at the International Swimming Hall of Fame), and theater. Other types of sports activities also are available within or near the community.  Office. Office uses in resort communities typically house tourism, marine, or community services; realty offices; and dentists' and doctors' offices. A resort community such as that envisioned for Central Beach typically would exclude industrial uses, hospitals, and major business development. In the long term, schools might be built to support an expanded resident population.   Several water taxi stops should be added at key strategic locations along the Intracoastal Waterway. This will further enhance the pedestrianfriendly resort concept. Kiosks to help identify the stops and provide shelter while people wait for the water taxis would make the water taxis even more convenient. A Review of Goals and Objectives While the panel found the 1988 and 1989 revitalization and redevelopment plans to be basically sound, some updating, enhancing, and clarification are needed. Several of the goals identified in the revitalization plan that need to be revised because of changes in the tourism and residential development industries are discussed below.  Enhance the resort image of Central Beach as a place for tourists and conference groups. The 27   original goal of creating a tourist destination resort is still valid. To ensure that this occurs, the area's key asset--the beach--must be maintained. Beachfront facilities for tourists and visitors should be expanded. The original concept of a lifeguard station/restroom/police substation also remains valid. More activities need to be provided on the beach for tourists and visitors. The goal of making the beach a destination for conference groups is a long-term one that will be dependent on the creation of business-oriented hotels. This may conflict with the goal of creating a resort that appeals to families and international travelers. One possible resolution might involve including conference facilities in the SBMHA zone and making them part of the ""marina"" experience.  Make the beach an integral part of the city for local residents. Because it is located on a barrier island, Central Beach is physically removed from the rest of Fort Lauderdale. Local residents will be attracted to the beach by convenience, popular activities, and a feeling of safety. Easyto-find and -use parking close to the beach, popular recreational activities that are in harmony with the environment, cultural venues, and public artwork can build on the beach's tremendous natural resource.  Improve circulation for cars, bicycles, and pedestrians. Circulation in the study area already is improving. The most important work yet to be done is the creation of a truly pedestrianfriendly environment. By promoting pedestrian movement on the promenade and along the portal streets with special crosswalks, sun and rain protection, and adequate lighting at night, the city can establish the core beach area--the area surrounding the intersection of Las Olas Boulevard and A1A--as a pedestrian zone. Bicycle rental shops and bicycle stands also would be an appropriate addition.  Create a positive visual image of Central Beach through design guidelines. The process of establishing design guidelines has begun. It needs to be updated to reflect the latest thinking in resort design and consumer tastes. The present guidelines are a good base from which to start, 28  but they should be revised to provide more explicit detail.  Examine and augment the regulatory framework to encourage development. This remains an important goal of the revitalization plan. The regulatory process needs to be clarified. The contradictions between the revitalization plan and the zoning code must be resolved.  Create a facilities plan for city services on the beach. City services on the beach need to be expanded. Highly visible restrooms, information centers/kiosks, and safety and security measures will make the beach more user friendly.  Transportation Progress has been made in improving Fort Lauderdale's transportation network in recent years, but much remains to be done. Transportation on the barrier island should be convenient, easy to understand, reliable, and of an appropriate scale and appearance for a resort community. It should accommodate the differing needs of employees, residents, overnight guests, and day visitors. Right now, circulation is too restricted, parking is inappropriately located near the beach, and an untidy jumble of streets bears witness to unfinished business. Key elements of the transportation system include the street network, walkways and bicycle routes, transit, water routes, and signage. Each of these is discussed in turn below. Street Network Highway A1A dominates circulation on the barrier island. Traffic approaches Central Beach via 17th Street (with 27 percent of the total), Las Olas Boulevard (22 percent), and Sunrise Boulevard (51 percent). The posted speed limit along A1A is 30 miles per hour. The current traffic pattern has northbound traffic in two lanes on A1A and southbound traffic in two lanes on Seabreeze Boulevard. Detailed design documents now nearing completion would expand Seabreeze Boulevard, south of Las Olas Boulevard, to a two-way road by adding a single northbound lane to the two existing southbound lanes. However, the one-way traffic flow is planned to continue along the A1A oceanAn Advisory Services Panel Report   view highway (Fort Lauderdale Beach Boulevard) as the primary pattern within the boundaries of the CRA. Considerable congestion occurs on weekends in peak seasons, with seven to eight hours of congestion per day, about double the amount during the off-peak season. While weekends are the busiest times, weekend peak-hour volumes counted in 2000 showed only a modest increase (generally 6 to 7 percent) over weekday volumes. On the A1A/ Seabreeze couplet, the existing two lanes in each direction generally are adequate to carry today's volumes, although the system is effectively at capacity during peak periods. Between Las Olas Boulevard and Sebastian Street, little capacity remains to handle traffic from any additional development. The A1A/Seabreeze couplet has greatly improved beachfront activity, largely by making the area more pedestrian friendly. However, the one-way traffic flow requires all traffic--whether commuter, resident, sightseer, overnight guest, transit, or delivery service--to use A1A and Seabreeze Boulevard. Some of these trip purposes should be separated to balance their competing demands and, ultimately, to gain needed capacity. Beachgoers and sightseers should have the choice of driving leisurely along the beach, while others should have a quicker alternative. The city's effort to make Seabreeze Boulevard a two-way street south of Las Olas Boulevard is an initial step in addressing this issue. The 1988 ULI panel recommended two-way traffic throughout Central Beach, with an ultimate scheme of four lanes on Seabreeze Boulevard-- which then would serve as a beach bypass--and two lanes on A1A. The objective of this ""four-plustwo"" network is to:  Offer drivers more choices in moving around Central Beach;  Reduce traffic volume along the beach--leaving A1A primarily for sightseers and beachgoers-- and offer residents and others an alternative to getting caught up in beach traffic;  Create a more pedestrian-friendly beachfront; Fort Lauderdale, Florida, November 1015, 2002   Provide adequate capacity for future development; and  Offer alternative routes for transit, service, and delivery traffic. Another benefit of the four-plus-two scheme is that it offers the opportunity to reconfigure some currently jumbled streets. Intersection improvements will be required at the southern end of the existing one-way pair--which also provides access to the South Beach Municipal Parking Lot--and at the northern end, around Sebastian Street. A proper intersection at Sebastian Street and Birch Road also would be desirable, to eliminate redundancy where these streets parallel one another. Simplifying circulation patterns will create greater clarity, eliminate unnecessary pavement, and reduce the need for ""do not enter"" and ""no left turn"" signs. A theme that arose throughout the panel's interviews and discussions was the need to improve circulation. The panel reiterates the 1988 panel's recommendation, and strongly believes that a two-way flow using the four-plus-two scheme will do much to alleviate traffic concerns and provide greater compatibility with a residential and resort setting. The panel recommends some specific improvements to Birch Road. This oversized road is approximately 48 feet wide north of Bayshore Drive and 36 feet wide south of it. Birch Road serves a residential area and should be redesigned as a  A view along Seabreeze Boulevard heading south near Sebastian Street shows the mixed scale of buildings in the MidBeach District.  29   Palm trees planted by a low wall along a roadway show the effectiveness of streetscape improvements.  narrower neighborhood street, with traffic lanes that are approximately 28 feet wide. It should have a speed limit of 25 miles per hour (mph). It also could serve as the spine for Broward County Transit routes, as it once did. Restoring transit service to Birch Road would put commuter routes closer to the residents who would use them and would reduce heavy-vehicle traffic on A1A. It also would make transit routes more visible, since both directions of travel would be on one street rather than two, as happens now. The planned streetscape improvements for this road generally would accomplish this, although designs should provide for transit stops. Walkways and Bicycle Routes The core beach area should be primarily a pedestrian area. As the center of public activities and the heart of commercial functions, this area generates the highest number of pedestrians anywhere along the beach. In this pedestrian realm (and throughout the barrier island's residential/hotel areas), traffic should be controlled accordingly. Speed limits should be 25 mph. Only south of Harbor Street and north of Bayshore Drive should the speed limit on A1A increase to 30 mph. Sidewalk widths should be maximized. Space should be reclaimed from poorly located poles and street furniture so that walkways can be as wide as possible. Buildings abutting sidewalks should 30  be designed with pedestrian needs in mind. Traffic signals should give pedestrians generous crossing times. Bicycle routes currently are provided by marked lanes on A1A and along Las Olas Boulevard and should be retained. Under the four-plus-two scheme, an additional bike lane should be marked on both A1A and Seabreeze Boulevard. Transit Broward County Transit runs two routes on the barrier island, Routes 11 and 40. Both run on A1A and Seabreeze Boulevard north of Las Olas Boulevard. About 625 people board these buses in the study area each day. Transit customers in this area include resident commuters, service employees, and tourists. The presence of large buses (or other large vehicles) on the core sections of A1A is not appropriate. Relocating transit routes to Birch Road/ Seabreeze Boulevard under the four-plus-two scheme would be more appropriate and would put transit routes closer to the residents and work sites that need them. While tourists visiting the beach do use transit, the routine trip brings them to Seabreeze Boulevard. Consolidating Broward County Transit routes on Seabreeze Boulevard would improve route visibility and should be acAn Advisory Services Panel Report   companied by improved signage and stops amenities such as shelters, benches, and trash cans. The city should consider installing a beachfront circulator to help visitors travel up and down the beach, at least on peak days. Such a circulator could operate between Bahia Mar and the south beach parking area and Sunrise Lane. It would operate solely on Fort Lauderdale Beach Boulevard (A1A)--assuming implementation of the fourplus-two scheme--and should feature open-air vehicles with a distinctive beach theme. Frequent service, with ten- to 15-minute headways, could be achieved by using seven vehicles. This service should be free to its users, and therefore would require a subsidy. Potential funding sources could include business/property owner assessments, parking fund revenues, tourism taxes, or monies from the city's general fund. If the circulator were to run ten to 14 hours per day, 221 days per year, the operating cost would be approximately $440,000 per year. (This reflects the following calculations: The panel assumes that from one to seven vehicles would operate, depending on the time of day. For a 12-hour service day, one vehicle would run for six hours, four would run for four hours, and seven would run for two hours. This works out to 36 vehicle hours per day, 221 days per year, at $55 per hour, or 36 x 221 x 55 = $437,580.) Water Routes One of Fort Lauderdale's unique features is its waterbus and water taxi service. This is a rare and highly desirable form of transportation. Additional stops could be incorporated into the existing routes, thereby connecting new destinations to attract more residents and visitors. For example, in addition to its current destinations--which include the Galleria mall and the downtown--the waterbus could serve the marina and public market area, the North Beach community (if an appropriate landing can be created near the convergence of Antioch Avenue, Riomar Street, and Bayshore Drive), the Bonnet House, and Hugh Taylor Birch State Park. Recent experience shows a ready market for this high-quality service, which could continue to grow if promoted properly, in conjunction with improved pedestrian linkages and additional destinations. Fort Lauderdale, Florida, November 1015, 2002  Because the water taxi is an attractive and potentially efficient way to travel on the Intracoastal Waterway, the panel suggests that its routes be expanded and publicity increased to encourage greater use.  Signage One's arrival on the barrier island should be noted with appropriate gateway signage. Throughout the study area, directional and regulatory signs are inadequately sized, improperly located, and poorly maintained. No area is spared: traffic, transit, parking and waterbus signs all miss the mark. Altogether, they are simply inappropriate to a resort setting. Suitable graphic standards and placement criteria for the barrier island should be defined to improve the effectiveness of signage and enhance the area's image. There is no surer indication of neglect and oversight than a faded, leaning, rusty sign, which reflects poorly on the entire community.  Parking According to a 1998 parking study, demand exceeds the system's effective capacity--which is defined as approximately 90 percent of total capacity, to account for turnover and the difficulty of finding the last available spaces--approximately 14 hours each weekend during peak season. This indicates a peak-period deficit of approximately 300 spaces in 1998 and approximately 500 spaces today. National attention has focused on intercept or ""portal"" parking as a solution to some parking ills. The concept is to intercept arriving traffic by providing parking near, but outside of, a busy area-- in this case, at locations near the entries to the barrier island--thereby reducing traffic congestion in the core area. People parking at these portal locations would either walk to nearby destinations or ride a shuttle to those located farther 31   away. The panel recommends this as one of a number of appropriate strategies for dealing with the barrier island's parking problems. The proposed Palazzo Las Olas project would incorporate public parking as a first step in creating a portal parking location for public use. Portal parking will be effective only if it:  Is provided in proportion to the volume of traffic arriving at each gateway;  Is easily identified and readily accessible;  Is located within convenient walking distance (ideally, within 600 to 800 feet) of destinations;  Is attractively priced (that is, is less expensive than parking at more central locations); and  Meets the needs of the target market. A shuttle would have to operate frequently (preferably with ten-minute headways at peak periods, and not less than 20-minute headways at other times) and reliably. Recent local experience, however, has proven shuttles to be ineffective when routes are long and schedules infrequent and unreliable. Finally, land use policies governing the amount of parking required in new developments should be scaled back to create demand for portal parking. The garage planned for the proposed Palazzo Las Olas project would not meet many of the above requirements. Most importantly, no target market has been identified for it or any other portal facility. Insufficient local information presently exists concerning the needs and expectations of employees, hotel guests, beachgoers, and other visitors to assess the potential for a portal-parking scheme. Furthermore, reductions in privately provided parking may be few, since the dominant uses-- residences and hotels--typically need on-site parking. Portal parking could be an option during peak periods for employees and beach day visitors, but the limited number of days per year when additional parking is needed suggests that aggressive management, use of existing lots in the region, and less capital-intensive solutions might be more appropriate and cost effective than constructing large portal garages. 32  Parking Principles and Appropriate Parking Locations Instead of pursuing the development of largescale portal parking, the panel suggests that the city use the following guidelines to create offstreet parking that better fits the resort setting. It should:  Locate parking lots and garages away from the beach;  Place parking garages along a two-way Seabreeze Boulevard, as much as possible, and within 400 to 500 feet of the primary destination to be served;  Develop modestly sized (500 spaces or less) parking facilities; and  Build small, low-profile (two-level) garages in residential areas close to the beach. When new, detailed demand studies indicate a need for more parking, the panel suggests the following locations as candidate sites:  The Sunrise Lane area;  The city-owned parcels between Alhambra and Sebastian streets on Birch Road;  The Las Olas/Seabreeze Boulevard area (a garage here should front Seabreeze Boulevard); and  Selected corner lots along Birch Road (for small, two-level facilities). Parking Demand Strategies The city needs to update its 1998 and 2000 demand studies in order to determine the current number of existing parking spaces, which in turn will allow it to define the necessary increase in supply. A demand analysis can help identify the sites where additional parking facilities would be most useful in alleviating the current parking shortage. The panel identified a number of parking areas previously mentioned that appear appropriate for the location of new facilities. These sites are convenient, accessible, and safe and are shown on the proposed traffic and parking plan. The city also will reap benefits from undertaking the following actions.

The purpose of the database should be to set a baseline that will delineate the current land use--commercial (retail, restaurant, service), lodging, residential, or recreational--and square footage on each parcel within the study area. This database also should identify all on-street and off-street parking spaces. Once these land uses have been identified and delineated, the next task will be to determine the number of employees--by market segment and population--that occupies each business or residential unit. It will be important to differentiate between permanent and transient user groups. From this data, the city can project true parking demand for the beach, thus establishing a parking demand database, which will enable the city to identify travel characteristics for each user group and for weekdays, weekends, and special events. Project Parking Demand. Once a parking information database has been established, it will be possible to project parking demand for each hour of the day, day of the month, and season of the year. This demand analysis should allow the city to provide adequate and convenient parking for shoppers, recreational users, employees, visitors, and residents in appropriate locations and at all times, including holidays and special events. The analysis also will establish acceptable walking distances for all user groups, including families and other visitors who may carry beach equipment. The city should use this analysis to create a revised parking plan designed to benefit users and improve the quality of their beach experience. This plan should Fort Lauderdale, Florida, November 1015, 2002  include the possibility of VIP or valet parking for special occasions. Identify Supply Options. Parking facilities--both surface lots and garages--will vary in size as a result of the constraints associated with height limitations and adjoining land uses. Based on its review of previous reports and its own analysis, the panel found that an estimated deficit of some 500 spaces currently exists during peak season. The panel suggests that the city's goal should be to satisfy parking demand with well-designed, cost-effective parking facilities. One potential problem is that the city has proposed a requirement that parking structures be no longer than 200 feet, regardless of the site's dimensions. This new rule would reduce the efficiency of structured parking, thus increasing the unit cost per space or per square foot. Taller parking structures also would provide fewer opportunities for streetfront retail than would a low-rise building covering more land area. The panel therefore believes that some justification may exist for projects that exceed the standard zoning criteria as adopted a couple of years ago in both the PRD and ABA zoning districts. It recommends that the city consider exempting parking structures or specifically identifying them as a use where innovative design could justify reconsideration of the zoning requirements. The city also could design and build parking facilities in phases. Once a site has been selected, the size of the structure to be designed for that site could exceed the current parking demand, resulting in an underutilized parking facility. One way to avoid this situation would be to design a structure  Proposed traffic and parking plan.  33   that can be expanded either vertically or horizontally, depending on site constraints and building height. This would help ""right-size"" the amount of parking for a particular zone within the study area. When parking demand begins to exceed supply, the facility could be expanded relatively quickly (during the off-peak season), since building foundations and initial structural systems already would be in place. This type of expandable facility should be considered for each of the proposed parking sites. The city's Parking Division is organized as an enterprise fund, and operating expenses are fully supported by the revenues generated by the fund through meter and citation revenues and the sale of parking permits. The division currently is responsible for managing, operating, and maintaining some 29 parking lots and four parking structures located throughout the city, with a total of about 10,000 public parking spaces. Eight of the parking lots and one of the garages are located on the barrier island. The panel was told that the Parking Division currently is making major repairs to two of the garages, will begin repairing a third garage in the near future, and plans to spend approximately $4 million to repair them. The city has approved plans for 1,000 public parking spaces to be built on the barrier island at the proposed Palazzo Las Olas project, which will provide a net increase of approximately 400 public spaces over the current supply. Construction of this project has not yet begun. As mentioned previously, the 1988 panel was asked to evaluate traffic and parking in the core beach area. The city then had a parking consultant evaluate the parking situation again. This consultant conducted a supply/demand and parking accumulation analysis specifically for the Central Beach area. The study included specific car counts in the area for peak and off-peak hours of the day, days of the month, and seasons. Projected parking deficits--based on the consultant's studies--have been estimated at five-year intervals during peak season (November through April) as follows. The Central Beach area will have a 758-space deficit by 2005, a 1,174-space deficit by 2010, a 1,655-space deficit by 2015, and a 34  2,209-space deficit by 2020. This shortage was projected by integrating a 1.6 percent area growth rate with a 4.8 percent visitor growth rate into a blended 2.88 percent annual growth rate. The beach has adequate parking during off-peak months (May through October), but current parking trip-generation data and public perception indicate that many of these spaces are not conveniently located. The city of Fort Lauderdale Central Beach public properties inventory identifies four sites as potential locations for additional parking facilities:  Las Olas Intracoastal Municipal Parking Lot and adjacent redevelopment property (about ten acres);  Oceanside Municipal Parking Lot (2.9 acres, located about six blocks south of Las Olas Boulevard, and the only parking lot actually on the beach);  South Beach Municipal Parking Lot (9.5 acres, located on the east side of of Fort Lauderdale Beach Boulevard at the intersection with Seabreeze Boulevard); and  Alhambra-Sebastian Block and Municipal Parking Lot (about 2.56 acres, located between Birch Road and Fort Lauderdale Beach Boulevard and between Alhambra and Sebastian streets). The panel recommends one additional site as appropriate for a parking structure. This site is located in the Sunrise Lane area, south of Sunrise Boulevard at Breakers Avenue. To date, none of these structures has been constructed to help alleviate the present parking shortage, but the city is undertaking the feasibility studies necessary to secure federal and state funds to determine the proper location of portal parking lots that could serve the beach and be linked by a new beach transit system. With the exception of the proposed Palazzo Las Olas project, no other portal garages are planned at this time. A Parking Authority The panel suggests that Fort Lauderdale's parking efforts could be better organized--and their An Advisory Services Panel Report   profitability increased--by the creation of a parking authority, which could:  Acquire, construct, improve, maintain, and operate off-street parking facilities (both lots and parking structures);  Generate additional revenues by leasing space for commercial purposes (by either selling or leasing the air space above and/or the ground space below a parking structure to private interests);  Issue bonds to be secured by pledges of revenue; and  Use the power of eminent domain. Public parking spaces created by a parking authority--whether self operated or leased to others--are exempt from all taxes, whether levied as property taxes or excise taxes. Portions of structures leased for commercial use lose this taxexempt status. While the city may have many of the powers listed above, the panel recommends that it create an independent parking authority to ensure that parking development decisions are depoliticized, which in turn will bring greater fiscal discipline to parking development while consolidating parking responsibilities within one agency.  The city of Miami established its parking authority in 1955 by a special act of the state legislature. In 1968, the city reestablished its charter to incorporate the parking authority. The Miami Parking Authority has completed a number of parking transactions since 1968. Its projects have been both profitable and beneficial to residents, businesses, and visitors. The panel was told that the Miami Parking Authority has increased the profitability of its parking operations over the years and is pleased with the results. To create this type of authority--an established entity in the state of Florida--the city of Fort Lauderdale would have to pass a local ordinance. The panel suggests that the city of Fort Lauderdale review Senate Bill No. 585, Chapter 27725 (No. 1246) as written for the city of Miami. The establishment of a parking authority will help the city establish a parking growth plan and a way to implement the construction of new parking facilities. This plan can be phased in over many years to satisfy the parking deficit created by increased tourism, recreation/entertainment, and resort development.  Fort Lauderdale, Florida, November 1015, 2002  35   Development Strategies  T  he city has been reacting to various development proposals and approving projects without the benefit of a city-, community-, and stakeholder-endorsed vision for the Central Beach area. If this situation is not corrected, future additions to the built environment likely will do little to create a sense of place and a sense of community. The panel recommends that the development process be revised to foster future development that will help build ""a resort community with a beach lifestyle.""  Based on the approved plan, the city should proactively encourage various design initiatives for the study area that will set the standard for future development. These catalyst projects can determine the character of the built environment, introduce family-oriented activities throughout the area, and create a community spirit that will help build a unique place. A Solid Strategy Development that is responsive to a community vision will be possible if a concrete strategy to encourage such development is put into place. The city of Fort Lauderdale must prepare an updated Central Beach master plan and provide a consistent development approval process. The city can encourage the desired type of development in several ways. The panel believes that each of the following actions is achievable and will contribute to program success. It further suggests that the city pursue these actions simultaneously.  Communicate the vision. The city should take an active and high-profile role in communicating the community-ratified vision and the revitalization and redevelopment plan for Central Beach. This will become the basis for an updated master plan.  Clarify the approval and permitting processes. High-quality developers and financial institutions of good standing will be attracted to the Central Beach area if these processes become more predictable. The best development companies are in a position to choose where they do business. For this reason, the city needs an efficient development approval process, one in which approvals and permits can be administered in a timely and clearly understood fashion. The city must understand that it is competing with other jurisdictions in its efforts to attract the best developers to Fort Lauderdale. An Advisory Services Panel Report  Preferred Development Approach To achieve more easily the type of high-quality built environment and resort community desired by residents and business owners, the city should take steps to position Central Beach as a viable investment opportunity for major equity investors, financial institutions, and developers. As a first step, the city should embrace the proposed plans recommended by the panel as a starting point for a broad discussion between area residents and business owners. This initial consensus-building effort should serve as a basis for further formal input into a master community revitalization plan for Central Beach. The master plan should seek to simplify the existing code, streamline the application process, and strengthen those standards for the built environment deemed desirable by the community. This plan would replace the array of existing zoning districts, overlay districts, and other precedents with a system that is understood by residents, business owners, and developers alike. Once such a plan is in place, the city should adapt its development approval process to allow stafflevel review and permitting as defined in the scope, standards, and set limitations of the plan. This should help eliminate the current lack of predictability in the approval process. 36    Implement a PUD ordinance.The panel recommends that the city consider revising its planning and zoning districts into a Central Beach planned unit development area. The purpose of PUD regulations is to encourage and allow more creative and imaginative design than is possible under the current zoning regulations. Ideally, this flexibility will result in development projects that are better planned and contain more amenities. An added safeguard built into the PUD process is that it demands more information about the proposed project than would be required under conventional zoning requirements. (The PUD process can incorporate the panel's proposed thematic planning districts.)  Determine the highest and best use of available public funds. The city must decide how much funding it can devote to the redevelopment of the Central Beach area. A commitment to the future of the area is essential to build the confidence needed for private sector involvement.  Oversee the developer selection process. The city would be wise to provide an oversight function when public planning entities solicit requests for proposals (RFPs) for key publicly controlled sites. The panel suggests that a rigorous ""proof of funds"" requirement and/or verification of financial relationships be sought, in addition to the typical public approval matters. This will protect the public sector from having to expend unwarranted time and attention on projects that are not likely to come to fruition.  process is viewed as somewhat arbitrary because of the compatibility provision, which is perceived as negating the zoning process and allowing too much discretion. The resulting impression--which was expressed both by residents and members of the development community--is that there is a complete lack of predictability in the development approval process. Changing the approval process will substantially enhance the city's reputation as a community that encourages high-quality design. The panel recommends the following revisions to the approval process:  Conduct early technical reviews. This will encourage developers to submit their projects for the planning review process earlier than they do now. Developers currently wait until a project's design is as complete as possible before they present it to planners and the public. This wait has created distrust, because the public senses that by the time designs are submitted for approval, they are too far along to be changed.  Remove design review from the political process. Plans that presently are submitted for development approval in the Central Beach RAC could be approved by the DRC rather than subjected to the more political process of approval by the planning and zoning board and the city commission.  Have project modifications reviewed and approved by the DRC. If a project falls within current zoning, modifications should not be subject to approval by either the planning and zoning board or the city commission.  Pull the plug early on projects that will not be approved. Once a project has been rejected by the DRC, the plan should be sent back to the developer for redesign or the process stopped.  Implement an independent technical review process. The city should hire outside design consultants who have no conflict of interest to conduct technical reviews. The development community currently views the process as being biased by the commission's views. Interviewees told the panel that ""the commission likes to play `designer'."" For this reason, the city should hire 37  The Approval Process The current three-step process for development approvals in Central Beach is estimated to take-- at best--four months, but developers and attorneys told the panel it can take as long as 18 to 24 months. Three authorities--the city planning department's development review committee (DRC), the planning and zoning board, and the city commission--each are currently responsible for reviewing most proposed projects in the study area. Almost everyone interviewed by the panel described the approval process as taking more time than it does in similar, adjacent communities. The Fort Lauderdale, Florida, November 1015, 2002   outside designers and let these professionals do the job.  Update the Master Plan While the panel is reluctant to recommend any additional studies, given the many studies that have been undertaken to date, an important first step will be to update the master plan for the study area. The new plan should illustrate the current status of approved and proposed projects and identify potential development sites. It should include a review and consolidation of all prior studies and should include the linkages needed to ensure the redevelopment of Central Beach. The master planning process should address the importance of the quality-of-life issues that affect both residents and tourists. The master plan should consider phased development scenarios and options and identify realistic projects for implementation, based on the community's opportunities, needs, and financial condition. The result should be a plan that takes into account the needs of all potential users, enhances the community, encourages preferred land use patterns, and acknowledges the realities of the city's economic conditions. Community outreach and public participation efforts must be aimed at reaching a consensus on the future of the area. The panel recommends that the city retain an outside team of design consultants together with someone skilled in public facilitation. Members of this team should be selected as part of a formal RFP process and those invited to respond should not include firms with links to any development project already underway or proposed for the study area. The panel finds that the broadly written goals and objectives in the 1988 Beach Revitalization Plan are still valid and, in general, are applicable to the entire Central Beach area. However, the ""urban beach village"" concept articulated in the revitalization plan needs to be updated to reflect the vision of a resort community with a beach lifestyle recommended by the panel. The city should incorporate the following recommendations into the updated master plan: 38   The city should update the master plan for the Central Beach area as part of its broader planning efforts, which include the master planning process currently underway for the downtown that will become part of the overall vision for the city.  The city should prepare photo simulations or comparable visual reference surveys of the type of development that is permitted within the current zoning districts. Then it should present these simulations to the public for consensus and approval. The vision should be the combined interpretation of city officials, residents, and civic/business representatives.  The city should continue to encourage public participation in the planning process by involving residents from throughout the community. The public participation process should be continuous and should include residents, stakeholders, and other business interests who are active in the community. Members of the community should be encouraged to express their views and preferences regarding the vision through interviews and workshops.  Independent consultants should design specific sector plans for those areas where the city has control through zoning regulations and can encourage development as guided by a master plan. Many communities find this method of planning and designing for smaller areas (sectors) to be desirable. The intent of a sector plan is to remove conflict from the planning phase by opening up the process and making it transparent for all stakeholders. If such a plan is prepared early enough, this will set a precedent and inform the residents and the development community about the rules before the entitlement process begins.  Catalysts The panel envisions Central Beach as an area that offers a high-quality visitor, tourist, and resident experience. To accomplish this, the panel suggests the development of an active promenade that offers opportunities for shopping, strolling, dining, and entertainment. Private/public partnerships should work together to build a complete user exAn Advisory Services Panel Report   Las Ola s Boulev ard  9 Water way  Harbor Drive  Pointsettia Street  2 1 eeze Boulevard Seabr  6 Sebastian Street  Terramar Street  Intracoastal  Sunrise Boulev  Alhambra Street  Bayshore Drive  Seville Street  Riomar Street  5 5  Cortez Street  4  13 Birch Road  Birch Road  8  10  11 Breakers Avenue  A1A  3  7  12 14  Key: Shoreline and Waterways 1 Bahia Mar 2 International Swimming Hall of Fame Museum and Aquatic Complex 3 Public Beach Facilities 4 Public Market 5 Redevelopment Site and Las Olas Park at A1A 6 Palazzo Las Olas  7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14  A1A Resort Promenade Mid-Beach Garage Water Taxi Route Public Square in North Beach Community District Bonnet House Connection Public Parking in Sunrise Lane District Hugh Taylor Birch State Park Public Beach Water Taxi Stops  Atlantic Ocean  North  perience that is exciting, safe, and family oriented. Each new project can add to the excitement of the area; together, these projects can make Central Beach a place that is attractive to residents, visitors, and the business community. What follows is a discussion of 14 design initiatives that the panel has identified as key to furthering the reemergence of the study area as a resort community with a beach lifestyle. The catalyst projects vary in scale and purpose from single sites to thematic planning districts, from streetscape improvements to traffic-calming initiatives. Note that project numbers in the text below correspond those in the illustration above. 1. Bahia Mar New construction at Bahia Mar will be the result of $18 million in improvements to the marina, with 242 larger marina slips replacing the 332 smaller, old, and outdated slips. There is an obvious need for a new facility on this city-owned block, to support the Fort Lauderdale International Boat Show and to maintain the city's position as host of the largest and most prestigious boat show in the United States. The new development--which is expected to be unveiled in early 2003--is envisioned as a joint development of Boca Resorts, the city of Fort Lauderdale, and the boat show. The primary goal of the new construction at Bahia Mar is to achieve and maintain a resort community ambience at this complex. The project will need to create an active street presence, with varied retail and commercial offerings along A1A/ Fort Lauderdale Beach Boulevard. To animate the streetscape, these facilities must be easily accessiFort Lauderdale, Florida, November 1015, 2002  ble and highly visible. Street-level activities will benefit the residents and tourists who walk and drive by the complex. Quality will be the most important aspect of this project, in terms of both the development process and design. This project should become an excellent example of a public/private partnership and should serve as the model for similar future projects in Central Beach. The participants are well known in the community. They should engage experts in design and public participation to work in concert with the community to assure that this becomes a special project. This is an important project--perhaps the most important in Central Beach--since it could be built in the near future by the current participants with community support. The goal should be to develop Bahia Mar as the anchor project at the southern gateway to Central Beach. This project will be vital to the success of the boat show, the study area, the city, and the community. It must result in a win for everyone. 2. The Swimming Hall of Fame The International Swimming Hall of Fame Museum and Aquatic Complex is a major family attraction on the beach. This combination facility generates approximately 30,000 annual room nights plus the additional economic impact resulting from visits by swimmers and their families. The facility sponsors pre-Olympic training as well as Amateur Athletic Union (AAU), collegiate, and high school competitions throughout the year. This facility is important to the beach because it builds on the history of swimming and the facil-  Development initiatives.  39   A view from the roadway, looking north toward the canal, shows boats docked at residences on the main land side of Fort Lauderdale.  ity's national reputation as the home of pooltrained champions. The panel believes that the facility superbly validates the beach as an international draw and reinforces Fort Lauderdale's identity and unique character. The panel understands that, because of a reorganization, the International Swimming Hall of Fame--a nonprofit, 501(c)3 entity--is in the process of relocating its museum and library to Pompano Beach. If the organization does move, the city-owned and -operated aquatics complex will remain, and plans for the renamed Fort Lauderdale Aquatics Center are scheduled to be prepared in 2003 for a 2005/2006 opening. However, the panel believes that this facility will lose its cachet when the International Swimming Hall of Fame departs. In addition, the city and the Fort Lauderdale Community Redevelopment Agency currently are working to raise an estimated $25 million in funding for renovations to the facility that will enable it to once again meet international standards. The national and international quality and attraction of the facility will disappear when the International Swimming Hall of Fame Museum has relocated 40  and the remaining facility's name is changed to the Fort Lauderdale Aquatics Center. Although it appears likely that the Hall of Fame will relocate, the panel believes that the city commission should revisit this decision in light of the cost of renovations and the overall economic impact and importance of the combined facilities to Fort Lauderdale. 3. Public Beach Facilities and Recreational Activities Day beach users, residents, and tourists all are clamoring for public beach facilities that are well designed, well maintained, and convenient. As an introduction to the beach experience, the wave wall was a tremendous investment that has become an iconic image of the area. Other support facilities should exhibit a similar design quality. Additional facilities should include:  Public restrooms, located in one place and designed to be easily maintained and staffed throughout their hours of operation. Studies have shown that one or two well-maintained and -operated public restrooms are much more successful than several smaller, unstaffed facilities along public beaches. An Advisory Services Panel Report    A police substation, in a visible, easily accessible location.  Food concessions that are attractively designed and serve as an example of the level of quality the city would like all public beach facilities to attain.  Lifeguard facilities.  Locker facilities.  Recreational concessions that sell or rent bikes, roller blades, beach umbrellas and chairs, environmentally friendly jet skis, kayaks, rafts, kites, surfboards, paragliding, diving, and other recreational services and merchandise. The investment in these facilities should set quality standards that will make the Fort Lauderdale beach competitive with and more attractive than the many other beach cities along A1A. Tourists and visitors have many choices along the coast, and this particular beach already enjoys an outstanding reputation and great name recognition. 4. A Public Market People all over the world are rediscovering the charm of public markets. Strolling and walking through exciting public spaces, sitting, eating, people watching, and shopping combine many of the interests of residents and tourists alike. Outstanding ocean views and the exciting grand scale of the marina at the Bahia Mar Yachting Center could create an outstanding venue for a public market. Many communities are looking at either relocating or reintroducing public markets as a way to attract and encourage visitors and add to the general livability of an area. This site is a natural for a public market. Successful markets offer food and merchandise that are easily identifiable by the community. The panel sees an opportunity to enlarge and reorganize the existing fish market into a public market. This market could be accessed directly from the street and would be adjacent to several existing and proposed parking areas. The market could offer items related to the surf and to the beach culture. It also might include a combination of boats and stands selling seafood, mixed with small restaurants and stands offering produce, flowers, Fort Lauderdale, Florida, November 1015, 2002  sweets, beach floats and other beach products, and additional small items. Day visitors walking through the market on their way to the beach could purchase items they need for the day. They also could stop there on their way back to their cars and make additional purchases. Many visitors look for opportunities to extend their leisure time, and shopping for a few items to take home with them can be an important part of the leisure experience. 5. Las Olas Park/Oceanside Municipal Parking Lot The intersection of A1A and the famous Las Olas Boulevard is the 100 percent, number-one corner in Central Beach. It is the entrance to both the beach and an internationally known shopping destination within the Downtown RAC. The history of this site began with the demolition of the Holiday Inn in late 1992. Surface parking--the Oceanside Municipal Parking Lot--currently occupies the three-acre site, and the city has restricted development on the property to public space and parking. The panel concurs with this decision and believes that the property must be maintained and preserved as an open space with active entertainment uses. The redevelopment of this property is essential if Central Beach is to become a high-quality destination resort community. The panel recommends that it be transformed into an exciting, active community open space known as Las Olas Park, which could include a beautifully designed plaza and parking facility. Development should be focused on the northwest and southwest corners of the intersection. In addition to being a prime corner with an outstanding address, this is an important view corridor. The panel envisions Las Olas Park as an active plaza with water features, a small performing arts stage, and lawn areas, plus adjacent parking. The panel believes that, if feasible, parking should be accommodated below the park. If this is not feasible, these uses should be separated, with an attractive parking facility adjoining the plaza. An interactive water feature would be a welcome place for children to enjoy safe water play. This feature could be designed in such a way that it could be used as a small performing arts stage 41   Streetscape improvements along the beach side of A1A include the widened paved promenade with the wave wall, streetlights, and palm trees that have become symbolic of the Fort Lauderdale beaches.  additional development. To further support additional activity at this intersection, the beachside promenade should be expanded to accommodate the anticipated increased pedestrian activity. 6. Palazzo Las Olas This proposed project is to be located at Las Olas Boulevard and the Intracoastal Waterway, another prime intersection and gateway to the barrier island. The development has been designed with building heights lower than the maximum allowed under code, but the bulk of the proposed buildings is nevertheless massive. The panel believes that varying the building heights, while maintaining approved floor areas, could result in a more attractive built environment. The panel recommends abandoning plans for major public parking at the Palazzo Las Olas project and placing some parking at alternative locations closer to the beach. 7. The A1A Resort Promenade This promenade would include the public walkways and building facades along A1A within the Beach Entertainment District. The panel recommends that the city focus on developing a promenade along the storefront side of A1A, between its southern and northern ""Y"" intersections with Seabreeze Boulevard. Several years ago, the city did a commendable job of creating a beach promenade along the ocean side of A1A with special pavers and the iconic, meandering beach wave wall. If the city wants to become a top-quality resort destination, it now must give the same type of attention to the storefront side of A1A. If the street face is left to future developers, new resort hotels built along A1A likely will tend to maximize their inward focus, rather than address the broader neighborhood goal of improving the streetscape. The panel recommends that the storefront side of A1A incorporate some of the following features. The city should:  Create design guidelines for all hardscape that meets the street. These guidelines should conform to the thematic style that fits the proposed Beach Entertainment District's conceptual plan.  Encourage restaurant and retail uses within new or redeveloped resorts along A1A, in a An Advisory Services Panel Report  A typical view of the piers seen all along the Intracoastal Waterway.  when the water is turned off. The stage would be programmed for family entertainment with music and artist events. Lawn areas for sitting, enjoying the sun, and people watching also could feature small tents for artistic activities and related events. The panel's vision for this park is a small, intimate space and an active location for families designed to further the resort community feel of the beach. As the city did so successfully with the beach plan, the public sector must take the lead in developing a high-quality open-space plaza to set the tone for 42   manner that will help create pedestrian interest on the promenade. The goal should be to produce a great strolling experience.  Promote the placement of seasonal carts/kiosks operated by various concessions on the walkway, to further heighten the visitor experience along the promenade. 8. A Mid-Beach Garage The panel recommends that a low-rise public parking facility be located at the Alhambra-Sebastian Block and Municipal Parking Lot along Birch Road. This structure should be designed to blend in with the surrounding neighborhood. The use of green plants on its upper levels could soften the hard edge that such facilities typically present to the street. A good example is the public parking garage built in Miami Beach's South Beach area, which is barely apparent to passersby. The panel believes that a properly designed parking structure could blend in with the neighboring buildings and still provide a major asset in terms of convenience for visitors and beachgoers alike. 9. The Water Taxi The water taxi is the most novel way to get around in Fort Lauderdale. It is an important asset and provides transportation along the Intracoastal Waterway and the New River. The stops provide quick and efficient access to high-quality shopping venues like the Galleria, neighborhoods, historic attractions, hotels, and the beach. Fort Lauderdale's water taxis are clean and attractive. If they are well publicized, they could become an alternative source of transportation connecting additional areas and attractions. (See the proposed traffic and parking plan on page 33.) The panel suggests making the stops more attractive by redesigning signage and adding lighting. It also suggests that local hotels should actively advertise this alternative mode of transportation. The boat ride itself is an attraction. It offers an intimate look at the residential and commercial enclaves surrounding the study area. Throughout the day, it presents dramatic views of the city; in the evening, riders can enjoy romantic views of homes and the yachts docked at private piers and marinas along the Intracoastal Waterway and the Fort Lauderdale, Florida, November 1015, 2002  New River. The city has ordered new water taxis that will include some environmentally friendly features and will shorten the trip time between stops to improve access. 10. The North Beach Community District The panel recommends that the North Beach Community District focus on neighborhood preservation, because many of its buildings are of historic and architectural interest. Adaptive use and new infill construction could help to increase the density of the neighborhood, thereby increasing residential and small-scale resort options while also protecting the current scale of development. The panel suggests that the city focus its attention in this district and help to create a community with a unique beach character. The city could accomplish this by sponsoring a starter project in the district. With the right kind of sponsorship, North Beach could host a variety of initiatives, including adaptive use of existing structures, preservation, and new residential construction-- with both higher-density stacked flats and rowhouses/ townhouses. A public square could be developed at the core of the community to provide a central gathering space. Other neighborhood-scale parks and green spaces could be created on some infill sites. A low-impact parking facility in the district could serve beachgoers and shoppers. Neighborhood convenience stores serving limited food and beverages also might be appropriate. The city can sponsor the emergence of a true neighborhood in this area by playing a guiding role in the preparation of an area plan, encouraging preferred projects, and intervening with public improvements. Some of the concepts already under study by the city--including parking solutions and traffic calming--should be pursued within the framework of this desired neighborhood plan. 11. The Bonnet House Connection The city should consider ways to better connect this historic facility--and major community asset --with its neighbors. At present, it is simply a barrier that isolates the Sunrise Lane District from the rest of Central Beach. At the very least, improved access to the Bonnet House and better 43   signage could help connect it to its surroundings and increase its visibility. 12. The Sunrise Lane District This is a special neighborhood. It is an authentic place, with a pedestrian scale common to many beach communities. The panel understands that changes here--such as the adaptive use of existing buildings--are severely limited by the current lack of parking. It therefore supports the development of a public parking facility in this district, between Sunrise Lane and Breakers Avenue, to allow the neighborhood to evolve. This public parking facility would serve as a good intercept parking location for beach visitors, and therefore should be tied to an expanded community transit program. The panel hopes that this district can retain its unique beach orientation and heritage, perhaps with some upgrading, but without losing its sense of place. 13. Hugh Taylor Birch State Park The city should take action to knit the state park located north of Sunrise Boulevard (beyond the boundaries of the study area) with the surrounding community. It is one of the city's major assets and a positive attribute that is located directly across from the beach. Together with the Bonnet House, it could be used to add an ecotourism component to Central Beach. The city could begin by introducing seasonal park programs. 14. The Public Beach The public beach is the amenity and attraction for Fort Lauderdale. In 1986, with a voter-approved general obligation bond, the city made the wise decision to make a tremendous investment in the redesign of the beach, beginning with the construction of the wave wall as a symbol for the Fort Lauderdale beaches.  The essential ingredient, of course, is a healthy beach. Many beach communities regularly undertake beach renourishment efforts. Several have chosen to make impressive investments in enlarging and restoring their beaches. In the mid 1990s, for example, Miami Beach invested in a renourishment program that served as a catalyst for the continued redevelopment of South Beach. Fort Lauderdale should consider the enormous impact of such an investment and its effect on revitalization. The panel encourages the city to maintain its vigilant review of the width of the entire beach and to continue to protect this most important asset. Another protective device--the planting of sea oats along the beach required by the state to protect existing dunes--is a safeguard that will protect the beach over the long term. The city should continue this process as one way of protecting its investment. In summation, the panel hopes that the city will pursue development of the catalyst projects identified above, which encompass new development, architectural preservation, adaptive use, and pedestrian, transportation, and parking improvements. With the community's attention focused on revitalizing Central Beach within the proposed thematic planning districts, the panel believes these projects will lead the way to the successful redevelopment of a resort community with a beach lifestyle. Great projects lead communities.  44  An Advisory Services Panel Report   Implementation  T  he city of Fort Lauderdale and its stakeholders need a clear, more uniform definition of the portion of the barrier island programmed to encourage the mix of uses and recreational amenities that will attract both local families and tourists. The panel proposes that Central Beach be that area and that it be defined as the area between the Atlantic Ocean and the Intracoastal Waterway, extending from Sunrise Boulevard on the north to just north of Harbor Drive on the south. A second term that needs to be more clearly defined and uniformly used is ""redevelopment."" The study area includes the 125-acre Central Beach Community Redevelopment Area (CRA), which is located within the larger, 425-acre Central Beach Regional Activity Center (RAC). Within the CRA, the city can use some additional powers and tools --including tax increment financing and powers of eminent domain--as development incentives. When the city uses these tools to actively encourage development, this can be described as redevelopment with a ""big R."" Outside the CRA, where the city offers fewer incentives and thus plays a more limited role--using standard tools like zoning and infrastructure investment--its efforts can be described as redevelopment with a ""little r.""  plement its vision for Central Beach. In addition to an update of the master plan (as discussed in the ""Development Strategies"" section), the panel recommends the actions outlined below. Utilize Public Intervention Tools and Techniques The panel believes that the city has taken too much of a ""hands-off"" approach to this key redevelopment area. Beachfront areas typically are more resource intensive than other parts of a community, but they also help define the community. The city must market and promote the Central Beach area. A coordinated and concerted effort will be needed to promote the area through, for example, an expanded range of special events. The physical environment requires additional maintenance and security. Together with city resources, a business improvement district (BID) or an operational assessment district might be created to help fund these enhancements and to help determine an appropriate level of investment by the city. Involving and cultivating beach stakeholders in this effort also would strengthen the public/private partnership needed to stimulate redevelopment. Additional site assemblage can help achieve the vision for the area. Although such efforts often are controversial, the city needs to have the political will and resources to use its power of eminent domain to remove blight on key sites if voluntary acquisition efforts to do so fail. The city also should consider, on a case-by-case basis, the use of economic incentives--subsidies, tax holidays, loan guarantees, industrial development bonds (IDBs) or other bond programs, tax increment financing (TIF), and community development block grant (CDBG) funds--to stimulate development, especially for catalyst projects. The city can be both a source of funding and a tool to help capture private sector investment. 45  Recommended Strategy The panel congratulates the city and many of the beach stakeholders for the progress they have made to date in enhancing the Fort Lauderdale beaches' image and physical environment. Major investments in infrastructure--including transportation improvements--and the acquisition of a number of key parcels have set the stage for further development. While much already has been accomplished, the panel believes that the city still needs to take a number of actions to help realize the study area's development potential and to imFort Lauderdale, Florida, November 1015, 2002   and offer assistance to project proponents and/or developers. This will ensure that the city has timely market and project status information. It also will demonstrate the city's interest in the success of private sector development. For example, the city should directly contact the real estate investment trust that owns the Holiday Inn at A1A and Sunrise Boulevard to determine the status of development rights for additional parking on hotel property. The city should not rely on third-party sources for this information. The city also can leverage its investment in infrastructure. Doing so will send a positive message to the equity and financial sources that are necessary to assist developers in advancing their projects. Such involvement also facilitates the city's own decision making in regard to determining its own efforts and activities. Expand Funding and Staffing to Accomplish the Vision While the Fort Lauderdale Community Redevelopment Agency has adopted a five-year funding plan, the resources it anticipates receiving are dependent upon approved but not yet constructed development. The agency is not a funding source for many of the efforts needed to further the vision for Central Beach. Its limited resources should be designated for catalyst projects as they materialize and to leverage other investment in the area. In the Community Redevelopment Area (CRA), where incremental property tax revenues are generated, the Fort Lauderdale Community Redevelopment Agency can encourage development by utilizing the concept of a ""developer advance."" Since public agencies find it difficult to access traditional financial resources--such as bonds--with projected revenues from projects not yet in the ground, many communities partner with project developers to fund the gap. The project developer advances all public project costs, including the cost of land assemblage. Repayment of any gap or public commitment to the project comes from a share of future project-specific tax increment revenues if these revenues materialize. Public funds and private redevelopment efforts will not be sufficient to complete the transformaAn Advisory Services Panel Report  This view of the Intracoastal Waterway shows the tropical vegetation typical of the area.  The city, as a service provider, should ensure that the Central Beach area receives expanded services. The city and Broward County should work together to provide transit service, parking facilities, parks and public open spaces, recreational venues, and other support services. Code enforcement and other programs that encourage property maintenance also should be a high priority in the area. Define the Public Sector's Role in Private Development Projects The city should be more involved with the study area as a whole. It needs to play a more active role in fostering private development. The existing tax structure offers the city no financial motivation to undertake this extra effort outside of the Central Beach CRA, because it gets no share of the hotel tax there, no situs sales tax (the discretionary income received from sales taxes collected in a particular area, which gives cities an incentive to promote the location of retail businesses within their boundaries). However, a successful beachfront area does create a tremendous economic multiplier effect, including job-creation and quality-oflife benefits as well as the increased potential to create a top-quality resort community. These factors should stimulate and reinforce the city's efforts to become more engaged and proactive in private development projects earmarked for Central Beach. The panel suggests that the city track new development projects and regularly communicate with  46   tion and realize the vision for the beach. The city should consider making the beach a higher priority for other public financial resources. For example, perhaps the city should provide a portion of the financing for the Fort Lauderdale Aquatics Center from the city's general fund or a general obligation bond, rather than expecting it to be financed entirely by tax increment financing. The city also should explore the establishment of a parking authority, as the panel recommended earlier in this report, to further leverage parking revenues. In addition, the city could pursue an increase in the hotel occupancy tax and designate the increased revenues for Central Beach. The city of Fort Lauderdale and the Fort Lauderdale Community Redevelopment Agency should facilitate development on city-owned sites in the study area through patient investment. They should defer public returns until later, according to a participation formula. The city also should pursue all available state and federal grant opportunities to fund infrastructure, recreation, and other capital improvements in the study area. One sound approach to leveraging limited financial resources is to invest city resources in design, working drawings, and entitlements for projects. This allows the city to be more competitive when seeking grants and providing local matching funds. The object is to have projects ready to go as grant opportunities arise. Modify City Organization and Staffing The 1988 ULI panel recommended the establishment of a beach redevelopment authority. This recommendation has not been implemented. Although the focus of the earlier study was the 33acre Beach Redevelopment Area, the continued evolution of Central Beach has reinforced the need for a champion for the beach within the city organization (as opposed to an independent redevelopment authority). The city has not dedicated sufficient resources to effectively achieve the vision for the area. Resources currently earmarked for the beach are diffused. Central Beach interests do not appear to have adequate political support. The city also appears to need additional professional (zoning, engineering, and planning) staff to move forward with a plan for the area. Thus there is no champion, funds and staff are insufficient, Fort Lauderdale, Florida, November 1015, 2002  and the overall coordination necessary to implement a plan is lacking. Downtown Fort Lauderdale has demonstrated how a community can transform a once undesirable area into a vibrant and active urban center. This was accomplished, in part, by dedicating resources specifically to downtown redevelopment. The panel suggests a similar focus for the beach, led by a champion who would direct public redevelopment activities and support private development throughout Central Beach. The beach champion also would take the lead in a high-profile effort to communicate the community-ratified vision for the study area. This champion must be a high-level professional manager with the necessary political backing, organizational skills, and clear mandate to spur redevelopment. Adequate staff or outside contracted professional support (for design, legal, engineering, and other services), along with an ability to approve and expedite building permits, ground leases, change orders, and so forth--and to encourage development--would add the momentum needed to create the resort community. The mayor and city commissioners need to express-- consistently and publicly--their commitment to and support for beach redevelopment. Foster Private Sector Involvement and Compromise The development community is often seen as the enemy by citizen groups, concerned public officials and--all too often--public zoning and design professionals. This environment of conflict is fostered by uncertainty about design, zoning, and land use restrictions. During the master plan update, citizens and design professionals should register their concerns about such contentious issues as density, building height, view restrictions, traffic, parking, and economic constraints. Professional planners employed as part of the master plan process must take these considerations into account by weighing workable compromises to produce a plan that will be acceptable to all concerned parties. A workable master plan must be based on the realization that conflict between citizens and developers is inherent but compromise is possible. One healthy basis for com47   promise consists of the recognition that while a project's density affects its economics, tall buildings restrict views and cast unwanted shadows. The public sector should accept the fact that compromise will never fully appease citizen anxiety concerning land development. Yet public officials can defuse some of the opposition to development by providing convenient and easily accessible parking, improved traffic flow, and expanded recreational opportunities. Citizens' more emotionally based concerns--about views, aesthetics, and ""that memory of the beach as it was""--will be more difficult to address.  quired, buildings constructed, rents paid, or housing units sold. Hotels, restaurants, and retail businesses must attract paying customers to remain viable. In a resort community, visitors as well as residents benefit from a thriving business community. The public sector must be able to depend on taxes, fees, and levies to continuously provide services and improvements. The financial linkage cannot be disconnected for long. The panel has emphasized the necessity for the public sector to supply infrastructure and services to enable redevelopment to continue. Funding is in place or can be designated. The city also must address private sector development fundamentals. The availability of developable land, properly located and assembled, will guide or influence development of the study area. Financially sound land assemblage depends on ""spreading"" land and development costs over a building area that can be leased or sold. In general--within reason--the greater the building density, the more the land and development costs can be spread. Most often, this density--and cost spreading--are created by developing taller buildings. Yet increased building heights often are in conflict with the scale of a neighborhood, since taller, denser buildings can block views and require additional public facilities such as roads and parking. In addition, land prices often escalate in response to perceived increases in market value attributable to allowing for increased density or potential rezoning to more financially rewarding uses. The lack of certainty about land uses creates these self-inflating pressures. The panel reiterates its belief that the city must establish and adhere to a clear and comprehensive development master plan with clearly stated zoning and building requirements. This will alleviate a great deal of the pressure on land values. Restrictions on land uses and density, however, must be established in the context of balancing financial fundamentals and neighborhood compatibility. The panel encourages the city to employ outside design professionals to help establish building density, height, and locational restrictions in conjunction with the plan. An Advisory Services Panel Report  Connecting the Vision with Results The implementation process needs to support the goals and objectives put forth in an updated master plan for the beach. A ""disconnect"" currently is hindering progress in spite of the public investment made in streetscapes, parking, and other public improvements. A mandate that has been publicly confirmed in enough detail by the highest level of public officials will empower the staff responsible for the zoning, design, and approval processes to encourage development. Vague promises of support and lukewarm assurances of change, coupled with the continued acceptance of structural impediments in city development documents and regulations, will negate the effect of public sector investment and discourage private investment. Changing working documents to reflect the compromises reached in the master plan process can establish a mandate for redevelopment. Redevelopment of the Fort Lauderdale beach must connect the business of real estate development with the process of government regulation. Continuing the present disconnect will lead to a waste of public funds, result in futile efforts by professional developers, and spoil the goodwill of the citizens of Fort Lauderdale. The Financial Environment The implementation of any successful redevelopment plan ultimately depends on the financial viability of all parts of the plan. Whether funds come from private or public resources, land must be ac48   Recommended Time Line for Redevelopment Initiatives Year One Organizational Actions Modify city organization and staff Identify/empower beach ""champion"" Dedicate additional staff resources Master Plan Update Establish community workshop process: Hire independent market/design consultant Involve concerned citizens Issue consultant's report Revise zoning, design, approval process Complete Public Initiatives Provide new signage Complete street improvements Address parking issues: Establish parking authority Assess parking needs Acquire property Construct new facilities Expand parks and open spaces Undertake catalyst projects: Beach promenade Beach facilities Las Olas Park Core area parking Public market Guide Approved/Future Private Projects Hotel development Mixed-use development High-density condo and rental housing Retail development                                                               Year Two Year Three Year Four Year Five  Fort Lauderdale, Florida, November 1015, 2002  49   The financial viability of a real estate project often depends on the developer's ability to provide enough equity--or a combination of debt and equity--to develop the project. Developers rarely have the luxury of enough equity to fund 100 percent of their development costs. The current economic climate certainly presents a substantial challenge for developers attempting to raise either debt or equity for most types of projects. The redevelopment of Central Beach should be viewed beyond the current economic cycle, but within the constraints of the history of the real estate industry. Perceived risk generally demands returns commensurate with those risks. Financiers and investors traditionally have ranked all three of Central Beach's major property types-- resort hotels, resort condominiums, and resort retail--as high-risk projects. Since 9/11, resort hotel and retail developments have suffered because fewer people have been vacationing. Resort condominiums, however, are a more secure investment, because they generally are presold with substantial contract deposits. Developers can use these presales to underwrite both equity and debt financing, and to lower perceived risk. Risk management is, obviously, a crucial component of new development. Resort hotel and retail development still are viewed as increasingly risky. A more stable economy and a return to a more peaceful international environment certainly would reduce perceived risk. However, it would be unwise to rely on a return to economic certainty and stable political conditions as a basis for redevelopment efforts. Combining the greater certainty of residential condominiums with hotels reduces reliance on the hotel component of the financial equation. The 75 percent hotel and 25 percent residential condo-  minium split established within other Florida markets would stimulate construction of the Central Beach hotel projects that currently are stalled because of the difficulty of obtaining financing for all-hotel projects. Resort retail development provides an amenity for both hotels and residential condominiums. In turn, retail--whether restaurants, shops, or services--relies to a great extent on the traffic generated by hotels and residences. The city would be wise to offer incentives for the inclusion of some retail space in hotel and residential condominium structures, as long as its location is feasible and conforms to the master plan. That incentive could take the form of increased density, property tax incentives, or other inducements. Finally, any efforts and initiatives to shorten the development approval and permitting time will reduce risks and costs. A more efficient timetable will decrease costs, and required debt and equity returns will enhance the ability of the development community to meet the master plan goals and timetables. Fostering the image of Fort Lauderdale Beach as a stable and reasonable development environment will have the added advantage of bringing in more qualified and professional developers and operators. Quality begets quality. Time Line for Redevelopment The panel recommends a time line for moving ahead with redevelopment. Most activities could begin immediately and should be completed over the next five years. The panel has grouped the actions to be taken according to major initiatives. The recommended time line for development on the preceding page shows the panel's recommendations as to when each activity should be implemented.  50  An Advisory Services Panel Report   Conclusions  T  he Fort Lauderdale community can be mobilized to enhance the quality of Central Beach's resort and residential environment. Strong leadership throughout the planning phase will enable reasonable compromise and result in a workable, equitable, and financially responsible redevelopment environment. The panel believes that a champion for the beach is needed to stimulate interest and support among public officials, the development community and residents of Central Beach. Each thematic district within the study area should be revitalized according to its unique characteristics. The panel has described these districts as generalized planning areas.  The Mid-Beach District is a transition zone between the highly active entertainment area to its south and the more modestly scaled residential area to its north. This district is an appropriate location for additional hotel development across from the ocean and for residential uses along the Intracoastal Waterway. The beach would begin to serve more family-oriented users in this area. The North Beach Community District is located farther north along A1A. Its boundary extends as far north as the historic Bonnet House. This district contains a unique blend of low-rise, architecturally significant buildings that form a cohesive neighborhood. The panel recommends that a public square be built at its center. The primary land use in this district is residential, although some buildings recently have been converted to B&Bs, and small guesthouses also can be found scattered among the housing. Some demolition has occurred for redevelopment. New high-rise buildings affect the character of the neighborhood. The panel believes that the scale of this neighborhood should be protected from further high-rise development. The Sunrise Lane District, which lies between the Bonnet House and Sunrise Boulevard, is the fifth thematic district and the northern gateway for Central Beach. Its redevelopment potential is limited by a lack of parking. It contains a mix of hotel, retail, and residential uses, which are physically isolated from the beach area to its south. A parking facility in this district could serve both existing businesses and beachgoers. All five districts are defined by their proximity to one another and their location across from one of the few stretches of public oceanfront beaches in this part of south Florida. In terms of parking and transportation improvements, the panel recommends scattered low-rise parking facilities in six locations within Central Beach, the establishment of a parking authority to 51  The Marina District is defined by the Bahia Mar property and what is to become the Fort Lauderdale Aquatics Center, together with the surrounding marinas that host the Fort Lauderdale International Boat Show. Redevelopment proposals have been prepared for a significant expansion of the Bahia Mar property. Proposed development would bring additional conference attendees and convention goers to the area. Street-level retail along portions of A1A would revitalize the streetscape and help to define the southern gateway of Central Beach. The Beach Entertainment District is centered on Las Olas Boulevard. Redevelopment in this area should complement--not compete with--retail development on Las Olas west of the Intracoastal Waterway. This area should be redeveloped for public use, to serve an expanded resort and residential population. It must become an active entertainment enclave with, perhaps, a performing arts stage at its core, an expanded promenade, and a range of public beach facilities. The approved mixed-use Palazzo Las Olas project at Las Olas and the Intracoastal Waterway falls within this planning area. Fort Lauderdale, Florida, November 1015, 2002   program and operate these facilities, and a reconfiguration of the community's main streets. The panel suggests a street network with a ""four-plustwo,"" two-way scheme consisting of two lanes of traffic along A1A and four lanes along Seabreeze Boulevard, as well as a redesigned and narrower Birch Road. These improvements should be included in an updated master plan designed to stimulate development of ""a resort community with a beach lifestyle"" that will be enjoyed by tourists, visitors, and residents alike. Public and private interests should join forces to grasp the redevelopment potential of Central Beach and, in this way, help guide its future.  52  An Advisory Services Panel Report   About the Panel  William H.

GX256-18-14147820	"Tree Protection February 2001 DCLU Proposal I. INTRODUCTION Purpose of Proposal The purpose of the proposal is for the City to improve the way it protects trees on private property especially when development occurs. The focus of the current proposal is to protect really significant trees throughout the city, even on property that is already developed. Also, the proposal would improve the way all trees over 6 inches in diameter are protected when vacant land is being developed. A summary of the proposal is contained in the cover letter. The goals of the proposal are to:    Retain as many of Seattle's really significant trees and retain (and expand) as much of Seattle's urban forest on land undergoing development as is compatible with other objectives Allow development to occur, including affordable housing Minimize permitting delays and additional costs  Value of Trees and Loss of Tree Canopy There are many economic, aesthetic, and environmental reasons to protect trees. Trees add to property value, both residential and commercial. Trees are beautiful. They soften the edges and bring green into the urban setting. They can frame views and create feelings of relaxation and comfort. They can add tremendously to a neighborhood's quality of life. Trees provide huge environmental benefits. One acre of trees can remove approximately thirteen tons of dust and gases from the atmosphere each year. Trees help prevent soil erosion by slowing rainwater runoff and they filter and purify the water, ensuring cleaner streams and lakes. And, trees provide habitat for birds and animals. An American Forests study indicated that areas with high vegetation and tree canopy cover comprised 10% of the city's area in 1972, but only covered 5% of the city in 1996. Conversely, areas with low tree cover comprised 81% of Seattle in 1972 and increased to 92% of the city in 1996. Status Of City Effort To Protect Trees On Property Undergoing Development The City has been working on the issue of protecting trees on private property, especially on sites undergoing development, for several years now. Attachment I summarizes this work to date.  1   Options and Issues All of the following proposal, of course, is subject to public comment at the February meetings. However, there are some issues and options to the proposal that deserve particular emphasis in these public discussions . These are indicated by shading in the discussion of the proposal that follows.  II. PROPOSAL Definitions Significant Trees : These are really special healthy trees because of their age, size, and rarity. A proposal to define these trees has been developed in conjunction with local ""tree experts"" and is presented in Attachment II. These trees represent probably one or two percent of the trees in Seattle on private property. Regulated trees : all trees over 6"" in diameter (measured 4.5' above the ground) Protected area: that area that must not be altered or significantly disturbed in order to protect trees. The protected area is comprised of two parts: one, the Critical Root Zone, which is half the distance to the drip line (where no disturbance is allowed); the other, the Dripline Protection Area, is the remainder of the area within the dripline (one-third of this area could be disturbed). Some minor additional incursion may be allowed if approved by a qualified tree professional.  Allowed development potential : In single family zones, this would be the maximum lot coverage. In lowrise zones, it would be equal to the floor area that can be achieved with 2   maximum lot coverage and three floors of development. Other zones use a ""reasonable use exception"". Citywide Restrictions on Tree Cutting In general, the removal of certain trees would not be permitted without an Exception being granted. This applies to Significant Trees anywhere in the City and to trees over 6"" on vacant land. Significant Trees Removal is prohibited. An Exception can be granted if a tree is hazardous or in conjunction with development if the tree must be removed in order to allow ""reasonable use"" of the property. The regulations would not apply if it is shown that the tree does not meet the Significant Tree definition (See Attachment II). Objective: To prevent removal of trees that are special because of their age, size, and rarity. Procedure : Applicant must indicate tree on site plan if it is over the designated threshold for natives or over 75% of diameter of the Washington Champion Tree for non-natives. Then significance must be determined as noted in Attachment II. Other Trees (all trees over 6"" in diameter) Removal is prohibited on vacant land. An Exception can be granted if tree is hazardous or if it is in conjunction with development. There would be no restriction on removing these trees on property that is already developed. Objective : to encourage retention of existing canopy cover, and to prevent tree removal before development review occurs. Consideration of retention is required in some instances (design review, subdivision and short plats). Educational information concerning value of trees and goals for canopy cover would be provided to all applicants. Procedure : Applicant would only need to show these trees on site plans for larger projects (SEPA, design review, subdivision or short plats). Regulations, by Zone: Significant Trees on Sites Undergoing Development The basic approach is that Significant Trees should not be removed unless necessary to provide for ""reasonable use"" of the property. Specific regulations would relate to how ""reasonable use"" is defined in single family and lowrise zones.  3   Single Family Approach : Review would only be required for trees over the diameter threshold (See Attachment II). Basic ""reasonable use"" seen as house that meets lot coverage requirement, and is able to meet parking and access (curb cut width) requirements. 1. Require identification of all existing trees over a specified diameter, by species, as indicated in Attachment II, in order to identify potential Significant tree. 2. Require arborist report on Significant status; if it is a Significant tree, the tree protection area must be established and the following steps must be taken. 3. If the structure is not proposed to locate within the tree protection area, then no further review is required except that conditions to protect tree during construction must be applied. 4. Establish allowed development potential: equal to maximum permitted development coverage (35% of lot area or 1750 square feet whichever is greater), and meeting parking and access requirements. 5. First step is to try to obtain this development potential without impinging on tree protection area (as defined in step 2) or required yards.  4   6. If the development coverage potential cannot be achieved without extending into the rear and/or front yards, such extension shall be permitted up to an amount equal to the amount of the tree protection area not located within required yards; the maximum intrusion shall not exceed a 50% reduction in yard requirements.  7. If the development potential cannot be achieved through this provision, or if the required tree protection area results in a portion of the house being less than 15 feet in width, then the tree may be removed.  5   Lowrise zones Approach : establish potential waivers and prototypes ahead of time. Handled through administrative design review. Administrative design review entails a 14-day public comment period and a public forum to discuss the proposal. 1. Potential Significant trees identified, Significant status established, and tree protection area determined as in SF zones. Also, as in SF zones, if project will stay out of protected area then can proceed with only the stipulation that conditions to protect tree during construction must be applied. Otherwise the following steps must be taken. 2. If project, because of its small size, would not ordinarily be subject to design review, then must go through administrative design review. 3. Establish allowed development potential: equal to floor area that could be achieved with maximum permitted development coverage and a three-story structure. 4. Design review evaluates two tree protection options:  Similar provisions to single family: building can extend into required setbacks (up to a maximum of 50% of setback) in order to achieve development potential; also, other development standards, such as open space requirements, can be reduced through design review if this would result in a redesign that would save the tree:  6     Development potential achieved without impinging into required yards through an increase in height to obtain development potential on a fourth floor. Maximum amount of floor area on fourth floor is equal to amount of floor area lost by staying out of tree protection area. Other currently ""untouchable"" development standards (parking requirements and density) cannot be waived:  If development potential cannot be regained in this manner then the tree can be removed. An Option to be discussed during public review of this proposal: should reduction of parking requirements be permitted through design review to protect a tree? Should  7   this apply in certain neighborhoods only? Should there be a maximum reduction (perhaps 10% of the number of required parking spaces)? Midrise zones Approach : Realize that it is more difficult to protect trees in these zones since greater lot coverage and parking often results in lot line to lot line development. Tree protection should be handled mainly through design review and associated reductions in open space and setback requirements. 1. Identify Significant tree and protection area, as above 2. Currently available development standards waivers (not height, density, or parking) should be considered to protect tree. 3. Tree can only be removed if applicant demonstrates that protecting the tree (development staying out of the tree protection area) would not permit reasonable use of the property. An Option to be discussed during public review of this proposal: should reduction of parking requirements be permitted through design review to protect a tree? Should this apply in certain neighborhoods only? Should there be a maximum reduction (perhaps 10% of the number of required parking spaces)? Note: increase in height limit is not proposed as an option in Midrise zones. Commercial Zones Approach : Realize that it is even more difficult to protect trees in these zones because of the greater development potential and lot line to lot line construction, especially for underground parking. Tree protection should be handled mainly through design review. 1. Basic approach same as Midrise. Zone edge conditions should be considered: where a tree is located in the rear or side portion of a site abutting a less intensive zone, if the area around the tree remains undeveloped it would both preserve the tree and mitigate height, bulk, and scale impacts. 2. Tree can only be removed if applicant demonstrates that protecting the tree (development staying out of the tree protection area) would not permit reasonable use of the property. An Option to be discussed during public review of this proposal: should reduction of parking requirements be permitted through design review to protect a tree? Should this apply in certain neighborhoods only? Should there be a maximum reduction (perhaps 10% of the number of required parking spaces)? Note: increase in height limit is not proposed as an option in Commercial zones. Issue: What about highrise, downtown, and industrial zones: just don't apply them here? Just let SEPA apply?  8   Other Regulated Trees (Over 6"" in Diameter) As noted above, removal of these trees on vacant land would not be permitted unless the tree is hazardous or removal is associated with project development. While retention of these trees would not be required, their retention would be encouraged through the Design Review process for larger projects and through education concerning the value of retaining trees. The educational component would be implemented through a brochure handed out at the development application stage. The brochure could state possible City goals with respect to eventual canopy cover:  Single family- 25% of lot area  Multifamily  20%  Commercial and downtown  15% Applicants would be encouraged to try to meet these objectives in the following priority:  Retention of existing trees on site  Planting of new trees on site  Planting of new street trees next to site Tree Replacement Requirements and Penalties Replacement Requirement for Significant Trees : Tree replacement would only be allowed after steps to protect the tree, as noted below, have been taken and it is determined that saving tree is not possible. Efforts should be made to replace the tree with a similar kind. Transplanting of the tree could also be considered. Penalties: Any tree that is removed illegally would be subject to a fine. The fine would be equal to the appraised value of the tree in accordance with the Guide for Plant Appraisal, 9th Edition, or successor.  9   Attachment I: Background Comprehensive Plan and 1999 Legislation In 1997 the Seattle City Council added Tree Preservation and Enhancement goals and policies to the Seattle Comprehensive Plan including a policy to encourage the preservation and maintenance of existing healthy tree cover in areas undergoing development. The following reports were published:  Protecting the Urban Forest in Areas Undergoing Development, Seattle Strategic Planning Office, March 1998  Improving Tree Protection During Regulation of Property Development , Seattle Strategic Planning Office and Urban Forest Work Group, February 1999 In 1999 the City Council adopted new Land Use Code regulations that included the following:  New landscaping (tree planting and/or retention) requirements for Single Family, LDT, L1, and L2 zones  Subdivision and short plat applications required to include the specific location and description of all trees at least 6"" inches or more in diameter; criteria for approval now include a determination that the short plat or subdivision is designed to maximize the retention of existing trees  Flexibility in location of single family, lowrise, and midrise structures to protect trees  Design review requirement to identify trees 6"" or more in diameter on the drawing of existing site conditions. 2000 Work Program The City Council asked that the following issues be looked at this year:  Provide greater flexibility in Design Review to protect trees  Protect important trees on projects that don't go through SEPA  Evaluate options for including remodeling projects under the new (1999) landscaping requirements. The Council asked that a Work Group, first convened in 1998, be reconvened to look at these issues. The Work Group is composed of people who are active in the preservation of trees throughout the city, people concerned with the ability to conduct business in the city, construction industry representatives, and conservationists. In 2000, neighborhood representatives were added to the group. The Work Group asked the Department of Design, Construction and Land Use to prepare options for additional regulations to protect trees during development. The Work Group has commented on these options but has not attempted to reach consensus. In order to promote public discussion, DCLU prepared a proposal, with options noted, that was discussed at the public meeting of August 15, 2000.  10   Following this meeting it became apparent that more work would need to be done to craft a proposal that was able to meet the goals noted in the Introduction. A focus group was created to help refine a revised proposal. A joint meeting was also held between the original Work Group and the new focus group. Following these meetings, DCLU has now formulated a new proposal that is the subject of the February 2001 public meetings. These meetings will provide additional public comment prior to submitting a final recommendation to the City Council. Other City Efforts Protecting trees during construction is only one aspect of an overall urban forest program that includes planting of street trees, managing the urban forest on City-owned parkland, etc. The City is in the process of developing an Urban Forest Strategic Plan that will provide a comprehensive, long term perspective on priority resource needs for city trees. It will be completed this year. The plan will assess existing conditions and measure them against nationally recognized criteria for sustainable urban forests. It will recommend and prioritize actions for the City and community to take, and estimate resource needs to achieve them.  11   Attachment II: Definition of Significant Trees Definitions Non-native Trees Non-native trees that are 75% of percent of the American Forestry Association (AFA) rating for the largest trees of each species in the state, as noted in Champion Trees of Washington, by Robert Van Pelt. AFA ratings are based on a tree's circumference (or diameter), height, and crown spread. Native Trees The determination of Significant native trees is a little more complex and is based on a January 2001 report by Native Seattle Trees and their Status , by Arthur Lee Jacobson. Tree species are recommended to be grouped in three categories: 1) trees that never need be saved, 2) trees that should always be saved, and 3) trees that should be saved depending on several factors discussed below. The three categories are based on the following factors:        relative and actual abundance habitat, usual and exceptional lifespan (especially if notably short or long) reproductive rate (especially if extraordinarily low) exceptional trunk sizes and heights prevalent judgement as to ornamental value post-construction lifespan and safety near buildings and people  The three categories of trees are as follows: Common, short-lived ""weedy"" species not worth saving (4): Red ALDER Bitter CHERRY Black COTTONWOOD Pacific Black WILLOW Rare species worth saving in all cases (12): Sitka ALDER Quaking ASPEN Paper BIRCH Black HAWTHORN Dwarf or Rocky Mountain MAPLE Oregon White or Garry OAK 12   Lodgepole / Shore PINE Sitka SPRUCE Geyer WILLOW Mackenzie WILLOW Hooker Pussy-WILLOW Pacific YEW Species sometimes worth saving (16): Species Pacific Crab-APPLE Oregon ASH CASCARA Western Red CEDAR Pacific DOGWOOD Douglas FIR Grand FIR Western HEMLOCK MADRONA Bigleaf MAPLE Vine MAPLE Western White PINE Western SERVICEBERRY Piper Pussy-WILLOW Scouler Pussy-WILLOW Sitka Pussy-WILLOW * Healthy young specimens on construction sites are Threshold Diameter 1'0"" 3'0"" 10"" 4'0"" 6"" 3'0"" 2'0"" 2'0"" * 4'6"" 5"" 2'0"" 5"" 8"" 1'8"" 5""  more worth saving than are old, large ones. As many specimens as possible in very good condition--regardless of size--should be preserved on construction sites, but they should not be watered or are more likely to decline and die. Requiring large specimens of average or poor health to be preserved is likely to result in a short lifespan because of damage during construction and to post-construction practices such as irrigation--harmful to this species.  Procedure for Determination of ""Significant Tree"" Non-native Trees For projects that do not require Design Review, SEPA, subdivisions or short plats, applicants are only required to indicate those trees that have a diameter of 75% of the diameter of the Champion Tree of Washington. Then a report by a tree professional would be required to determine it's height and crown spread to see if it meets the overall requirement of 75% of the Champion Tree's AFA points. The tree professional would also need to determine whether or not the tree presents a hazard and whether or not it would be able to survive after construction occurs. Native Trees  13   For projects that do not require Design Review, SEPA, subdivisions or short plats, applicants are only required to indicate those trees that have a diameter equal to or greater than the ""Threshold Diameter"" noted above. Then the tree's significance would be determined by a tree professional based on the following factors: the tree's height and crown spread, tree condition, precise location, and likelihood of surviving construction damage and remaining a save healthy specimen for years.  14"

DEVELOPMENT OPPORTUNITY The Portsmouth Port and Industrial Commission, hereinafter referred to as ""the PPIC,"" is soliciting the interest of qualified developers to work with the City of Portsmouth, hereinafter referred to as ""the City,"" and the PPIC in the development of an approximate 21.2-acre parcel located at Mile Marker Zero of the Intracoastal Waterway on the North Shore of Scotts Creek in Portsmouth, Virginia. The winning Purchaser/Developer will develop the parcel for its highest and best use with a possible marina component; and prepare a detailed program, and complete site and building plans acceptable to the PPIC. Portsmouth is located on the Elizabeth River at the mid point of the U.S. Atlantic coast, (Fig. 1) on the world's largest natural harbor and the East Coast's second-largestvolume port. At Mile Marker Zero of the Intracoastal Waterway, it offers direct access to the lower Chesapeake Bay, the Atlantic Ocean and the Intracoastal Waterway.  Figure 1  The city is situated in the heart of the country's 33rd-largest Metropolitan Statistical Area. Portsmouth has convenient access to the region's interstates, and attractions and amenities. Neighboring cities include Norfolk, Virginia Beach, Chesapeake, Suffolk, Hampton and Newport News. Portsmouth also is within an hour's ride to Williamsburg, Va., and the Outer Banks, N.C. Portsmouth has several historic neighborhoods, rich in character and architecture. Scotts Creek neighborhoods (see cover photo) are among them. Portsmouth's strategic location and small-town charm make it ideal for commercial, residential and recreational development. It is home to over 6,000 businesses and more than 100,000 residents. Figure 2  4   SITE  Figure 3  5   Complementing the city's 250 years of historic charm are many attractions, such as museums, galleries, entertainment venues, specialty shops and fine restaurants. All are within walking distance of Portsmouth's historic downtown.  Olde Towne is, according to the American Institute of Architects, the best collection of historic homes between Alexandria, Va., and Charleston, S.C.  A tree-lined High Street offers a pleasurable array of art, antique and specialty shops, and several fine restaurants.  The Elizabeth River Ferry is a scenic means of travel between downtown Portsmouth and downtown Norfolk.  The nTelos Pavilion at Harbor Center is a state-of-the-art amphitheater and first-class entertainment venue, with the Elizabeth River as its backdrop. It won the Hampton Roads Association of Commercial Real Estate First Honor Award for Best Recreation/Entertainment Facility in 2001.  The Renaissance Portsmouth Hotel and Waterfront Conference Center offers luxury accommodations and boasts the highest occupancy rate of all the Marriott Hotels in the U.S. It also won a HRACRE First Honor Award for Best Commercial/Retail Building over 100,000 square feet in 2000.  One of the country's oldest Fresnel lenses that once shone from the Hog Island Lighthouse now shines as a beacon from Portsmouth's seawall.  The Children's Museum of Virginia is an enlightening experience for children of all ages, with two floors packed full of exhibits, including a toy train collection, a planetarium, adventures with bubbles and much more.  The Courthouse Galleries, housed in the historic Greek Revival-style 1846 Courthouse, offers a dramatic setting for ever-changing exhibits, lectures, classes and performances.  The Lightship Museum, a National Historic Landmark, is an actual lightship realistically fitted out and filled with fascinating artifacts, uniforms, photographs, models and more.  The Naval Shipyard Museum offers a unique perspective on U.S. history, from Colonial to Civil War times and beyond.  The Commodore Theatre, one of Hampton Roads' best-kept secrets, is a renovated 1945 movie theater that offers a sit-down dining experience while showing first-run movies.  A number of other amenities and attractions throughout the city make Portsmouth a truly memorable destination. Year-round festivals and special events capitalize on all that makes Portsmouth unique.  6   Synergy between the City and the development community has historic Portsmouth moving toward an exciting future. Among the new and exciting projects are:  The Estates at River Pointe is a high-end waterfront community of custom-built homes, several valued at $1 million plus. The community will also offer approximately 58 villa homes for senior buyers and a neighborhood shopping center. In 2003 The Estates at River Pointe was the site of the Tidewater Builders Association Homearama, which attracted some 86,000 visitors.  The Myrtles at Olde Towne is a planned 249-unit apartment complex, whose architecture will complement that of the adjacent historic neighborhoods.  Following the renaissance of Portsmouth's historic High Street corridor, Victory Crossing in central Portsmouth has been redeveloped as a retail center.  Tidewater Community College plans to relocate its large Suffolk-Portsmouth campus from Suffolk to a new state-of-the-art facility in Portsmouth's new Victory Crossing Business Park.  Plans for the Victory Crossing also call for the development of a 135-acre business park.  Westbury is a new award-winning community of Victorian and Colonial-style homes.  Sterling Cove, a community of 66 condominiums, is designed for older adults. Visit www.portsmouth.va.us for a closer look at Portsmouth.  II. PROPERTY DESCRIPTION AND NEIGHBORHOOD OVERVIEW The property is bounded to the East by adjoining businesses, the South and West by 3,400 feet of shoreline on Scotts Creek, and to the North by 2,825 feet of frontage on Harper Avenue. The property shares the small peninsula called Pinner's Point, which separates Scotts Creek from the Elizabeth River, with Portsmouth Marine Terminal and a small shipyard on the Elizabeth River to the North. Another marina, and a diving and marine construction business are located to the East at the mouth of the creek. Across Scotts Creek to the South, the four stable residential neighborhoods of historic Park View, West Park View, Shea Terrace and Sugar Hill share the shoreline with several water-related small businesses: a boatyard, a small marina and shipwright's shop, a crab house, and a seafood restaurant. Portsmouth Naval Medical Center, a yacht club and a small television station are also located on Scotts Creek. The character of the creek is primarily defined by the residential neighborhoods' relationship to the water, each neighborhood's unique mix of period architectural styles and their residents. Several factors make Scotts Creek an ideal location for a marina or other enterprise with a water-related component. Scotts Creek is one of the few sheltered small waterways in Hampton Roads with no bridges or other vertical obstructions. The federally maintained entrance channel carries an 8-foot controlling depth. Mean tidal range is 2.8 feet.  7   The site is located less than a mile from the Northern end of the Intracoastal Waterway, commonly known as ""Mile Marker Zero."" In fiscal year 2002-03, 58,874 boaters used the Intracoastal Waterway on their annual fall migration South and their spring return trip North, often stopping in Portsmouth. The City reduced the personal property tax on boats to 1 cent per $100 valuation, which has succeeded in attracting recreational boaters to the city's marinas. As a result, there are 2,900 boats registered in Portsmouth. Another marine facility in Portsmouth could easily attract more tenants from across the region. The area remains ice-free for the entire winter due to its temperate climate and has one of the lowest incidences of hurricanes on the East coast, averaging only one landfall per decade, due to the influence of the Gulf Stream and Cape Hatters. The property lies approximately 8 feet to 10 feet above mean high water, and within the 100-year flood plain. The property is easily accessible by road. It is only one mile from both historic downtown Portsmouth and the bustling downtown Norfolk commerce center. Local Route 164 Freeway and Route 664 provide a direct connection by four-lane highway to Interstate 64 to Richmond and points North and West, and to Interstate 95 via U.S. Route 58 to points South. Norfolk International Airport, a major regional airport, is within one-half hour's drive. Transport by sea and rail are available nearby via Portsmouth Marine Terminal. The property is currently zoned M-2. In 1991, the city spent $1.1 million upgrading Harper Avenue, and water and sewer facilities serving the site.  III. DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT GUIDELINES Design and development guidelines have been established to ensure and implement the highest quality design standards for the project. The design scale and character of the development must be compatible with the Scotts Creek residential communities. Should the project have a marina component, the project may be designed to accommodate both transient and permanent (leased) dock space, or docks in conjunction with other commercial or residential development. The layout and operation of the marina should facilitate local usage as well as offering sufficient amenities to constitute a major destination point for craft traveling the Intracoastal Waterway and Chesapeake Bay. Landside repair facilities, if proposed, must be contained within buildings. Limited repair service will be allowed at the slips. Dry storage configuration can be open, enclosed or a combination, but must be screened. These guidelines are intended to serve as a framework for the planning and design of the property. Development parameters for this property must include:  Sensitivity to existing neighborhoods, and compliance with Chesapeake Bay Regulations, including the 100-foot Riparian Protection Area requirement;  Compliance of any marina piers, access piers, boat ramp, fuel island and boat lifts with U.S. Army Corps of Engineers standards;  Application of the highest standards in the design and use of quality of materials in the construction.  8   IV.

GX247-47-3888310	Lawrence County Mine Reclamation         Projects                       DEP WILL FILL MINE         VOIDS UNDER 146 PROPERTIES           . . . . . . . . January 10, 1997           DEP’s Bureau of         Abandoned Mine Reclamation has conducted a         pre-construction conference for a mine subsidence control         project to begin in Neshannock Township, Lawrence County.         This project, referenced as OSM 37(2856)102.1, is         intended to stabilize 146 properties located along         Shenango Road, Old Plank Road, Greenfield Road, Lexington         Street, Meadow Lane, Elm Drive and Greentree Circle, all         situated in Neshannock Township. Major work items under         this contract include 12,100 feet of overburden drilling,         17,830 feet of air rotary drilling and 34,825 tons of a         grout mixture consisting of flyash and cement. This grout         mixture will be injected underground, through drilled         boreholes, to fill the underlying mine voids. The project         is scheduled to take one year and will be completed by         Eles Brothers, Inc., the successful low bidder, at an         estimated cost of $1.05 million.            Over the last 10 years,         DEP’s Ebensburg District Office has received more         than 90 complaints of mine subsidence in Neshannock         Township, Lawrence County, alone. Because of the severity         and frequency of mine subsidence complaints in this area,         several projects have already been undertaken. Two         exploratory drilling projects were completed in 1987 to         help determine the extent of mining in this area. The         first mine subsidence control project was then completed         in May 1990, stabilizing 16 residences. Since then, the         BAMR has developed an area wide subsidence control plan,         much of which will be addressed by the current project.           WESTERN         PA COALITION FOR ABANDONED MINE RECLAMATION           The Western Pennsylvania Coalition for Abandoned         Mine Reclamation was established in 1981 to provide         leadership for encouraging the reclamation, development         and best use of abandoned mine lands in the bituminous         coal area of western Pennsylvania. This independent,         non-profit, non-partisan group supplements the efforts of         the Pennsylvania Association of Conservation Districts,         the Rural Abandoned Mine Program, and others with similar         goals.

GX244-04-0928258	"Site Navigation                   DEPS New Remining Incentives Program At Work In Jefferson County         KNOX, PA (Feb. 20) -- The Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection today announced the issuance of the first permit in Jefferson County to use DEPs new remining incentives program aimed at restoring abandoned mine lands.  Javed Mirza, district mining manager of DEPs Knox Mining Office, also thanked Rep. Samuel H. Smith (R-Jefferson) for his help in creating the new program.     ""After fueling the industrial revolution and two world wars, Pennsylvania has been left with 250,000 acres of abandoned mine lands.  It would cost Pennsylvania taxpayers billions of dollars to restore those lands using existing reclamation programs, Mirza said.  With help from Rep. Smith, to ease that burden, DEP developed this new program to encourage today's mining industry to remine and reclaim abandoned mine land.""     The program, an outgrowth of changes made to the Surface Mining Conservation and Reclamation Act in 1992 and in 1996 as part of a package of incentives approved in House Bill 1940 sponsored by Smith, is designed to encourage the remining of abandoned mine lands and subsequent reclamation of those areas.     The financial guarantee portion of H.B. 1940 established a fund within DEP to guarantee reclamation liability on a remine area for qualified operators.  The mine operator pays an annual premium to the fund based upon his remine reclamation liability.  The fund is then used to help defray permitting costs and bonding costs as an incentive for operators to remine and reclaim abandoned sites according to current standards.     ""We expect this program to provide the incentive for the mining industry to reclaim more than 1,000 acres of abandoned mine land each year,"" Mirza said.  Currently, DEP reclaims about 1,100 acres of abandoned mine lands each year through its Bureau of Abandoned Mine Reclamation.     Original Fuels Inc. of Punxsutawney is the first company in northwestern Pennsylvania to receive approval under this new program.  The company plans to reclaim seven acres of spoil and approximately 1,200 feet of abandoned highwall at a site in Perry Township, Jefferson County.     Mirza noted that there are two similar requests pending for areas in Elk County.     Qualified operators may use the program to bond abandoned mine land and up to 300 feet of adjacent unmined land.     In addition to these incentives, mining operators also can earn bond credits by performing voluntary reclamation of additional abandoned mine lands under an agreement with DEP.  The credit is the operator's cost to reclaim the proposed area or DEP's cost, whichever is less.  Credits may then be applied   as bond on any coal mining permit, and may be transferred and reused once after their first use.     ""Operators who reclaim abandoned mine land for private landowners, or want to reclaim abandoned mine land adjacent to an active mine, will be most interested in the bond credits,"" Mirza said.     For more information, contact any DEP District Mining Office or the Bureau of Mining and Reclamation at 717 787-5103.  Information about the remining incentives program is also posted on the DEP World Wide website at http://www.dep.state.pa.us (choose Information by Environmental Subject/choose Mining and Mineral Resources).

GX082-02-7577350	News Release        FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  March 22, 1999       ODNR EXPLORATORY DRILLING PROJECT WILL STUDY EXTENT AND CONDITION   OF ABANDONED MINES IN CITY OF GREEN NEIGHBORHOOD     COLUMBUS, OH -- The Ohio Department of Natural Resources (ODNR) will conduct subsurface drilling tests beginning March 29 to determine the extent and condition of abandoned underground mines in a residential neighborhood of Green in southeast Summit County.  Initially, drilling will be conducted on streets and other public rights-of-way, however, ODNR officials may later ask permission to evaluate some private properties as well.  Work is expected to be completed by the end of April.   The affected area covers several city blocks within a larger area bounded by Derbyshire Road on the south, Charleston Drive on the east, Moore Road on the north and Cottage Grove Road on the west.  Owners of approximately 100 adjacent properties have been notified by ODNR.   ODNR Field Project Manager Jim Gue, with the ODNR Division of Mines & Reclamation's district office in Salem, said the program  called the Berkenstock Mine Subsidence Exploratory Drilling Project  will define the limits of mapped abandoned underground coal mines in the area and will help develop recommendations to reduce the risk of damage or property loss caused by mine subsidence activity.   In recent years, areas in Green and neighboring Green Township have experienced several subsidence incidents due to the collapse of abandoned underground coal mines dating from the 1920s.  Mines from that era were often not mapped or the existing maps are incomplete, Gue said.   Persons having questions or comments regarding the exploratory drilling project may contact Jim Gue, ODNR Division of Mines and Reclamation in Salem, at (330) 222-1527 or Derek Collins, geologist with the division's Abandoned Mine Lands Program in Columbus, at (614) 265-1038.     -30-     For Further Information Contact:  ODNR Media Relations  (614) 265-6886

Project 9394  Replacement of Utilities at ...................................................................... (M-7) Cordova Road/Lauderdale Harbours Mr. Hector Castro, City Engineer, explained that bids had been received on April 19, 2000, and the contract award had been deferred from the last meeting because a bid protest had been filed. He stated that there had been some irregularities in the bid of the low bidder as detailed in the back-up memorandum distributed in connection with this item. Mr. Ira Libanoff, representing Telcon, Inc., the second low bidder, said a fairly lengthy bid protest letter had been submitted to the City. He stated that the bid of AKA Services was nonresponsive and clearly in contravention of the bid documents and instructions to bidders. Mr. Libanoff said page 1.B.2 of the bid documents related to causes for rejection, and there was no dispute that the bid submitted by AKA Services had not provided all of the information requested. It had not included a $149,500 mobilization item, which was the very first item in the bid. He believed that omission rendered the bid informal under the City's definitions and, therefore, should not have been accepted or considered. Mr. Libanoff advised that despite this clear error, staff had recommended award of the contract to AKA Services. He stated that when one added the line items in this bid, it came to $2,825,000. However, the recommended award was in the amount of $2,955,000. Therefore, the additional $149,500 mobilization cost left out of the bid was being included in the recommended award. Mr. Libanoff stated that AKA Services had filed a response to the bid protest, and it had referred to omission of the mobilization cost as an oversight, a minor omission, and a minor irregularity. However, he felt failure to include the price of mobilization was not minor, nor an oversight. He pointed out that $149,500 represented 5% of the bid amount, which was also the amount of a bid bond, so that could not be considered minor. Mr. Libanoff felt this came down to a question of the integrity of the City's documents and instructions v. dollars and cents. In the response file by AKA Services, it had been brought out that there was a $200,000+ difference between its bid and the second low bid. He did not dispute that issue, and it had been pointed out that the Commission was entitled to waive minor irregularities. Mr. Libanoff acknowledged the importance of saving tax dollars, but it was clear the low bidder had not conformed with the bid requirements. Further, the recommendation actually awarded the low bidder an extra $149,500. Mr. Libanoff thought the City should enforce its bid documents and not look solely at the cost. He did not think it was appropriate to allow bidders a ""second chance look"" at bids, and it was his position that the low bid was non-responsive. However, if the Commission was inclined to follow staff's recommendation, he felt an award should be made in the actual bid amount rather than the higher amount if savings was the primary issue.   Minutes of a Regular Meeting  6/6/00 - 19  Mr. Bill Salim, Attorney representing AKA Services, stated that a substantial response had been filed to the protest, and there had been an oversight in failing to complete the mobilization item. He explained that item had been intended as a ""fill in"" of the balance of the bid. Mr. Salim stated that if the bid items were added, the total was $2,955,000 except for the mobilization unit, so the total bid amount was not being changed. Mr. Salim agreed there had been an omission of one line item, but the total amount had not been changed. Mr. Salim stated that the bid documents specifically allowed the City to waive minor irregularities, and AKA Services had acknowledged the oversight and the fact that it rendered the bid informal. However, that did not render the bid nonresponsive, and the City had reserved the right to waive any informality to obtain the lowest price. Mr. Salim pointed out that the irregularity allowed no competitive advantages to AKA Services because the bottom line price had always been the same. He also pointed out that the low bid was $200,000 lower than the second low bid, and public policy was promoted by accepted the low bid. Mr. Salim requested that the City Commission waive the irregularity and award the contract to AKA Services. The City Manager stated that staff was satisfied that the irregularity was just that and stood by the recommendation to award this contract to AKA Services. Commissioner Moore disclosed that the company he worked for had used Mr. Salim's services in the past, although he did not believe it was a conflict of interest.

(Pur. 5) for HOPWA Funding Requests Commissioner Moore asked if there were any other late proposals. He understood the Broward House proposal had come in late. Mr. Kirk Buffington, Purchasing Manager, advised that the proposal from Broward House and Shadowood. Commissioner Moore understood it was a joint proposal. Mr. Buffington said that was his understanding, but staff had not been able to open two parts of the proposal, so he could not be absolutely certain. He added that five or six other proposals had been submitted. Commissioner Moore asked if any explanation had been offered for the late submission. Mr. Buffington replied that a written explanation had been submitted. He explained that the proposals had been very voluminous and coming from different parts of the organization. Therefore, parts of the proposal had been delivered on time while others had been late. Mr. Buffington stated that one part had been delivered to the HOPW A Supervisor rather than to the Purchasing Division, and another had come late because it had been delivered separately. Commissioner Moore understood one part had gone to the wrong City department, but it had been delivered on time. Mr. Buffington agreed that was correct. Commissioner Moore was concerned about compromising the integrity of the process. However, this grant had impact on a lot of individuals. Mr. Buffington felt the integrity of the process was extremely important, and he always gave late proposals serious consideration. In this case, he did not believe the process was compromised in any way. He believed it was in the best interests of the City and the community being served that the proposal at least be opened. Motion made by Commissioner Moore and seconded by Commissioner Smith that Consent Agenda Item No. Pur. 5 be approved as recommended. Roll call showed: YEAS: Commissioners Smith, Moore, Hutchinson, Katz, and Mayor Naugle. NAYS: none. Bid 702-8230  Consultant Services  ........................................................................ (Pur. 9) Sanitation Rate Study Commissioner Moore asked how many firms had been represented at the pre-bid conference held in connection with the Sanitation Rate Study. Mr. Kirk Buffington, Purchasing Manager, believed three representatives had attended the pre-bid conference. He noted that although 177 invitations to submit proposals had been sent, that did not mean all of the firms were qualified to perform this type of specialized study. Commissioner Smith felt this study was necessary because he had received complaints about the fairness of the rate structure. Motion made by Commissioner Smith and seconded by Commissioner Moore that Consent Agenda Item No. Pur. 9 be approved as recommended. Roll call showed: YEAS: Commissioners Smith, Moore, Hutchinson, Katz, and Mayor Naugle. NAYS: none. General Liability Settlement  File No. GL 97580B (Wanda Mullins) - $35,000 ............................................................. (M-20) A motion was presented authorizing the settlement of General Liability File No. 97-580B for $35,000 (W anda Mullins).   Minutes of a Regular Meeting  6/6/00 - 21  Motion made by Commissioner Smith and seconded by Commissioner Hutchinson to approve the settlement of General Liability File No. GL 97-580B (W anda Mullins) in the amount of $35,000. Roll call showed: YEAS: Commissioners Smith, Moore, Hutchinson, Katz, and Mayor Naugle. NAYS: none. Lien Settlements for Code Enforcement and Special Master Cases .......................... (M-21) A motion was presented authorizing the settlement of the following Code Enforcement Board and/or Special Master cases: 1. 2. 3. 4. Case Case Case Case No. No. No. No. 90-763  Robert D'Avanzo, 928 Northeast 20th Avenue - $5,000. CE99010588  Sky Motel, 1515-1531 Southwest 26th Street - $8,000 93-1174  Lovie Holmes, 424 Northwest 23rd Avenue - $5,000. CE98040479  Patricia Fraser, 1507 Northwest 15th Avenue - $2,500.  Mayor Naugle understood the proposed settlements had been accepted by the property owners involved. Ms. Lori Milano, Community Inspections Bureau, agreed that was correct. 928 Northeast 20th Avenue Commissioner Smith the fine in this case should be forgiven. He stated that this case dated back to the days when the priorities of citizens were not being enforced. Commissioner Smith said this property had been cited for having a canopy over some tables at the back of a restaurant, and he thought it would be more fair to reduced the fine to $0. He did not feel it had been fair to cite this violation in the first place, and it had caused a multitude of problems in the owner's family. Mayor Naugle noted that there had been costs incurred in handling the case and suggested a $500 settlement. Commissioner Smith felt that would be reasonable. Commissioner Moore asked how much expense had been incurred by the City. Ms. Milano stated that the case dated back to 1991, and there had been a long list of violations cited originally. Commissioner Moore suggested a $2,500 settlement. Motion made by Commissioner Smith and seconded by Commissioner Hutchinson to settle Case No. 90-763 for $2,500. Roll call showed: YEAS: Commissioners Smith, Moore, Hutchinson, Katz, and Mayor Naugle. NAYS: none. Motion made by Commissioner Moore and seconded by Commissioner Hutchinson to approve the remaining settlements as recommended. Roll call showed: YEAS: Commissioners Smith, Moore, Hutchinson, Katz, and Mayor Naugle. NAYS: none. Legal Fees  City View ...................................................................................................... (OB) Commissioner Moore felt each party should pay one-third of the costs through mediation. The City Attorney stated that the legal fees had been set at not to exceed $10,000, and not to exceed an additional $5,000 as the City's contribution toward mediation costs as discussed during the earlier Conference meeting. At this time, it was within the Commission's discretion to modify the idea any way desired. Commissioner Moore felt each party should participate in one-third of the mediation costs, and pay the $10,000 legal fees. It was agreed.   Minutes of a Regular Meeting  6/6/00 - 22  Motion made by Commissioner Moore and seconded by Commissioner Hutchinson to approve an expenditure of $10,000 for legal fees in connection with the City View matter and to contribute one-third of the mediation costs. Roll call showed: YEAS: Commissioners Smith, Moore, Hutchinson, Katz, and Mayor Naugle. NAYS: none. Event Agreement  Community Uplift ............................................................................. (OB) Mr. Tom Tapp, Director of Parks & Recreation, stated that Community Uplift proposed an event on Northwest 19th Street from June 7 through 25, 2000 on private property. He explained that the intent of the event was to stem the tide of drug abuse, alcoholism and teenager rebellion. Ms. Marsha Goldsby, Lauderdale Manors Homeowners Association, hoped the City Commission would allow the event. However, due to complaints about noise, she hoped the City would do whatever was necessary to address noise problems. Commissioner Moore stated that this was a worthy event, but he felt there should be some constraints on noise. If there were any noise complaints that could not be immediately addressed, he felt the event should be canceled. In the future, Commissioner Moore hoped the event would be held further away from residences. Motion made by Commissioner Moore and seconded by Commissioner Smith to approve this event as discussed. Roll call showed: YEAS: Commissioners Smith, Moore, Hutchinson, Katz, and Mayor Naugle. NAYS: none. Amendment to Ordinance No. C-85-77  Comcast Corporation One-Year Extension of Cable Television Franchise Agreement ................................. (PH-1) A public hearing was scheduled to consider an amendment to Ordinance No. C-85-77 to grant Comcast Corporation a one-year extension of the cable television franchise agreement with the City. Notice of the public hearing was published on May 25 and June 1, 2000. Mayor Naugle called for those who wished to be heard. There were none. Motion made by Commissioner Moore and seconded by Commissioner Smith that the public hearing be closed. Roll call showed: YEAS: Commissioners Smith, Moore, Hutchinson, Katz, and Mayor Naugle. NAYS: none. Commissioner Katz suggested a six-month extension of the agreement. Mayor Naugle said he would support that term. Mr. Bruce Larkin, Director of Administrative Services, felt a one-year extension would be prudent because staff was waiting for a transfer to take place from Comcast to AT&T. He advised that some adjustments in the franchise had been made, and this extension would afford the time necessary to go through the transfer. Afterwards, there would be an extensive renegotiation process with Comcast's successor, AT&T, and staff would present a long-term agreement to the Commission. Mayor Naugle felt a one-year term would allow the companies involved to further, and he thought it would be a good idea to keep the pressure on suffered as long as Comcast remained the franchise holder. He wanted t hands of a company willing to provide the services that were promised to years ago. delay the transfer because the City his contract in the the City over two   Minutes of a Regular Meeting  6/6/00 - 23  Commissioner Moore understood the City would be receiving several thousand dollars in consideration of this agreement, and he did not want to waive that consideration. Mr. Larkin explained that the new definition of gross revenues would result in an additional $180,000 coming to the City. He also added that there was a desire to provide additional services, and the cable consultant was working with two firms interested in an ""overbuild"" in Fort Lauderdale so competitive pressures would be brought to bear on Comcast and AT&T. Mr. Adrian Herbst, the City's cable consultant, anticipated the transfer to be triggered during the latter part of the summer. Once triggered, under the law, there was a four-month period to complete the transfer. Therefore, he did not believe a six-month extension would be sufficient. He believed the City would have good leverage during the transfer process to update, modernize and modify the franchise agreement. He understood the concern, but he did not believe this extension would have any adverse impact on the City. Further, if the extension proved too short, the agreement would have to be extended again. Commissioner Smith suggested a nine-month term. Mr. Herbst noted that the document also included provision for month-to-month extensions, if necessary, and he hoped that would remain in place. It was agreed. Commissioner Smith introduced the following ordinance on first reading, as amended: ORDINANCE NO. C-00-28 AN ORDINANCE OF THE CITY OF FORT LAUDERDALE AMENDING ORDINANCE NO. C-85-77 RELATING TO THE FRANCHISE GRANTED BY THE CITY OF FORT LAUDERDALE, FLORIDA TO CONSTRUCT, OPERATE AND MAINTAIN A CABLE TELEVISION SYSTEM OVER AND BENEATH THE PUBLIC STREETS AND OTHER PUBLIC PROPERTY OF THE CITY OF FORT LAUDERDALE PROVIDING THAT FRANCHISEE, COMCAST CORPORATION SHALL ENTER INTO AN AMENDMENT AND EXTENSION TO THE AMENDED FRANCHISE AGREEMENT W ITH THE CITY TO EXTEND THE TERM OF THE EXISTING FRANCHISE FOR A LIMITED PERIOD; AMENDING THE DEFINITIONS OF ""ANNUAL GROSS REVENUES"" AND ""AMENDED FRANCHISE AGREEMENT""; ALTERING THE MANNER OF PAYMENT OF FEES; AND ADDRESSING ISSUES SUBJECT TO FINAL DETERMINATION SUCH AS NON-DISCRIMINATORY ACCESS TO THE CABLE SYSTEM AND PASS-THROUGH COSTS.___________________________________________ W hich ordinance was read by title only.

Application for Dock Waiver of Limitations  Lauderdale Marine Center, Inc.  2001 Southwest 20th Street ..................................... (PH-2) A public hearing was scheduled to consider a resolution authorizing the proper City officials to waive the limitations of Section 47-19.3(B) and (C) of the Unified Land Development Regulations (ULDR) as provided by Section 47-19.3(D) of the Code of Ordinances in order to allow Lauderdale Marine Center, Inc. to construct 8 concrete floating finger piers and 22 dolphin pilings that extend a maximum distance of approximately 45.9 feet and 69.4 feet, respectively, from the property line into the South Fork of the New River.   Minutes of a Regular Meeting Mayor Naugle called for those who wished to be heard. The following appeared:  6/6/00 - 24  Ms. Jennifer McDonald, a resident of Southwest 20th Street, felt this marina was taking over the neighborhood. She said she owned three duplexes on 20th Street, and she did not feel the marina should be expanded further. Mr. Bill Keith, representing the applicant, stated that the marina had been in this location since 1927, and the redevelopment process had been long and difficult. He advised that this was the first he had heard of any concern, and the developer had been working with the neighborhood. Mr. Keith noted that both the Shady Banks and River Oaks Neighborhood Associations had provided written support of the project. Mr. Keith stated that this was not an expansion of the marina and involved only replacement of existing docks. However, he was willing to work with Ms. McDonald. Mayor Naugle did not believe anything was planned near 20th Street. Mr. Keith agreed that was true. Motion made by Commissioner Moore and seconded by Commissioner Smith that the public hearing be closed. Roll call showed: YEAS: Commissioners Smith, Moore, Hutchinson, Katz, and Mayor Naugle. NAYS: none. Commissioner Hutchinson stated that Mr. Keith had been working closely with the neighborhood, and she hoped he would address Ms. McDonald's concerns. She understood there were some traffic concerns, and she asked that Ms. McDonald be brought into the process. Mr. Keith had no objection. Commissioner Moore recalled discussion about a park opposite the marina on the other side of the waterway. It was his understanding the marina would not have any impact on the north side of the waterway, and he did not know what park had been discussed. Mr. Keith said there was an environmental parcel across the River from the marina, and it was his understanding that the price of the land had been too high, so a park was no longer being considered for acquisition under the Parks Bond Issue. Commissioner Katz understood there would be reflective tape on the pilings, but she thought better lighting would be appropriate. Mr. Keith stated that much more than reflective tape would be provided. He advised the existing pilings had been removed, and he did not expect anything electrical, but there would be reflectors all the way around the pilings. Mayor Naugle stated that a lot of vessels had spotlights that were used at night. Commissioner Moore asked if the pilings would be in the same locations as the old pilings. Mr. Keith replied they would be placed within 1' of the previous locations. He displayed a slide showing the area of submerged land that had been leased in 1987, and it showed the locations of the previous pilings and the proposed pilings.   Minutes of a Regular Meeting Commissioner Smith introduced a written resolution entitled: RESOLUTION NO. 00-65  6/6/00 - 25  A RESOLUTION OF THE CITY COMMISSION OF THE CITY OF FORT LAUDERDALE, FLORIDA, W AIVING THE LIMITATIONS OF SECTION 47-19.3.B & C OF THE CODE OF ORDINANCES OF THE CITY OF FORT LAUDERDALE TO ALLOW LAUDERDALE MARINE CENTER, A FLORIDA GENERAL PARTNERSHIP TO CONSTRUCT AND MAINTAIN EIGHT (8) FLOATING FINGER PIERS AND TW ENTY-TW O (22) DOLPHIN PILINGS, MORE PARTICULARLY DESCRIBED BELOW , THAT EXTEND FROM THE PROPERTY LINE INTO THE SOUTH FORK OF NEW RIVER FOR THE PROPERTY LOCATED AT 2001 S.W . 20TH STREET AND LEGALLY DESCRIBED BELOW .______________________________________________ W hich resolution was read by title only.

City Commission Call-Up for Review  Application to Continue a Nonconforming Use  National Lift Truck Service/Charlie Frymeyer, Inc. (ARC Case No. 16-NC-99) ........................................... (PH-3) A public hearing was scheduled to consider an application to continue a nonconforming use of the National Lift Truck Service (owner)/Charlie Frymeyer, Inc. (tenant) property located at 201 Northwest 20th Avenue. On April 11, 2000, the City Commission voted 5 to 0 to hold such public hearing on June 6, 2000. Mayor Naugle called for those who wished to be heard. There were none. Motion made by Commissioner Moore and seconded by Commissioner Smith that the public hearing be closed. Roll call showed: YEAS: Commissioners Smith, Moore, Hutchinson, Katz, and Mayor Naugle. NAYS: none. Mayor Naugle said he had called up this item for review because he had seen a lot of earth moving and trees being removed or relocated. He had observed some diesel fuel tanks being stored on the property near the drainage ditch that led directly to the North Fork of the New River as well, without any retaining berms. Mayor Naugle was concerned about potential leaks, and there was a lot of equipment being stored on the property. It seemed to him that someone was operating a storage yard without meeting current Code requirements. Mayor Naugle had asked staff to investigate, and he had learned today that there were many Code violations on the site. Ms. Liz Holt, Construction Services, stated that Code enforcement personnel had found diesel tanks placed on the property without permits. In addition, some trees had been cut down. She advised that there had not been sufficient time to determine if those trees had been covered by the tree removal permit issued in 1994, however. Nevertheless, the Landscape Inspector had found stumps of an oak tree and a black olive tree, so additional inspections would be necessary. It was Ms. Holt's understanding that a Notice of Violation would be issued with respect to the fuel tanks.   Minutes of a Regular Meeting  6/6/00 - 26  Mayor Naugle asked if paving, drainage, and a retention berm would be required for a storage yard. He thought it might be best to defer this until some type of plan could be presented. Ms. Holt stated that the first stage of this process had entailed a records review. She explained that the use had been denied, and a records review had been conducted to determine there had been no intent to abandon the use. However, permitting would not occur until the second phase of the process. Commissioner Moore said he had made inquiries about this site some months ago, and he had been informed that nothing was taking place on the property at the time. He stated that this had long been a negative property in the area, so he hoped every review allowed would be undertaken and any Code violations addressed immediately. Ms. Susan Motley, representing the applicant, stated that National Lift Truck had been in business in Fort Lauderdale since the early 1970s, and this property was adjacent to their existing building and business. She introduced Mr. Robert Ciano, President of National Lift Truck, and Ms. Sarah Stewart, who had conducted the research with regard to the continuing nonconforming use. Ms. Motley stated there were no residential homes in this area near the Salvation Army complex. She described the surrounding uses. Mayor Naugle pointed out that there were residences directly across the River from the subject property. Ms. Motley agreed that was correct. Ms. Motley stated that she had not waived her client's right to challenge this consideration tonight because the Code required a call-up within 30 days of the staff decision. She advised that the Notice of Determination had been issued on March 6, 2000. However, the motion to set a public hearing had not been considered until April 11, 2000. She advised that her client had agreed to cooperate, but the 30-day period had been exceeded. Ms. Motley reported that the determination made by staff had been that the owner had demonstrated there had been no intention of abandoning the previous use. She explained that water had been continuously provided to the site, and there had been continuous efforts to lease the property. Ms. Motley acknowledged that the last date on which there had been an occupational license exceeded the 180-day limit, but the property had been continuously occupied since the last licensed occupant had vacated the property. Therefore, there was no issue with regard to continuation of the nonconforming use. Ms. Motley understood there might be some Code enforcement issues, and any violations could and would be addressed as necessary. However, the nonconforming use had never been abandoned. She stated that her client had purchased the property on September 9, 1999, but the tenant had been a paving company that had occupied the property since January, 1999. Ms. Motley said the property was zoned B-1, although all the surrounding uses were industrial, and her client had been told he could not obtain an occupational license. At that time, she had been retained to examine the records as to the continuing use. Ms. Motley pointed out that water service had been provided and equipment had been stored continuously, and back-up material had been provided detailing these uses and associated dates. Ms. Motley referred to the diesel tanks on the property. She had contacted the tenant who said he had been told a permit was not required because the tanks were on a rack. However, if permits were necessary, the owner would ensure the tenant proceeded accordingly. She stated the issue before the Commission tonight was continuation of the nonconforming use, and she reported that there had never been more than a month without a tenant occupying the property.   Minutes of a Regular Meeting  6/6/00 - 27  Commissioner Moore said he differed with everything Ms. Motley had stated. He pointed out that the property had been rezoned, and the nonconforming use should end along the North Fork of the New River. He acknowledged that there might have been people using the property all along, but none of them had been properly licensed to operate. Commissioner Moore understood water had been supplied to the building, but the occupants had not had a right to continue a nonconforming use on the site. He hoped the Commission would deny continuation of this use. Ms. Motley stated that the Code indicated that people were entitled to continue nonconforming uses unless there had been an abandonment of the use for 180 days or more. She pointed out that City staff had reviewed all of the documentation, which showed there had never been a cessation of the nonconforming use for a six-month period. Therefore, the City Commission did not have a right to determine the use had to be stopped. She stated that the City could make the occupants comply with the Code, but the nonconforming use had never been terminated for 180 days. Commissioner Moore believed the Code required occupational licenses to operate businesses. Although the property might have been occupied, the tenants had not been operating legally without licensing. Ms. Motley stated that the tenant did not have an occupational license because the City would not issue it. Mayor Naugle said his problem with this was that there were B-3 or M-1 properties all over the City on which industrial uses were allowed. However, this had been a raw piece of vacant land, and he did not feel it was appropriate to store various types of chemicals and equipment without a building, paving, drainage, etc., to protect the environment. Instead, someone had moved some earth, parked vehicles and stored diesel fuel. Mayor Naugle agreed with Commissioner Moore that ""camping out"" illegally on the property did not constitute proper continued use. Commissioner Hutchinson wanted to hear from the City Attorney with regard to Ms. Motley's statements. The City Attorney stated this case was somewhat unusual because other cases usually involved the use of a structure. The question had also involved whether or not the tenant of the property had continued to make appropriate use of the premises, sometimes with and sometimes without all the necessary licenses and zoning approvals. Generally, these cases had involved the use of a structure with approvals continuously. The City Attorney explained that staff made the determination as to whether or not a use had continued, and the procedure being followed tonight involving Commission call-up was somewhat new. In this particular case, it appeared the property had not been lawfully used for the B-3 uses staff had looked for, although there was evidence that people were doing something on the property more or less continuously, but without permits, site plan approval, or licenses. Ms. Motley advised that there had been licenses issued to tenants from June, 1991 until October, 1998. After that, another tenant had a City license. Mayor Naugle believed the last license issued might have been issued in error because there had been no inspection, etc. He stated that no one was permitted to run storage yards on vacant, dirt lots. Ms. Motley said it had only been when Mr. Frymeyer had sought a license that he had been told the use could not be continued. She believed the use dated back to 1991, long before the zoning had been changed. Ms. Motley said it was incorrect to indicate that occupational licenses had not been issued for this property because there had been licenses issued as late as 1998.   Minutes of a Regular Meeting  6/6/00 - 28  Commissioner Moore pointed out that even if there had been an occupational license in 1998, that was two years ago. Commissioner Katz agreed with Commissioner Moore and Mayor Naugle, but she thought the Commission was on a ""slippery slope,"" and the question was whether the use had been abandoned. She noted that there was documentation about the payment of water bills, etc., and that was the issue before the Commission. Commissioner Katz stated that even if they did not want this use, she did not think this process could be utilized to terminate the use. It was her understanding that the question was whether or not the use had been ongoing, and there was documentation indicating that it had been. The City Attorney pointed out that staff had submitted a report about the history of the property and, as of the time the report had been prepared, staff had found nothing indicating the use had been discontinued for 180 days. He wondered if staff had any additional comments or information because that would form the basis of the Commission's decision this evening. Ms. Cecelia Hollar, Director of Construction Services, said it appeared from the information provided that there were numerous Code violations on the site. However, that did not invalidate the evidence that there had been a continuing use of the property. She acknowledged that there might be items on the property placed there without permits, and the owner would have to obtain after-the-fact permits or remove anything necessary. The City Attorney stated that one normally considered use of a property as requiring an occupational license for business use but, as to non-conforming uses, the Code merely required that the use had been continued and not voluntarily abandoned, with or without an occupational license. He explained that was really nothing more than a revenue-generating measure rather than a regulatory measure. The City Attorney advised that was one trigger for a review, and lack of a license has often triggered a presumption. However, it appeared that presumption had been rebutted with the submittal of documentation indicating the use had continued unabated but for brief periods of up to a month. He felt the existing record supported staff's recommendation. Commissioner Smith was concerned because it appeared the City Attorney agreed the owner had a right to continue the use despite other violations. He agreed there were much better uses for property along the New River, but it did not seem prudent for the Commission to deny this use. Commissioner Smith was hopeful there was some other avenue that could be pursued to address this property. Commissioner Moore believed City staff had done what they were supposed to do. He had called staff when he had noticed earth being moved on the site, and he had learned then that no permits had been requested or issued. Now, although there was no occupational license, they had water, despite the fact that there was no building on the site. Ms. Motley advised the building was to the south. Commissioner Moore noted that there was a lot of vacant property. Ms. Motley stated that there had been no building under construction. She acknowledged there might have been some dirt being moved, but no work had been done without permits. Commissioner Moore believed that if a property was going to be used for storage, there were certain requirements, including paving, drainage, landscaping, etc. Ms. Motley stated that the owner would comply with the Code. However, the issue before the Commission tonight was the nonconforming use, and documentation had been submitted indicating that the use had never stopped except for very short periods as allowed by the Code.   Minutes of a Regular Meeting  6/6/00 - 29  Mayor Naugle suggested this item be deferred for 60 days to give the owner time to submit a site plan with the proper drainage, landscaping, and buffering of the River. Commissioner Moore thought that was probably a good idea. He also wanted the City Attorney's Office to review the matter further and meet with him and the area civic association. Commissioner Hutchinson understood the only issue before the Commission tonight was whether or not the use had been discontinued for more than 180 days. The City Attorney advised that was essentially correct, and any Code compliance issues would be addressed independently regardless of the Commission's action tonight. He believed, however, there was something of a gap between what at least two Commissioners had observed and what staff's investigation had revealed. The City Attorney understood Mayor Naugle and Commissioner Moore wanted to defer the matter to give his staff more time to examine the issue even more thoroughly. He suggested this public hearing be recessed. Ms. Motley noted there had been discussion about the owner seeking permits and moving forward with a site plan. She stated there would be no point in that if this item was deferred. She thought the ultimate purpose of the Commission was to see the site cleaned up, but she did not feel the owner could move forward without knowing the outcome of this issue. Commissioner Moore believed Code enforcement staff could address any violations in the meantime. Commissioner Smith was concerned that nothing would be done. He wanted some assurances that violations would be addressed. Mr. Robert Ciano, property owner, stated that he would have the soil removed immediately and have the tanks removed by the weekend. He explained that there had been 4 abandoned trailer containers and 150 tires on the property when he had purchased it, and he had recently cleaned and cleared the property because there had been some criminal activities. He had also removed a tree that had been cut in half by lightning. Mr. Ciano advised that the dirt was topsoil, but it could be removed. Mayor Naugle asked where the dirt had come from, and Mr. Ciano replied that a friend had brought it to the site from some construction work he had done. Mayor Naugle pointed out that the dirt was being stored on the banks of the River, and the City had no way of knowing if it was contaminated or not. He stated that this could be toxic fill, and these were environmentally sensitive lands. Mr. Ciano said he would have it removed immediately, and he was willing to do whatever was necessary. Ms. Motley clarified that the property would be cleaned up, but she did not want anyone to think that permits for drainage or anything else would be sought until the Commission had addressed this item. Motion made by Commissioner Smith and seconded by Commissioner Moore to recess this public hearing until 6:00 P.M. on July 6, 2000. Roll call showed: YEAS: Commissioners Smith, Moore, Hutchinson, Katz, and Mayor Naugle. NAYS: none. Appeal Historic Preservation Board's Denial of a Certificate of Appropriateness  The Salvation .................................................... (PH-4A) Army, Inc. (HPB Case No. 4-H-00) A public hearing was scheduled to consider an appeal of the Historic Preservation Board's decision on March 13, 2000 to deny a Certificate of Appropriateness for a proposed community worship and service center.   Minutes of a Regular Meeting  6/6/00 - 30  Applicant: Request: Location:  The Salvation Army, Inc. Certificate of Appropriateness for new construction of community workshop and service center facility 843 Southwest 2nd Street  Mayor Naugle stated that this was an appeal of the Historical Preservation Board's denial of an application for a Certificate of Appropriateness for new construction. It was also an application for a rezoning, which included approval of a site plan. Mayor Naugle stated that the rezoning required allocation of flexibility based on the approved site plan, so if the appeal was denied, the rezoning request would be withdrawn. Mayor Naugle advised that the appeal involved a two-part process. The City Commission would first review the record. Based on that review, the Commission would then determine if there had been a departure from the essential requirements of law or that there had not been competent, substantial evidence to support the decision. If neither criteria was found, the Commission would consider a motion to uphold the decision of the Historic Preservation Board. If such a motion was approved, the matter would be concluded. If not, the new hearing could begin immediately or a resolution adopted setting a date for a new hearing within 60 days. Mayor Naugle called for those who wished to be heard. The following appeared: Mr. Mike Ciesielski, Planner II, displayed a map showing the subject site within the Sailboat Bend Historic District. He advised that the ULDR required that any alterations, new construction, demolition or relocation of buildings in the historic district obtain a Certificate of Appropriateness from the Historic Preservation Board. Mr. Ciesielski stated that the Board had unanimously denied this Certificate for construction of a 46,500-square foot community and worship center. Mr. Ciesielski said that among the reasons cited for the denial of the application, the Board cited visual incompatibility of the proposed buildings with other buildings in this historic district; and, that the contemporary design did not promote a sense of the past. The Board had based its decision on the applicant's site plan, elevations, floor plans, landscape plans, and application, as well as the presentation made on March 13, 2000. Mr. Mark Ritchie, Consultant representing the applicant, stated that when the applicant submitted a completed application for Historic Preservation Board review, a checklist was provided. The checklist involved various features including exterior covering, windows, walls, fence, roof features, etc., and a number of options was provided for each of these features. He advised that only one item had not been chosen from the listed options, so it appeared only that item required Board approval. Mr. Ritchie stated that the Board had not addressed the guidelines contained in the Code at all. He felt the relevant Sections of the ULDR did not give that Board the authority to ignore the written guidelines and substitute their own assessment. He thought that since that was the case, the decision could not have been based on competent and substantial evidence. Mr. Ritchie said that the Board had felt the project was not compatible with surrounding properties, but he felt that was an incorrect or incomplete assessment in that the proposed development had not been assessed in its actual context.   Minutes of a Regular Meeting  6/6/00 - 31  Mr. Ritchie explained that given the structures in the immediate proximity, he felt the new church facility could only be an improvement in terms of visual compatibility. He did not think the creation of the Sailboat Bend design guidelines had been intended to require mindless replication of existing structures. Mr. Ritchie believed the guidelines had been intended to allow for innovation in design while incorporating the features required by law. At 8:23 P.M., Commissioner Moore left the meeting. He returned at 8:25 P.M. Mr. Oscar Vagi, Architect representing the applicant, displayed some elevations and said that respect for surroundings did not mean bland imitation or design compromises. He felt the design of the community center fulfilled the goals of the historic preservation district and was neighborhood-friendly. Mr. Vagi advised that the project included a chapel, a fellowship hall used for meetings and banquets, a gymnasium, game and exercise facilities, classrooms, a library, a nursery, and an administrative area. He noted that the chapel would establish a gateway to the downtown area and to the neighborhood, extending a gesture of welcome. Mr. Vagi pointed out that the large gymnasium had been placed along Broward Boulevard, away from residential streets, to enhance the urban significance of the building. He stated that although the Code allowed construction to the property line, the building would be set back from the roadway more than 44' and moved the chapel forward so it would be clearly visible from all directions. The rest of the building facing 9th Avenue was only 15' tall, and landscaping would be provided to address community goals. Mr. Vagi stated that a large oak tree and a huge banyan tree would be preserved, and a large portion of the parking area would not be paved. He advised that the existing chapel would be renovated and become the fellowship hall, and the existing two-story building would be removed. Mr. Vagi reported that finish materials would be used as established by the historic district design guidelines, and he believed this project could induce further development on Broward Boulevard. Commissioner Smith referred to photographs submitted by the applicant. Mr. Chuck Ritchie, representing the applicant, agreed they were photographs of the existing buildings and surrounding buildings. The Commission wanted to see some elevations of the proposed buildings. The City Attorney explained that the photographs had not been presented to the Historic Preservation Board, so they were not part of the record. However, the Commission's first task was to determine if there had been competent, substantial evidence to support the decision made by the Board based on the record and if the criteria in the Code had been applied properly. At this time, he did not think it was appropriate to supplement the existing record with additional items. Mayor Naugle asked if the City Commission could request that the applicant make another presentation to the Historic Preservation Board in order to obtain its support. The City Attorney replied it would be appropriate to submit a supplemental application to the Board.   Minutes of a Regular Meeting  6/6/00 - 32  Mr. Ken Lyuk, Broward Captain for the Salvation Army, stated that the Salvation Army had endeavored to be a good neighbor and work with the neighborhood association. He believed there had been some positive results, including vacation of the alley and demolition of some of the old buildings. Mr. Lyuk believed every effort had been made to clarify the use of the property, and there seemed to be no problem in that respect. He stated that certain adjustments had been made in response to comments from the Historic Preservation Board, although it appeared hearing about those adjustments would not be appropriate at this time. Mr. Lyuk noted that the larger aspects of the building had been moved to the front of the premises, away from residential areas. Existing mature trees would be maintained and new trees added, so it would be difficult to even see the building from the neighborhood. He advised that there had been very little opposition to the design from the neighborhood, and he believed the Salvation Army had done everything possible in that respect and acted in good faith. Mr. Lyuk believed it would be appropriate for the Commission to make a decision this evening based on the record. Mr. (Chuck) Ritchie stated that a presentation could be provided this evening if the Commission desired. Mayor Naugle advised that this first step was to focus only on the existing record. Commissioner Katz asked Mr. Ritchie if he could go back to the Historic Preservation Board with his supplemental materials. Mr. Ritchie understood the Commission would retain the ultimate jurisdiction and agreed he could make such a presentation to the Board. The City Attorney stated that if Board could reach a different matter would not come back to the matter could be returned to could be supplemented. If the the City Commission. the record was supplemented, it was entirely possible that the decision. If a Certificate of Appropriateness were issued, the the Commission at all. At this point, the City Attorney explained the Board with the applicant's agreement so the existing record Certificate was still denied, the applicant could again appeal to  Mr. Ritchie said that the matter could be taken back to the Board, but he did not believe there would ever be a plan everyone in the neighborhood and on the Board would support. He said that substantial changes to the plan had been made after listening to comments from the neighborhood, but he did not think it would ever satisfy everyone. Commissioner Katz understood the Board had not seen those changes, and Mr. Ritchie agreed that was correct. The applicant was willing to go back to the Board to see if the new information might result in a different decision, although he was concerned about the criteria the Board would utilize. Commissioner Hutchinson wondered how long this would be tied up in the process. She was under the impression the applicant did not want to be delayed for another four months. Mr. Ciesielski advised that the Board would be meeting on July 10, 2000. Mayor Naugle noted the Commission could schedule it for July 18, 2000, if necessary. Commissioner Hutchinson understood the question before the Commission was whether or not the Board had deviated from the established criteria in rendering its decision. The City Attorney agreed that was one question and another would be whether or not there had been substantial evidence to support its decision. The applicant had some additional information, but the Board had not considered that information. Therefore, to allow the applicant to supplement the record with this information and modifications to the original plan would be expanding the record. He felt it should go back to the Board and, if it came back to the Commission again, it would be with the benefit of this additional information and evidence.   Minutes of a Regular Meeting  6/6/00 - 33  Motion made by Commissioner Smith and seconded by Commissioner Moore to return this matter to the Historic Preservation Board. Roll call showed: YEAS: Commissioners Smith, Moore, Hutchinson, Katz, and Mayor Naugle. NAYS: none. Rezone RMM-25 to CB  The Salvation Army, Inc. ................................................... (PH-4B) (PZ Case No. 32-ZR-99) This item was not presented due to the action taken by the City Commission under Item PH-4A. At 8:53 P.M., the meeting was recessed. It was reconvened at 9:03 P.M. Application of ULDR Section 47-26.A.1  L'Ambiance Beach Ltd. (PZ Case No. 67-R-99) ......................................................... (PH-5A) At the March 15, 2000 regular meeting of the Planning & Zoning Board, it was recommended by a vote of 5 to 2 that the following application be approved. Notice of the public hearing was published on May 25 and June 1, 2000. Applicant: Request: Location: L'Ambiance Beach Ltd. Application of ULDR Section 47-26.A 4240 Galt Ocean Drive  Mayor Naugle said this matter involved two different items, both related to the construction of a condominium project. The first was a request for application of prior zoning regulations, and the second was an application for modification of yards and conditional use. Since both applications involved a single site plan, Mayor Naugle advised the City Commission would hear testimony applicable to both requests. He explained that at the conclusion of the public hearing, there would be two votes. The first would involve an ordinance approving the application of the prior zoning regulation, and that approval would be subject to approval of yard modifications and conditional use. He explained the City Commission would then consider a resolution approving yard modifications and conditional use. If the first application, however, was denied, there would be no basis on which to vote, and the second item would be withdrawn. Mayor Naugle called for those who wished to be heard. Having affirmed to speak only the truth by virtue of an oath administered by the City Clerk, the following appeared: Ms. Courtney Callahan, Attorney representing the applicant, stated that unit luxury condominium project on Galt Ocean Mile. She advised the pipeline"" for a couple of years and had been hotly contested. She agreement had been reached with the two immediate neighbors  Galt Condominium. L'Ambiance was a 143project had been ""in the reported, however, that Towers and the Galleon  Ms. Callahan stated that a site plan application was before the Commission containing a request for a yard modification pertaining to setbacks and a conditional use related to height. She advised that the criteria contained in the Code required that a site plan prove to the Commission that it was superior in terms of neighborhood compatibility and adequacy. Ms. Callahan believed the site plan would be shown to be superior, and she pointed out that the DRC and the Planning & Zoning Board supported the application, the latter by a vote of 5 to 2.   Minutes of a Regular Meeting  6/6/00 - 34  Ms. Callahan said she was extremely comfortable that the site plan was neighborhood-friendly. She pointed out that Galt Ocean Mile was a strip of high-rise, high density, residential units located on the beach. It was unique in that it was the highest density on the beach and easily distinguished from any other area of the beach. She advised there were about 19 condominium buildings on the Galt Ocean Mile, ranging in height from 15 to 32 stories, oriented east to west. Ms. Callahan noted that the average east/west dimension was 226'. Ms. Callahan advised that the L'Ambiance site was located in the middle of the Galt Ocean Mile between Galt Towers and the Galleon. The site was approximately 200' x 575', and compatibility had been the standard the design sought to achieve. She referred to the neighbor to the north, Galt Towers. Ms. Callahan said it was a 17-story condominium building containing 260 residential units. The Galleon to the south was 19 stories, and the design team had attempt to not just be compatible with the neighboring buildings but superior. Ms. Callahan said that the design involved an extremely small footprint, and to place a recreation area above the garage at a height of only 11' above grade. She explained that the garage had been placed underground, and a lushly landscaped pool area with few obstructions was proposed. Ms. Callahan stated that the building had been oriented as far west as possible on the Galt Ocean Mile, which had a 100' platted setback. The building footprint was 130' x 160', with the pool deck to the east. Ms. Callahan felt the designers had done an excellent job of providing a very attractive, open vista for the building residents and their neighbors. Ms. Callahan stated that this would be one of the smallest buildings in terms of the number of units on the Galt. She advised that density per acre had been considered, and this building was at the low end with 53 units per acre where 60 units per acre were allowed. Ms. Callahan noted that the prior Code had apparently allowed a higher density. Ms. Callahan believed a main component in terms of compatibility involved parking and garages. She stated that the garages on the Galt generally ran from property line to property line, and there was frequently surface parking on top of the garages. She displayed photographs of the adjoining properties, as well as this project's contrasting lush landscape plan with a suppressed parking garage of 306 spaces. Overall, she believed this was an extremely attractive site plan, but another thing that was incredibly important to the neighbors was the preservation of views. Ms. Callahan presented slides showing existing views from nearby buildings and the view that would result upon construction of this building. Ms. Callahan stated that another approach to the design had been taken through consideration of a traditional ""as a right"" Code building of 12 stories. She advised that produced an undesirable result for the neighbors, and she believed a better site plan had been achieved. Mayor Naugle asked if the building was seaward of the coastal construction line. Ms. Callahan believed part of the tower was seaward of the coastal construction line. Mr. Charles Sieger, Architect representing the developer, advised that this building had been under design for the past two years. He displayed the building footprint and explained that a view corridor had been created taking into consideration the buildings to the north and to the south. Mr. Sieger explained this building would be withdrawn with only a slight portion extending into the existing view corridor, so existing views would be unobstructed. At 9:17 P.M., Commissioner Smith left the meeting. He returned at 9:20 P.M.   Minutes of a Regular Meeting  6/6/00 - 35 because six valet having a ed with a  Mr. Sieger explained the 200' maximum length of the garage needed to be exceeded the garage had been suppressed so the cars would be covered with the exception of spaces in the front. He stated that the garage would be longer and flatter rather than five- or six-story garage obstructing views. Mr. Sieger noted that the garage was cover pool and landscaping as mentioned earlier by Ms. Callahan.  Mr. Sieger advised that a series of step backs at the rooflines had been provided in the portion of the building that was taller than the adjoining buildings. He explained that a magnificent rotunda with a fountain had been designed for the front yard with lush landscaping and located a considerable distance from the street. Mr. Sieger said the intent of the request was to construct a building that would be the best neighbor possible. He thought it was clear that effort had been successful since agreement had been reached with the adjacent neighbors. Ms. Michele Mellgren, Urban Planner representing the developer, described her background and experience. She discussed neighborhood compatibility and stated that this project was compatible in terms of the Code. Ms. Mellgren said she had been asked to examine this project to determine if it would be compatible with the surrounding area, and she had taken a comprehensive approach to ensure it would mesh with the overall neighborhood, the promenade, and to the immediate neighbors. Ms. Mellgren stated that when professional planners examined neighborhood compatibility, they did not examine Code compliance or intangibles such as nearby rights-of-way. She understood that one of the issues was whether or not the developer could take advantage of a Code provision that allowed a setback reduction. However, when that issue was considered, compatibility had to be assessed in terms of neighboring properties as opposed to the property line itself. Ms. Mellgren said she had found that this development would be compatible with neighborhood. She pointed out that the neighborhood was high-rise, residential nature. character was older and newer in terms of urban design with few distinguishing features limited pedestrian character landscaping by today's standards on the older properties. Mellgren advised the newer buildings had a pedestrian scale and orientation with submer parking so landscaping and features could be provided. the Its and Ms. ged  Ms. Mellgren stated that with the extensive landscaping and features proposed, this building would be an asset to the area. Therefore, she found that it was clearly compatible with the fabric of the Galt Ocean Mile. She noted that the public promenade was an important feature of the area, and she felt this project would provide a seamless connection. In addition, in terms of the immediate neighbors, she had found that the building-to-building separation fell within the existing range of the area. Ms. Mellgren summarized that this project met all the neighborhood compatibility criteria from an urban planning standpoint. Mr. Don Hall, Attorney representing applicant, referred to the request for application of a prior zoning regulation. He stated that prior to the adoption of the ULDR, there had been no length or width restriction on buildings in this zoning district or any other. W ith the adoption of the ULDR, a confusing provision had been added indicating that a multi-family residential structure could not exceed 200' in length. Mr. Hall's interpretation of that Section led him to believe that application of the prior zoning regulation was not necessary.   Minutes of a Regular Meeting  6/6/00 - 36  Mr. Hall explained that the parking garage was an accessory use prior to adoption of the ULDR and was an accessory structure today under the ULDR. The parking garage itself was not a multi-family residential structure, and that was the term used by the Code, so it was not regulated under this Section. Nevertheless, an application had been submitted, and staff agreed with the applicant that the five criteria had been met. Mr. Hall stated that staff's report did a very good job of dealing with this on pages 2 and 3. Mr. Hall said that there were five criteria, and consistent with the goals, objectives and policies that staff had found that Objective 19 was met in that was compatible with the neighborhood densit met Objective 22, which called for encouraging Objective 26 relating to coastal zone protection, effect on evacuation times or shelter because density. the first was whether or not a project was of the City's Comprehensive Plan. He noted that this project would provide a development y and the City's plans for revitalization. It also quality development. Mr. Hall stated it met and staff had found that there would be no this project would be well below permitted  Mr. Hall advised that staff had found that subject to certain conditions, the second criteria relating to water, sewer, etc., was met by the project. The third criteria related to neighborhood compatibility, and he believed Ms. Mellgren's comments amplified staff's finding that the project was compatible with the neighborhood. He noted that the position of the building had been selected in order to preserve views and enhance the site, and the building itself was 130' x 160' so it was well within the 200' limitation contained in the ULDR. Mr. Hall explained only the parking garage exceeded that limitation, but it was not a multi-family residential structure, and it was suppressed with only 11' above grade. He also pointed out that it had been designed not to impede with views from neighboring properties. Mr. Hall stated that one of staff's recommendations was that the northern setback be increased from 10' to 15', and the applicant had agreed to that condition. Therefore, unlike other parking garages on the Galt and unlike the immediate neighbors, this parking garage would not be on the property line. He advised that the fourth and fifth criteria required demonstration that restricting use of the property by applying the new zoning regulation resulted in a burden on the applicant that should not be imposed. In this case, imposing the 200' length was antithetical to good planning. He pointed out that building the garage with that limitation would result in a fivestory garage. Mr. Hall advised that the original plan for the building had involved 160 units and a 3-story parking garage. The neighbors had found that unacceptable, so the project had been scaled back to 143 units and a parking garage only 11' above grade. He believed the request involved the minimum relief necessary, and the relief itself protected the public good. Mr. Hall believed the project met all the criteria and was entitled to application of the prior zoning regulation. Ms. Pat Hale, Alliance of Northeast Homeowners' Associations, stated that residents of the Galt did not support the requested variances to the Code. She thought the Commission should follow through with the regulations it adopted. Ms. Hale believed developers would save time and money if they knew the City would stand by its regulations. She thought the process would be shortened, and the Commission would not have to have these types of hearings.   Minutes of a Regular Meeting  6/6/00 - 37  Ms. Hale said she had been surprised to hear that the two neighboring condominiums now supported the project, and she wondered about the reason. She did not believe this building would be compatible with the neighborhood on this ""pea sized"" lot. Ms. Hale characterized the building as a ""monster,"" and she believed a denial of this application would prevent such future applications. Mr. Michael Astor, a resident of the Galt Ocean Mile, stated that there were over 10,000 residents on the Galt, and this was very important to all of them. He felt the pictures presented were beautiful, and the applicant's representatives had discussed a lot of nice things, but he believed a few things had been omitted. Mr. Astor said that all the lots on the Galt had originally been 200' wide, and every building on a 200' lot was less than 20 stories. He advised that the only buildings over 20 stories were on 400' double lots. Mr. Astor said this was a tiny lot, and he felt there were already too many people living on the Galt. He stated there were tremendous traffic problems, and he was concerned about what might happen if there was a hurricane. Mr. Astor understood the setback was supposed to be half the height of the building, which was 290'. Therefore, a 145' setback was required on each side, but a setback of only 10' was proposed. He felt this would be a monstrosity on a tiny lot that would be longer, wider and taller than was allowed. If the Commission allowed this, Mr. Astor did not understand why a Zoning Code even existed. He believed the citizens had made it clear that they did not want these big developments. Mr. Bob Rozema, President of the Galt Mile Community Association, distributed copies of a newsletter sent out some time ago indicating that the Association had voted on this project at least three times. Each of those votes had been in unanimous opposition to the width and height of the proposed building. He said he had read the Code Section related to yard modifications, and continuity of urban scale with adjacent properties was required, including height and relationship of building size to lot size. Mr. Rozema pointed out that the adjacent building was 170' tall and 80' wide, and the Galleon was 120' wide at its widest. He did not feel this project would be compatible. Commissioner Smith noted that what the developer had the absolute right to build under the Code would be a long rectangular box up to 12 stories. He hoped everything had taken that into consideration. Commissioner Smith believed that would definitely block views and be incompatible with the neighborhood. Mr. Rozema said he would have supported a 20-story building with 25' setbacks. Mr. Emilio DeFilippo, representing the Plaza South Association, was opposed to this project. He noted that there had been more than 200 residents at the Planning & Zoning Board meeting when this project had been discussed, and more than 125 residents of Plaza South had signed a petition against this project. Mr. DeFilippo stated that the Association was not opposed to redevelopment, but it was opposed to variations from established Code requirements. He also reminded the Commission that this had been a highly contested project. Mr. Emerson Allsworth, representing the owners of the property in question, stated that the old hotel on the site would be demolished no matter what action the Commission took tonight. He thought that people might be overlooking the potential highest and best use of this property. Mr. Allsworth explained that if this project was defeated and his client retained ownership, he would proceed with the highest and best use of the property, which was a hotel with restaurant, bar, banquet facilities, etc. He hoped this project would be approved because his client did not believe he could move forward on any project better than the proposal under consideration.   Minutes of a Regular Meeting  6/6/00 - 38  Mr. Jon Sutz, a resident of Galt Towers, supported this development. He believed it would preserve the views of the ocean, the sun on the pool deck, and the property values. Mr. Sutz said that as long as the building was thin and narrow and pushed toward the street, he would support it. He pointed out that a long building stretching to the beach would obstruct views and sunlight at the Galt Towers. It was his understanding that the front of this building would be about the same distance from the street as the two adjoining buildings, and there would be a strip of views obstructed as a result, but the majority of the panoramic views would be preserved. He believed views of the ocean were the most important consideration when someone was going to purchase a beachfront condominium. Mr. Astor noted that a 12-story building would be allowed, but he was sure no one would ever construct such a building because it would not be economically feasible. Mr. Vinni Pershani, member of the Galleon Condominium Board of Directors, stated that there had been very discussions on this issue, and there had been a meeting today at which the Association agreed to support the original proposal even though there was little difference in the plan now and what had been denied two years ago. He did not know what had happened today to change the Association's position. Mr. Chris Remmett, 65 Castle Harbor, felt this building would loom large over the Bermuda Riviera neighborhood. He thought it seemed ridiculous to put rules in place only to make exceptions later. Mr. Remmett did not see why area residents should subsidize the property owner getting a great price for the property by sacrificing their views and lifestyle. Ms. Julia Jones, a resident of Sailboat Bend, said she was an 80-year resident of Fort Lauderdale, and she was sick and tired of high-rise buildings that stretched all the way from Port Everglades to Deerfield Beach. Motion made by Commissioner Moore and seconded by Commissioner Smith that the public hearing be closed. Roll call showed: YEAS: Commissioners Smith, Moore, Hutchinson, Katz, and Mayor Naugle. NAYS: none. Mr. Hall pointed out that the applicant was not seeking any variances this evening. Rather, the applicant was asking the City Commission to apply criteria contained in the Code. He noted that the height permitted in this district was 300', and 10' setbacks were required on the sides if certain criteria were met. Mr. Hall noted that staff's report indicated that this project met the adequacy criteria, and this building represented a very sensitive planning approach to a parcel of property that took into consideration design criteria and impact on the surrounding neighborhood. Mr. Hall believed this was the most pleasing development proposal for this parcel that would ever be presented. He noted that some of the speakers had wondered why the City would have a zoning Code if exceptions were going to be made, but the Code itself contained the criteria, and this project met that criteria. Commissioner Katz asked if balconies were provided on the north side of the building. Mr. Hall replied that there were bay windows on the north side. Mr. Charles Sieger, Architect, advised that the bay windows extended 3' as allowed by the Code.   Minutes of a Regular Meeting  6/6/00 - 39  Mayor Naugle asked the applicant's representatives to address the agreement reached with the adjoining Condominium Associations. Mr. Hall advised that the agreement had specified the design criteria, which were as presented in the site plan with the exception that the setback on the north would be 15' rather than 10' as suggested by staff. The agreement also contained certain best management practices during the construction, as well as acceptance of liability for any damage caused to neighboring properties during the process. Mayor Naugle asked if there had been any compensation involved in the agreement. Mr. Hall replied there had been compensation, but he was not free to discuss it in detail as a representative of only one party to the agreement. He stated that if the other two parties were willing to disclose additional information, however, he would have no objection. Commissioner Hutchinson was concerned because up until this morning both of the adjoining properties had opposed this project. She was surprised agreement had been reached so suddenly, and she wondered if monetary compensation had been the deciding factor. Mr. Jim Brady, Attorney representing the Galt Towers and the Galleon Condominiums, advised that he had not reviewed the agreement and only took his direction from the Associations' Board of Directors. He had been instructed not to oppose this application this evening. Mr. Ed Harmon, President of the Galleon Condominium, stated that there had been a hectic two years of fighting and, despite reservations, everyone was tired of the fight and ready to accept the inevitable. Ms. Dorothy Bloom, resident of the Galt Towers, stated that there had been a couple of busloads of residents prepared to appear this evening. However, late this afternoon they had learned that the Board of Directors had made a deal. Ms. Bloom stated that the large majority of the residents were opposed to this deal because they wanted to preserve space between the buildings on the Galt Ocean Mile. Commissioner Smith wondered why the other residents had not appeared tonight, and Ms. Bloom replied they had been told this was a ""done deal"" and they would be wasting their time. There had also been concerns about the cost of pursuing this fight. Commissioner Smith was disappointed that anyone would think anything coming before the Commission was a ""done deal."" If the money was more important to residents, he would not object, but he wanted free input from the public. Commissioner Katz thought this would be a beautiful project, and it appeared the developer had tried to consider the neighborhood by pushing the building as far west on the site as possible. She had heard from people who supported the project and from those who objected, so the issue was not entirely one-sided. Commissioner Katz had been hopeful that agreement would be reached, although not through monetary compensation. Commissioner Katz said her concern was neighborhood compatibility, and she felt that would require greater setbacks from the property line. She wondered if the applicant would consent to reduce the height and provide 25' setbacks from the property line. In that case, she believed everyone would feel better about the project. Before proceeding further, each member of the City Commission disclosed that they had received many communications from area residents and members of the development team with respect to this project.   Minutes of a Regular Meeting  6/6/00 - 40  Mr. Hall advised that the applicant could eliminate one story and add an additional 2' to the setback on the north side, for a total setback on that side of 17'. He noted that would cost the applicant about $5 million, but the northern setback could not be increased beyond 17'. Mr. Sieger explained there were some peripheral Code issues that impacted the plan, including Americans with Disability Act and Fair Housing Code requirements. He stated that these requirements affected the sizes of the rooms, and to reduce setbacks further would make the apartments not marketable by today's standards. Mayor Naugle noted that the larger buildings on the Galt Ocean Mile were on larger lots. He felt a building that would be compatible with the neighborhood would be a lower structure. Mayor Naugle also felt the charts about density were a little misleading because these units were much larger than the typical units. He understood people wanted big apartments, but this made the building much larger, so measuring just the number of units did not reflect the bulk of the building. Mayor Naugle also pointed out that prior to the 1995 ""Hanbury amendments"" to the Code, the density allowed had been 40 units per acre. He thought an 18- or 20-story building would be more appropriate on this property. Commissioner Smith believed everyone agreed the old building should be demolished and a residential use provided. However, this project appeared to be ""pushing it to the limit."" His primary concern was the side yard setback, and he felt a minimum reasonable setback would be 20'. Commissioner Smith also hoped everyone understood that no variance was being requested in this case. He favored redevelopment on this parcel, but he did not think buildings should be only 20' apart. Commissioner Katz believed the concerns were air, light and scale. This lot was only 200', and she felt placing something 10' or 15' from the property line at this height was simply too massive. Commissioner Katz did not want to see someone come along and build a hotel, but the size of the lot had to be considered. Commissioner Hutchinson was uncomfortable with the size of the building and the lot. However, she did like certain aspects of the project, such as the submerged parking. Nevertheless, she felt the building was too large for the lot. Commissioner Smith wondered if the developer had any new thoughts. Mayor Naugle believed that even if there were some new thoughts, they could not be adopted this evening. Commissioner Smith believed this item could be deferred for staff and Planning & Zoning Board review. Mayor Naugle pointed out that if this request was denied another plan could be submitted to the City, so there was no need for deferral. Mr. Taft Bradshaw, Landscape Planner representing the applicant, agreed the Galt Ocean Mile was a wonderful community, and the beautiful landscaped deck above the garage would enhance views. In addition, he felt how setbacks were treated was more important than the width of the setback itself. Mr. Sieger believed the building width could be narrowed by 2', and 3' could be added to the south. That would accommodate a 20' setback on both sides of the building. He noted that Mr. Hall had already indicated that the building height could be reduced by one story.   Minutes of a Regular Meeting Commissioner Smith introduced the following ordinance on first reading: ORDINANCE NO. C-00-  6/6/00 - 41  AN ORDINANCE APPROVING THE APPLICATION OF A PRIOR ZONING REGULATION TO PERMIT PROPERTY DESCRIBED AS LOT 22, BLOCK 34, OF ""GALT OCEAN MILE ADDITION NO. 2"", ACCORDING TO THE PLAT THEREOF, RECORDED IN PLAT BOOK 58, PAGE 24, OF THE PUBLIC RECORDS OF BROW ARD COUNTY, FLORIDA, LOCATED ON THE EAST SIDE OF GALT OCEAN DRIVE, NORTH OF NORTHEAST 41ST STREET AND SOUTH OF THE INTERSECTION OF GALT OCEAN DRIVE AND STATE ROAD A-1-A, W HICH PROPERTY IS ZONED RMH-60 TO BE USED FOR A MULTIPLE FAMILY STRUCTURE THAT EXCEEDS THE 200 FOOT LENGTH LIMITATION, PURSUANT TO SECTION 47-26.A.1.

Ms. Alysan Childs, President of the Central Beach Alliance, stated that the zoning in progress list was still under consideration, and there were some concerns about the 200' building limitation. Commissioner Katz inquired about the development of the Birch Las Olas parking lot. She understood no one would be able to develop it with the 200' limitation. Commissioner Smith believed there could be an exception granted in the PRD and ABA districts that would address that issue. Mr. Chris W ren, Manager of Community and Comprehensive Planning, agreed that was correct. He noted it could only be requested in the east/west direction in the ABA district. Commissioner Smith understood this would be a zoning in progress issue until a final decision was made by the Commission.   Minutes of a Regular Meeting  6/6/00 - 42  Mayor Naugle felt comfortable moving forward with the 200' limitation now, but he would be satisfied now with zoning in progress until a final decision was made at a later date. Motion made by Commissioner Moore and seconded by Commissioner Smith to implement zoning in progress requiring a 200 foot maximum width and length of structures in PRD and ABA with the right to modify pursuant to Site Plan Level IV review, only permitting a modification of the east/west direction in the ABA zoning district. Roll call showed: YEAS: Commissioners Smith, Moore, Hutchinson, Katz, and Mayor Naugle. NAYS: none. Commissioner Moore introduced the following ordinance on second reading: ORDINANCE NO.

Amendment to Chapter 2  Lobbying Activities/Registration ..................................................................................... (O-2) An ordinance was presented creating a new Article VIII of Chapter 2, ""Administration,"" of the City's Code of Ordinances entitled ""Lobbying Activities,"" to define lobbyists and lobbying activities; to require registration of and statements by lobbyists; and, to prohibit lobbying by certain prior City officials and employees for a period of time after leaving the City. Ordinance No. C-00-27 was published on May 6, 2000 and was passed on first reading at the Regular Meeting of May 16, 2000 by a vote of 5 to 0.   Minutes of a Regular Meeting  6/6/00 - 43  Commissioner Hutchinson had some concerns about Level 3 employees. She was not sure why the Commission had decided to include them, and she was not sure how staff would deal with the ordinance. The City Attorney stated that it was the lobbyists' responsibility to register and file the necessary forms. Commissioner Hutchinson wondered how the ordinance could be enforced. The City Attorney believed there would be voluntary compliance for the most part and, as a practical matter, staff would let people they dealt with know they had to comply with this ordinance. He stated that copies of the ordinance would be made available to those who were likely lobbyists. However, if there were blatant violations, they would likely be noticed and the ordinance enforced as necessary. Commissioner Hutchinson asked if a Level 3 employee was considered a decision-maker who the Commission would want to restrict if they left City employment. The City Manager stated that Level 3 employees could have the opportunity or ability to influence decision-makers or advisory bodies. Commissioner Katz wondered if including Level 3 employees was going too far. She had also received a letter from Attorney Bill Leonard, and there were some questions that had not been addressed. For example, she wondered if an attorney had to sign up to bring each item to the City Commission or if he could register once a year. The City Attorney had not received Mr. Leonard's letter, but the requirement for registration was keyed to the principal being represented. Thus, if there was an ongoing relationship with a certain hotel owner, and an attorney appeared before the Commission throughout the year on various items related to the hotels owned by that individual, the attorney would only have to register one time. If the attorney were representing someone else, he would have to register again. He explained the idea was to know who was being represented when elected or appointed officials were contacted. Mayor Naugle thought it would be easy to keep track of these things because attorneys billed for their hours and kept detailed records. Commissioner Katz wondered about an attorney inquiring about a potential project to determine if a project might be feasible. Commissioner Smith believed inquiries were different from lobbying efforts. Mayor Naugle pointed out that people could obtain opinions from professionals if they just wanted to determine if a particular project would be feasible, for example, based on the understanding of the law. The City Attorney stated that if there were nothing more than a request for information, this ordinance would not apply because that would not be a lobbying contact. Mayor Naugle said he had written to Mr. Leonard indicating that more and more cities had these types of ordinances because it was the type of thing the public wanted. They felt they had a right to know things and that deals were not being done in the ""back room."" Mayor Naugle thought people would just have to get used to it. He noted that there had been discussion about preparing some sort of reference guide about the ordinance for distribution in easy to understand language. Mayor Naugle was sure attorneys would have no problem understanding the ordinance. Commissioner Smith stated that there were lots of inquiries about provisions of the Code, and he hoped the manual would spell out that inquiries were not the same as lobbying, and asking questions was not the same as pushing for a project. He felt there should be some clear delineating between making inquiries and putting forth a project. Commissioner Hutchinson understood instructions would be provided for the public, but she thought staff had questions as to how this ordinance might affect them. She wanted them to understand how they fit into the process.   Minutes of a Regular Meeting  6/6/00 - 44  Commissioner Moore did not feel this ordinance was necessary, and he had always felt that way, but there had not been a law written that did not have some gray areas. He thought a few employees in Level 3 could be specifically identified rather than including all Level 3 employees. For example, he felt it might be necessary to include Assistants to the City Manager, the City Clerk, the Planning & Zoning Manager, and the Economic Development Manager. Commissioner Moore felt the Commission was making this ordinance much more complicated every time it was discussed. He preferred that it be kept simple to satisfy the majority of the Commission. Commissioner Hutchinson asked that the City Manager bring back a recommendation along the lines of Commissioner Moore's suggestion. Mayor Naugle suggested the Commission proceed with inclusion of Level 1, 2 and 3 employees and ask the City Manager which Level 3 employees he felt should be deleted from the ordinance at a later date. Commissioner Smith understood there would be no fee for registration. The City Clerk agreed that was correct, but if the process proved to be labor intensive, a fee could be considered later. Commissioner Smith asked that staff also keep the Commission informed if it seemed as if the same lobbyists were registering with different clients again and again. Commissioner Hutchinson thought a lobbyist could register once and list all their clients. That was the way she had envisioned it, and names could be added to the list as they acquired new clients. Commissioner Katz felt it would be appropriate if lobbyists registered once a year. Commissioner Hutchinson agreed as long as new clients were added to the list as necessary. Commissioner Moore concurred. He suggested the ordinance be amended accordingly. It was agreed. Commissioner Moore introduced the following ordinance, as amended, on second reading: ORDINANCE NO. C-00-27 AN ORDINANCE CREATING A NEW ARTICLE VIII OF CHAPTER 2 OF THE CODE OF ORDINANCES OF THE CITY OF FORT LAUDERDALE, FLORIDA, ENTITLED LOBBYING ACTIVITIES, TO PROVIDE FOR DEFINITIONS OF LOBBYISTS AND LOBBYING ACTIVITIES; TO REQUIRE REGISTRATION OF AND STATEMENTS BY LOBBYISTS, AND TO PROHIBIT LOBBYING BY CERTAIN PRIOR CITY OFFICIALS AND EMPLOYEES FOR A PERIOD OF TIME AFTER LEAVING THE CITY.____________________________________ W hich ordinance was read by title only.

Lot Clearing and Cleaning Charges ................................................................................ (R-7) A resolution was presented authorizing the imposition of liens against certain properties for costs associated with clearing and removal of debris located thereon. Commissioner Smith noted that one of the properties on the list was now above the lien threshold. He wondered how quickly it could be processed for foreclosure. Ms. Lori Milano, Community Inspections Bureau, asked him which property he was discussing, and Commissioner Smith replied he was referring to 633 Northeast 5th Terrace. Ms. Milano advised the case could be forwarded to the City Attorney's Office for action once a lien was recorded. She stated that staff would proceed as quickly as possible. Commissioner Smith hoped staff would move with all due haste because this property was being kept in such a condition that it was thwarting neighborhood improvement efforts. Ms. Milano agreed to do so.   Minutes of a Regular Meeting Commissioner Moore introduced a written resolution entitled: RESOLUTION NO. 00-70  6/6/00 - 48  A RESOLUTION OF THE CITY COMMISSION OF THE CITY OF FORT LAUDERDALE, FLORIDA, ASSESSING AGAINST THE PROPERTIES DESCRIBED IN THE SCHEDULE ATTACHED HERETO THE COST AND EXPENSE OF CLEARING LOTS FOUND TO HAVE AN UNLAW FUL OR EXCESSIVE ACCUMULATION OF RUBBISH, DEBRIS OR TRASH UNDER CHAPTER 18 OF THE CODE OF ORDINANCES OF THE CITY OF FORT LAUDERDALE, FLORIDA AND IMPOSING SPECIAL ASSESSMENT LIENS AGAINST SUCH PROPERTIES FOR THE COST AND EXPENSE INCURRED IN CLEANING AND CLEARING SAME; AUTHORIZING AND DIRECTING THE PROPER CITY OFFICIALS TO RECORD A NOTICE OF SPECIAL ASSESSMENT LIEN IN THE PUBLIC RECORDS OF BROW ARD COUNTY, FLORIDA.________________________________________________________ W hich resolution was read by title only.

Mayor Naugle said he had been informed that the ""slumlord"" on W ingate Road had boarded up the buildings as of this afternoon. Commissioner Moore thought it had been a waste of money and wondered how much it had cost the City. The City Manager said he would provide that information but, just before demolition on Thursday, the plywood would be retrieved and recycled. Therefore, he believed the cost had been minimal. Mayor Naugle believed the money had been well spent to prevent criminal activity.

(R-10) There was a member of the public who indicated a desire to address this item. Commissioner Smith said he wanted to do the responsible thing, but if Mayor Naugle felt the action taken had been appropriate, he supported the idea. Commissioner Moore thought the Commission should do the right thing and let this individual provide input, but he had not been on the prevailing side of the vote. Mayor Naugle thought the Commission would be in a better position should a challenge be filed if opportunity for comment was offered. Motion made by Commissioner Smith and seconded by Commissioner Hutchinson to reconsider this item. Roll call showed: YEAS: Commissioners Smith, Moore, Hutchinson, Katz, and Mayor Naugle. NAYS: none. Having affirmed to speak only the truth by virtue of an oath administered by the City Clerk, Mr. Richard Berie, Architect representing the developer, said that the plans showed the building within the required setbacks and with no encroachments except for a fountain designed to enhance the pedestrian environment. He stated that the column in question, which encroached 4"", had not been installed incorrectly by intent. Mr. Berie stated that the building was almost completed, and this error had been discovered during a survey. He advised that cutting the column back 4"" would expose the steel, which would rust. Mr. Berie noted that the drawings had involved over 500 sheets, and this had been an oversight. He hoped this mistake would not put him out of business and requested a little leniency for a human error. Commissioner Hutchinson asked who had discovered the error. Mr. John Smith, Building Official, replied that the applicant had discovered the error and notified the City. Commissioner Hutchinson stated that Jackson Towers had not been a good neighbor, but she understood the problem. Ms. Alysan Childs, Central Beach Alliance, said that Jackson T neighbor, but they had been working with area residents since construction. She wanted some assurances that the City would closely. Ms. Childs was not thrilled about the 4"" encroachment, long as the neighbors were protected from damages. owers had not been a good the City had shut down the continue to monitor this site but she would not object as  Mayor Naugle recalled similar circumstances with the Casa Riviera project. He stated that an architect had made a mistake, and the building had encroached 4' into the setback. Mayor Naugle said the case had gone to court, and the owner had not been required to demolish the building. Therefore, although he would love to see Jackson Towers demolished, he thought it was likely the developer would prevail in court. Mayor Naugle had understood that some orange fabric material to protect surrounding properties from construction debris had not been utilized as promised. A different material had been used, which had proven inadequate, and he wanted to see the proper material installed from floor to ceiling on each story as the work progressed until windows were installed. He also thought the developer should put up $100,000 to pay for damage to autos and other personal property. Mayor Naugle did not think a repainted car was as good as one with an original paint job.   Minutes of a Regular Meeting  6/6/00 - 52 required situation ion, and no more  Commissioner Smith also felt some type of bond or insurance policy should be because the developer had not had a good record in this respect. Although the seemed to be improving, that had not been the case throughout the construct Commissioner Smith felt the neighbors deserved assurances that there would be destruction of their property.  Mr. John Doyle, developer of Jackson Towers and one-third owner of the property, said he had spoken with Ms. Childs before the meeting, and he had agreed to provide insurance to the extent necessary. He believed the Portofino and Leisure Beach Condominiums could be named as additional insureds on the general contractor's policy and, perhaps, the owner's policy. Mr. Doyle said he would deliver that to the extent such coverage was available. Mr. Doyle stated that orange fabric had been installed. Commissioner Smith did not believe it was the proper type. Mr. Doyle acknowledged the difference. He stated that when there was concrete work being done, a black, more dense mesh screening would be installed as well. Commissioner Smith agreed that would work. Mr. Doyle added that members of the Central Beach Alliance had also been invited to inspect the site each week. The City Attorney stated that the owners of properties within the two adjacent condominiums could be included as additional insureds on the insurance policy so they could file direct claims in the event of damages. The Commission agreed to approve this item subject to this additional insurance.

GX019-96-7039817	"APPENDIX     JOINT DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS             INTRODUCTION.  This appendix contains guidelines for undertaking joint development     projects. It also contains a set of questions most frequently asked about the concept of     joint development and provides responses to those questions, with examples. This appendix     implements the joint development policy announced in the  Federal Register  on March     14, 1997, which is available at www.fta.dot.gov on the FTA Home Page.          JOINT DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS.  Joint development is any income-producing activity     with a transit nexus related to a real estate asset in which FTA has an interest or     obtains one as a result of granting funds (the ""Assisted Real Estate Asset"").     Joint development projects must meet three tests: statutory definition, financial return,     and highest and best transit use, discussed below.     Joint development projects are commercial, residential, industrial, or mixed-use   developments that are induced by or enhance the effectiveness of transit projects. Joint   development projects include private, for-profit, and non-profit development activities   usually associated with fixed guideway transit systems that are new or being modernized or   extended. Such projects can also be associated with new intermodal transfer facilities,   transit malls, and Federal, state, or local investments in existing transit facilities.   FTA capital funds may be used to facilitate private development that enhances transit;   these funds may not be used for purely private development such as construction and   permanent financing costs related to the design or construction of residential, retail, or   other commercial, public, and private revenue-producing facilities not associated with   transit-related development.     REQUIREMENTS RELATED TO STATUTORY DEFINITION . A joint development transportation     project must be compatible with the statutory definition of a capital project:                It is a transportation project that enhances economic development or incorporates       private investment including commercial and residential development, pedestrian and       bicycle access to a mass transportation facility, and the renovation and improvement of       historic transportation facilities, because the project:                             Enhances the effectiveness of a mass transit project, and is related physically or         functionally to that mass transit project; or                                   Establishes new or enhanced coordination between mass transportation and other         transportation; and,                                  Provides a fair share of revenue for mass transportation use.                    OTHER DEFINITIONS RELATED TO THE CAPITAL PROJECT DEFINITION .                      Physically Related . A project is physically related to a capital project if       it provides a direct physical connection with transit services or facilities. This       includes projects using air rights over transit stations or projects built within or       adjacent to transit facilities.                          Functionally Related . A project is functionally related to a capital project       if it is related by activity and use, and it is functionally linked (with or without a       direct physical connection) to transit services or facilities. Also, a project is       functionally related to a capital project if it provides a beneficial service to the       public (or community service) and enhances use of or access to transit. Functional       relationships do not extend beyond the distance most people reasonably can be expected to       walk to use a transit service. The eligible project area for a functionally related       project is estimated to be within a radius of approximately 1,500 feet from the center of       a transit facility. The eligible project area for a functionally related project will be       identified by the grantee in consultation with FTA's Regional Office on a case-by-case       basis.              FINANCIAL RETURN REQUIREMENTS .                Each grantee must negotiate a fair and equitable return in the form of cash and other       benefits to be generated as a result of the FTA investment.                    All projects must generate a one-time payment or ongoing revenue stream for transit use,       the present value of which equals or exceeds the fair market value of the property. See       paragraph 6 for discussion of fair market value.                    After October 1, 1996, all FTA Master Agreements allow the use of real property for       appropriate project purposes ""including joint development purposes that generate       program income to support transit purposes;"" this is the Federal agency authorization       required by 49 C.F.R. 18.25(g)(2) by which the revenues are brought within the definition       of program income and can be used for transit capital, planning, and operating purposes.       While a grant is still open, the transit agency must apply all revenues from any  sale        of real property (which does not qualify as a joint development  transfer ) to the       grant purposes, or must return the revenues to FTA, or must obtain FTA approval to use the       revenue to reduce gross project costs in another capital project. (See Chapter I, Sales       Proceeds.) If the transit agency transfers an Assisted Real Estate Asset from an open       grant and maintains continuing control and otherwise meets the three joint development       program tests, the transit agency may retain as program income all the revenues that       accrue.                    For open grants predating October 1, 1996, all the terms of the current Master Agreement       apply, so subparagraph c above controls.                    Closed grants made in 1983 or thereafter may be reopened to allow for the use of       Assisted Real Estate Assets in joint development projects. However, for those closed       grants made between 1983 and October 1, 1996, the grant purpose and terms, as necessary,       must be amended to allow for joint development. Aside from the requirement that the income       be used for transit operating or capital expenses, FTA generally sets no further       conditions on income from a closed grant.                    Program income includes current or future returns generated from, but not limited to,       transfer or lease of property, mortgage proceeds, or returns stemming from participation       in distribution of project revenues.                    Agreements which transfer title or rights in land or facilities acquired as part of the       FTA project must contain provisions which--                            Extend the requirements, as appropriate, of the FTA Grant Agreement (see paragraph 9);         and                                  Ensure that the grantee retains continuing control of the assets as long as they are         needed for mass transit. This continuing control may be demonstrated by an easement, by a         reversionary interest, by a covenant running with the land, by a contractual clause in the         joint development agreement, or more commonly, by some combination of these assuring the         transit agency that the joint development project will maintain its physical or functional         relationship to transit, will continue to enhance coordination between modes, or will in         fact result in increased mass transportation usage; and                                  Ensure that a person making an agreement to occupy space in a facility under this         subparagraph shall pay a reasonable share of the costs of the facility through rental         payments and other means.                    HIGHEST AND BEST TRANSIT USE REQUIREMENT .                The calculation of equitable return required in paragraph 5 must be based on the       appraised market value as represented either by highest and best use of the property or by       highest and best  transit   use of the property, taking into account in either       valuation the local transportation, land use, and economic development plans. Highest and       best transit use is that combination of residential, commercial, retail, public, and/or       parking space and amenities to be included in the joint development, which is calculated       to produce the greatest level of social, economic, and financial benefit to the transit       system and the community that it serves.                    If the grantee structures a joint development project to include the transfer of an       Assisted Real Estate Asset, then the final transfer value must be based on competition to       the extent practicable, and FTA concurrence in the final transfer value is required.               ELIGIBLE COSTS FOR JOINT DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS . Eligible project costs for joint     development projects include, but are not limited to, the following:                Planning, design, engineering, and environmental analyses, as appropriate. (Formula       program funds are more appropriate for planning and feasibility analysis.)                    Real estate packaging for a specific joint development project including preliminary       design and engineering; estimates of operating income and expenses and capital costs; and       negotiations to secure financing, developers, and prime tenants.                    Land acquisition, relocation, demolition of existing improvements, and site preparation,       as appropriate.                    Foundations and substructure improvements for buildings over transit facilities.                    Open space, and pedestrian connections and access links between transit services and       related development.                    Other facilities and infrastructure investments needed to induce significant private       investment and to improve access between new or existing development and transit       facilities.                    Utility work. The eligibility of costs of utility work associated with private       investment will be considered on a case-by-case basis. FTA grant funds will pay for costs       of utility work that are attributable to non-FTA project purposes only when--                            The utility services a joint private and transit use; or                                  The utility lines will be located under a co-located street or sidewalk or within other         common elements so that it would benefit the project to provide adequate capacity at the         outset of the project.                          Safety and security equipment and facilities (including lighting, surveillance and       related intelligent transportation system applications).                    Facilities that incorporate community services such as daycare or health care.                    Parking elements. All FTA participation in financing parking improvements must have a       public transit justification and use. Parking elements of joint development projects which       meet this general rule will be considered on a case-by-case basis.                    Professional Services Contracting Costs. Grantees may incur reasonable and necessary       costs for consultants to prepare or perform items a through j above, or to assist the       grantee in reviewing the same.              FUNDS THAT MAY BE USED IN JOINT DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS . No dedicated funding has     been established for joint development projects. Joint development activities are eligible     for funding under all Title 49 capital programs, including the Capital Program (Section     5309), the Urbanized Area Formula Program (Section 5307), the Non-urbanized Area Formula     Program (Section 5311), and the Elderly and Persons with Disabilities Program (Section     5310). CMAQ and STP funds transferred from the Federal Highway Administration to be     administered by FTA may also be used to support joint development projects.          APPLICATION OF OTHER FEDERAL REQUIREMENTS TO PRIVATE SECTOR PROJECTS . In a joint     development project, FTA must determine whether, and to what degree, various Federal rules     apply to the privately funded, non-transit portion of the project. The applicability of     Federal requirements (such as those of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), the     Davis-Bacon Act, third party procurement requirements, and Buy America) will be resolved     on a case-by-case basis for joint development projects involving the transfer of real     property. FTA will work with the grant applicant to determine whether, and the extent to     which, such Federal requirements apply, particularly to any private development, and the     most appropriate procedures for satisfying the requirements. Proposals should be submitted     as early as possible in the joint development process. This will allow FTA staff to help     the grantee structure an approvable proposal in the least time possible and determine     which cross-cutting requirements must be applied to the particular project. Nevertheless,     the following cross-cutting requirements are expected to apply in the indicated     circumstances:                If the joint development involves a ground lease or transfer of federally assisted real       estate and there is no Federal assistance for new improvements, then the following       requirements apply to the lessee or transferee and must be incorporated into the lease or       the conveyance instrument:                            language found at 49 C.F.R. 23.7 binding the lessee or transferee not to discriminate         based on race, color, national origin, or sex;                                  language found at 49 C.F.R. 27.7 and 49 C.F.R. 27.9(b) binding the lessee or transferee         not to discriminate based on disability and binding the same to compliance with the         Americans with Disabilities Act with regard to any improvements constructed; and                                  language contained in the FTA MA(4), dated October 1, 1997, and found in Section 3         Subparagraphs (a)(1), (a)(2), and (b) thereof relating to conflicts of interest and         debarment.                          If the construction of improvements is also federally assisted, then in addition to       paragraph 9a above, at least the following requirements also will apply and must be       incorporated into the lease or the conveyance instrument:                            Buy America - language making it clear that the steel, iron, and manufactured goods used         in the joint development project are produced in the United States, as described in         49 U.S.C. Section 5323(j) and 49 C.F.R. Part 661. The reader is referred to Chapter         VI, paragraph 15 of circular 9300.11A for further information about Buy America         requirements.                                  Planning and Environmental Analysis -- language making it clear that the grantee must         comply with, and the joint development project is subject to, the requirements of: the         FHWA/FTA metropolitan and statewide planning regulations at 23 C.F.R. Part 450; the         National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, as amended, 42 U.S.C. 4321,  et seq.

Cargo Preference - language making it clear that items imported from abroad and used in         the joint development were shipped predominantly on U.S.-flag ships and that the project         complies with 46 C.F.R. Part 381, to the extent these regulations apply to the joint         development.                                  Seismic Safety - language certifying that a structure conforms to seismic safety         standards, as contained in 49 C.F.R. Part 41.                                  Energy Conservation and Recycled Products - Transferee(s) or joint developer agrees to         comply with the mandatory energy efficiency standards and policies within the applicable         state energy conservation plans issued in compliance with the Energy Policy and         Conservation Act, 42 U.S.C. 6321  et seq.                                          Lobbying - 49 C.F.R. Part 20.                                  Labor Protection--Language making it clear that the transferee or joint developer will         adhere to labor protection requirements applying to Federal projects, such as Davis-Bacon         - 49 U.S.C. Section 5333(a) and 40 U.S.C. 276a through 276a(7) and 29 C.F.R. Part 5;         Copeland ""Anti-Kickback "" Act as amended, 18 U.S.C. 874 and 40 U.S.C. 276c and         29 C.F.R. Part 3; and Contract Work Hours and Safety Standards Act, 49 U.S.C. 327 through         332 and 29 C.F.R. Part 5 and 40 U.S.C. 333 and 29 C.F.R. Part 1926; as well as 49 U.S.C.         5333 (b) concerning protection of transit employees.                                  Civil Rights Requirements - 49 U.S.C. Section 5332.                                  Program Fraud - Transferee(s) or joint developer agrees to comply with Program Fraud         Civil Remedies Act of 1986, as amended, 31 U.S.C. 3801  et seq.  and 49 C.F.R. Part         31. Penalties may apply for noncompliance.                                  Language making it clear that the level of Federal participation in the joint         development provides no U.S. Government obligation to third parties in the project.                                  Uniform Relocation - If the federally assisted site to be improved is occupied by other         than the grantee and the occupant is displaced, the transferee(s) or joint developer must         comply with 42 U.S.C. 4601  et seq.  and the regulations at 49 C.F.R. Part 24.                          In any instance in which FTA determines that NEPA applies to the joint development, the       level of environmental analysis will depend upon the complexity of the project and its       likely impacts. In some instances, minimal review will be necessary, in which case FTA       will issue a Categorical Exclusion. Joint development activities that portend significant       environmental impacts, however, will necessitate the preparation of an Environmental       Assessment or an Environmental Impact Statement. See generally the FTA Environmental       Impact and Related Procedures at 23 C.F.R. Part 771.               NOTES TO READER . Before undertaking a new joint development, a grant applicant is     encouraged to turn to Chapter X, ""Regional Offices,"" of Circular 9300.1C, select     the FTA Regional Office responsible for the grant applicant's locality, and telephone that     office to discuss the kind of project planned. Such a dialogue, early in the project     planning process, will ensure that the joint development proposal will be reviewed on a     timely basis.            The statements included in this appendix reflect typical project situations. Instructions     given and policy statements appearing in the circular are not intended to be read as     inflexible FTA mandates. They are instead set forth as guidelines which FTA generally     applies to typical projects. Early dialogue with the FTA Regional Office will clarify the     degree to which a new joint development project conforms to, or differs from, previous FTA     experience.          FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS AND SOME PRACTICAL EXAMPLES .                What is joint development ? It is an income-producing activity involving a third       party, taking place on or with an Assisted Real Estate Asset (described in paragraph 2       above). The third party is the source of the income to the grantee; the third party is the       party to whom the property is transferred or the lessee who leases the space.                    What is the limitation on new improvements for joint development ? The purpose of       the Joint Development Policy is to facilitate the use of an Assisted Real Estate Asset for       transit oriented joint development. Thus, FTA will support, or allow the use of grant       funds for, the construction of a structure that includes a transit facility. However, FTA       is unlikely to allow FTA grant funds to support a free-standing facility (such as an       apartment building or an office tower) that is not part of a transit facility. (See       question 11f for the definition of a shell for joint development.)                    Does joint development require a private or nonprofit developer ? Not really. The       third party's role need not be that of developer; it may be that of a lessee. For example,       the transit agency can lease out its excess space to a senior care or day care provider,       in which case the transit agency is the ""developer"" under FTA's policy. If,       however, the project is to build an office/retail complex in the air space above a transit       station, only a very large transit agency will have the means to borrow the sums necessary       to build and finance the structure. It will be much easier (though not absolutely       necessary) to have a private partner who builds and manages the development.        One transit authority has created a private subsidiary (limited partnership) to assist     it in developing property around an historic central station. This project will create six     floors of multi-family rental housing. The project will be financed with a combination of     historic preservation tax credits, low-income housing tax credits, and mortgage revenue     bonds issued by the city. The transit operator is also a partner in the joint development.     The transit operator will receive a share of the project revenues for the life of the     limited partnership.       What is highest and best transit use ? A property's highest and best use is the       use--from among reasonably probable and legal alternative uses that are physically       possible, appropriately supported, and financially feasible--that results in the highest       anticipated selling price. The way highest and best  transit  use differs from       highest and best use is through recognition that value to the transit system is not in the       selling price alone.       Highest and best  transit  use is that combination of financial return and other     transit benefits, such as increasing ridership, reducing trip durations or improving     connections between trips, that maximizes the value of the asset to transit.       For example, a transit agency identified several properties adjoining existing or     planned transit stations that it wished to use for joint development. One particular     property was oddly shaped, but with substantial road frontage. A request for development     proposals resulted in offers to build 8 or 10 townhouses with garages. This option would     produce the highest immediate cash proceeds to the transit system. However, the transit     agency sought and was granted revised zoning on the property, allowing up to 160 moderate     income apartments to be offered for rent. The moderate-income rental use will take a long     time to produce cash flow and proceeds to the grantee, but in the interim, the     moderate-income rental use is projected to increase transit ridership by (conservatively)     32,000 trips per year, which are estimated to be worth between $18,000 and $24,000 per     year in additional farebox revenues. It is anticipated that these residents will also     provide economic support for new retail space in the surrounding community. FTA regards     this decision as satisfying the ""highest and best transit use"" criterion.       How much land may be purchased by a grantee ? A town is currently planning       improvements to its bus transit system, including a downtown transfer center. The center       is being planned as a multi-use facility, which will include a tourist information center,       small retail businesses, and possibly a bank. To make this eventual development a reality       may require that the transit agency acquire a larger amount of land than is necessary for       the transit center alone. FTA will assist the transit operator's land acquisition       activities with grant funds, as described in paragraphs 7a through 7e of this appendix.       Generally, FTA will not support land purchases more than 1,500 feet from the center of the       transit facility.                    What is an ""envelope"" or ""building shell"" for a joint development ?       The transit agency may wish to encourage local economic activity at its facilities. Under       the Joint Development policy, the transit agency may build an ""envelope,"" or       rehabilitate an existing transit owned facility. Envelope or building shell means (but is       not limited to) load bearing walls, roof, foundation, substructure improvement, site       design, and engineering. ""Tenant finishes,"" however, are not eligible for FTA       reimbursement. These include partition walls, furniture, equipment, shelving, lighting,       drapes, floor coverings, and other items specific to the business intended to be operated.            A Neighborhood Travel and Jobs Center involved just such a development. There, the     local transit authority was allowed to convert an existing office building into a     $3 million Neighborhood Travel Center. The center will serve as a terminal for bus     lines to industrial jobs and will provide the focus for a downtown redevelopment     ""campus"" including jobs training, child care facilities, and a     privately-financed development bank. The tenant finishes for each of these ancillary     activities will be paid for with non-grant funds, though grant funds were used to     rehabilitate the building itself. The tenants will pay market rate rent to the transit     authority.       What is the difference between a sale and a joint development transfer ? A sale       does not involve continuing control of the real property by the grantee and fails to       establish a nexus between the Assisted Real Estate Asset and an ongoing transit purpose as       outlined in paragraph 3 of this appendix. Proceeds from a sale are not program income and       must be returned to FTA pursuant to 49 CFR 18.31(c)(2).       In contrast, a joint development transfer meets the statutory definition test outlined     in paragraph 3 of this appendix, the grantee exercises continuing control over the     transferred real estate, and the financial and highest and best use tests of the Joint     Development Policy are met. The proceeds from a joint development transfer are considered     program income, which may be retained by the grantee. (See paragraph 5c.)       Here is an example of a joint development transfer: a rapid rail station includes 6.3     acres for a ""park and ride"" area. A developer has been approved to build 160     residential units and 17,000 square feet of service retail space on a portion of this     area. The transit operator transfers 3.4 acres to the developer for use in the joint     development. The development will generate more transit trips and more non-fare revenue     than the displaced parking spaces provided. The transit agency will retain the income     generated from this land transfer as program income and will be assured of satisfactory     continuing control through covenants running with the land. Should the developer re-sell     the land in the future, the covenants bind the next owner to a transit-oriented use of the     land.       Will NEPA and other Federal cross-cutting requirements discourage private       participation ? It is the will of the Congress that the Federal cross-cutting       requirements govern grantees' use of FTA's financial assistance. To the extent that a       grantee joins with a private or nonprofit developer to undertake joint development using       FTA grant funds in whole or in part for the improvements to the site, it is that grantee's       role to obtain the grant funds necessary to make the joint development financially       feasible and to supply its expertise in meeting the applicable Federal requirements. For       example, if the proposed land use is known from the outset, a grantee can reduce the risk       to the private or nonprofit developer by using transit resources to perform the necessary       environmental studies before choosing a partner. Alternatively, a project may be       structured so that the grantee selects a development partner, the grantee and the partner       jointly determine the highest and best transit use, and the grantee then performs the       necessary environmental studies before its private or nonprofit partner becomes       responsible for any costs. Such incentives can attract new participants to transit joint       development.                    Are all incidental uses joint development?   No, not all incidental uses are       joint development. ( FTA permits the incidental use of transit equipment and property for       purposes other than provision of transit service, provided the use is compatible with the       approved purposes of the project and does not interfere with intended uses of project       assets.) Allowing nearby theaters and restaurants to use transit parking spaces during the       transit system's off hours is an incidental use. So is temporary use of transit property       as a staging area for nearby construction. These uses, however, are not joint development.       In contrast, the acquisition of land or the redesign of space to allow for additional       parking to be used by local theaters and restaurants could be considered as a joint       development project -- to the extent the acquisition or redesign is justified by a transit       use -- and should be discussed with the Regional Office.                    What is the difference between ""joint development"" and       ""transit-oriented development ?"" The term ""joint development"" is a       subset of transit-oriented development. While all joint development is transit-oriented       development, not all transit-oriented development meets the three tests of statutory       definition (transit nexus), financial return, and highest and best transit use.

ROLL CALL     COUNCILMEMBERS PRESENT: Cook, Warden, Wright, Rianda, Hahn   COUNCILMEMBERS ABSENT: None   Staff Present: City Manager Kersnar, City Attorney Savaree, Community Development Director Ewing, Public Works Director Curtis, Finance Director Fil, Police Chief Janke, Human Resources Director Dolan, Principal Planner de Melo, Assistant City Engineer Jones, IT Manager Harnish, GIS Coordinator de Rouen, Deputy City Clerk Harrington     REPORT FROM CLOSED SESSION     Mayor Hahn announced that direction was given, and no action taken.     SPECIAL ORDERS OF THE DAY/PRESENTATIONS     Mayor's Proclamation declaring May 20, 2001 as San Juan Canyon Day in Belmont.     Mayor Hahn read the proclamation aloud to the audience and thanked Mr. McLaughlin, the Poet Laureate of Belmont, for writing it.     Update on Pedestrian/Bike Bridge Project.     Presentation by Assistant City Engineer Duncan Jones, Consultants Mark Ashley, Project Manager/Bridge Engineer of T.Y. Lin International, and Ricardo Rabines Bridge Architect of Safdie Rabines Architects.   Engineer Jones outlined the history of the project. Since the initial meeting with Council, 11 public meetings have been held as well as a Planning Commission and Park and Recreation Commission meetings. The original project alignment has been changed, due to an adverse reaction by the neighbors. The School District Board no longer favors the bikepath from the apartment complex on Old County Road through Nesbit School, since this would create another point of access at the back of the schoolyard. Issues raised at the public meetings included: control of access for security, loss of parking and safer intersections.   Engineer Jones outlined alternative routes that were being considered. The Park and Recreation Commission suggested the bridge come down on the north side of the slough and enter directly into the bike trail that goes around the north side practice fields. This would be a direct connection to the Bay Trail.   As a result of this project, the Safe Routes to School would create a school zone in the vicinity of the three intersections in front of Nesbit Elementary School. Traffic calming devices could include intersection neckdowns or traffic circles, an engineering study would determine which was best. This would go up Hiller, Masonic, and Old County Road. This would cut down cross traffic on Hiller.   Consultant Mark Ashley discussed the community outreach aspect of this project. They wanted the bridge to bear the signature of the community. He noted that one more conceptual design review workshop would be held. At the meetings they discussed the image they wanted to project and what they thought the essence of Belmont was.   Three alternatives and visions statements were developed out of the meetings:       A. The essence of Belmont is tying historical to the 21 st    Century; the bridge is a suspension, asymmetrical bridge, and a landmark   structure for the city.     B. The essence of Belmont is home, trees, hills, country   and privacy; the bridge is a flowing, inviting bridge, not a landmark   structure, more conventional.     C. The essence of Belmont can best be described as diverse   architecture and the bridge is a conventional bridge and still a landmark that   would compliment the train station.       Mr. Rabines  Bridge Architect showed the bridge designs that were created based on the vision statements.   Consultant Mark Ashley had the workshop participants rate the designs, there was clear consensus for Alternative B, Alternative A was the least desirable.   The Planning Commission was divided between Alternatives A and B; there was no clear consensus. The Planning Commission was concerned that there was not enough community input.   The Park and Recreation Commission selected Alternative B unanimously, with the provision that the landing zone on the sports complex side be studied for alternatives.   Engineer Jones stated he would place survey forms at the library, city hall, and city website for more public input.   C. Cook, suggested placing survey forms at the Farmers' Market, and including the vision statements for each alternative.   In response to C. Warden, Engineer Jones stated that Alternative B would cost $2.5 million, Alternative C $3 million, and Alternative A would cost $3.5 to $4 million.   C. Rianda mentioned a bridge in Santa Clara County that had trees across it and a bridge in Millbrae with good architecture and victorian lighting. She would like to incorporate those aspects into the design. C. Rianda recommended the Arts Commission review the bridge designs.   In response to C. Wright, Engineer Jones stated the schedule would be extended by one month. He would return to Council for final direction on one concept and give the consultant additional time to prepare final drawings.   C. Wright was concerned that they might get a hodge podge design with more input.   C. Hahn was concerned about the maintenance cost for Alternative A, liked Alternative B and agreed with C. Rianda that natural enhancements would be fitting.   Engineer Jones stated they were applying for Bicycle Transportation Account funding at the end of May, for the remaining, $785,000 to close the gap to $2.5 million. There were other grants available that they could apply for, up to $2 million.     PUBLIC/COUNCIL COMMENTS   Mr. Gibson ,  3114 E. Laurel Creek invited the public to San Juan Canyon Day on May 20 at 2p.m. in Ralston Village and distributed information to the Council.   C. Cook announced that the Belmont Farmers' Market would reopen on May 20, and this year the market will be held every Sunday in the Caltrain parking lot.   C. Hahn announced that on May 19 th  at 10 a.m. would be the rededication of Alexander Park.

PUBLIC/HEARINGS   Public Hearing to consider an appeal filed on March 30, 2001, by Mr. Herring, regarding Planning Commission Action taken on March 20, 2001, recommending City Council disapproval of a Mitigated Negative Declaration, and Tentative Parcel Map and Single Family Design Review application to subdivide a one-acre parcel into two lots and construction of a new single family residence on one of the two lots, for property located at 1601 Courtland Road, Lot A, Block  33,Montebello Subdivision, Assessor’s Parcel No. 045-212-010.     Principal Planner de Melo,   stated   the Planning Commission voted unanimously to recommend disapproval of this project. The one acre site currently contains a single family dwelling, if the tentative parcel map were approved the existing dwelling would be sited on the larger of the two lots which would be .69 acres. The applicant proposed locating a new 3,498 s.f. single family dwelling on .31 acres.     Mr. Fred Herring , Project Architect, stated they worked on this project for 2 1/2 years. The City assigned 4 to 5 different project planners during the process. He acknowledged this was an exceedingly steep site with a dreadful past. They conducted many tests to satisfy the town geologist including drilling a 30-inch hole. Mr. Herring stated the General Plan issue was not raised until they went to the Planning Commission, and felt they should have been notified sooner.   Mr. Herring noted that he sent a letter to the neighbors in response to a petition with approximately 100 signatures against the project. He only received one response back regarding safeguards during the construction. He stated that expert testimony confirmed that the site was feasible, and it could increase the stability. The house was sited on the steepest part of the lot by design. Mr. Herring stated the City planners and geologist recommended approval for this project to the Planning Commission.   Mayor Hahn opened the Public Hearing.     Mr. Carlomagno ,  1615 Vine Street stated he was   concerned about a nine-foot wall on Vine Street. Debris would flow between the two homes when it rained. He requested Council uphold the Planning Commission decision.     Mr. Richy ,  1609 Vine Street stated the slope was steep, and was concerned about the nine-foot wall. Mr. Richy did not think the wall would blend with the neighborhood design.     Ms. Thompson ,  38 Vine Street   asked Council to uphold the Planning Commission decision. The property has at least a 62% slope, over twice the allowable limit. Sliding and drainage issues would not be stabilized by building this home. She stated this home would jeopardize the surrounding properties.     Mr. Sorensen ,  1610 Courtland Road   opposed the building of this house. He stated that in wet winters, the hillside along Vine and Courtland runs off into the street down the drains. A house built on the hill supported by pillars could slide into the street, if the ground was saturated with water.     Mr. Herring ,  responded that   every geotechnical issue was raised by Cotton and Associates. The issues were studied and the problems were resolved by the design. The wall would not be seen below the house, the only wall would be a debris flow wall and it would be heavily landscaped.   On motion by C. Rianda, seconded by C. Wright, and approved unanimously by show of hands, to close the Public Hearing.   In response to C. Rianda's question, Mr. Herring stated that he has built 100's of homes and was aware that General Plans exist, but did not review it in this case.   C. Warden confirmed with Community Development Director Ewing that the General Plan was a reference document when making a finding for a subdivision. C. Warden sited relevant sections from the General Plan.   C. Rianda noted that the geological input stated that there was visible slough and subterranean movement beyond the surface slough. Some of the recommendations made were based on limited field exploration, and were subject to confirmation of actual conditions encountered during construction. C. Rianda stated there was no guarantee that the mitigation's proposed would work.   C. Cook, stated that they needed to avoid developments where the slope was over 30%. She thought the majority of this lot was not developable and should remain that way. Considerable time had been spent on landslide issues in that area of Belmont.   C. Wright, stated he did not see any new information, in the process, that would cause him to overturn the Planning Commission decision.   C. Hahn stated she would uphold the Planning Commission decision.     Action:  On motion by C. Cook, seconded by C. Rianda and approved unanimously by show of hands to adopt:           Resolution No. 8986  upholding the Planning Commission   decision and disapproving a mitigated negative declaration and tentative   parcel map and single family design review application at 1601 Courtland Road   (Appl. No. 1007)             Recess  at this time being 8:45 P.M.     Meeting Resumed  at this time being 8:51 P.M.     Public Hearing to consider a Conceptual Development Plan, General Plan Amendment, and Zone Change to construct 48 townhouses on a five-acre site currently occupied by the Peninsula Jewish Community Center (PJCC) at 2440 Carlmont Drive. On-site parking would be provided for 120 vehicles for the units. The project would include 2.6 acres of landscape area, which includes hillside and riparian area to the north and west of the units. (Application No. 00-1005); APN: 045-031-010; Zoned: R-3 (Multi-Family Residential – Garden Apartments); CEQA Status: Mitigated Negative  Declaration; Summerhill Homes (Applicant); Peninsula Jewish Community Center (Owner)     Principal Planner de Melo, stated the Planning Commission voted 5/2 recommending approval of this project. The project would consist of a 48 unit residential townhouse development on a 5 acre site. The plan included 12 4-plex buildings, 4 different floorplans were proposed which consisted of 36 2-bedroom, and 12 3-bedroom units, a pool, spa complex and tot lot area. Access to the development was proposed from a two way driveway entrance fronting on Carlmont Drive at the Southeast corner of the project site. A loop road would access the units. They proposed 120 parking spaces consisting of 96 garage spaces, (2 spaces per unit) and 24 uncovered spaces for guest parking. 2.6 acres of open space would remain in the development, with a trail created between the project entrance at Carlmont Drive and Old Lake Road to provide access to Water Dog Lake Park.   Council discussed the trails on the property.   C. Warden questioned why this project did not require an Environmental Impact Report.   Community Development Director Ewing stated the potential impacts could be resolved by straightforward mitigation measures and a Negative Declaration could be used. If they believed that additional studies need to be completed to determine the extent of the impacts then an EIR would be prepared. He did not believe that was necessary in this case, the differences between the current use and the proposed use were in many cases quite small and determined a Negative Declaration was appropriate.     Craig Champion,  Summerhill Homes, stated the initial proposal was submitted in January, 2000, which consisted of 60 units and was considered too dense. The project was presented to the Planning Commission in September 2000, with 52 units. Summerhill further addressed the concerns of the Planning Commission and reduced the project to 48 units.     Karl Lagonie, Bassenian and Lagoni ,  Project Architect, highlighted the issues faced on the land plan. The applicant was proposing four buildings designed so the width of the front of the unit was narrower than the rear, this would reduce the scale and the mass that fronts the street. The project was designed with visual corridors, to take advantage of riparian areas and open space. Two types of product, flat padded on the first and third tiers, and upslope for the second and fourth tier, were designed to disturb less natural terrain.     Craig Champion,  Summerhill Homes, compared their project density with the existing buildings that surround the site. The general ranges were 40 units an acre, this project was at 9.6 units per acre. They increased the playground area near the cabana and deleted the detached garages. They increased the setback on Carlmont Drive to a 25 foot setback. He stated they would comply with the Planning Commission condition of a Detailed Mitigation Monitoring Plan. Over 50% of the site would be in open space or landscaped. They would pay the Park Dedication Fee of $700,000 and the Pool Impact Fee of $300,000. They would expand the drainage outflow from 48 inches to 72 inches, which would reduce the potential for flood in the area. Mr. Champion estimated a 77% reduction of daily traffic on Carlmont Drive. The PJCC currently has 1,000 members, 300 of those members were from Belmont. Mr. Champion requested approval of the application.   Mayor Hahn opened the Public Hearing.     Mr. Bauer,  1027 Tahoe Drive, stated his children went to the PJCC. Mr. Bauer reviewed the project plans and thought it was an enhancement to the neighborhood. He encouraged Council to endorse this project and thought it would benefit the City.     Mr. Gersch,  President, Board of Directors PJCC, stated the existing 20,000 s.f. center was 40 years old. The PJCC acquired a 12 acre site in Foster City and would build a new 140,000 s.f. center. The Belmont site would close at the end of the school year 2002. Mr. Gersh urged Council to approve the project.     Ms. McNutt,  Read Avenue, PJCC Board Member for 9 years. The new center would have two pools and new amenities. She stated the Summerhill project would be an attractive addition to the community and hoped the $1 million dollars in fees would be used to build a teen facility in Belmont. Ms. McNutt asked for support of the application.     Mr. King,  2441 Carlmont Drive, stated there was a density problem on Carlmont Drive and asked if this project would cause further problems. He stated the PJCC did not bother the residents because the use time was during off hours, in between commute hours. Mr. King thought that adding more residential units would impact the current residents.   On motion by C. Warden, seconded by C. Wright and agreed unanimously by a show of hands to close the Public Hearing.   C. Wright stated he liked the project, and thought it was the closest to moderately priced that Belmont would get. He stated he would have supported a higher density project. C. Wright thought the key issues had been mitigated and believed that traffic would be lowered. He stated the loss of the pool was the greatest concern expressed by the community.   In response to C. Hahn's question as to why the PJCC chose Summerhill, Mr. Gersch stated he had a meeting in the City offices, with the then City Manager. Summerhill and one other developer were posed as the two that the City would most like to see as the developer of the project. The PJCC went forward with the transaction with Summerhill based upon that guidance.     Mr. Gersch  stated the PJCC needed approximately $40 million to build the Foster Site and they were 70% through the fundraising process. Construction would start in the next two months.   C. Cook, stated that she agreed with C. Wright that this was a quality project. The community needed housing stock and liked that the public would be able to access Water Dog Lake. C. Cook stated that she supported the project.   C. Warden, stated he needed to make a finding to amend the General Plan. There was no entitlement for that. He read goals and policies from the General Plan and stated it was a difficult decision to change the zoning.   C. Rianda stated that these homes would cost between $500,000 and $600,000. Based on the 30% average for income it would require an income of between $150,000 and $180,000 to purchase a home. ABAG statistics stated that Belmont needed rental homes. ABAG statistics state that in the salary range of $122,000 and 184,000 countywide we will be 1,100 units over what was needed. ABAG projected a deficiency in rental units for all salary ranges, except for the $122,000 to the $184,000. C. Rianda stated that Belmont had enough ownership units and need rental units.   C. Rianda stated that she would like to reduce the density. The current zoning of R-3 would allow a maximum of 84. That would be 16.7 units per acre. There were 2.4 acres to be developed, with the same density that would work out to be 40.08 units. The 48 units on the 2.4 acres was still too high. C. Rianda would like to stay consistent with the original R-3 zoning. There was 5 acres, but they chose to do compact housing on 2.4 acres, if they developed all 5 acres then you come out with 16.7 units per acre, and 2.7 acres comes out to 40 units.   C. Rianda stated she was concerned that there was no proposal for low to moderate units or below market units. She noted that there was only one entrance to the project and thought that lower density would allow another entrance. C. Rianda would like the tot lot to be open to the public.   C. Rianda stated that she did not think she could make the findings presented in the staff report.   C. Rianda thought the onsite parking was deficient and the current parking lot at the JCC was used for neighborhood overflow parking at night. C. Rianda pointed out that the developer fees did not keep up with the additional expenditures that the School District experiences.   C. Rianda stated that she hoped Summerhill would incorporate the comments and present Council with alternatives at a later date.   C. Hahn stated that there was no sharing with Council that several builders had been discussed with staff, there was no knowledge that there was any discussion entered into or opinions given relative to future direction for the community center. She had a trepidation about making a General Plan amendment. C. Hahn thought the project was too dense. She noted the Hidden Valley development donated a significant amount of open space to the City for perpetuity. C. Hahn would prefer to see something that fit into the hillside better.   In response to C. Cook's question, Mr. Gersch stated that the PJCC explored other options and was surprised that Council was surprised about the meetings that took place with the City Manager at the time. The PJCC ultimately went in the direction based on the guidance from the City Manager's office that this was the type of project that the City wanted in Belmont. Mr. Gersch thought this was the type of project that had the highest likelihood of being accepted. The amendment to the general plan had been discussed at that time. Mr. Gersch stated he left that meeting feeling that that was not a difficult thing to do and was compatible with the use that was going on. Mr. Gersch further stated that they need to maximize the value that they can get for the land, every qualified institualized use that they were approached with would not have yielded enough funds to be able to sell it.   C. Wright, stated that he thought that C. Rianda contradicted herself. The contradiction was that what we really need is affordable rental housing, but we want lower density. Those two things were incompatible. C. Wright stated that he supports open space in the community, but wanted to make clear who had to pay for that open space. He did not think it was fair to the PJCC to go back through the process   C. Rianda, stated that if they had to have increased density, then she wanted housing that the City was deficient in, and that was rental units.   C. Cook stated that Summerhill discussed the concept of the project with the Council a year ago, and thought it was unfair that they gave general consensus and direction where this project was going. Lots of time had been spent on this project.   C. Hahn clarified that their comments were restricted in the parallel process, and there was not a formal application before them at that time.     Action:  C. Rianda moved to continue the project and provide guidance to the applicant and staff for further development of the conceptual development plan and mitigated negative declaration and general plan.   Community Development Director Ewing, requested City Council consensus on the action to be taken.   In response to C. Hahn's question, City Attorney Savaree, stated that Council could have a general discussion to come to a consensus. She stated that if the motion to continue is still pending and if there is a second, then the maker of the motion could indicate as part of that motion the aspects of the project that the council would like to see be further looked at.     Action:  C. Warden, stated he would second the motion but was concerned about traffic flow and how it related to am/pm peak. He stated that it was addressed in the traffic study, but thought that it had a negative impact in terms of residential use of that site. He also suggested getting feedback from the people who live in the area.   City Attorney Savaree clarified that if this was continued, C. Warden was requesting that C. Rianda amend the motion so that traffic issues would be additionally studied.   C. Warden, stated the traffic issue and neighborhood outreach.     Action:  C. Rianda, agreed to the amendment and outlined the issues she wanted addressed: density, traffic circulation, the one entrance versus two entrances, the number of parking spaces to deal with 108 bedrooms, If the density remained the same then she would like consideration of rental units. The parking, the fact that the parking lot is used for overflow parking at night. C. Rianda stated that if the kind of housing Summerhill was proposing, remained the same, then she would like to see the density reduced to 40, which would be consistent with the density that it was zoned for currently. C. Rianda stated she would consider higher density for rental units.   C. Cook, stated she would vote to go along with the consensus of the Council, but she was concerned about giving direction to the developer to make changes if there was not support to change the zoning.   Community Development Director Ewing, stated that the developer was going to need some time, and staff would renotice when the time was right to come back to Council.   C. Wright, stated that he supported the project as it stood, but was willing to continue if they went in a workable direction. C. Wright wondered what the process was that Council could give the developer more specificity, to bring back something novel, that would get three votes.   C. Hahn called for the vote.     Action:  Council voted unanimously, 5/0 by a show of hands, to continue this item.     OLD BUSINESS   Consideration of Resolution upholding the Planning Commission’s decision to deny a Floor Area  Ratio exception & Single Family Design Review at 3817 Naughton Avenue. (Shehabi)     Principal Planner de Melo, presented a survey of the surrounding properties which indicated that the subject dwelling with the proposed additions would result in the highest floor area ratio (FAR) of the surveyed properties. This FAR would be inconsistent with the FAR of the surrounding neighborhood which is identically zoned HRO-2, and would be a grant of special privilege.     Action:  On motion by C. Warden, seconded by C. Rianda and approved by show of hands, 3-2 ( C. Cook and C. Wright abstained), to adopt:                             Resolution No. 8987  upholding the Planning       Commission decision to deny a Floor Area Ratio Exception and Single Family       Design Review at 3817 Naughton Avenue (Application No. 00-1065).                   Status Report on the City Hall/Police Facility       Project.                             Public Works Director Curtis stated the architect was not ready with plans and suggested canceling the bid date and re-advertise when the plans were ready, possibly in July.   C. Rianda stated she thought this was unprofessional and irresponsible of the project architect.   Council concurred to have the project architect at the next City Council meeting for a special presentation.     MEETING EXTENDED     At this time being 10:30 P.M., on motion by C. Wright, seconded by C. Warden and approved by Council, to extend the meeting another 10 minutes and to continue hearing new items.     Action:  On motion by C. Wright, seconded by C. Warden and approved unanimously by show of hands, to adopt:           Resolution No. 8988  authorizing the cancellation of the   sealed bids advertisement for the City Hall/Police Facility Retrofit, City   Contract No. 415.             NEW BUSINESS     Consideration of Ordinance amending Chapter 22, Section 4 of Encroachment Permit Ordinance.     Public Works Director Curtis stated this amendment would allow the issuance of a stop work orders. He requested a penalty fee be established by a Resolution in the future.     Action:  On motion by C. Rianda, seconded by C. Warden and approved unanimously by show of hands, to introduce:             Ordinance amending section 22-4 of the Belmont City Code, Streets and     Highways, Article 1 Encroachments. (2 nd  reading and adoption     scheduled for 5/22/01)           Discussion and direction regarding Schedule of Special City Events. (Commission dinner, Holiday party, City picnic).    Council discussion ensued.     Action:  On motion by C. Rianda, seconded by C. Warden and approved unanimously by show of hands to approve holding the Commission dinner in early spring before reappointments, and to present Resolutions of Appreciation for milestone years 5/10/15 to the Commissioners; and for the Holiday Party: Commissioners invited, recognition of Councilmembers for length of service.           MATTERS OF COUNCIL INTEREST/CLARIFICATION             Discussion and direction regarding Slope Density on   unsubdivided lots City-Wide. (Hahn)       C.Hahn asked the City Council if they would like to implement HRO Slope Density standards Citywide.   C. Wright thought they were looking at the zoning issues piecemeal. He would rather have a more integrative process.   C. Cook was concerned about how this would fit into the workplan for staff.   Community Development Director stated that between the Planning Commission and the City Council they were currently working on approximately half a dozen zoning amendments.   C. Wright stated he would prefer to consider zoning amendments in a more integrative process.   Council decided 4/1 (Wright, No) to consider this item.

I-90.  As part of the wetland mitigation plan, a  depleted sand and gravel pit, formerly operated by Pine Hill  Materials Corp., and located northeast of the intersection  of Siehl and Crittenden Roads, will be developed into a  13.98 acre created wetland to be associated with 35 acres of  protected upland at that location.  Under the wetland  mitigation plan, there will also be 9 acres of wetland  enhancement and 168 acres of wetland protection.  Additionally, a trash rack would be constructed in Dorsch  Creek upstream of Crittenden Road.  At the end of the  projects assumed 75 year life, the mine will be reclaimed  as two connected lakes totaling about 300 acres.       The Department has prepared a Draft  State Pollutant  Discharge Permit, SPDES No. NY0002914, and made a tentative  determination to approve this application for modification  of an existing discharge of 4.0 million gallons per day  (MGD) average and 14.0 MGD Maximum of stormwater to Dorsch  Creek, Class C(T), a protected trout stream.       The NYS Department of Environmental  Conservation, as Lead  Agency, has accepted a Draft Environmental Impact Statement  (DEIS) for the County Line Stone Co.,Inc., Akron Quarry  Expansion.  Complete DEIS and application packages are  available for review at the NYS Department of Environmental  Conservation Office at 270 Michigan Avenue, Buffalo,  New York 14203 (contact person listed below) and at the  Departments Allegany Sub-Office located at 182 East Union  Street, Allegany, New York 14706 (contact Mr. Michael  Meyers, telephone 716/372-0645).  Copies can also be  inspected during business hours at the Town of Newstead,  Town Hall in Akron and the Akron Denio Library, 33 Main  Street, Akron, NY, open on Monday and Wednesdays from 10  A.M. - 8 P.M., Tuesday 10A.M. - 6 P.M. and Friday 10 A.M. -  5P.M., while appointments can be made to view the documents  at County Line Stone, 4515 Crittenden Road, during business  hours by contacting Mr. Bruce Buyers at 716/542-5435.
