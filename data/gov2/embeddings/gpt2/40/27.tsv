This is a gain of one seat since the 2002 general election due to one woman being elected in a special election. This is a loss of four seats from the 2002* legislative session when 59 (29.4%) legislators were women. The historic high of women in the Legislature was reached in 1998* when women held 62 (30.8%) seats. The high for a general election was 61 (30.3%) women elected to the Legislature in 1996. In the House of Representatives, women hold 32 (23.9%) of the 134 seats. This is a loss of two seats from the 2002* legislative session when 34 (25.4%) representatives were women. The historic high of women serving in the House was reached in 1998* when women held 40 (29.9%) seats. The high for a general election was 39 (29.1%) women elected to the House in 1996.

GX067-37-14121243	"U.S. House Urged to Support Mass Transit for its Employees  Feb. 28, 1997  More than 1,000 employers in the Washington Metropolitan Area encourage their employees to use mass transit, and now Oregon Congressman Earl Blumenauer wants the U.S. House of Representatives to do the same thing.    A bill introduced Wednesday by Blumenauer would enable members of the U.S. House of Representatives to use their current office funds to provide $21 transit passes to their employees who use either Metro or some other system, as long as they dont have a House parking permit. There would be no additional expense with the bill.    Encouraging House employees to use Metro and other regional mass transit helps the environment by reducing air pollution, as well as reducing traffic on the districts roads. At the same time, many employers think its a nice thing to do for their employees.    ""Transit passes work, and theyre great for morale,"" said Blumenauer.    Across the nation, private businesses supply their employers with public transportation passes. Here in the Washington, D.C. area 745 Bell Atlantic employees are among the many businesses who participate in such programs.    Blumenauers bill would also make workers in each Representatives Home District would also be eligible for transit passes.    ""Employees here, and in every district, will be able to contribute to the livability of their communities by taking mass transit,"" Blumenauer said.    Prior to becoming a Congressman, Blumenauer was a city commissioner in Portland, Oregon. While there Blumenauer helped establish a transit pass program for city employees, and saw immediate benefits.    ""We found that transit pass programs decreased demand for parking, helped clean the air, and decreased congestion,"" said Blumenauer.    Other Congressional employees, including workers at the U.S. Senate, Congressional Budget Office and office of the Architect of the Capitol are already eligible for such programs, and almost 2,000 participate. Senate employees have been eligible for the program since 1992, and their $21 transit pass was the model for Blumenauers proposed legislation. Whether or not to participate is up to each individual office, as it would be in the House under Blumenauers bill.    ""When we are asking employers across the country to step forward in the fight for clean air, we in the House must be prepared to do our part, and to help our employees.    Original co-sponsors of the bill include many local representatives, including Del. Eleanor Holmes Norton, and Reps. Connie Morella and Albert Wynn of Maryland."
GX067-29-7513015	"Blumenauer To Continue to Fight for Passage of the House Transit Pass Resolution      June 26, 1998      Congressman Earl Blumenauers effort to bring the House of Representatives into a popular mass transit program came close to passing today, but at the last moment fell victim to a parliamentary maneuver and was blocked from passing as part of major appropriations bill.   Blumenauers measure, which is sponsored by a majority of his colleagues, would have established for the House of Representatives an optional mass transit incentive program financed entirely out of existing funds.   The Senate, over 120 federal agencies, and over 1,000 private businesses in the Washington D.C. metropolitan area, and many more in cities across the nation, already use similar programs to encourage the use of public transit by their employees.   ""It would have been nice to pass the transit measure today, because it does so much for the livability of our community.  Since it didnt happen, Im now picking up where I left off -- building support until we get this done,"" the Oregon Congressman said.  ""Offering an incentive to get people out of their cars and onto public transportation is the right thing to do, both economically and environmentally, which is precisely why I will continue pushing for the passage of this resolution.""   Blumenauers bill,  H. Res. 37, was amended last week into the Houses own budget bill for next year, the Legislative Branch Appropriation bill for FY 99.  It was approved overwhelming by the House Appropriations Committee. Today, however, when the Legislative Branch Appropriation Bill was brought to the House floor, the transit incentive provision was struck from the bill on a parliamentary maneuver by Congressman Bill Thomas, chairman of the House Oversight Committee.   Under House rules, Members of Congress can provide a tax-free parking benefit of roughly $124 a month to employees who drive, but are specifically prevented by House rules from providing an incentive to use public transportation.  The Blumenauer proposal provides an optional incentive program for a $21 a month transit pass that can be used on 68 transit systems in the Washington D.C. metropolitan area as well as public transportation systems in many cities else where.  The cost of the pass will come out existing budgets of House offices, at no additional expense to the Houses overall budget."
GX001-10-2816967	"Home Federal Policy Pending Legislation                     Pending Stem Cell Research and Cloning Legislation   Background   In November 1998, two different groups of scientists reported the successful isolation and culturing of human embryonic stem cells. Generally referred to as pluripotent stem cells, these cells have the ability to develop into most of the specialized cells or tissues in the human body and can divide for indefinite periods in culture. Because these cells can give rise to many different types of cells, such as muscle cells, nerve cells, heart cells, blood cells, and others, they are enormously important to science and hold great promise for advances in health care.   The establishment of human pluripotent stem cell lines represents a major step forward in human biology. This advance has generated interest among scientists, the public, and patients and their advocates, especially with regard to the ethical issues related to stem cell research.   The Clinton Administration published guidelines governing the use of human embryonic stem cells in the Federal Register on August 23, 2000. On April 25, 2001, a scheduled review of pending grant applications was postponed to provide President George W. Bush and his new Administration an opportunity to review the issue. On August 9, 2001, President Bush issued a long-awaited decision on stem cell research. He authorized funding of stem cell research using existing pluripotent stem cell lines that were derived from human embryos before August 9. Such research is eligible for Federal funding if the following criteria are met: 1) there must have been informed consent of the donors, 2) the embryos must have been created for reproductive purposes and in excess of clinical need, 3) there must not have been any financial inducements to the donors, and 4) the embryos must not have been created for research purposes. During fiscal year (FY) 2002, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) funded the first grants to conduct human embryonic stem cell research, including both new grants and supplements to existing grants.   House Bills - 108th Congress   H.R. 534—Human Cloning Prohibition Act of 2003  On February 27, 2003, the House voted 241 to 155 in favor of H.R. 534, the Human Cloning Prohibition Act of 2003. H.R. 534 would prohibit both reproductive and therapeutic cloning, and includes a criminal penalty of up to 10 years for violation of the provisions of the bill. A less restrictive substitute measure offered by Representative Jim Greenwood (R-PA), which would have prohibited reproductive cloning only, failed by a vote of 231 to 174.   HR 534 was introduced on February 5, 2003, by Representative Dave Weldon (R-FL). The was reported favorably by the House Committee on the Judiciary with a vote of 19 to 12 on February 12.   H.R. 801—Cloning of Humans  On February 13, 2003, Representative Jim Greenwood (R-PA) introduced H.R. 801, a bill to amend the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act with respect to the cloning of humans, and for other purposes. Although the text of the bill is not available, it is reported that it would prohibit reproductive cloning but permit therapeutic cloning. The bill was referred to the House Committee on Energy and Commerce.   H.R. 916—Human Cloning Research Prohibition Act  On February 25, 2003, Representative Cliff Stearns (R-FL) introduced H.R. 916, the Human Cloning Research Prohibition Act. The intent of the bill is to prohibit the expenditure of Federal funds to conduct or support research on human cloning. The bill would require the Director of the National Science Foundation to contract with the National Research Council for a review of the implementation of the Act. H.R. 916 would also express the sense of Congress that other countries should establish similar provisions. The bill was referred to the House Committees on Energy and Commerce and on Science.   H.R. 938—Human Cloning Prevention Act of 2003  On February 26, 2003, Representative Ron Paul (R-TX) introduced H.R. 938, the Human Cloning Prevention Act of 2003. The bill would prohibit any Federal agency from making any grant, contract, or other payment to any entity that ""within the past year has engaged in human cloning."" The phrase ""human cloning"" is defined to include somatic cell nuclear transfer technology for the purpose of deriving stem cells. The bill was referred to the House Committee on Energy and Commerce.    108th Congress, Senate Bills   S. 245—Human Cloning Prohibition Act of 2003  On January 29, 2003, Senator Sam Brownback (R-KS) introduced S. 245, the Human Cloning Prohibition Act of 2003. The bill would prohibit both therapeutic and reproductive cloning, and is similar to H.R. 234, introduced by Representative Dave Weldon (R-FL). The bill was referred to the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions.   S. 303—Human Cloning Ban and Stem Cell Research Protection Act of 2003  On February 5, 2003, Senator Arlen Specter (R-PA) introduced S. 303, the Human Cloning Ban and Stem Cell Research Protection Act of 2003. The bill would prohibit reproductive cloning but would specifically permit therapeutic cloning, as long as certain ethical requirements are met.   107th Congress  Stem Cell Research   H.R. 2059/S. 723, H.R. 2096/S. 1349, H. Con. Res. 17, H.R. 2747, H.R. 2838, H.R. 2863, and H.R. 4011  The Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services (HHS) and Education (Senator Tom Harkin [D-IA], Chairman) held four hearings on the issue during the 107th Congress—July 18, 2001; August 1, 2001; October 31, 2001; and September 25, 2002. The July 18 hearing focused on the release of a comprehensive report prepared by NIH that described the current state of the science on stem cells derived from human embryos, fetal tissue, and adult tissue. In addition, several Senators holding pro-life views testified in support of stem cell research. The August 1 hearing focused on intellectual property issues and ethical issues. The October 31 hearing focused on testimony from the various derivers of the existing stem cell lines. The September 25 hearing was held to provide the new Director of NIH with an opportunity to update the Subcommittee on the implementation of the President's stem cell decision by NIH, and to hear from researchers on their efforts to obtain the eligible stem cell lines listed in the NIH Stem Cell Registry. The Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee (Senator Edward M. Kennedy [D-MA], Chairman) held one hearing on this topic on September 5, 2001. The hearing focused on the quality and viability of the existing stem cell lines. The Secretary of HHS, Tommy G. Thompson, testified.   The House was not particularly active on this issue as a body. The House Committee on Government Reform Subcommittee on Criminal Justice, Drug Policy and Human Resources held one hearing on this issue on July 17, 2001, which focused on testimony from individuals who had adopted frozen embryos from in vitro fertilization clinics.   H.R. 2059 and S. 723, the Stem Cell Research Act of 2001, were introduced by Representative Jim McDermott (D-WA) and Senators Arlen Specter (R-PA) and Harkin, respectively, to amend the Public Health Service Act to provide for human embryonic stem cell generation and research.   H.R. 2096 and S. 1349, the Responsible Stem Cell Research Act of 2001, were introduced by Representative Christopher H. Smith (R-NJ) and Senator John Ensign (R-NV), respectively, to require the Secretary of HHS to maintain a stem cell donor bank containing stem cells derived from adult tissue, placentas, and umbilical cord blood.   H. Con. Res. 17 was introduced by Representative Carolyn Maloney (D-NY) to express the Sense of Congress regarding pluripotent stem cell research.  H.R. 2747 was introduced by Representative Diana L. DeGette (D-CO) to codify the Clinton Administration's guidelines governing research using human pluripotent stem cells.   H.R. 2838 was introduced by Representative Juanita Millender-McDonald (D-CA) to require NIH to conduct human embryonic stem cell research and repeal the Human Embryo Research Ban contained within the Labor, HHS, and Education Appropriations Act.   H.R. 2863 was introduced by Representative McDermott to require the establishment of an additional Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Advisory Committee to make recommendations on the field of cell development, including human embryonic stem cell research and therapeutic cloning.   H.R. 4011 was introduced by Representative Maloney to establish a Stem Cell Research Board within the legislative branch to conduct research on the effects of the President's August 9, 2001, stem cell policy.   While no further action on this legislation occurred during the 107th Congress, stem cell research continues to be a source of considerable controversy and discussion within Congress. As many predicted, there was considerable debate on this issue when the Senate considered H.R. 3061, the Departments of Labor, HHS, Education, and Related Agencies Appropriation Act of 2002. Rather than passing new legislation, most Members of Congress appeared willing to accept the President's policy and await the results of its implementation before determining whether any specific legislative remedies were needed. It is possible, however, that if the 108th Congress considers the Labor, HHS, Education, and Related Agencies Appropriations bill this spring, rather than one omnibus spending bill, stem cell amendments may be added. It is also possible that Members of Congress who have been active on this issue, such as Senator Specter and Senator Sam Brownback (R-KS), will introduce legislation to either expand or limit the President's policy. Given comments by the Senate majority leader during debate on the Labor, HHS, Education, and Related Agencies appropriations bill, it is possible that Senator Specter's bill will be the subject of debate when the Senate considers this issue again in spring 2003.   The Senate Report to the FY 2003 Labor, HHS, Education, and Related Agencies Appropriations bill currently contains language that would 1) require DHHS to submit a report to Congress explaining how the Agency plans to encourage more stem cell grant applications and make more stem cell lines available to researchers, 2) encourage NIH to expand the stem cell registry to include more detailed information regarding the availability and characteristics of the existing lines, and 3) encourage NIH to consider developing a stem cell repository.   Provisions of the Legislation/Impact on NIH   S. 723/H.R. 2059—Stem Cell Research Act of 2001  These bills would have permitted the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) to fund both the derivation and use of human pluripotent stem cells. Section 2 of the bills would have added a new section (489C) to the Public Health Service Act, which would have stipulated the following:     Notwithstanding any other provision of law, ""the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) may only conduct, support, or fund research on, or utilizing, human embryos for the purpose of generating embryonic stem cells and utilizing stem cells that have been derived from embryos in accordance with this section"" (Section 489C).    The only embryos that may be used for such activities are ""those embryos that otherwise would be discarded that have been donated from in-vitro fertilization clinics with the written informed consent of the progenitors.""    The research involved shall not result in the creation of human embryos.   The research involved shall not result in the reproductive cloning of a human being.   Any person receiving Federal funds would be prohibited from knowingly acquiring or transferring embryos for ""valuable consideration."" Valuable consideration would not include reasonable payments associated with transportation, transplantation, processing, preservation, quality control, or storage.   The Secretary of HHS would be required to develop guidelines that would ""expand on the rules governing human embryonic stem cell research to include rules that govern the derivation of stem cells from donated embryos under this section.""      H.R. 2096/S. 1349—Responsible Stem Cell Research Act of 2001  These bills would have required the Secretary of HHS to establish a stem cell donor bank containing stem cells derived from umbilical cord blood, placental tissue, and adult tissues. The bills contained the following key provisions:     The Secretary of HHS would have been required to establish and maintain by contract a National Stem Cell Donor Bank for the purpose of seeking and preserving donations of ""qualifying human stem cells"" and shall make such donated cells available for biomedical research and therapeutic purposes   ""Qualifying stem cells"" were defined as human cells obtained from human placentas, umbilical cord blood, organs or tissues of a living or deceased human being who has been born, or organs or tissues of unborn human offspring who died of natural causes (such as spontaneous abortion).   The bills would have authorized appropriations of $30 million for FY 2002 and such sums as may be necessary for each of the FYs 2003 through 2006 for NIH to conduct and support research using qualifying human stem cells.      H. Con. Res. 17—Support for Pluripotent Stem Cell Research     H. Con. Res. 17 would have expressed the ""Sense of the Congress supporting Federal funding of pluripotent stem cell research.""       H.R. 2747—Stem Cell Research for Patient Benefit Act of 2001  The bill would have codified the NIH guidelines for research using human pluripotent stem cells. The bill contained the following key provisions:     The Director of NIH would have been required to conduct or support research using human pluripotent stem cells from embryos and fetal tissue in accordance with the NIH guidelines published in the Federal Register on August 25, 2000   The Director of NIH would have been required to conduct a study on the current state of knowledge regarding stem cells derived from embryos, fetal tissue, and adult tissues.    The Institute of Medicine would have been required to conduct a study on the current state of knowledge regarding therapies, including somatic cell nuclear transfer and therapies using pharmaceuticals, that may be used to address immunologic rejection of stem cells and differentiated cells and tissue derived from stem cells.   A Biomedical Advisory Commission would have been established, with members appointed by Congress, to conduct studies and make recommendations regarding bioethical issues arising from research on human biology and the applications of such research.      H.R. 2838—New Century Health Advantage Act  The bill contained the following key provisions:     The Director of NIH would have been required to conduct or support research using human pluripotent stem cells derived from excess embryos created for purposes of fertility treatment and in excess of clinical need.   Section 510 of the FY 2001 Labor, HHS, and Education Appropriations Act, which prohibits certain research involving human embryos, would have been repealed.      H.R. 2863—Cell Development Research Act of 2001  The bill contained the following key provision:     A Cell Development Advisory Panel would have been created to provide recommendations to the FDA regarding the field of cell development, including human embryonic stem cell research and therapeutic cloning.      H.R. 4011—Science of Stem Cell Research Act  The bill would have established a Stem Cell Research Board within the legislative branch to conduct research on the effects of the President's August 9, 2001, stem cell policy. The bill contained the following key provisions:     A bipartisan commission to be known as the Stem Cell Research Board would have been established in the legislative branch.    The Board would have been required to conduct research on the effects of the President's August 9 stem cell policy, including the progress in advances in curing certain diseases, and all aspects of the NIH funding process for both embryonic and adult stem cell research.   The Board would have been required to make recommendations to Congress regarding any changes in legislation that may be warranted to reduce any inefficiencies in Federal funding of human embryonic stem cell research.   The Board would have included members appointed by the President, Speaker of the House, minority leader of the House, and majority and minority leaders of the Senate. There was no specification in the bill that any of the members be individuals with scientific expertise.      Status and Outlook  On April 5, 2001, Senator Specter introduced S. 723, the Stem Cell Research Act of 2001. The bill had 18 cosponsors and was referred to the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee. A series of amendments to the bill were also referred to the Committee in June and July.

The procedure would be similar in format to the procedure already set forth in the Charter to fill vacancies in the Offices of Public Advocate, Comptroller, Borough President and City Council member, except that in the special election for the Office of the Mayor, where no candidate receives forty percent or more of the vote, the two candidates receiving the most votes would advance to a run-off election to be held on the second Tuesday following the special election. Pending the result of the election, the Publi c Advocate would act as Mayor. In order to implement the proposal consistent with State law, this proposal  would confer upon the Speaker of the City Council the responsibility to preside over meetings of the City Council, instead of the Public Advocate ha ving that duty. The Public Advocate would remain a nonvoting member of the City Council, and have all other powers arising from that position. This proposal would take effect immediately, and would apply to vacancies in the Office of the Mayor occurring after September 20, 2002.  1   PART II Introduction A. Overview of the Charter Revision Process The New York City Charter is the basic document that defines the organization, power, functions and essential procedures and policies of City government. As a ""short form"" charter, it sets forth the institutions and processes of the City's political system and defines the authority and responsibilities of elected officials --the Mayor, Council, Comptroller, Borough Presidents, and Public Advocate --and City agencies in broad strokes, while leaving the details of operation to local law and agency rulemaking. Unlike the United States Constitution, which is amended rarely, the City's Charter is a fluid document that is amended often. Indeed, while the U.S. Constitution has been amended only 27 times in its 215 year history, the Charter has been amended more than 100 times since 1989. In the United States, city governments receive their legal authority from the states in which they are located. In the State of New York, municipalities have broad authority to structure how they operate by virtue of the Home Rule provisions of the State Constitution and the Municipal Home Rule Law. The City's Charter, along with the State Constitution, the Municipal Home Rule Law and othe r State statutes, provides the legal framework within which it may conduct its affairs. Under State law, charter revision may occur as an ongoing process through the passage of local laws. There are limitations on that authority. For example, there can be no curtailment of powers of an elected official. A charter can also be revised  pursuant to a State or City charter revision commission, which has the authority to put 2   proposals before the voters. A charter revision commission may put proposals before the voters regarding all elements of a charter, including the curtailment of powers of an elected official, as well as provisions that could also be adopted through local law. Municipal Home Rule Law (""MHRL"")  36(4) permits the Mayor to establish a ""charter commission"" in New York City. The composition of a mayoral charter commission must consist of nine to fifteen members. The members must be City residents and may hold other public offices or employment. The Mayor designates the chair, vice-chair and secretary of the commission pursuant to MHRL  36(4) and (6)(d). Charter commissions are not permanent commissions. MHRL  36(6)(e) limits the term of a charter commission. A commission expires on the day of the election at which a proposed new charter or amendments prepared by a commission are submitted to the voters. However, if a commission fails to submit a new charter or any  amendments to the voters, the commission expires on the day of the second general election following the commission's creation. There are no prohibitions against the reappointment of a commission or appointment of a new commission upon the expiration of an existing commission. A charter commission may propose a broad set of amendments that essentially ""overhauls"" the entire cha rter, or may narrowly focus upon certain areas and explain why such an approach is preferable in a report to the public. MHRL  36(5)(a); see Matter of Cruz v. Deierlein, 84 N.Y.2d 890, 892-893 (1994). The proposed amendments must be consistent with general State laws and can only effect changes that are otherwise within the City's local legislative powers as set forth in the State Constitution and the MHRL.  3   The proposed amendments must be filed with the City Clerk for action by the voters no later than the second general election after the commission's creation, and must be voted on at a general or special election held at least sixty days after the filing. The proposed amendments may be submitted to voters as one question, or a series of questions or alternatives. MHRL  36(5)(b).  B.  The Commission's Membership In July 2002, Mayor Michael R.

They are as follows . Anthony Crowell, Co-Executive Director, has been a City attorney for five years including having served in the Division of Legal Counsel at the New York City Law Department. He served as General Counsel and staff counsel to the 2001 and 1999 Charter Revision Commissions.

An attorney, he has served as an Adjunct Professor at Fordham University.  9   Howard Friedman, General Counsel, has been a City attorney for 7 years, serving currently as Senior Counsel at the Law Department. He has served as staff counsel to the 1999 and 2001 Charter Revision Commissions. He ha s extensive City legal experience and has served in executive level capacities at the Loft Board. He also served as a Legal Aid attorney. Other members of the staff are from the City's Law Department (which is a professional, independent law office that has represented, among others, the Mayor, the Public Advocate, the Comptroller, and the City Council), the Departments of Finance, Probation, Parks and Recreation and City Planning, the Business Integrity Commission and the Mayor's Office. They include: Deputy General Counsel Elisabeth Palladino; Special Counsels Dara Jaffee and Florence Hutner; Assistant General Counsels Mark Tyler and Coleen Chin; Research Director Anne Fitzgibbon; Community Affairs Director Sara Vidal; Deputy Research Directors Eathan Davidson, Owen Stone, and John Mattera ; Analyst Talya Sheinkman; and Administrative Aides Renee Wortham, Ivonne Sierra and Oscar Camacho.

Special thanks are extended to Francis Barry, a researcher from the NYU Taub Urban Research Center, and former staffer of the City's Campaign Finance Board, who prepared for the Commission detailed abstracts of the scholarship on nonpartisan elections, and provided great ins ight into the relationship between nonpartisan elections, term limits and the City's campaign finance system.  10   D.  Scope of Review On July 25, 2002, the Commission held its initial public meeting. At that meeting,  Commission staff provided an orientation to the Commission members on the Charter, the process of Charter revision and the range of issues addressed by the previous three Charter Revision Commissions: the 1998 Powers Commission, and the 1999 and 2001 Mastro Commissions. Among the numerous issues addressed by those Commissions, all three of them studied the issues of mayoral succession and nonpartisan elections. At that initial meeting, the Commission Chair directed staff to review the entire Charter. Further, he asked staff to review the prelimi nary and final reports of the 1998, 1999 and 2001 Charter Revision Commissions, and Commission member and public inquiries, comments and proposals. Finally, he requested that the staff draft preliminary options reports on the topics of nonpartisan electio ns and mayoral succession, and provide summaries of other proposals submitted by City agencies and the public. At the August 6, 2002, public meeting, the staff presented the Commission with three reports. The first two reports were extensive in scope and provided a detailed analysis of the options for the Commission to consider on the issues of mayoral succession and nonpartisan elections. The third report presented summaries of the proposals and issues submitted to the Commission from the public and vari ous City agencies, including the Departments of Investigation, Housing Preservation and Development, Finance and Parks and Recreation, as well as the Conflicts of Interest Board and the Office of Administrative Trials and Hearings. The staff reports were released to the public and posted on the Commission's website for public review and comment.  11   Between August 13 and 22, 2002, the Commission held a series of expert briefings and public hearings concerning the options and proposals in all five boroughs. 1  Both expert briefings and public hearings were held on August 13, 2002 in Brooklyn, August 15, 2002 in Queens, August 20, 2002 in Staten Island, August 21, 2002 in Manhattan, and August 22, 2002 in the Bronx. On the topics of nonpartisan elections and mayo ral succession, the Commission heard expert testimony and received comments from elected officials and the public. The Commission also received proposals for changes to the Charter on a wide range of issues from City agencies and from members of the public. On August 21, 2002, the staff made a second presentation to the Commission on additional proposals submitted by agencies as well as proposals submitted by members of the public. Both the substantive and process-based comments from the public were of enormous value to the Commission in helping it determine whether to put before the voters any proposals on the November 2002 ballot. Indeed, although the Commission received substantive comments on the issues of mayoral succession and nonpartisan elections, members of the public also criticized the Commission, its process and work. Principally, these comments centered on two points: that the Commission's public hearings were held during August, a time when many people are on vacation; and the issues required further review and public comment.  1  The Queens hearing, held at LaGuardia Community College, was directly accessible by four major subway lines as well as bus lines. The Brooklyn hearing at Metro- Tech Center was within a short walk from the borough's downtown hub and accessible by eleven subway lines as well as numerous bus lines. Manhattan's public hearing at the Adam Clayton Powell State Office Building was easily reached by subway as well as by bus. The hearing at Eugenio de Hostos Community College in the Bronx was accessible both by subway and bus. The Staten Island hearing, held at the College of Staten Island, was accessible by a bus line and by car, a principal means of transportation for Staten Islanders . All of these facilities were fully handicap accessible and equipped to accommodate more than 200 persons.  12   In reviewing the substantive proposals, the Commission found that some of them could be accomplished legislatively, and therefore did not require a referendum immediately, while others required further study and comment from the public and other City agencies that also would be affected by the proposals. Although the Commission believes that many of the agency and public proposals would greatly enhance the operations of City government, it determined ultimately, at its August 23 , 2002, public meeting, that it would defer consideration of these issues, and the remaining issues in the reports of the 1999 and 2001 Commissions, to another election cycle. At the same time, the Commission determined that it would focus on the issues of mayoral succession and nonpartisan elections for possible inclusion on the ballot. After further consideration of the issues and the opinion expressed publicly by Mayor Bloomberg, the Commission concluded, at its September 3, 2002, meeting that it would defer the issue of nonpartisan elections to another election cycle to afford the public more opportunity for comment and debate on this important issue. The Commission nonetheless determined that it would put forth a proposal to the voters providing for a nonpartisan special election within sixty days of a vacancy in the Office of the Mayor which, by virtue of State law, would necessitate that the Speaker of the Council be placed in the role of presiding officer of the Council instead of the Public Advocate. The 13 member Commission unanimously approved the proposal. E. The Commission's Public Outreach and Proceedings The Commission developed its proposals for the November 2002 ballot by: (1) initiating a public outreach campaign to solicit proposals for Charter revision from the 2  2  It should be noted that Commissioner Badillo was not physically present at the meeting to vote, but cast his vote on the proposal symbolically by telephone.

The public was afforded the opportunity to submit proposals for Charter revision before the staff made its preliminary reports, and the Commission remained open to new public and City agency proposals throughout the process. Moreover, the principal issues considered by the Commission were analyzed thoroughly and made public before the Commission's final hearing and vote. As a result, the public was able to shape the Commission's agenda and critique the proposed Charter revisions. On July 22, 2002, Commission Chair Robert J. McGuire issued a ""Solicitation of Proposed Revisions to the New York City Charter."" A Notice announcing the first public hearing also was issued on July 22, 2002. On August 5, 2002, a second notice was issued with the complete listing of all upcoming public meetings and hearings . These notices were published in the City's newspapers, as well as the language newspapers of the Spanish, Chinese, Russian and Korean speaking communities. 3  The notices  3  The advertisements were placed in the New York Times, the World Journal, the Daily News, the New  14   were also published on a daily basis in the City Record, and on the Web. Finally, the notices were sent by mail to approximately 2,300 interested persons . 4  In response to  the Chair's solicitation, the Commission's staff received many letters, telephone calls and e-mails either requesting information on, or containing proposals for, Charter revision. In six weeks , from July 22 through August 30, 2002 , the re was a heavy  volume of ""hits"" on the Commission's Web-site by people seeking Commission reports, notices, and other information, checking the meeting, and hearing schedule. At the August 6, 2002 public meeting , the Commission's staff presented three reports to the Commission, entitled Preliminary Options for Mayoral Succession, Preliminary Options for Nonpartisan Elections, and City Agency and Public Proposals. Chairman McGuire stressed that the Commission was committed to reviewing the entire Charter , and encouraged the other Commissioners , the public and City agencies to continue to raise issues for possible Charter revision. Chairman McGuire further  emphasized that the Charter review process would be held in a fair and non- judgmental way and that all meetings, hearings and forums conducted by the Commission would be open to the public. The Commission held public hearings on the issues before it on August 13, 2002 in Brooklyn, August 15, 2002 in Queens, August 20, 2002 in Staten Island, August 21, 2002 in Manhattan, and August 22, 2002 in the Bronx. All of the hearings were  scheduled to begin at 7:00 p.m.. Many elected officials and members of the public, including former candidates for public office, spoke. All elected officials and members York Post, El Diario, the Korean Times, Sing Tao, Hoy, and Novoye Russkoye Slovo. 4  Interpretation in American Sign Language was provided at the first meeting and was made available for all public meetings, hearings and forums.  15   of the public were urged to limit their remarks to three minutes as a courtesy to the other speakers. Although many of the speakers spoke for more than their allotted time, all were nonetheless permitted to conclude their remarks. televised repeatedly on Crosswalks. The Commission's Chair also held briefings on August 13, 15, 20, 21 and 22, 2002, for the purpose of hearing expert testimony from many invited speakers, including experts on the Voting Rights Act implications associated with the issues of mayoral succession and nonpartisan elections, and the Justice Department's Voting Rights Act preclearance process. These experts addressed the main issues reported on by the Commission's staff and considered by the Commission. These five bri efings also were repeatedly televised on Crosswalks. On September 3, 2002, the Commission held its final public meeting and voted to propose that a single ballot question be submitted to the voters on November 5, 2002, and to issue this report . The proposal would provide for a special election to be held to fill a vacancy in the Office of the Mayor within sixty days of the vacancy, and would give the Speaker of the City Council the ceremonial role to preside over meetings of the City Council rather than the Public Advocate. The Public Advocate would remain a All of the hearings were  nonvoting member of the City Council, and have all other powers arising from that position. This proposal would take effect immediately, and would apply to vacancies in the Office of the Mayor occurri ng after September 20, 2002. The Commission asked the staff to issue , as soon after September 3, 2002, as possible, a summary of its proposals, for publication in various newspapers, including the City Record, and in foreign language papers, as required by law. It also asked the  16   staff to post this information on the Web and mail it to interested persons in English, Spanish, Chinese and Korean.  17   THE CITY IN TRANSITION: INTERIM SUCCESSION AND THE MAYORALTY PART III Proposal The Commission determined that it will place one issue before the voters on the November 5, 2002, ballot: whether Charter  10(b) should be amended to require a special election within 60 days of a mayoral vacancy, with a runoff election if no candidate receives at least 40 percent of the vote. The merits of this proposed change are clear. As detailed in Part IV(A) of this report, Charter  10(b) currently provides that, upon a permanent vacancy (i.e., failure to qualify, resignation, removal, death, or permanent inability to discharge powers and duties), the powers and duties of the Mayor devolve upon the Public Advocate, the Comptroller, or a person selected by the Council, in that order of succession, until a new Mayor is elected. If the vacancy occurs prior to September 20 in any year, it is filled at the general election of that year. If the vacancy occurs on or after September 20 in any year, it is filled at the general election held the following calendar year. The result of this provision is that, if a vacancy were to occur o n or after September 20 in any year of the Mayor's term (except the last), the interim successor (e.g., the Public Advocate) could potentially serve as Acting Mayor for more than 15 months before an elected Mayor takes office. This system contrasts sharply with the election system for filling vacancies in other elected offices, where voters are given the opportunity to elect a successor in short order.  18   The Office of the Mayor is obviously a crucial one. It is the seat of executive power in the City's gove rnmental structure and is the focal point of policies affecting the lives of City residents. As the City's chief executive officer, the Mayor is most  responsible for the effectiveness and integrity of City government and is the City's most politically accountable elected official. Providing for the prompt selection of a new  Mayor by the voters in the event of a mayoral vacancy is closely related to issues of democracy, stability, and effective government. In light of these considerations, the Commission has determined that changing Charter  10(b) to provide for a prompt election for a new Mayor is a change that is in the best interest of all New Yorkers. In addition to being good policy, such a change also appears, as set forth in Part IV(A) of this report, to be legal, and within the mainstream of practice on this topic. Furthermore, as indicated by the description of the public comment on this issue contained in Part IV(A) (particularly the comments of elected officials), a change to prompt elections is broadly accepted by the citizens of this City; there were very few dissenting voices.5 The Commission has determined, however, that the other main issue relating to mayoral succession-- which official should be first in the line of succession in the event of a vacancy--should not be placed on the ballot this year. As indicated by the  discussion in Part IV(A), there are serious arguments on both sides of the question of whether the Public Advocate should be the first in the line of succession. Furthermore, even if one were to conclude that it was more appropriate to have a different official be  5  The Public Advocate has publicly supported the institution of a sixty day special election in the succession system to the mayoralty. See below.  19   the first interim successor, the question of who that official should be (e.g., a deputy mayor) would need to be resolved. Therefore, the Commission defers a determination on this issue, and recommends that it be considered by a future Commission. The Commission also defers a determination on the other major issue it considered, the institution of nonpartisan elections. As indicated by the discussion in Part IV(B) of this report, this issue raises profound questions of representative democracy, and has raised considerable passion among the public and the members of the Commission. As with the issue of the line of mayoral succession, a cogent  argument has been made tha t nonpartisan elections would best serve the members of minority communities in the City, as well as the public in general, by allowing for a greater range of candidates and expertise to be presented to the voters. However, counter -arguments have also been made concerning the effect of nonpartisan elections on minority communities in the City, as well as the effect such elections could have on voter turnout and informed voter participation. In light of all these arguments, the  Commission has determined that this issue requires further public review and comment, and recommends that it be considered by a future Commission. 6  The Commission defers a determination on the other issues it has studied, which are set forth in Part V of this report. As stated in the Scope of Review section of Part II, the Commission has found that some of these issues could be accomplished legislatively, and therefore did not require a referendum immediately, while others required further study and comment from the public and other City agencies that also would be affected by the proposals. Although the Commission believes that many of 6  Commissioner Harry Kresky made a statement on the record regarding the decision to defer a consideration of nonpartisan elections at the Commission's September 3, 2002 public meeting. His statement is contained in Appendix I.  20   the agency and public proposals would greatly enhance the operations of City government, it determined ultimately, at its August 23, 2002, public meeting, that it would defer consideration of these issues, and the remaining issues in the reports of the 1999 and 2001 Commissions, to another election cycle. The Commission notes that it has reviewed the entire Charter. In addition to the reasons stated in connection with the issues above, the Commission has determined not to propose amendments to other sections of the Charter for several reasons. First, the Charter was extensively amended in 1989, only 13 years ago, and has been reviewed by three subsequent Charter Revision Commissions, with changes adopted by the public in 1998 and 2001. Furthermore, in light of recent events, the Commission decided to prioritize a consideration of the issue of mayoral succession, i.e., how the City should fill a mayora l vacancy. Finally, in light of the time constraints, the  Commission decided to prioritize only one other issue, i.e., nonpartisan elections.  21   PART IV(A) Mayoral Succession Issue: Should the Charter's provisions governing the filling of mayoral vacancies be revised? Relevant Charter Provisions: Mayoral succession is governed by Charter  10. Other provisions that are relevant to a discussion of mayoral succession are Charter  8(f) (mayor's power to delegate functions, power, and duties), 24 (powers of the public advocate and succession), 25 (council member election and vacancies), 81 (borough president election and vacancies), and 94 (comptroller vacancies). Discussion: 1. Introduction The issue of ""mayoral succession"" really consists of two majo r issues: who should serve as the Acting Mayor when a vacancy first occurs, and how, if at all, elections should be scheduled to choose the person or persons who will complete the remainder of the term. In considering whether to amend the Charter's mayoral  succession provisions, the Commission has reviewed the following issues:    Who should be the first in the line of succession? Who should be the next person(s) in the line of succession? If the Commission chooses not to keep the portion of the current system relating to elections, whether or not it removes the Public Advocate's office from the line of succession, should the Acting Mayor serve for the remainder of the unexpired term, or should a special election be held for someone to succeed the Acting Mayo r?  22         If a special election is provided for, should it be partisan or nonpartisan? If a special election is provided for, what should the timing of that election be (i.e., 45, 60, 90, or 120 days after the vacancy)? If a special election is provided for, should a runoff election be held if the winner of that election does not get a high enough percentage of the vote? If a runoff election is provided for, what should the trigger percentage be and how many candidates would qualify for the runoff? Does the person elected at a special election serve for the remainder of the unexpired term, or should a general election be held following the special election? If such a general election is held, should it be partisan or nonpartisan? What is the proper relationship between the choice of the person who will serve as the Acting Mayor and the choices about the election system? For example, if a Deputy Mayor would be Acting Mayor, should a special election be held more or less quickly than if it were, for example, the Public Advocate?     Elections to complete the term While the City has a consistent system for filling vacancies in almost every elected City office, the office of the Mayor is the exception. Voters are currently  empowered to fill a vacancy in any other elected office by, in the usual circumstance, special election within 45 days of the vacancy. 7  The City now has over a decade of  experience with these special elections, which were established by the 1988 Charter Revision Commission. Section 10(b) of the Charter currently provides that, upon a permanent vacancy (i.e., failure to qualify, resignation, removal, death, or permanent inability to discharge powers and duties), the powers and duties of the Mayor devolve upon the Public Advocate, the Comptroller, or a person selected by the Council, in that order of  7  Regarding succession to the office of the Public Advocate, see footnote 17.  23   succession, until a new Mayor is elected. If the vacancy occurs prior to September 20 in any year, it is filled at the general election of that year. If the vacancy occurs on or after September 20 in any year , it is filled at the general election held the following calendar year.8 The result of this provision is that, if a vacancy were to occur on or after September 20 in any year of the Mayor's term (except the last), the interim successor (e.g., the Public Advocate) could potentially serve as Acting Mayor for more than 15 months before an elected Mayor takes office. This system contrasts sharply with the election system for filling vacancies in other elected offices, where voters are given the opportunity to elect a successor in short order. The office of the Mayor is crucial. It is the seat of executive power in the City's governmental structure and the focal point of policies affecting the lives of City residents. As the City's chief executive officer, the Mayor is most responsible for the effectiveness and integrity of City government and is the City's most politically accountable elected official. Providing for the prompt selection of a new Mayor by the voters in the event of a mayoral vacancy appears closely related to issues of democracy, stability, and effective government. 9  Who should serve as Acting Mayor pending an election? The other major issue is whether the Public Advocate should remain first in line to be interim successor to the Mayor. As identified by the staff and as reflected in public comment to this Commission, there are benefits and drawbacks to having the Public 8 9  The person elected at a general election would then serve until the end of the original mayoral term. A special election to select an interim Mayor within 90 days of the vacancy has been suggested by The New York Times (Editorial, July 9, 2002). In a subsequent editorial, the Times stated that ""[i]t makes sense to shorten the time to three months when voters can choose a mayoral replacement."" (Editorial, August 17, 2002). Furthermore, as described below, there appears to be widespread support for the idea of changing the Charter to provide for the prompt election of a new Mayor. For example, Betsy Gotbaum, the Public Advocate, has supported such a change.  24   Advocate be the first interim successor. The benefits are that the office of the Public Advocate is an elected office and has a Citywide constituency. The drawbacks are that, in the event of a vacancy, particularly in times of crisis, the Public Advocate would often be someone who lacked sufficient executive knowledge of the City's operations to ensure stability in the City, simply because the day-to-day role played by the Public Advocate is that of ombudsperson. 2. Background and History For over 25 years charter revision commissions have considered the issue of mayoral succession. The 1989 Charter Revision Commission's discussions on  succession are particularly relevant to the issue of who the first successor should be, because that Commission had to address the issue within the larger context of the abolition of the Board of Estimate (""the Board"") and its replacement with the City government structure we have today. For most of this century, the Board was the most powerful and important governing body of the City. At the time of its abolition in 1989, the Board was  comprised of eight members: the Mayor, the City Council President, and the Comptroller, each of whom had two votes, and the five Borough Presidents, each of whom had one vote. Membership on the Board was the most significant source of power for the office of the Council President. The Board exercised authority over some of the City's most important functions and responsibilities. It participated in the budget process, granted leases of City  property, and maintained final authority over the use, development and improvement of City land, including through zoning regulations. It also had final approval of all capital  25   projects and City contracts that were not awarded through competitive sealed bids. While the Council had the power to pass local laws and participate in the budget process, and the Mayor was responsible for implementing the City's programs, the Board possessed authority over important policy decisions that affected the City on a daily basis. In 1989, however, the United States Supreme Court, in Board of Estimate v. Morris, 489 U.S. 688 (1989), declared the Board's voting scheme unconstitutional, holding that it violated the principle of ""one person, one vote."" Because Borough  Presidents held equal amounts of power on the Board, the Court held that residents of some less populous boroughs, such as State n Island, were over-represented, while residents of relatively more populous boroughs, such as Brooklyn, were underrepresented. The Court ordered the City either to reorganize the Board or abolish it. Between March 22 and August 2, 1989, the 1989 Charte r Revision Commission worked to comply with the Court's ruling. The 1989 Charter Revision Commission proposed to abolish the Board and create a new governance structure for the City that would receive the Board's powers. The Commission wanted to continue the City's tradition of a strong mayoralty and, therefore, it transferred many of the Board's functions to the Mayor. The Commission also decided that the Council, as the legislative branch, should be the primary check on the mayoralty. The Commission expanded the Council's membership from 35 to 51 members, and granted it power to approve the budget and authority over land use decisions.  26   The 1989 Commission continued the offices of the Comptroller and the Borough Presidents but with significantly different powers than they had enjoyed by virtue of their seats on the Board. The Comptroller retained certain executive - like functions including the duty to audit every City agency at least once every four years. Borough Presidents lost a significant amount of power with the end of the Board, but retained appointment powers with respect to community boards and were given some control over funding for their boroughs. The City Council President's role in government underwent a major transformation as a result of the 1989 Charter revision, which eliminated the Board of Estimate and, of course, the Council President's votes on the Board. Like the Mayor and Comptroller, the Council President enjoyed two votes on the Board and thus had the ability to exercise significant influence over budgetary issues, land use decisions, approval of contracts, and zoning regulation changes. The duties of the Council  President outside of the Board, however, were limited. As the Council's presiding officer, the Council President could cast a vote to break a tie but was not permitted to vote under any other circumstance. The Vice-Chair of the Council (predecessor to the position of the Speaker) was the person who effectively led the Council, not the Council President. Although the Council President had little input regarding the day-to-day workings of the legislative body, he was the immediate successor to the mayoralty. This  arrangement was rational because the Council President had the same number of votes on the Board as the Mayor and was involved in the day-to-day executive decisions of the Board.  27   With the elimination of the Board came a heated debate over whether to redefine the Council President's responsibilities or whether instead to eliminate that office altogether. It is widely understood that the 1989 Commission ultimately retained that office as part of a political compromise: certain Commissioners did not want thenCouncil President Andrew Stein to be ousted from City government. Indeed,  Commission Chair Frederick A. O. Schwarz, Jr. has since acknowledged that the office was kept, in part, to keep the Commission's majority coalition from falling apart; he noted that this issue aroused ""puzzling passion."" 10  In the 1989 Commission's ""Summary of Final Proposals,"" the Council President is described as ""the city's `Public Advocate' . . . charged with receiving, investigating and attempting to resolve individual citizen complaints.""11 The Public Advocate has  been described as the country's only elected ombudsman.12 In 1993, the City Council passed Local Law 19, officially changing the title of that office from ""President of the Council"" to ""Public Advocate."" In passing that law, the Council acknowledged that ""the most important duty of the President of the City Council is to serve as the public advocate for the citizens of New York City."" 13  In short, it appears that while the provision empowering the Council President, now the Public Advocate, to succeed to the mayoralty has remained constant, the nature of the Public Advocate's office has been radically transformed, and now bears little resemblance to that of its predecessor under the Board of Estimate system.  10  Frederick A.

Review by Previous Commissions  Both the 1999 and the 2001 Charter Revision Commissions reviewed the issue of mayoral succession. These Commissions analyzed different options for an  appropriate interim successor in the event of a mayoral vacancy as well as the need to hold a special election following the vacancy. 1999 Charter Revision Commission The 1999 Commission reviewed whether the Charter's provisions for filling mayoral vacancies should be amended to provide for a special election or a different successor or both. In its report to the Commission, issued July 22, 1999, the staff analyzed these issues, considering facto rs such as the need for stability and continuity in the event of a vacancy, succession systems in major cities throughout New York State and the country, and the legal issues implicated by a change in the City's mayoral succession system. One such legal issue was the question of whether a change to a system of special elections to fill mayoral vacancies would violate the federal Voting Rights Act. The Commission retained Dr. Allan J. Lichtman, Chair of the History Department at American University and a no ted voting rights expert, to provide a detailed analysis of this issue. Dr. Lichtman ultimately concluded that there was no evidence that special elections for Citywide offices would disadvantage minority voters or result in relatively larger reductions in minority voter turnout. Based on this and other expert testimony, the 1999 Commission concluded that its proposal for filling mayoral vacancies with special elections would not violate the Voting Rights Act. 14  14  This Commission also retained Dr. Lichtman to study this issue. As described below, Dr. Lichtman has concluded that the use of special elections with a runoff provision for filling mayoral vacancies would not  29   The Commission's ultimate proposal regarding special elections, contained in its September 1, 1999, final report, provided, in essence, that a nonpartisan special election would be held within 45 days after the occurrence of a vacancy, with a runoff election held if no candidate received at least 40 percent of the vote. A partisan general election would then be held to fill the remainder of the unexpired term. In addition to the special elections issue, the 1999 Commission also analyzed options regarding who could serve as the interim successor to the Mayor in the event of a vacancy. The offices of Public Advocate, Comptroller, Council Speaker, a (newly created) Vice Mayor, and Deputy Mayor were identified as possible successors. The Commission concluded, however, that it would not propose any chang e to the line of succession. The issue of mayoral succession received much public comment. A summary of the comments that were received by the Commission is attached in Appendix D.  2001 Charter Revision Commission The 2001 Charter Revision Commission als o considered the issue of mayoral succession. Ultimately, while the Commission stated that the City should adopt special elections to fill mayoral vacancies and should remove the Public Advocate from the line of succession, it concluded that such Charter reform should not be proposed to the voters ""on the eve of elections for every citywide office."" A summary of the public comment on succession issues received by the 2001 Commission is attached in Appendix D.  violate the Voting Rights Act.  30   4.  Succession in Other Major Cities  A comparison of the mayoral succession provisions for other cities in New York State and across the United States shows the wide variety of approaches cities have taken to address the issue of succession to the mayoralty. Other Cities in New York Under General City Law  2-a(1), where the mayor and the presiding officer of the local legislative body are elected at the same time, for the same term, by the electors of the entire city, the presiding officer becomes mayor for the remainder of the term in the event of a vacancy. As discussed below, New York City's existing mayoral succession provision, Charter  10(b), which differs significantly from Section 2-a(1), is given effect as a grandfathered exception to that section. See General City Law  2a(3)(b). Of the other cities in New York State described in this section, some are  governed by Section 2-a(1), while others are not so governed, because the conditions set forth in that section are not met. Albany. 15  A vacancy in the office of the Mayor is filled by the City Council President,  who serves as Mayor for the remainder of the unexpired term. Buffalo. The vacancy is filled by the City Council President for the remainder of the unexpired term. Rochester. The Council appoints a successor, who must be registered in the same party as the vacating Mayor. An interim Mayor is then elected for the remainder of the unexpired term at the next general election for which there is time to file nominating petitions. If the Council fails to appoint a successor within 30 days of the vacancy, a 15  Any change to the City's current system would require that the Charter be harmonized with General City Law  2-a(1). See discussion of State law issues, below.  31   special election must be held within 90 days of the vacancy to elect a successor to serve for the remainder of the unexpired term. As the President of the Council is  selected from among the members of the Council, the succession rule s forth in et General City Law  2 -a(1) does not apply. Syracuse. The Council President succeeds to the mayoralty for the remainder of the unexpired term. Yonkers. A vacancy in the office of the Mayor is filled by the City Council designating a deputy mayo r, commissioner, or department head as acting Mayor. A special election to fill the remainder of the term is then held 90 days after the vacancy or as soon thereafter as legally possible. If the vacancy occurs within 180 days of the regular midterm muni cipal election, the special election is held concurrently with that election. If the vacancy occurs within 180 days of a regular mayoral election, no special election is held. As the Mayor has a four - year term and the City Council President has a two - year term, the succession rule set forth in General City Law  2 -a(1) does not apply. Mayoral Succession in Other Selected United States Cities The succession provisions for major cities throughout the United States fall into three main categories: (a) cities where the mayor appoints the person who is the  successor; (b) cities where the City Council President becomes the Mayor; and (c) cities where the City Council chooses the successor. Details of the various succession  systems vary by city. Such details include the qualifications of the interim successor, whether a special election is held to fill the remainder of the term, and the length of time before such an election is held. A number of major cities throughout the U.S. hold special elections in the eve nt that a Mayor leaves office. These cities include: Atlanta, Boston, Chicago, Cincinnati, 32   Cleveland, Dallas, Denver, Kansas City, Los Angeles, Miami, Minneapolis, Philadelphia, Portland, Oregon, Orlando, Phoenix, Providence, Sacramento, San Diego, San Francisco, Seattle, Tampa, and Washington, D.C. Furthermore, many cities have  endorsed the designation of a mayoral appointee as the interim mayor. These cities include: Cleveland (Law Director), Denver (Deputy Mayor), and Cincinnati (Vice-Mayor; member of Council selected by Mayor), Houston (Mayor pro tem, member of Council nominated by the Mayor, confirmed by Council) and Kansas City (Mayor pro tem; member of Council appointed by Mayor). On the other hand, many cities take other approaches. 16  Charts summarizing various approaches taken by major U.S. cities are attached in Appendix D. 5. Related State and Federal Law Issues State Law While the options regarding changes to the mayoral succession system implicate provisions of State law, a change to the City's system appears completely consistent with State law. For example, a change to the system of mayoral succession elections to provide for prompt nonpartisan special elections, as is provided for in the Charter for vacancies in all other City elective offices, would be legal. See Charter  24 (public advocate), 25 (council members), 81 (borough presidents), and 94 (comptroller). This existing Charter procedure was upheld in City of New York v. Board of Elections , Index No. 41450/91 (Sup. Ct. New York Co.), aff'd __ A.D.2d __ (1st Dep't), lv. den. , 77 N.Y.2d 938 (1991), 16  One factor that may affect the approach a city takes is whether the city's form of government follows a ""strong mayor"" model, like New York City, or instead a ""council/city manager"" model, like Kansas City. A chart analyzing this issue is attached in Appendix D.  33   on municipal home rule grounds, against a claim that the Charter provisions were preempted by inconsistent provisions of the State Election Law. See State Constitution, Article IX; Municipal Home Rule Law  10; Election Law  1-102; and Bareham v. City of Rochester, 246 N.Y. 140 (1927). 17  Any change to the terms of mayoral succession, whether as to the interim successor or the form of elections would implicate General City Law  2-a(1). Under this provision, where a city's mayor and the presiding officer of the local legislative body are elected at the same time for the same term by the voters of the entire city, the presiding officer of the legislative body becomes the mayor for the remainder of the unexpired term. Currently, as the Public Advocate ""presides over"" the Council, Charter  24(e), and is elected at the same time as the Mayor, for the same term as the Mayor, by the voters of the entire City, the terms of Section 2-a(1) appear to apply. However, the City's current mayoral succession provision, Charter  10(b), is ""grandfathered"" as an exception to Section 2 -a(1) by General City Law  2 -a(3)(b). Because this exemption from application of the provisions of Section 2-a(1) arguably would not continue, however, after modification of any of the current mayoral succession provisions, it would be necessary to eliminate the Public Advocate's  17  It should be noted that the special election provision intended to be triggered by a vacancy in the office of Public Advocate has never been precleared by the Department of Justice. While the provision must be precleared before it can be implemented, the 1988 Charter Revision Commission recommended that State law be changed prior to the City seeking preclearance. Specifically, that Commission was concerned that General City Law (""GCL"")  2 a(2) might preempt the Charter's provisions regarding Public Advocate vacancies, because it mandates that the vice-chairman of the local le gislative body, i.e., the Speaker of the Council, becomes the presiding officer of the Council, i.e., the Public Advocate, for the remainder of the unexpired term. However, any change to the current succession system would necessitate that the Public Advocate be switched out of the now ceremonial role of presiding over the Council, see Charter  24(e). Thus, the concern of the 1988 Commission will become moot because the terms of GCL  2-a(2) would, on their face, no longer apply. See discussion of GCL  2- a(1) and 2-a(3). The provisions regarding who shall be the interim successor to the Public Advocate pending a special election, in the event of a vacancy, are therefore clarified in the proposed Charter changes.  34   ceremonial right to ""preside"" over the Council--or transfer the right to a public official who is elected on a different election cycle, or for a different term, or not by all the citizens of the City--so that the terms of Section 2-a(1) would not apply in the first place. 18  While one could, alternatively, amend the starting point of the Public  Advocate's term, so that it would not run concurrently with the term of the Mayor, this approach might create additional complications regarding, for example, the application of term limits. Under either approach, the Public Advocate's authority to introduce legislation in the Council would not need to be changed. Federal Voting Rights Act A change in the rules governing mayoral succession could arguably be considered a change in a ""standard, practice, or procedure with respect to voting."" Such a change could require the City to seek preclearance from the Justice Department pursuant to the Voting Rights Act. Under the Voting Rights Act, a State or political subdivision may not impose a ""standard, practice, or procedure . . . which results in a denial or abridgement of the right of any citizen of the United States to vote on account of race or color . . . ."" 42 U.S.C.  1973(a). In establishing whether such an abridgement has occurred, one must determine whether, ""under the totality of circumstances, it is shown tha t the political processes leading to nomination or election in the State or political subdivision are not equally open to participation by members of a [protected] class [i.e., race or color] in  18  Under Charter  24(e), a major power of the Public Advocate that relates to the power to preside over the Council is the ability to break a tie vote. However, under Municipal Home Rule Law  20(1), passage of a local law requires a majority affirmative vote of the total voting power of the legislative body. See also Charter  34 (passage of local law or resolution requires majority affirmative vote of all the council members). Thus, 26 affirmative votes are needed in the Council to pass any local law. In light of this fact, a meaningful tie vote is extremely unlikely.  35   that its members have less opportunity than other members of the electorate to participate in the political process and to elect representatives of their choice."" 42 U.S.C.  1973(b). Whenever the City seeks, in general, to change a ""standard, practice, or procedure with respect to voting,"" it seeks preclearance from the Justice Department as to whether the change will have the effect of denying or abridging the right to vote on account of race or color. 42 U.S.C.  1973c. The change may not take effect until the City receives preclearance. Id. When preclearance is sought from the Justice  Department, the change may take effect if ""the Attorney General has not interposed an objection within sixty days after such submission, or upon good cause shown, to facilitate an expedited approval within sixty days after such submission, the Attorney General has affirmatively indicated that such objection will not be made."" Id. As to preclearance of a change such as one to the Charter's mayoral succession provisions, which would require approval by referendum, see Municipal Ho me Rule Law 23(d), Charter 38(3), the Department of Justice has set forth instructions regarding the timing of such preclearance. submissions,"" The Attorney General will not consider on the merits: (a) any proposal for a change affecting voting submitted prior to final enactment or administrative decision or (b) any proposed change which has a direct bearing on another change affecting voting which has not received Section 5 preclearance. However, with respect to a change for which approval by referendum, a State or Federal court or a Federal agency is required, the Attorney General may make a determination concerning the change prior to such approval if the change is not subject to alteration in the final approving action and if all other action necessary for approval has been taken. Under 28 C.F.R.  51.22, entitled, ""Premature  36   It thus appears that the Justice Department could, but would not be required to, consider for preclearance any change to the Charter's mayoral succession provisions prior to appro val by the voters at referendum. In 1999, the Charter Revision Commission's consultant, Dr. Allan J. Lichtman, analyzed whether establishing a system of special elections to fill mayoral vacancies would have a detrimental impact on voting power or representation of the City's minority communities and thus violate the Voting Rights Act. He analyzed recent special  elections in the City and other municipalities with high minority populations. Specifically, he analyzed data for seven special elections for Sta te Assembly and Senate, Congressional and Council positions between 1992 and 1998. Dr. Lichtman also  reviewed special elections in Washington, D.C., Chicago and Memphis. He found no evidence to support a conclusion that New York City mayoral special elections would be likely to disadvantage minority voters by producing large reductions in minority turnout relative to the reductions in white turnout. Indeed, he inferred from the data that in a Citywide special election minority turnout would likely be high relative to white turnout if a minority candidate or choice of minority candidates was competing for office. The Commission also consulted on this issue with Gerald Hebert , a legal expert on the Voting Rights Act, who worked at the Department of Justice for over 20 years and served as Acting Chief, Deputy Chief, and Special Litigation Counsel in the Voting Rights Section of the Civil Rights Division at the Justice Department. After reviewing the opinions of Professor Lichtman and Mr. Hebert, the Commission concluded that filling a mayoral vacancy through a special election (using the procedure proposed by the 1999 Commission) would not violate the Voting Rights Act.  37   Dr. Lichtman was retained by this Commission to again review this issue. He concluded that the use of nonpartisan special elections, with a runoff provision for filling vacancies in the mayoralty, should not impede the opportunity for minority voters in the City to participate fully in the electoral process and elect candidates of their choice. Dr. Lichtman noted that, while the 40 percent runoff provision might undermine minority voting opportunity, because a minority candidate could have received a plurality (but under 40 percent) of the vote if the white vote split, the same was true for a white candidate, who could receive a plurality (but under 40 percent) of the vote if the minority vote split. In either event, the runoff provision would prevent that candidate with the under 40 percent plurality from winning the office. Thus, the runoff provision itself did not present a Voting Rights Act problem. Dr. Lichtman's analysis of citywide special elections in Washington, D.C., Memphis, and Chicago did not show any consistent pattern of lower minority than white turnout or greater minority fall-off than white fall-off. He stressed that it was the  competitiveness of the elections that mattered and not the nature of the elections. He stated that if there is a hotly contested election with a strong minority candidate there would be minority turnout. 6. Policy Considerations Prompt Elections As described above, while the City has a consistent system for filling vacancies in almost every elected City office, the office of the Mayor is the exception. Under Charter  10(b), the Public Advocate could potentially serve as Acting Mayor for more than 15 months before an elected Mayor takes office. In light of this situation, the  38   Commission has studied whether it would be appropriate to provide for prompt elections for the person who would next be Mayor. The Commission received extensive comment on this issue, both from elected officials and from the public. Elected officials expressed a range of opinions with regard to the timing of elections for mayoral succession, with suggestions ranging from 45 days to the current 15- month period. A number of officials favored a 90-day period. Some officials believed that a shorter period of time might not afford candidates sufficient time to establish a campaign or give voters sufficient time to make an informed decision. However, while the exact suggestions varied, the testimony of the elected officials was notably in favor of instituting a system of prompt elections for mayoral succession. For example, Betsy Gotbaum, the Public Advocate, while stating her belief that the Commission should take more time to deliberate, stated that she ""would support a change in the Charter that allowed a special election to take place at some point after a successor takes office, whether it's 45, 60, or 90 days. That's what I've always said and what I truly believe."" (Public Hearing, August 13, 2002, Transcript p. 40) 19  Similarly, Bill Thompson, the Comptroller, C. Virginia Fields, the Manhattan Borough President, and Fernando Ferrer, the former Bronx Borough President, stated that they supported a special election being held within 90 days of a mayoral vacancy. See Thompson (Public Hearing, Aug ust 22, 2002, Transcript p. 49), Fields (Public Hearing, Aug ust 21, 2002, Transcript p. 41), and Ferrer (Public Hearing, Aug ust 21, 2002, Transcript p. 86). 19  Helen Marshall, the Queens Borough President, thought that a  In a letter to the editor of the New York Times dated January 20, 2002, Gotbaum stated that ""[w]hat she did promise in [her] campaign was to propose legislation toward a swifter special election for the new mayor. Under the current system, in the event of the elected mayor's inability to serve, the public advocate could have the job as long as 15 months. We can probably arrange an opportunity for the people to choose their own new mayor in significantly less time than that .""  39   special election within 90 days was a possibility. (Public Hearing, Aug ust 15, 2002, Transcript p. 69) Both Denny Farrell, a Member of the New York State Assembly, and Leroy Comrie, a New York City Council Member, testified in favor of shortening the period before an election is held. See Farrell (Public Hearing, Aug ust 21, 2002,  Transcript p. 102) and Comrie (Public Hearing, Aug ust 15, 2002, Transcript p. 59). Steven Fiala, the County Clerk of Richmond County and a former New York City Council Member and Minority Whip, thought the election should occur within 60 days. Only Scott Stringer, a New York State Assembly Member, and G. Oliver Koppel, a New York City Council Member , opposed substantially shortening the period before an election; Stringer (a former candidate for Public Advocate, who evidently thought that the Public Advocate served automatically for 12 to 15 months as successor) thought Charter  10(b) should remain as is, and Koppel thought there should be ""a substantial period of time"" before an election took place. See Stringer (Public Hearing, Aug ust 13, 2002, Transcript p. 51), and Koppel (Public Hearing, Aug ust 13, 2002, Transcript p. 69). Marty Markowitz, the Brooklyn Borough President, thought more time was needed to study this issue. (Public Hearing, August 13, 2002, Transcript p. 59) 20  Public comment was consistent with the implementation of prompt elections. Line of Mayoral Succession A. Staff analysis In its August 5, 2002, report, the staff analyzed various options for which City office was appropriate as first in the line of succession. The offices considered included  20  Elected officials who supported special elections in testimony before the 1999 Commission included Comptroller Alan Hevesi, Queens Borough President Claire Shulman, Staten Island Borough President Guy Molinari, Council Member Noach Dear, Council Member Martin Golden, Council Member James Oddo, Council Member Priscilla Wooten, State Senator Guy Velella, and Congressman Vito Fosella.  40   the Public Advocate, the Comptroller, the Speaker of the Council, a newly created Vice Mayor, and a Deputy Mayor. This analysis follows: Public Advocate -- The Public Advocate is currently the immediate successor to the mayoralty in the event of a vacancy. Charter  10(b). 21  The most significant power  of the office is that of an ombudsperson, i.e., an officer that monitors government operations and investigates complaints. See Charter  24. Though the Public  Advocate maintains a seat on a limited number of boards, the office performs virtually no executive functions other than managing a small staff. As the prior discussion of the history of the office indicates, the powers and responsibilities of the Public Advocate are not of the magnitude of those exercised formerly by the Council President on the Board of Estimate. This analysis can lead to the conclusion, as it did for the 2001 Commission, that the Public Advocate is not the appropriate choice as first in line to succeed to the mayoralty in the event of a vacancy. 22  It may be argued that, in a time of crisis, the  person who immediately becomes Acting Mayor should be someone who has an intimate knowledge of the daily workings of the executive function performed by the Mayor. Either a Deputy Mayor or arguably the Comptroller would meet this criterion. In fact, it may be argued that the Public Advocate, exercising an ombudsperson function, is particularly unsuited to be first in the line of succession to the City's most important executive office. The ""ombuds"" concept originated in Sweden in the early 1700s; by the 1800s, ""the Swedish Ombuds man had evolved into an administrative 21  For a comprehensive description of the office of the Public Advocate, see Mark Green & Laurel Eisner, The Public Advocate for New York City: An Analysis of the Country's Only Elected Ombudsman, 42 N.Y.L. Sch. L. Rev. 1093 (1998). 22 See Making Our City's Progress Permanent: Report of the New York City Charter Revision Commission, at 112 (Sept. 5, 2001).  41   body appointed by the Parliament to protect individuals against the excesses of the bureaucracy."" 23  Even today, the accepted definition of ombudsperson is ""a public  official appointed by the legislature to receive and investigate citizen complaints against administrative acts of government."" 24  While the office of the Public Advocate is elective  rather than appointive, its powers under the Charter remain largely within the classic ombudsperson model. Therefore, one could argue that the Public Advocate does not gain the experience necessary to step immediately into the mayoralty, particularly in a time of crisis. Furthermore, the Public Advocate's ombudsperson role may put the office institutionally at odds with the mayoralty; in the event of succession, this fact may create a blurring of institutional separation of powers. On the other hand, it is significant that the office of the Public Advocate is an elected, Citywide office. One could argue that it is more democratic, even when  considering an office that may be filled for only a relatively short period of time (assuming that a special election will be held), to have the person who is first in the line of succession to be someone who has been elected to public office. Furthermore, considering that the Public Advocate has been chosen by the entire electorate of the City, it would not be inappropriate for the Public Advocate to be the interim successor for another, elected Citywide office. An alternative between either keeping the Public Advocate as first in line of succession or simply replacing that office with another one could be made along the lines of Charter  10(a), the provision governing mayoral suspension, absence, or temporary inability to discharge powers. Under that section, the Public Advocate or the  23 24  Green & Eisner, Public Advocate, at 1104. See the website of the United States Ombudsman Association, at www.usombudsman.org.  42   Comptroller, in that order, acts as mayor with certain limited powers until the suspension, absence, or inability ceases. While so acting, the Public Advocate or Comptroller may not appoint or remove from office, and may not exercise any power lawfully delegated by the Mayor to a Deputy Mayor prior to the suspension or inability, or before or after the commencement of the absence. Furthermore, the Public  Advocate or Comptroller may not, as a general matter, sign, approve, or disapprove any local law or resolution until the suspension, absence, or temporary inability has continued for at least nine days. While the Deputy Mayor may exercise many powers during this period, he or she may not act on local laws or resolutions of the Council, act as a magistrate, or appoint or remove officials. Thus, while the Public Advocate or Comptroller may assume certain functions, the operational functions are retained by a deputy mayor. The advantages of such an approach for the vacancy situation is that would not necessarily involve removing the Public Advocate from the line of succession, and it would be familiar. 25  The disadvantage is that it might result in a tension between the  Acting Mayor and the Deputy Mayor, even if they were officially exercising different powers. Comptroller-- The Comptroller performs several significant functions and is responsible for the fiscal integrity of the City. The Charter vests the Comptroller with the power to audit all City agencies and all matters relating to the City's finances, and to settle and adjust all claims against the City. Furthermore, under Charter  8(c), the Comptroller participates in the issuance of City debt. In addition, the Comptroller is  25  This bifurcated approach would be possible with either the Comptroller or the Public Advocate as the Acting Mayor.  43   responsible for the registrati on of contracts for the procurement of goods, services and construction. Hence, the Comptroller, unlike the Public Advocate, exercises certain functions that may be viewed as ""executive"" in nature. Conversely, the responsibility to audit and monitor the executive branch may put the Comptroller institutionally at odds with the executive branch on various issues. This could create, at a minimum, an  awkwardness in how the Comptroller, as Acting Mayor, would act in relation to the Comptroller's office. Furthermore, as the Comptroller's responsibilities are largely postaction audits and approvals, and not service delivery or the implementation of legislative mandates, some might see the Comptroller's executive experience as limited. Speaker of the Council-- The Speaker of the City Council is the leader of the City Council, and is elected by its members. The Speaker does not possess an executive function and is not a Citywide elected official but, as the leader of the City's legislative body, is a powerful player in the affairs of the City. This role could give the Speaker the experience necessary to exercise the powers and duties of the Mayor until there is an election to fill the remainder of the unexpired mayoral term. On the other hand, the Charter, like the State and federal constitutions, contains a framework based on a separation of powers, which could be compromised by allowing the Speaker to succeed to the mayoralty. The Charter's separation of powers is manifested in a number of ways that would be compromised if the Speaker became the Acting Mayor. For example, the Mayor provides a check on the Council by approving or vetoing local laws passed by the Council. Conversely, the Council has an oversight role in relation to the activities of mayoral agencies. If the Speaker succeeded to the mayoralty, even on an interim basis, these checks could be lost.  44   A possible variation on the idea of Speaker as first in the line of succession is to have a person chosen by the Council be the interim successor. This is currently the third possibility for succession under Charter  10(b), which is the provision governing the order of succession in the event of a mayoral vacancy. Vice Mayor--As discussed above, the 1989 Charter Revision Commission considered establishing an office of the Vice Mayor, who would be elected along with the Mayor. The Vice Mayor proposal was designed by its sponsors as a vehicle to help minority candidates win election to Citywide office based on the theory that mayoral candidates would choose to run with Vice Mayor candidates who came from a community other than their own, in order to create a broad-based coalition. Opponents of the proposal, however, argued that the creation of a Vice Mayor position would relegate minorities to a secondary role beholden to the Mayor. Others maintained that the Council President could have the ability, even after the reorganization of the government, to serve as a check on the Mayor, but that, if the position of Vice Mayor replaced that of Council President, such a check would be lost. After considerable debate, the Commission rejected a motion to abolish the Council President's office and create a Vice Mayor who would succeed to the mayoralty. Bill Thompson, the current Comptroller, stated this year that the concept of a Vice Mayor would be a ""prescription for disaster."" Transcript, August 22, 2002, p. 54. Creating the office would represent a significant alteration of the City's electoral structure, with possible legal consequences, and would require framing the specific powers and duties of that office. Deputy Mayor-- The Charter provides that the Mayor may appoint Deputy Mayors, as appropriate, with powers and duties as the Mayor determines. Of the  various existing options for who should be the interim successor, a Deputy Mayor is 45   most likely to subscribe to the views of the vacating Mayor and would be the person most likely to continue the Mayor's policies. In addition, a Deputy Mayor would be intimately familiar with the operation of City government and the role played by the executive branch, an asset that would be critical in a period of crisis and transition. A vacancy in the office of Mayor would inevitably create the possibility of significant volatility in the City. It would therefore be valuable to guarantee that someone with knowledge of the City's operations, such as a Deputy Mayor, become the Acting Mayor to ensure and facilitate stability in the City. Furthermore, if an act of war, natural disaster or other disaster in the City claimed the li fe of the Mayor, the need for stability and experienced leadership would be essential. The tragic events of September 11th have demonstrated the need for continuity in a time of grave crisis. As is widely known, Mayor Giuliani was able to develop a  comprehensive emergency response plan immediately after the attack. The execution of that plan was possible because the Mayor had extensive knowledge of the operation of City government and a close working relationship with the City officials responsible for executing the emergency response plan. It is arguable that, had there been a  vacancy in the mayoralty related to the sudden attacks, a Deputy Mayor would have been best able to replicate the Mayor's knowledge and working relationships. Additionally, someone who is already in the chain of command to the Mayor, such as a Deputy Mayor, would likely be one of the only persons who could effectively command and deploy police, fire, and other resources necessary to respond in a time of crisis. On the other hand, it may be argued that the fact that a Deputy Mayor is not an elected official makes a Deputy Mayor inappropriate to become the interim mayoral  46   successor. In addition to the general democracy concerns that would be raised, making a Deputy Mayor the interim successor could be perceived as giving him or her an unfair advantage in any election to fill out the remainder of the term, assuming that the Deputy Mayor were inclined to run in such an election. Therefore, if a future Commission were to consider proposing that a Deputy Mayor be first in the line of succession, it might want to consider barring that person from running in such an election to fill the unexpired term. Furthermore, the concerns about the Deputy Mayor being Acting  Mayor become more significant the longer the period of time for which he or she would serve as Acting Mayor. Therefore, if a future Commission decides to consider  proposing a change to Deputy Mayor in the line of succession, it needs to consider closely the amount of time before a n election is held. B. Public Comment The elected officials who spoke at the public hearings believed it would be best if the successor to the Mayor were an elected official. In support of this position, some stated that elected officials have experience dealing with citywide issues, are aware of the public's concerns, and have a relationship with the commissioners. Others cited a concern that a m ayor removed for illegal conduct should not be succeeded by that person's appointee. Some officials believe d that the average individual does not know who the deputy mayors are, thus making it inappropriate to appoint one of them to the highest level of municipal government. Others believe d that the current succession model works and should be retained, that it is undemocratic to have the Mayor's hand picked assistant run the City, or that mayoral appointees may not have sufficient public experience.  47   Many elected officials believed that the Public Advocate should succeed the Mayor, while others endorsed the concept of an elected Vice-Mayor. A few officials specifically supported abolishing the position of Public Advocate; on the other hand, some of those in favor of succession by the Public Advocate believe d that the position should be given a budget line or subpoena power. Those supporting mayoral  succession by the Public Advocate believed that the Public Advocate is familiar with City government and that the public is familiar with that person through a citywide election process. Some officials were influenced by the belief that the voters elected the Public Advocate knowing that the position is designated to succeed the Mayor in the event of a vacancy. Some elected officials were concerned that an interim successor should be focused on running the City, not on the next special election, and that any interim mayor would have an advantage in the subsequent election. Some concluded that the interim mayor should not be permitted to run at the next mayoral election. Public comment at the public hearings both supported and opposed changing the line of succession. Of those in support of a change, some commented that a deputy mayor would be best suited to be the interim mayor because that person would be familiar with the operations of City government. Some speakers expressed the view that the Public Advocate's office should not be the next in line for succession. In fact, some speakers expressed their opinion that the office should be eliminated. Some speakers noted that, due to the nature of the Public Advocate's role as ombudsperson, the Public Advocate often takes positions counter to the Mayor, and that it would therefore not be proper for the Public Advocate to succeed the Mayor.  48   On the other hand, many members of the public spoke in support of retaining the current line of succession. Some supported this position because the Public Advocate is a Citywide elected official. Others were concerned that the Mayor should not be able to designate a successor who is not an elected official.  Options Considered for Charter Change: This section contains two sets of proposed Charter revisions regarding mayoral succession: one in which (A) the election system is shortened by requiring, in the usual case, a special election within 60 days of a vacancy, but in which the line of succession is unchanged from the current Charter provision; and one in which (B) a deputy mayor is substituted for the Public Advocate as the interim successor and the subsequent election system would provide, in the usual case, for a special election within 60 days of a vacancy. Each set of proposed changes is followed by a discussion of its provisions. The Commission has decided to put proposal ""A"" before the voters on the November 2002 ballot, and defer proposal ""B"" for consideration by another Commission. A. The Line of Succession Remains Unchanged, but a Prompt Election is Required Subdivision b of section 10 of the New York city charter, as  Section one.  amended by local law number 19 for the year 1993, is amended to read as follows: b. In the case of a failure of a person elected as mayor to qualify, or a vacancy in the office caused by the mayor's resignation, removal, death or permanent inability to discharge the powers and duties of the office of mayor, such powers and duties shall devolve upon the public advocate, the comptroller or a person selected pursuant to subdivision c of section twenty-eight, in that order of succession, until a new mayor shall 49   be elected as provided herein. [If the vacancy shall occur before the twentieth day of Septe mber in any year, such vacancy shall be filled in the general election held in that year, otherwise it shall be filled in the general election held in the following year. The term of the person then elected mayor shall begin on January first after such election and shall expire on the date when the term of the mayor originally elected would have expired.] Upon the commencement of the term of the [thus] person first elected mayor pursuant to the provisions of subdivision c of this section, the [public advo cate or the comptroller] person then acting as mayor pursuant to the provisions of this subdivision, if an elected official, shall complete the term of the office to which such person was elected if any remains.  2. Subdivision c of section 10 of the New York city charter is re-lettered  subdivision d, and a new subdivision c is added to read as follows: c. 1. Within three days of the occurrence of a vacancy in the office of the mayor, the person acting as mayor shall proclaim the date for the election or elections required by this subdivision, provide notice of such proclamation to the city clerk and the board of elections and publish notice thereof in the City Record. After the proclamation of the date for an election to be held pursuant to paragraphs fo ur or five of this subdivision, the city clerk shall publish notice thereof not less than twice in each week preceding the date of such election in newspapers distributed within the city, and the board of elections shall mail notice of such election to all registered voters within the city. 2. If a vacancy occurs during the first three years of the term, a general election to fill the vacancy for the remainder of the unexpired term shall be held in the year in which the vacancy occurs, unless the vacancy occurs after the last day on which an  50   occurring vacancy may be filled at the general election in that same year with party nominations of candidates for such election being made at a primary election, as provided in section 6-116 of the election law. If suc h a vacancy occurs in any year after such last day, it shall be filled for the remainder of the unexpired term at the general election in the following year provided, however, that no general election to fill a vacancy shall be held in the last year of the term, except as provided in paragraph nine of this subdivision. Party nominations of candidates for a general election to fill a vacancy for the remainder of the unexpired term shall be made at a primary election, except as provided in paragraph five of this subdivision. 3. If a special or general election to fill the vacancy on an interim basis has not been previously held pursuant to paragraphs four, six, seven and eight of this subdivision, the person elected to fill the vacancy for the remainder of the unexpired term at a general election shall take office immediately upon qualification and shall serve until the term expires. If a special or general election to fill the vacancy on an interim basis has been previously held, the person elected to fill the vacancy for the remainder of the unexpired term at a general election shall take office on January first of the year following such general election and shall serve until the term expires. 4. If a vacancy occurs during the first three years of the term and on or before the last day in the third year of the term on which an occurring vacancy may be filled for the remainder of the unexpired term at a general election with party nominations of candidates for such election being made at a primary election, as provided in section 6116 of the election law, a special or general election to fill the vacancy on an interim basis shall be held, unless the vacancy occurs less than ninety days before the next primary election at which party nominations for a general election to fill the vacancy may 51   be made and on or before the last day on which an occurring vacancy may be filled for the remainder of the unexpired term at the general election in the same year in which the vacancy occurs with party nominations of candidates for such election being made at a primary election, as provided in section 6 -116 of the election law. 5. If a vacancy occurs after the last day in the third year of the term on which an occurring vacancy may be filled for the remainder of the unexpired term at a general election in each year with party nominations of candidates for such election are being made at a primary election, as provided in section 6-116 of the election law, but not less than ninety days before the date of the primary election in the fourth year of such term, a special or general election to fill such vacancy for the remainder of the unexpired term shall be held. 6. Elections held pursuant to paragraph four or five of this subdivision shall be scheduled in the following manner: a special election to fill the vacancy shall be held on the first Tuesday at least sixty days after the occurrence of the vacancy, provided that the person acting as mayor, in the proclamation required by paragraph one of this subdivision, may schedule such election for another day not more than ten days after such Tuesday and not less than forty days after such proclamation if the person acting as mayor determines that such rescheduling is necessary to facilitate maximum voter participation; except that (a) if the vacancy occurs before September twentieth in any year and the first Tuesday at least sixty days after the occurrence of the vacancy is less than ninety days before a regularly scheduled general election or between a primary and a general election, the vacancy shall be filled at such general election; and  52   (b) if the vacancy occurs before September twentieth in any year and the first Tuesday at least sixty days after the occurrence of the vacancy is after a regularly scheduled general election, the vacancy shall be filled at such general election; and (c) if the vacancy occurs on or after September twentieth in any year and the first Tuesday at least sixty days after the occurrence of the vacancy is after, but less than thirty days after, a regular ly scheduled general election, the vacancy shall be filled at a special election to be held on the first Tuesday in December in such year. 7. All nominations for elections to fill vacancies held pursuant to paragraphs four and five of this subdivision sha ll be by independent nominating petition. A signature on an independent nominating petition made earlier than the date of the proclamation required by paragraph one of this subdivision shall not be counted. 8. A person elected to fill a vacancy in the office of the mayor at an election held pursuant to paragraph four of this subdivision shall take office immediately upon qualification and serve until December thirty- first of the year in which the vacancy is filled for the remainder of the unexpired term pursuant to paragraph two of this subdivision. A person elected to fill a vacancy in the office of the mayor at an election held pursuant to paragraph five of this subdivision shall take office immediately upon qualification and serve until the term expires. 9. If a vacancy occurs less than ninety days before the date of the primary election in the last year of the term, the person elected at the general election in such year for the next succeeding term shall take office immediately upon qualification and fill the vacancy for the remainder of the unexpired term. 10. If at any election held pursuant to this subdivision for which nominations were made by independent nominating petitions, no candidate receives forty percent or more 53   of the vote, the two candidates receiving the most votes shall advance to a runoff election which shall be held on the second Tuesday next succeeding the date on which such election was held.  3. Subdivision e of section 24 of the New York city charter, as amended by  local law number 19 for the year 1993, is amended as follows: e. The public advocate [shall preside over the meetings of the council and]  shall have the right to participate in the discussion of the council but shall not have a vote [except in case of a tie].  4. Section 44 of the New York city charter, as amended by local law number  68 for the year 1993, is amended to read as follows:  44. Speaker. The council shall elect from among its members a speaker and such other officers as it deems appropriate. The speaker shall preside over the meetings of the council. During any period when the public advocate is acting as mayor, or when a vacancy exists in the office of the public advocate, the speaker shall act as public advocate pending the filling of the vacancy pursua nt to subdivision c of section twentyfour, and shall be a member of every board of which the public advocate is a member by virtue of his or her office.  5. Section 1152 of the New York city charter is amended by adding a new  subdivision i to read as follows: i. 1. The amendments to the charter, amending sections ten, twenty- four,  and forty-four, approved by the electors on November fifth, two thousand two, shall take effect immediately, provided that any vacancy that occurs in the office of the mayor on or after September twentieth, two thousand two, and before the effective date of the  54   amendments referenced in this subdivision, shall be governed by such amendments, and any such vacancy shall be deemed to have occurred on such effective date. 2. Notwithstanding the provisions of section 1153, in the event that the  amendment set forth in paragraph 10 of the new subdivision c of section 10 is finally adjudicated to be invalid or otherwise cannot be implemented, all of the amendments referenced in this subdivision shall be without any further force and effect and, at such time, sections ten, twenty- four, and forty-four as they existed immediately prior to the effective date of such amendments shall be reinstated and shall be deemed to have always remained in full force and effect and unamended by such amendments. Discussion The proposed changes in section one , regarding Charter  10(b), eliminate the current election system for filling a vacancy in the mayoralty with someone who will serve for the remainder of the term after the initial successor. Section two of the proposal establishes a new election system, which would be contained in a new Charter  10(c). The proposal takes the basic approach that  currently exists for filling vacancies in other City offi ces, in which nonpartisan special elections are promptly held and general elections generally follow. The benefits of this approach are that it is convenient (because familiar) for the public and the Board of Elections, and it has been upheld in court. It should be noted, however, that this  approach creates the possibility that a number of people could serve as Mayor within too short a period of time.26 26  Using the Charter's current provision for filling vacancies in the office of the Comptroller, Charter  94(c), as an example for how a mayoral special election system might work, here is an example: Mayor Number One vacates the office on January 10 of the second year of his or her term. Mayor Number Two then immediately takes office as the Acting Mayor, pending a special election. Mayor Number Three wins  55   As provided in paragraph 1 of new subdivision (c), the person acting as mayor in the event of a vacancy (i.e., the interim successor) must proclaim the date for the election or elections required by the subdivision, provide notice of the proclamation to the City Clerk and the Board of Elections, and publish notice in the City Record. The City Clerk and the Board of Elections must then also publish or provide notice. The next step is that an election would be held. In the usual case, it would be a special election held on the first Tuesday at least sixty days after the occurrence of the vacancy. See paragraph 6 of new subdivision (c). The date of the special election could be varied somewhat if the mayor determined that rescheduling was necessary to maximize voter participation, id., or if the special election would occur too soon after the general election, see id. at subparagraph (c). In addition, the vacancy could be filled at the general election (rather than a special election) if it occurred in the summer or early fall, to avoid an excess of elections. See id. at subparagraphs (a) and (b). A special election would be required to occur approximately sixty days after the vacancy for several reasons. First, it should be noted that this sixty-day period is longer than the 45 days provided for in the Charter succession provisions for other elected offices. A longer period of time prior to the special election is appropriate for the choice of someone to be Mayor, considering that the City might be facing a crisis situation that would complicate its ability to hold an election in less than two months after the vacancy. However, a longer period of time was not chosen because of the need to  a special election, see Charter 94(c)(4), scheduled for late February, Charter  94(c)(6), and takes office immediately upon qualification. Charter  94(c)(8). He or she then serves until December 31 of that of that year. Id. Meanwhile, a general election is held to elect someone to fill the remainder of the term. Charter  94(c)(2). The winner of that election, Mayor Number Four, takes office on January 1 of the next year. Charter  94(c)(3).  56   have an elected person serving as mayor as soon after the vacancy as would likely be practicable. Furthermore, the timing of the vacancy would affect whether the person elected would serve for the remainder of the unexpired term or only on an interim basis. If a vacancy occurs in the first three years of the mayoral term, and on or before the last date in that year when vacancies may be filled at a general election through party nomination of candidates at a primary election, pursuant to Election Law  6-116, and if the vacancy occurs at least 90 days before that year's primary, then the election would be held to fill the vacancy on an interim basis, see paragraph 4, and wo uld be followed by a general election in that year to fill the remainder of the term. See paragraph 2. In the same situation, but where the vacancy occurs less than 90 days before the primary but with enough time to conduct a partisan primary and general election, no interim election is held; if there is not enough time to use the general election, a special election is held. See paragraphs 2, 4, and 5. If the vacancy occurs after the last day in the third year of the term when vacancies may be filled at a general election through party nomination of candidates at a primary election, pursuant to Election Law  6-116, but not less than 90 days before the date of the primary in the fourth year of the term, the election is to fill the vacancy for the remainder of the unexpired term. See paragraph 5. Elections held under paragraph 4 for filling a mayoral vacancy on an interim basis, and under paragraph 5 for filling the vacancy for the remainder of the term in basically the last year of a term, are nonpartisan elections. See paragraph 7. General elections to fill a vacancy for the remainder of a term that follow a special election are partisan elections. See paragraph 2. As with the existing Charter provisions for  vacancies in other elected offices, the paragraph 4 and paragraph 5 elections are 57   nonpartisan elections (through the independent nominating petition process) in order to allow ballot access to a broad range of candidates where use of a primary is not possible. See Election Law  6-116. This is the rationale that was used by the 1988 Charter Revision Commission when it instituted nonpartisan elections for vacancies in the other City offices. The provisions set forth exactly when a person elected under this system takes office and until when he or she serves. A person elected under paragraph 4 to fill a vacancy on an interim basis takes office immediately upon qualification and serves until December 31 of the year when the vacancy is filled for the remainder of the term at a general election under paragraph 2. See paragraph 8. The person elected at that general election then takes office on January 1 of the next year (i.e., the next day), and serves until the term expires. See paragraph 3. Similarly, a person elected under  paragraph 5 to fill the remainder of the unexpired term takes office immediately upon qualification and serves until the term expires. See paragraph 8. In addition, if no election has been held pursuant to paragraph 4 to fill the vacancy on an interim basis (if, for example, the timing requirements of paragraph 4 are not met), the person elected at a general election to fill the remainder of the unexpired term takes office immediately upon qualification and serves until the term expires. See paragraph 3. Finally, if the vacancy occurs less than 90 days before the date of the primary election in the last year of the term, the person elected at the general election for the next term shall take office immediately upon qualification (as opposed to the next January 1), and fill the vacancy for the remainder of the unexpired term (and then begin his or her own term). See paragraph 9.  58   Under paragraph 10 of new subdivision (c) of Charter  10, when a nonpartisan election is held for succession (i.e., under paragraphs 4 or 5), and no candidate receives 40 percent or more of the vote, the two candidates receiving the most votes advance to a runoff election held approximately two weeks later. Such a runoff election may be appropriate since special elections tend to produce a crowded fi eld. Considering that the winner of this election will be mayor, he or she should be required to demonstrate a substantial level of support from the electorate . Moreover, such a runoff provision would be analogous to the Election Law, which requires runo ff elections for primary elections prior to general elections, for the offices of the Mayor, Comptroller and Public Advocate , in the event no candidate receives forty percent of the vote. Election Law  6 -162. Under sections three and four of the proposal, regarding Charter  24(e) and 44, the power to preside over the meetings of the Council is moved to the Speaker from the Public Advocate . As explained above, any change to the Charter's mayoral  succession provision implicates General City Law  2-a(1). Under this provision, where a city's mayor and the presiding officer of the local legislative body are elected at the same time for the same term by the voters of the entire city, the presiding officer of the legislative body, after a vacancy occurs in the mayoralty, becomes the mayor for the remainder of the unexpired term. Currently, the Public Advocate ""presides over"" the Council, Charter  24(e), and is elected at the same time as the Mayor, for the same term as the Mayor, by the voters of the entire City. Thus , the terms of Section 2-a(1) would seem to apply. However, the City's current mayoral succession provision,  Charter  10(b), is ""grandfathered"" as an exception to Section 2-a(1) by General City Law  2 -a(3)(b). 59   Because this exemption from application of the provisions of Section 2-a(1) arguably would not continue, however, after modification of any of the current mayoral succession provisions, the law requires that the Public Advocate's ceremonial right to ""preside"" over the Council be moved to another official, so that the terms of Section 2a(1) would not apply in the first place.27 Note that the Public Advocate's authority to introduce legislation in the Council would not be changed, nor would the Public Advocate's other powers be affected i n any way. The Speaker of the Council was selected to be the presiding officer in this proposal for two reasons: (1) The Speaker is the logical choice given his or her prominent operational role in the Council; and (2) The Speaker is not a Citywide elected official, unlike the Public Advocate, and thus he or she would not, in any event, qualify to succeed to the mayoralty under GCL  2 -a(1). Finally, section five of the proposal, regarding Charter  1152, provides an effective date for the amendments. B. Deferred Option: Deputy Mayor as Interim Successor and a Prompt Election is Required Subdivision b of section 10 of the New York city charter, as  Section one.  amended by local law number 19 for the year 1993, is amended to read as follows: b. In the case of [a failure of a person elected as mayor to qualify, or] a vacancy in the office of mayor caused by the mayor's resignation, removal, death or permanent inability to discharge the powers and duties of the office of mayor, such powers and 27  Under Charter  24(e), a major power of the Public Advocate that relates to the power to preside over the Council is the ability to break a tie vote. However, under Municipal Home Rule Law  20(1), passage of a local law requires a majority affirmative vote of the total voting power of the legislative body. See also Charter  34 (passage of local law or resolution requires majority affirmative vote of all the council members). Thus , 26 affirmative votes are needed in the Council to pass any local law. In light of this fact, a meaningful tie vote is extremely unlikely.  60   duties shall devolve upon [the public advocate,] a deputy mayor designated by the mayor before the commencement of such vacancy, the comptroller or a person selected pursuant to subdivision c of section twenty-eight, in that order of succession, until a new mayor shall be elected as provided herein. Designation of a deputy mayor pursuant to this subdivision shall be by executive order filed with the city clerk. In the case of a vacancy caused by a failure of a person elected as mayor to qualify, the powers and duties of the mayor shall devolve upon the comptroller, or a person selected pursuant to subdivision c of section twenty-eight, in that order of succession, until a new mayor shall be elected as provided herein. [If the vacancy shall occur before the twentieth day of September in any year, such vacancy shall be filled in the general election held in that year, otherwise it shall be filled in the general election held in the following year. The term of the person then elected mayor shall begin on January first after such election and shall expire on the date when the term of the mayor originally elected would have expired.] Upon the commencement of the term of the [thus] person first elected mayor pursuant to the provisions of subdivision c of this section, the [publi c advocate or the comptroller] person then acting as mayor pursuant to the provisions of this subdivision, if an elected official, shall complete the term of the office to which such person was elected if any remains.  2. Subdivision c of section 10 of t he New York city charter is re-lettered  subdivision d, and a new subdivision c is added to read as follows: c. 1. Within three days of the occurrence of a vacancy in the office of the mayor, the person acting as mayor shall proclaim the date for the election or elections required by this subdivision, provide notice of such proclamation to the city clerk and the board of  61   elections and publish notice thereof in the City Record. After the proclamation of the date for an election to be held pursuant to paragraphs four or five of this subdivision, the city clerk shall publish notice thereof not less than twice in each week preceding the date of such election in newspapers distributed within the city, and the board of elections shall mail notice of such election to all registered voters within the city. 2. If a vacancy occurs during the first three years of the term, a general election to fill the vacancy for the remainder of the unexpired term shall be held in the year in which the vacancy occurs, unless the vacancy occurs after the last day on which an occurring vacancy may be filled at the general election in that same year with party nominations of candidates for such election being made at a primary election, as provided in section 6-116 of the election law. If such a vacancy occurs in any year after such last day, it shall be filled for the remainder of the unexpired term at the general election in the following year provided, however, that no general election to fill a vacancy shall be held in the last year of the term, except as provided in paragraph nine of this subdivision. Party nominations of candidates for a general election to fill a vacancy for the remainder of the unexpired term shall be made at a primary election, except as provided in paragraph five of this subdivision. 3. If a special or general election to fill the vacancy on an interim basis has not been previously held pursuant to paragraphs four, six, seven and eight of this subdivision, the person elected to fill the vacancy for the remainder of the unexpired term at a general election shall take office immediately upon qualification and shall serve until the term expires. If a special or general election to fill the vacancy on an interim basis has been previously held, the person elected to fill the vacancy for the  62   remainder of the unexpired term at a general election shall take office on January first of the year following such general election and shall serve until the term expires. 4. If a vacancy occurs during the first three years of the term and on or before the last day in the third year of the term on which an occurring vacancy may be filled for the remainder of the unexpired term at a general election with party nominations of candidates for such election being made at a primary election, as provided in section 6116 of the election law, a special or general election to fill the vacancy on an interim basis shall be held, unless the vacancy occurs less than ninety days before the next primary election at which party nominations for a general election to fill the vacancy may be made and on or before the last day on which an occurring vacancy may be filled for the remainder of the unexpired term at the general election in the same year in which the vacancy occurs with party nominations of candidates for such election being made at a primary election, as provided in section 6 -116 of the election law. 5. If a vacancy occurs after the last day in the third year of the term on which an occurring vacancy may be filled for the remainder of the unexpired term at a general election in each year with party nominations of candidates for such election are being made at a primary election, as provided in section 6-116 of the election law, but not less than ninety days before the date of the primary election in the fourth year of such term, a special or general election to fill such vacancy for the remainder of the unexpired term shall be held. 6. Elections held pursuant to paragraph four or five of this subdivision shall be scheduled in the following manner: a special election to fill the vacancy shall be held on the first Tuesday at least sixty days after the occurrence of the vacancy, provided that the person acting as mayor, in the proclamation required by paragraph one of this 63   subdivision, may sche dule such election for another day not more than ten days after such Tuesday and not less than forty days after such proclamation if the person acting as mayor determines that such rescheduling is necessary to facilitate maximum voter participation; except that (a) if the vacancy occurs before September twentieth in any year and the first Tuesday at least sixty days after the occurrence of the vacancy is less than ninety days before a regularly scheduled general election or between a primary and a general election, the vacancy shall be filled at such general election; and (b) if the vacancy occurs before September twentieth in any year and the first Tuesday at least sixty days after the occurrence of the vacancy is after a regularly scheduled general electi on, the vacancy shall be filled at such general election; and (c) if the vacancy occurs on or after September twentieth in any year and the first Tuesday at least sixty days after the occurrence of the vacancy is after, but less than thirty days after, a regularly scheduled general election, the vacancy shall be filled at a special election to be held on the first Tuesday in December in such year. 7. All nominations for elections to fill vacancies held pursuant to paragraphs four and five of this subdivision shall be by independent nominating petition. A signature on an independent nominating petition made earlier than the date of the proclamation required by paragraph one of this subdivision shall not be counted. 8. A person elected to fill a vacancy in the office of the mayor at an election held pursuant to paragraph four of this subdivision shall take office immediately upon qualification and serve until December thirty- first of the year in which the vacancy is filled for the remainder of the unexpired term pursuant to paragraph two of this subdivision. A person elected to fill a vacancy in the office of the mayor at an election 64   held pursuant to paragraph five of this subdivision shall take office immediately upon qualification and serve until the term expires. 9. If a vacancy occurs less than ninety days before the date of the primary election in the last year of the term, the person elected at the general election in such year for the next succeeding term shall take office immediately upon qualification and fill the vacancy for the remainder of the unexpired term. 10. If at any election held pursuant to this subdivision for which nominations were made by independent nominating petitions, no candidate receives forty percent or more of the vote, the two candidates receiving the most votes shall advance to a runoff election which shall be held on the second Tuesday next succeeding the date on which such election was held. 11. If the person acting as mayor pursuant to the provisions of subdivision b of this section is a deputy mayor designated by the mayor, such deputy mayor shall not be qualified to be a candidate in any election held pursuant to paragraphs 2, 4, or 5 of this subdivision.  3. Subdivision e of section 24 of the New York city charter, as amended by  local law number 19 for the year 1993, is amended as follows: e. The public advocate [shall preside over the meetings of the council and]  shall have the right to participate in the discussion of the council but shall not have a vote [except in case of a tie].  4. Section 44 of the New York city charter, as amended by local law number  68 for the year 1993, is amended to read as follows:  65    44. Speaker. The council shall elect from among its members a speaker and such other officers as it deems appropriate. The speaker shall preside over the meetings of the council. During any period [when the public advocate is acting as mayor, or] when a vacancy exists in the office of the public advocate, the speaker shall act as public advocate pending the filling of the vacancy pursuant to subdivision c of section twentyfour, and shall be a member of every board of which the public advocate is a member by virtue of his or her office.  5. Section 1152 of the New York city charter is amended by adding a new  subdivision i to read as follows: i. 1. The amendments to the charter, amending sections ten, twenty- four,  and forty-four, approved by the electors on November fifth, two thousand two, shall take effect immediately, provided that any vacancy that occurs in the office of the mayor on or after September twentieth, two thousand two, and before the effective date of the amendments referenced in this subdivision, shall be governed by such amendments, and any such vacancy shall be deemed to have occurred on such effective date. 2. Notwithstanding the provisions of section 1153, in the event that the  amendment set forth in paragraph 10 of the new subdivision c of section 10 is finally adjudicated to be invalid or otherwise cannot be implemented, all of the amendments referenced in this subdivision shall be without any further force and effect and, at such time, sections ten, twenty- four, and forty-four as they existed immediately prior to the effective date of such amendments shall be reinstated and shall be deemed to have always remained in full force and effect and unamended by such amendments.  66   Discussion of Deferred Proposal In this approach, the changes in section one of the proposed changes, regarding Charter  10(b), not only eliminate the current election system for mayoral succession after the initial successor, but also change the initial successor from the Public Advocate to a deputy mayor. The rest of the line of succession (Comptroller, person chosen by the Council) is unchanged. The line of successio n is broken into two parts-- one in the event of a vacancy and one in the event that the person elected as mayor fails to qualify--because it would not make sense to have a deputy mayor succeed to the mayoralty when the mayor -elect did not qualify for office in the first place. The remainder of the proposed changes in this version are the same as in the first one, except for the addition of a new Charter  10(c)(11). Under paragraph 11, if the deputy mayor has initially succeeded to be the interim mayor, prior to any election, he or she may not run in any of the elections under Charter  10(c) to act as mayor on an interim basis or to fill out the remainder of the term. Such a provision prevents the deputy mayor from getting an unfair advantage in such an ele ction, so that elected officials and others who may wage a campaign to fill the vacancy will have a level playing field.  67   PART IV(B) Nonpartisan Elections This issue has been deferred by the Commission for consideration in another election cycle.  Issue: Should elections for City elective offices be conducted on a nonpartisan basis? Relevant Charter Provisions: While the Charter provides for nonpartisan special elections to fill vacancies in the offices of Public Advocate, Council member, Borough President, and Comptroller, Charter  24(c), 25(b), 81(e), 94(c), the Charter does not provide for nonpartisan elections to fill those offices, or the office of the Mayor, during the regular Citywide election cycle. Discussion: 1. Introduction The electoral process for City elective offices, like those for federal and state offices, is a partisan one ; candidates compete in party nominating elections and a candidate's party affiliation appears with his or her name on the ballot. Under a typical nonpartisan election system, candidates do not run in party nominating primaries and ballots do not denote a candidate's party affiliation. Instead, all candidates for a  particular office run together in a nonpartisan primary. Typically, the two candidates who receive the most votes in the primary advance to the general election. In considering whether to propose a system of nonpartisan elections, t he Commission has looked at the following issues: 68       Issue: Should elections for City elective office be conducted in a nonpartisan manner? Issue: If nonpartisan elections are appropriate for any City elective office, should they be held for all City elective offices, or only for some? Issue: If the Commission proposes nonpartisan elections, what should the effective date of the change be?  Arguments regarding nonpartisan elections made prior to this Commission's study As outlined by the Commission's staff in its August 6, 2002, report to the Commission, advocates of nonpartisan elections ha d identified several potential bene fits. First, candidates would be freer to offer voters competing ideologies and visions. Candidates would no longer be forced to tailor their positions to appeal mainly to the insiders within their own parties who tend to vote in primaries. Instead,  candidates would be challenged, from the outset of the campaign, to articulate a vision that resonates with a broad spectrum of voters. By having to appeal to the electorate as a whole, candidates would be forced to offer ideas on actual issues and problems likely to arise during their terms in office, rather than focusing on the more esoteric and ideological concerns of the vocal few who tend to vote in partisan primaries. Furthermore, adherents argue d that a nonpartisan system would create the opportunity for people from outside of a party's machinery to compete on a more equal footing with party insiders and loyalists. Many candidates' fates, especially in partisan primaries, hinge on whether they can successfully convince party insiders to support them. Newcomers, and people with careers outside of politics, often find it difficult to run for elective office because of their lack of access to party organizations. Adherents argue d that by controlling access to the ballot with an iron fist, the party bosses perform a far larger role in selecting the City's leaders than the voters themselves, making the  69   current system inaccessible to all but the chosen few. With real world example after example of backroom dealing, corruption and patronage, supporters argue d that nonpartisan elections are the only way to remove the system from the control of the party bosses, and produce elected officials chosen by the people for their ability rather than candidates selected by the party for their utility. ""Supporters of nonpartisan elections envision direct representation of citizens rather than indirect representation through party intermediaries. They seek to make local government more businesslike and less political. The ultimate goal is to create a more responsive and effective local government system."" 28  When coupled with the  City's voluntary campaign finance program, which provides public matching dollars to participating candidates, a nonpartisan system could allow far more people to compete and win. Moreover, nonpartisan elections, when combined the campaign finance  program, could allow people with more limited means to compete, whereas the current system often is hinged on party donations and fundraising. See Title 3, Chapter 7 of the Administrative Code of the City of New York. In particular, see Administrative Code  3705, the public financing section of the New York City Campaign Finance Act, which details the circumstances under which candidate may receive matching funds, including ""four - to-one"" matching fund s. 29  Opponents of nonpartisan elections, on the other hand, have argue d that partisan elections are necessary to a democratic system, because they force candidates to make commitments that result in political accountability, and they allow  28  ""Local Nonpartisan Elections, Political Parties and the First Amendment"" 87 Columbia Law Review 1677, 1679 (198 7). Id. 29 For a general discussion of spending by political parties in campaigns, see ""Party Favors: A Report of the New York City Campaign Finance Board"" (Jan. 1995).  70   voters to affiliate themselves with a cause. Opponents further questioned the impact of nonpartisan elections on voter turnout. In addition, opponents argue d that, in the  absence of party identification, nonpartisan elections may lead to ethnic block voting, because vote rs may have nothing but ethnic identity on which to base their vote. This concern is highlighted in races for less high profile offices, where voters may not have been sufficiently exposed to the candidates' messages. Finally, opponents argue d that the current system should not be changed at this time, when minorities are becoming a force within the parties, because the change might splinter minority voting power. Following the staff's August 6, 2002, presentation, the Commission received extensive commentary on whether the City should change to a system of nonpartisan elections. As described below, the Commission received comments from elected  officials and members of the public. In addition, the Commission received the benefit of testimony from a number of experts. 2. Background and History The use of nonpartisan elections has been considered in recent years by the 1998, 1999 and 2001 Charter Revision Commissions, which both studied the issue itself and received extensive public comment. 1998 Charter Revision Commission The 1998 Commission extensively examined the issue of nonpartisan elections. As part of its work, the Commission conducted an expert forum specifically on this issue. A summary of this forum is attached in Appendix E. The efforts of the 1998 Commission culminated in a comprehensive staff report. The report noted, among other things, that 60 of the 75 largest cities in the United States with an elected mayor use nonpartisan elections, including Los Angeles, 71   Houston, San Diego, Detroit, Dallas, Phoenix, San Antonio, San Francisco, Boston, and Seattle. In addition, the report noted that, in 1988, New York City adopted nonpartisan elections for special elections to fill vacancies in City elective offices other than the Mayor's office.30 Frank Mauro, Research Director for the 1988 Charter Revision  Commission, described the rationale: ""The purpose of the nonpartisan special election was to dilute the power of the party leaders and to make it easier for those not chosen by the leaders to qualify for the ballot."" 31  The 1998 Commission's staff report explored the potential benefits of nonpartisan elections. Statistical data revealed that nonpartisan elections foster  diversity, while partisan elections do the opposite. For example, the report exa mined data from the 48 largest American cities. In the 11 cities using partisan elections, only two had minority mayors. In comparison, of the 37 cities that used nonpartisan  elections, 15 had minority mayors. The 1998 staff report conducted a thorough analysis of the legality of establishing nonpartisan elections for citywide offices in New York City, focusing on considerations arising from the requirements of the New York State Election Law and the federal Voting Rights Act. The Commission staff concluded that cities in New York State are permitted, under the principles of home rule, to amend their charters in order to adopt nonpartisan elections. The 1998 Commission retained Professor Allan J. Lichtman, Chair of the Department of History at American University and an expert in voting rights, to conduct 30  The Charter provides for nonpartisan independent nominating petitions to fill vacancies in the offices of the Comptroller (Charter  94(c)(7)), Public Advocate (Charter  24(c)(7)), Council member (Charter  25(b)(7)), and Borough President (Charter  81(e)(7)). However, as discussed above, see footnote 17 ,the succession provision for Public Advocate has never been precleared. 31 The New York Times , July 11, 1990 at B2.  72   an analysis of whether the establishment of nonpartisan elections would violate the federal Voting Rights Act. Dr. Lichtman analyzed statistics concerning race, voting patterns, and election results. He concluded that the change from partisan to  nonpartisan elections would not violate the Act. As summarized in Appendix E , Dr. Lichtman testified that his statistical analysis showed that party identification is not necessary for minority candidates to b e elected. As to the mechanics of nonpartisan elections, the 1998 report explored various possibilities for the ballot layout, as well as solutions to the problem of conducting both partisan and nonpartisan elections on the City's older voting machines. 1999 Commission The 1999 Commission began its examination of the issue of nonpartisan elections by conducting a thorough review of the 1998 Commission's staff report. The 1999 Commission held an expert forum on election issues on August 6, 1999. Lawrence Mandelker, an election lawyer, had favorable views on nonpartisan elections, as did Dr. Lichtman, based on his research. Stanley Schlein, counsel to the State Assembly Election Law Commission, and Professor Robert Bailey of Rutgers University disagreed with nonpartisan elections. Dr. Bailey stated that party affiliation and race are the two main predictors of voting patterns. 32  He further stated that removing party affiliation would highlight race 33  as a factor in elections.  Dr. Bailey further explained tha t by removing party, ""you in a  32  Transcript of 1999 Charter Revision Commission Expert Forum, August 6, 1999 (""1999 Expert Forum Transcript"") at p. 114. 33 Id.  73   sense are eliminating one filter or one other umbrella identity that could mitigate some racial voting patterns in this city."" 34  Dr. Lichtman performed extensive statistical analysis of citywide elections within the City from 1989 through 1997. 35  He emphasized the uniqueness of the City's voting  patterns, and concluded that, in the primaries, blacks and Hispanics do not vote cohesively to form a single minority block. 36  Dr. Lichtman noted that the lack of minority cohesion in the City is significant because, as a result of the large number of white voters in the City's Democratic Party, minority cohesion is necessary to advance a minority candidate out of the partisan primary and into the general election. As a result, Dr. Lichtman concluded that  nonpartisan elections would even the playing field between whites and minorities in New York in regard to candidate selection, because a minority candidate would be more likely to advance to the general election. Stanley Schlein testifi ed that ""it still should be the right of parties to put forward candidates to run in primaries, to coalesce behind philosophical ideas... ."" 37  The 1999 Commission also received testimony about the practical difficulties that New York City would face if it were to implement nonpartisan elections. As in 1998, these difficulties primarily concerned New York City's older voting machines. Lawrence Mandelker pointed out some of the logistical issues that needed to be resolved in order to use New York's voting machi nes for nonpartisan elections.38 He noted that it could be problematic for a partisan primary election to be held 34 35 36 37 38  Id. Id. Id. Id. Id.  at at at at  pp. 121-122. pp. 11 8-143. p. 103. pp. 92 -94.  74   simultaneously with a nonpartisan election, because of the lockout mechanism used to ensure that primary voters vote in the primary for party in which they are registered. Mr. Mandelker proposed solutions such as buying new voting machines, requesting the Legislature's approval to conduct partisan and nonpartisan primaries on different days, or using paper ballots, an alternative he disfavored. 2001 Commission The 2001 Commission also considered the issue of nonpartisan elections for the Citywide offices of Mayor, Comptroller, and Public Advocate. The Commission's staff reviewed the work of the 1998 and 1999 Commissions on the issue. In addition, the Commission received public comment about nonpartisan elections. As set forth in its final report, the 2001 Commission decided to defer the issue of nonpartisan elections. Nonetheless, the Commission specifically noted the compelling testimony of candidates for City offices whose candidacies had been frustrated by partisan election procedures. The Commission further noted that while term limits and campaign finance reform had opened the door to election reform, party politics nonetheless controlled primary elections and the overall electoral process.  3. Legal Issues State law issues The City's authority to enact local legislation creating nonpartisan elections for local offices derives from Article IX of the New York State Constitution and Section 10 of the Municipal Home Rule Law (""MHRL""). 39  In Bareham v. City of Rochester, 246 N.Y.  39  Under MHRL  10(1), cities have the power to adopt local laws relating to the ""powers, duties, qualifications, number, [and] mode of selection . . . of its officers and employees ,"" provided that such local  75   140 (1927), the Court of Appeals considered whether Rochester had the authority, under the State's home rule provisions, to adopt nonpartisan elections in light of the inconsistent provisions of the Election Law. Although the Court struck down the  Rochester law at issue because of its technical failure to cite the Election Law provisions that were being superseded, it nonetheless held that cities in New York State possess the authority to establish nonpartisan election systems. 40  As discussed more fully below, several cities in New York State continued to use nonpartisan election schemes for some time after the decision in Bareham, including the cities of Sherrill and Watertown. The existence of these schemes strengthens the argument that New York City has the authority to create nonpartisan elections. Furthermore, although the Election Law has been recodified since the decision in Bareham, the Bareham analysis applies to the current Election Law. Election Law  1102 specifically states that ""[w]here a specific provision of law exists in any other law which is inconsistent with the provisions of this chapter, such provision shall apply unless a provision of [the Election Law] specifies that such provision of [the Election Law] shall apply notwithstanding any other provision of law."" There is no existing  provision of the Election Law that mandates partisan elections ""notwithstanding any other provision of law.""  law is not inconsistent with the State Constitution or any general State law, and provided that the State Legislature has not restricted the adoption of such a local law on a matter of State concern. See MHRL 10(1)(ii)(a)(1) (emphasis added). This provision derives directly from Article IX,  2(c), of the State Constitution. 40 The Court in Bareham acknowledged that Rochester would not have had the authority to pass a local law inconsistent with the Election Law had that State law been a ""general"" law, see MHRL 2(5) (general law is one that ""in terms and in effect applies alike"" to, for example, all cities within the State), but noted that, on its face, the Election Law was instead a ""special"" law, with which a properly enacted local law could be inconsistent. See MHRL 2(12) (special law is one which ""in terms and in effect"" applies to, for example, one or more, but not all cities within the State).  76   In 1991, New York City's authority to adopt nonpartisan elections in its Charter was explicitly recognized in City of New York v. New York City Board of Elections , Index No.41450/91 (Sup. Ct., New York Co.), aff'd, __ A.D. 2d __, (1st Dept. ), lv. app. den. , 77 N.Y.2d 938 (1991). That case concerned the validity of Charter  25(b)(7), the nonpartisan special election provision for City Council vacancies that was added by the 1988 Commission. In that case, the Board of Elections, despite the new Charter  amend ment, accepted the party nomination of a candidate and attempted to place that candidate's name and party affiliation on the ballot in a special election to fill a Council vacancy. The Board of Elections claimed that Election Law  6-114, which provides that party nominations for an office to be filled at a special election be made in accordance with party rules, preempted the Charter. Relying on Bareham , MHRL  10, and Election Law  1-102, the Court ruled that New York City had the right to adopt nonpartisan elections in its Charter, notwithstanding the Election Law. Specifically, the Court held that although the Election Law allowed party labels in elections, ""the Election Law gives way to inconsistent local law provisions."" unanimously by the Appellate Division, First Department. Indeed, local authority to implement nonpartisan elections for local offices, as identified in Bareham, has never been compromised by the Legislature's enactment of a general law or an explicitly restrictive special law. Thus, the Election Law may be reasonably construed only to set forth the framework for governing partisan elections for those cities that choose to use them. In light of Bareham and City of New York , it appears clear that cities in New York State possess the home rule authority to adopt nonpartisan elections by amending their charters. See also Steinberg v. Meisser, 291 N.Y. 685 (1943) (upholding the denial of 77 This decision was affirmed   an injunction against the City of Long Beach placing before the voters a proposed local law amending its charter to provide, inter alia, for nonpartisan elections for City Council). Description of Nonpartisan Elections in New York State Nonpartisan election systems have in existed in New York State for over 80 years. For examp le, in addition to Rochester, the cities of Sherrill and Watertown have had nonpartisan elections since 1916 and 1920, respectively. 41  As discussed above, Rochester attempted to institute nonpartisan elections for its Citywide officers by local law, but its legislation was struck down in Bareham because of the law's failure to cite the provisions of the Election Law that were to be superseded. Following the decision in Bareham , in 1929, Rochester again instituted nonpartisan elections by local law, but this time the law contained the required list of superseded Election Law sections. 42  The City of Sherrill's nonpartisan primary system was instituted by the State Legislature in 1916. 43  In creating this scheme, the Legislature effectively superseded 44  various pro visions of the then-applicable Election Law as it applied to Sherrill.  At its  most basic, Sherrill's system of nonpartisan elections modified the method by which a candidate qualified for the general election. While the Election Law at that time  41  Other cities in New York that have had nonpartisan primary elections at some point in their history include Buffalo, Saratoga Springs, Long Beach, Jamestown, Mechanicville, Auburn, New Rochelle, Rome, and Batavia. 42 The sections of the then- existing Election Law superseded by Rochester's law were: 83 (lists of nominations); 84 (publication by Board of Election of nomination lists); 89 (poll-books); 102 (placing names on ballot); 103 (order of names on ballot); 104, 105, 108, 119, 249, 268 (official ballots); 131 (party nominations); 135, 136 (designating petitions); 137 (independent nominations); 138 (declination of designation or nomination); 139 (filling vacancies in designations and nominations); 140 (times for filing petitions and certificates for holding conventions); 156 (additional meetings for registration); 157 (registration for other than general elections); 204 (challenges at primary elections); 212 (proceedings of inspectors at close of polls); 213, 270 (canvassing vote); 217 (tallying votes); 233 (proclamation of results). 43 Laws of 1916, Chapter 172. 44 In 1985, the Election Law was reenacted into its current form.  78   provided that the candidate who received the most votes in each party's primary proceeded to the general election, see then-effective Election Law  89, Sherrill's nonpartisan system mandated that the two candidates who received the most votes at the nonpartisan primary would run in the general election, regardless of party. 45  The City of Watertown's nonpartisan primary system was instituted by the State Legislature in 1920.46 Like for Sherrill, the Legislature effectively superseded various provisions of the Election Law as it applied to Watertown. 47  The Legislature amended Watertown's nonpartisan election system in 1993,48 but the basic structure of nonpartisan primary elections remained the same. The  amendments merely conformed Watertown's system to certain admini strative requirements of the Election Law and addressed certain administrative details. 49  As  amended in 1993, Watertown's legislation effectively superseded various provisions of the modern Election Law. 50  45  Sherrill's legislation varied from numerous sections of the 1916 Election Law. See, e.g. , Sections 3 (definition of a primary election); 48 (process to choose candidates for primary election); 49 (filing declaration of candidacy); 58 (party affiliation on ballot); and 79 (when election supplies are to be delivered). 46 Laws of 1920, Chapter 276. 47 Watertown's 1920 legislation varied from numerous sections of the then-applicable Election Law. See, e.g. , 3 (defining primary as a party-based election); 74 (designation of polling places in accordance with political parties); 79 (number of ballots to be provided at election); 89 (two candidates receiving most votes at primary proceed to general election); and 122 (independent nominating petitions). 48 Laws of 1993, Chapter 247. 49 These administrative requirements addressed issues such as the filing and sufficiency of petitions; primary dates; revision and correction of registers of voters; the quality, weight, size, etc., of ballots; and the general conduct and canvassing of elections. The amendments also addressed details regarding the binding of petitions, the equipment to be furnished to the polling locations, the movement of voters between election districts, write-in candidates, and the conduct of general elections. 50 Watertown's legislation varies from the following sections of the Election Law as it existed in 1993: 1104 (defining a primary as a party-based election); 2 120 (statement of party positions to be filled at primary); 4- 118 (p arty designation on notices of primary election); 6-119 and 6-132 (designating petition to include party); 6- 128 (first nominations for new party); 6- 136 (designation of candidates for primary); 6138, 6-140, and 6-142 (independent nominating petitions); 6 156 (certificates of nomination to include party designations); 6-158 (filing of certificate of acceptance or declination of candidacy); 7-104, 7-106, 7114 (party designations on ballots); 9- 200 (selection of candidates to run at general election); and 9-210 (statements of canvassing results to include political parties).  79   Federal Voting Rights Act A change to nonpartisan elections could arguably be considered a change in a ""standard, practice, or procedure with respect to voting."" Such a change could require the City to seek preclearance from the Justice Department pursuant to the Voting Rights Act. Under the Voting Rights Act, a State or political subdivision may not impose a ""standard, practice, or procedure . . . which results in a denial or abridgement of the right of any citizen of the United States to vote on account of race or color . . . ."" 42 U.S.C.  1973(a). In establishing whether such an abridgement has occurred, one must determine whether, ""under the totality of circumstances, it is shown that the political processes leading to nomination or election in the State or political subdivision are not equally open to participation by members of a [protected] class [i.e., race or color] in that its members have less opportunity than other members of the electorate to participate in the political process and to elect representatives of their choice."" 42 U.S.C.  1973(b). Whenever the City seeks, in general, to change a ""standard, practice, or procedure with respect to voting,"" it seeks preclearance from the Justice Department as to whether the change will have the effect of denying or abridging the right to vote on account of race or color. 42 U.S.C.  1973c. The change may not take effect until the City receives preclearance. Id. When preclearance is sought from the Justice  Department, the change may take effect if ""the Attorney General has not interposed an objection within sixty days after such submission, or upon good cause shown, to  80   facilitate an expedited approval within sixty days after such submission, the Attorney General has affirmatively indicated that such objection will not be made."" Id. As to preclearance of a change such as one to nonpartisan elections, which would require approval by referendum, see Municipal Home Rule Law 23(d), Charter 38(3), the Department of Justice has set forth instructions regarding the timing of such preclearance. Under 28 C.F.R.  51.22, entitled, ""Premature submissions,"" The Attorney General will not consider on the merits: (a) any proposal for a change affecting voting submitted prior to final enactment or administrative decision or (b) any proposed change which has a direct bearing on another change affecting voting which has not received Section 5 preclearance. However, with respect to a change for which approval by referendum, a State or Federal court or a Federal agency is required, the Attorney General may make a dete rmination concerning the change prior to such approval if the change is not subject to alteration in the final approving action and if all other action necessary for approval has been taken. Thus the Justice Department could, but would not be required to, consider for preclearance any change to the Charter's mayoral succession provisions prior to approval by the voters at referendum. As stated above, Dr. Lichtman, the expert on voting rights for the 1998 and 1999 Commissions, concluded that a change to nonp artisan elections for Citywide offices would not violate the Voting Rights Act. Dr. Lichtman's 1998 statistical analysis showed that party identification is not necessary for minority candidates to be elected. This Commission retained Dr. Lichtman to conduct a new Voting Rights Act analysis. As described below, Dr. Lichtman has again concluded that a change to nonpartisan elections for Citywide offices would not violate the Voting Rights Act. Dr. Susan Welch, the Dean of the College of Liberal Arts and a professor of political science at  81   Pennsylvania State University, was also retained by the Commission, for the purpose of examining Dr. Lichtman's analysis. She agreed with this conclusion.51 Dr. Lichtman has also concluded that a change to nonpartisan elections for Borough Presidents and City Council members would not violate the Voting Rights Act. 4. Policy Considerations Use throughout the United States Nonpartisan elections are used by the overwhelming majority of municipalities across the nation, including Los Angeles, Chicago, Houston, San Diego, Detroit, Dallas, Phoenix, San Antonio, San Francisco, Boston, and Seattle. Attached in Appendix E is a chart that identifying the type of election system used in the 50 largest cities in the United States, their mayors and the mayors' ethnicity over the last decade, and whether those cities use runoff elections. According to the U.S. Conference of Mayors, as of the 2000 census, 41 of the nation's 50 largest cities elected their mayors using nonpartisan elections. Of those 41 cities, 34 percent elected black or Hispanic mayors. Of the nine cities that used partisan elections, only two cities (22 percent) elected a black or Hispanic mayor. Attached in Appendix E is a chart of 2000 Census data for the 50 largest cities. A chart summarizing these race statistics is attached in Appendix E. According to data from the National Conference of Black Mayors, based on U.S. Census Bureau data, 41 cities in the United States with populations of 50,000 or more have black mayors. Of the mayors in these 41 cities, 30 were elected through  nonpartisan elections, while 11 were elected with partisan elections, a difference of almost three to one (73% in cities with nonpartisan elections compared to 27% in cities  51  As described below, Dr. Welch stated other concerns that political scientists would have about a change to nonpartisan elections.  82   with partisan elections). A chart listing details of these 41 cities is attached in Appendix E. Arguments in favor of nonpartisan elections The Commission received extensive comments from elected officials and the public both for and against nonpartisan elections. These comments are summarized below and in detail in Appendix A (summary of comments from elected officials). Appendix B (the summary of public proposals) also has, among other things, a summary of comments related to nonpartisan elections. Elected officials who supported nonpartisan elections cited their own ability to be elected without party support as evidence that partisan elections were unnecessary. Some officials identified the  unwillingness of certain minorities to belong to political parties as proof that voter participation would increase with nonpartisan elections. Certain officials expressed the opinion that nonpartisan elections would elevate the quality of the candidates and electoral debate, and that nonpartisan elections would increase access to the ballot. Another sentiment in favor of nonpartisan elections was that persons elected through the nonpartisan process would feel accountable to their constituencies, as opposed to partisan elected officials who are accountable to the party that helped them get elected. The concern was also expressed that incumbent elected officials oppose nonpartisan elections because they want to maintain the status quo. Members of the public supporting nonpartisan elections expressed the belief that such electi ons would limit the power of political parties to control who actually is able to become a candidate for office. Some speakers recounted their own attempts to run for office, emphasizing that they spent an inordinate amount of time gathering signatures  83   and in court, defending themselves against challenges brought by party lawyers in efforts to keep them off the ballot. Some speakers indicated that a nonpartisan system would better represent the true preferences of voters because, under the current primary system, candidates with the broadest appeal may not have the opportunity to actually run for office. According to some speakers, this problem was particularly acute in New York City, where there is one dominant party and the outcome of the elections is often effectively decided in the primary. It was noted that the current party-driven process compels unions, PAC's, and other organizations to back the party hierarchy's candidate. Failure to do so risks incurring the wrath of the hierarchy, which can retali ate by thwarting or delaying the legislative and funding priorities of these organization's constituencies. In a similar  vein, speakers suggested that nonpartisan elections, by diminishing the power of the party bosses, would increase the diversity of ca ndidates and allow more minority participation. Some speakers cited the fact that large cities with nonpartisan elections have been more successful in electing minority mayors than cities with partisan mayoral elections. Some speakers noted that a nonpartisan system would enable voters to focus on the ideas and qualifications of candidates, rather than solely on a party label. Speakers stated that they believed that, with a nonpartisan system, candidates would be more accountable to the public rather than to a party machine. The Commission also heard testimony that a nonpartisan system would improve the performance of government in that it would create a system that is more open and fair and less subject to corruption by political parties.  84   The comments received by this Commission built on prior testimony and analysis of nonpartisan elections. As outlined in the staff's August 6, 2002, report, supporters of nonpartisan elections have argue d that such elections produce a system aimed at allowing citizens to seek elected office directly without first having to win approval from local party bosses. Nonpartisan elections have been seen as having the benefit of forcing candidates to address issues facing the population as a whole, rather than the narrow group of insiders who tend to vote in partisan primaries, and offering an opportunity for candidates whose positions may not fit with the party machines. Potential candidates who might not otherwise run for office would have the opportunity to do so without modifying their beliefs. 52  Instituting a system of nonpartisan elections could mean an end to a system where only candidates approved by the party system and with views that do not offend the party leaders receive the financial support often necessary to mount an effective campaign. When coupled with the City's voluntary campaign finance program,  nonpartisan elections could widen the electoral field to a broader group of candidates, and offer voters more choices in their leaders and policies. This point was discussed by NYU researcher Francis Barry at the August 20, 2002 expert briefing on Staten Island. See below. Nonpartisan elections also could encourage diversity of candidates. The  analysis performed by the 1998 Commission, and the statistics discussed above,  52  See generally ""Local Nonpartisan Elections, Political Parties and the First Amendment,"" cited in footnote 1, at p. 1679 (""[N]onpartisan systems give qualified candidates of the minority party or independents a better chance to succeed. These systems...permit voters to analyze local issues independently on their merits and to focus on the intelligence and experience of the candidates themselves rather than on their political affiliations."") (citations omitted)  85   indicate that minority group candidates in cities with nonpartisan elections have outperformed minority group candidates in cities with partisan elections. Nonpartisan elections may also increase minority voter turnout. The 2001  Commission heard testimony regarding the need for nonpartisan elections, particularly for City Council positions, in order to increase minority voter participation, because such elections would help counter the perception that minority needs were not met by nominees selected through a partisan process. 53  Supporters of nonpartisan elections also argue that since City government is mainly operational, as opposed to ideological, the value of the party banner and the ideals it represents is minimal at best. Arguments against nonpartisan elections The Commission received testimony from elected officials and the public against nonpartisan elections. Elected officials opposing nonpartisan elections expressed the concern that voters would be less aware of candidates' positions, since part y affiliation sends a message about the issues to the voters. They were also concerned that  53  According to Michelle McCleary, a candidate for the City Council in the 9 District, ""In a one party borough like Manhattan, the winner of the Democratic primary is the winner of the elections. So our elected officials are chosen by a very small percentage of eligible voters. ...This leads to elected officials who are more responsive to the Democratic Party than to the voters. It also tends to discourage many talented members of [the African-American] community from running for public office. And it turns our young people away from the electoral process altogether. The voter turnout among African-American youth ranges between the single digits and the teens."" Transcript, Aug. 15, 2001, at pp. 9-11. Similarly, Alex Cox, a candidate for the City Council in the 7 District, stated, ""In the Harlem community where I am running, for example, as in many black communities across the country, young black voters are increasingly choosing to not identify themselves with a party label. A recent poll conducted by the Joint Center for Political and Economic studies found that 42.6 % of AfricanAmericans between the ages of 18- 25 view themselves as politically independent. Young black voters ' interests are not represented in a partisan election where a local Democratic party machine dominates. This is particularly troubling in a district like mine because it mea ns that more and more potential voters will become disillusioned with the voting process and pull out altogether. In 1999, only 20% of eligible voters cast their ballots for a City Council candidate."" Transcript, Aug. 15, 2001, at pp. 11- 12. th  th  86   nonpartisan elections would favor incumbents and the wealthy because lower income candidates could not raise enough money to run without the support of established political parties. Minority communities and candidates could thus be hurt because of the loss of funding and, in the opinion of some, because minority candidates who had started to establish themselves through the party system would lose the advantages they had earned. Certain officials believed that the election of Republicans in the most recent mayoral elections indicated that the process was working well. Some believed in general that the current system was functioning properly and that there was the refore no benefit to altering it. Concern was also expressed that instituting nonpartisan  elections might violate the federal Voting Rights Act. Conflicting studies were cited concerning whether nonpartisan elections would increase voter turnout or minority participation. Concern was expressed that new voting machines would be required to conduct partisan and nonpartisan elections at the same time. Members of the public opposing nonpartisan elections focused not only on the substance of the issue but als o on the process of study undertaken by this Commission. The prime criticism centered on the time frame for review, as well as on the fact that the hearings were being held over the summer when some people would be on vacation. Many speakers commented that the Commission should not propose a change to nonpartisan elections this year, and should study the matter further. Concerns were raised that there would be an insufficient amount of time for voters to be educated on this topic. On the merits, several speakers expressed the belief that a change to nonpartisan elections would result in voter confusion. Speakers commented that,  because candidates would not be identified as being members of a particular political 87   party, voters would not know what a candidate stood for. Another concern raised was the impact of nonpartisan elections on minority candidates. Speakers were concerned that nonpartisan elections would benefit wealthy candidates who could afford to make themselves known and gain media exposure. Some speakers also feared that  nonpartisan elections would result in lower voter turnout because, without party affiliation, voters would be less aware of particular candidates (except those with wealth and thus exposure to the media), and would therefore be less interested in the elections. Members of the public commented that we have now reached a point where minorities have had success within the Democratic Party, and that a change to nonpartisan elections would serve to undo this success. Others questione d whether a change to nonpartisan elections would violate the Voting Rights Act. New York's long history of partisan elections and of political parties was also raised as a reason to not change to nonpartisan elections. Finally, the concern was expressed that the City's voting machines would not be capable of handling nonpartisan elections. The comments received by this Commission built on prior testimony and analysis of nonpartisan elections. As outlined in the staff's August 6, 2002, report, opponents of nonpartisan elections have argue d that such elections frustrate democracy and lead to political gridlock. 54  ""Part[y politics] force candidates to make choices, take stands, and  make commitments to groups of people with long collective memories and high collective standards."" 55  As one writer notes:  54 55  See July 29, 1998 Forum on Nonpartisan Citywide Elections, at p. 71. Susan Reefer, ""No to Nonpartisan Elections, available elections/jun.02.shtml.  at  www.gothamgazette.com/  88   What do politicians do? They get up meetings, circulate handbills and pamphlets, blaze away in the newspapers, send ships about the streets on wheels with flags and sailors, and send conveyances all over town, with handbills, to bring people to the polls  all to gain attention to their cause and elect their candidate. All these are these are their measures,"" and for their end they are wisely calculated. The object is to get up an excitement, and bring the people out.56 It is argued that the party system gives voters a chance to affiliate themselves with a cause; and that cause, is bigger than any candidate could be."" 57  Opponents have also argue d that nonpartisan elections discourage informed citizen participation. They argue that when party labels for the City's highest offices are removed, it disadvantages vast numbers of voters and deprives them of the historical perspective needed to project the nature of an administration. 58  This could harm those  with low income and low education who have strong party identification. Loss of party identity is believed to make it more difficult for the voters to keep track of candidates. 59  According to opponents, a person in a partisan system who lacks personal wealth can re ly on party or organizational support not only to start campaigning, but also to move up the political ladder. Nonpartisan elections would give advantages to  persons with personal wealth or with close ties to persons and institutions with great wealth. 60  56  See Jeff Pasley, Party Politics, Citizenship, and Collective Action in Nineteenth Century America: A Response to Stuart Blumin and Michael Schudson (""Party Politics"") available at www.mtsu.edu/~seig/pdf/pdf_response_pasley.pdf. 57 See Reefer, ""No to Nonpartisan Elections,"" available at www. gotham gazette.com/elections/ june.02.shtml. 58 See July 29, 1998 Forum on Nonpartisan Citywide Elections, at p. 90. 59 Id. at p. 70. 60 Id. at p. 91.  89   Finally, opponents have argue d that nonpartisan elections encourage extremism and discourage moderation. 61  Opponents also argue that voter turnout may decline  with nonpartisan elections because a lack of party identification could make it more difficult for voters to keep track of candidates. Expert testimony As summarized in Appendix C, the Commission received extensive expert opinion on the issue of nonpartisan elections. Much of that opinion was from Dr. Lichtman, who was retained by the Commission to study whether a change to nonpartisan elections for City elective offices would violate the Voting Rights Act. His analysis for the Commission expanded upon the work that he performed for the 1999 Charter Revision Commission. Based on his analysis of electoral results and of partisan and nonpartisan electoral systems in the nation's 100 largest cities, 82 percent of which have nonpartisan mayoral elections, Dr. Lichtman concluded that nonpartisan elections are not an impediment to the election of mayors fro m members of minority demographic groups. Twenty-seven percent of cities with nonpartisan systems (including 62  approximately 18 percent with white majorities) have African-American or Hispanic mayors, while only 22 percent of those with partisan elections h ave minority mayors, none of them in any of the 11 cities with white majorities. Controlling statistically for the demographics of cities, the slight lead in terms of minority mayors for nonpartisan elections systems widens quite substantially. Lichtman stated that these results hold up over time.  61 62  Id. at p. 92. Id. at p. 72.  90   Dr. Lichtman's analysis indicated that voter turnout is not reduced after the institution of nonpartisan elections, but rather that voter turnout tends to be low in municipal elections that do not occur simultaneously with elections for higher office such as governor or president. Minority turnout is generally higher for such elections, and voting in general is higher for higher offices. Thus elections that produce greater  turnout do not necessarily translate i nto more votes cast in lower municipal contests. Dr. Lichtman also concluded that citywide elections and voting within the City shows that standard explanations for how partisan elections might help minority voters elect candidates of their choice do not apply to citywide elections in New York City for multiple reasons. For example, there is a big fall-off from the primary to the general election not for white Democrats but for minority voters whose candidate is defeated in the primary. Additionally, the phenomena of minorities being able to dominate  Democratic primaries and of major differences between minority and white voting strengths in Democratic primaries and general elections do not apply in the City, perhaps because of the diversity of significant minority populations in New York City and the failure of minority voters to coalesce in support of candidates from other minority groups. Dr. Lichtman found that a change from partisan to nonpartisan elections of citywide officials in New York City might enhance the prospects for minority candidates or voters to compete in elections for citywide offices because, under a nonpartisan system, two candidates from the field, rather than one candidate from each partygenerally white candidates--advance to the ge neral election. Finally, Dr. Lichtman found that a change from partisan to nonpartisan elections for Borough President and City Council elections would not violate the Voting Rights 91   Act, because it would not produce a retrogression of minority opportunities to participate fully in the political process and elect candidates of their choice. Dr. Susan Welch, who was also retained by the Commission to help its study of nonpartisan elections, submitted written testimony dated August 22, 2002. Dr. Welch was retained to review Dr. Lichtman's current analysis. She analyzed his conclusions regarding the effect of a change to nonpartisan mayoral elections. Dr. Welch agreed with Dr. Lichtman's conclusion that ""nonpartisanship does not violate the Voting Rights Act,"" and stated that ""[i]t would be hard to argue a race bias in its voter impact."" Dr. Welch further noted that Dr. Lichtman's conclusions agreed with previous findings ""that neither type of election [partisan or nonpartisan] facilitates or hinders the election of African-American mayors (or Latino mayors either)."" Apart from Voting Rights Act considerations, however, Dr. Welch expressed that nonpartisan elections could have adverse impacts. According to Dr. Welch, political science research has shown that political parties play an important role in ""linking people to the political system,"" by increasing participation, providing information to voters, and promoting accountability. Francis Barry, from the New York University Taub Urban Research Center, described the development of the debate over nonpartisan elections, concluding that the current literature has undermined old concerns that nonpartisan elections advantage Republicans, depress turnout, and favor incumbents. He stated that New York may be uniquely well-suited to hold nonpartisan elections because of three recent reforms: the campaign finance system, which provides public money to candidates, thus reducing reliance on party funds and better equalizing funding available to each candidate; the Vote r Guide, which is mailed to every household with a registered voter and provides 92   information in a low-cost manner to enable voters to distinguish between candidates without the help of party labels; and term limits, which weaken the power of incumbency. Barry suggested that the City's campaign finance system strengthens  challengers and its term limits law weakens the power of incumbency, and that together they would significantly diminish any advantage that might accrues to incumbents under nonpartisan ele ctions. Although Richard Flanagan, Professor of Political Science at the College of Staten Island, agreed with Mr. Barry that studies about the impact of nonpartisan elections were inconclusive, he did believe that such elections could increase competitive ness in New York City, because of the high ratio of Democrats to Republicans in the City. Clayton Gillette, a Professor of Law at New York University Law School, approved of party affiliation as a proxy for voter knowledge of individual positions, but he warned that political parties may not focus on the concerns of the City electorate in selecting candidates for local office. Nonpartisan elections could thus have the benefit of advancing candidates who were well qualified for municipal office although not necessarily in line with national party positions, as well as breaking party dominance in a particular locality. He also opined that introducing nonpartisan elections would not eliminate the role of political parties, which would continue to support particular candidates. Elected officials of three jurisdictions that hold nonpartisan elections also testified about their experience. They were Bill McKoy, President of the Paterson, New Jersey City Council; Gus Garcia, Mayor of Austin, Texas; and Glenda Hood, the first woman to be elected Mayor of Orlando, Florida. In the last five years, Paterson elected its first 93   African-American and Hispanic mayors. Mr. McKoy believed that nonpartisan elections and a relatively low signature requirement render access to the ballot easier. A range of nonprofit organizations have sponsored public forums for candidates, broadening involvement in the political process, while political parties have remained somewhat involved in funding. In Austin, nonpartisan elections have successfully contributed to the election of minority candidates to various positions, although voter turnout is greater when there is a statewide or national election as well, and can be depressed when nonpartisan elections take place on different dates f rom the party elections. Nonpartisan elections have resulted in a large number of candidates getting on the ballot, leading to the election of many minority candidates. Mayor Hood testified that nonpartisan elections allow public officials to make good p ublic policy and remain focused on the issues without disruptive interference from political parties. She  believed that nonpartisan elections also permit neighborhoods and businesses to be more involved in the political process and to develop valuable alliances with one another and with nonprofits. Minority candidates have achieved success throughout Florida, whose municipalities all have nonpartisan elections except for Jacksonville.  Ballot and voting machine issues A. The 1998 Commission The 1998 Commission identified a number of practical problems with conducting nonpartisan elections, particularly problems relating to the ballots and voting machines. The 1999 and 2001 Commissions identified the same issues. As to the form of the ballot, the 1998 Commission noted that, pursuant to Election Law  7-104(5), the names of candidates of a particular party must appear on 94   voting machines in the same column or row containing generally the names of candidates of such party, 63  and that, generally, the ballots as they appear on the voting  machines already face space limitations. The Commission proposed several options as to how to structure ballots so that they could accommodate nonpartisan and partisan elections, and still meet these constraints. These options included the use of a  bifurcated ballot, double column bifurcation, or use of the final column. Attached in Appendix E is the 1998 Commission's description of these options. Regarding the voting machines themselves, the 1998 Commission noted that, as a practical matter, it is more difficult to conduct a nonpartisan primary than it is to conduct the general election following such a primary, because of the presence of a ""lockout"" mechanism on each voting machine. Where nonpartisan and partisan  primaries are being held simultaneously, all registered voters must be allowed to vote in the nonpartisan elections, while only voters registered for a particular party may be allowed to vote in that party's primaries. That Commission noted that the City's voting machines have a lockout mechanism that prevents a voter who is not the member of a particular party from voting for candidates of that party; when a voter enters the booth, the inspector flips a switch that allows the voter to select candidates from his or her party. While the 1998 Commission recognized that the City did not have a sufficient number of voting machines to devote some to nonpartisan primaries and others to partisan primaries, it believed that there were other viable solutions using the existing machines. For example, the Commission identified setting a separate nonpartisan  63  Election Law  1- 104(3) defines a ""party"" as a ""any political organization which at the last proceeding election for governor polled at least fifty thousand votes for its candidate for governor.""  95   primary date, using paper ballots, and using electronic voting machines as potential solutions to the lockout problem. It is also true that elections for City officials do not occur in the same year as State or federal elections, a fact that would tend to minimize the voting machine problem. For example, the 2003 elections will primarily be for elections to the City Council; there are no State or federal elections scheduled for next year. B. Electronic voting machines Federal legislation: Legislation is now pending in Congress to assist state and local governments nationwide in an effort to upgrade voting machines. The Senate bill, known as The Bipartisan Election Reform Bill (S. 565), will, among other things, provide $3.5 billion through grants to states and localities to improve voting systems. The  sponsors of the legislation in the Senate estimate that $3.5 billion will enable every locality in the nation to upgrade every voting machine, replacing older machinery with state of the art technology. These grants would be an 80%-20% federal-state match. Regardless of whether a state or locality uses the grant, states would have an obligation under the bill to meet certain standards regarding the quality of their voting systems. For example, by 2006 states must have voting systems in place that allow voters to verify their votes and to correct them before the votes are cast. The voting system must also conform to the error standards issued by the Federal Election Commission. The Senate bill mandates that, by 2004, states must be able to permit a voter who appears at the polls on election day to vote provisionally, even if there is no registration on file or it is alleged that the voter is ineligible.  96   This bill, and one passed by the House, are currently before a conference committee, and is expected to pass the full Congress in September. President Bush has already said he will sign the legislation. New York State Task Force on Electronic Modernization: In February 2001, Governor Pataki signed an executive order creating the New York State Task Force on Election Modernization, a bipartisan panel charged with examining methods for conducting and administering elections and making recommendations designed to ensure the accuracy and fairness of elections held throughout the State.64 The sevenmember task force issued its final report to the Governor on June 18, 2002.65 The report contains 64 recommendations and calls for dramatic reforms to modernize the State's election processes. The report recommends that each local board of elections, in consultation with the State Board, develop a plan, due by June 30, 2003, to gradually transition to full accessible electronic voting equipment , with a goal of substantial implementation in time for the 2004 presidential election. According to the report, the plans should include strategies for maintaining existing equipment during the transition, comprehensive voter outreach, and education and training of election personnel. Over the next several years, modernizing the State's voting systems and election process is expected to require more than $200 million in new resources and will require a federal, State and local partnership. Under the federal legislation currently pending before Congress, New York may be eligible for more than $135 million over the next several years to replace its voting machines and modernize its elections process. The report recommends that  64 65  www.state.ny.us/governor/electionmodernization. www.state.ny.us/governor/electionmodernization/PDFS/nystaskforce.pdf.  97   the State create an Election Modernization Capital Fund to leverage anticipated federal assistance.66 The report also recommends amending State law to allow the use in New York State of voting technologies that do not use full -face ballots, that is, where a full ballot is displayed on a single surface. full -face ballot. 68 67  New York State is one of only two states to require a  C. Other Practical Considerations The staff conveyed to the Commission its understanding that, if nonpartisan elections were adopted for the City, resources to procure new voting machines would be made available for implementing such a change. In addition, the staff compiled statistics relating to various voting machine issues.  Draft Charter Provisions: This section contains a draft Charter chapter instituting nonpartisan elections for City elective offices. The draft is followed by a discussion of the provisions. 1. Draft Nonpartisan Elections Chapter  Section one. The New York city charter is amended by adding a new chapter three to read as follows:  66  The City's Board of Elections developed a plan for an electronic voting system more than a decade ago, and entered into a contract for that system's development and implementation in 1993. A dispute arose, however, with a subcontractor developing some of the necessary software. The dispute led to a lawsuit, which was settled in only in the past few years. No contract is currently in place for electronic voting machines or an electronic voting system. 67 See 9 N.Y.C.R.R.  6209.2. 68 Id. at pp. 18 -29.  98   CHAPTER 3 ELECTION TO CITY OFFICE  60.

The persons named in such certificates shall be the persons nominated for such offices, respectively.  67. Vacancies; nomination. Vacancies in nominations made at the  nonpartisan election primary caused by death or disqualification or by declination authorized by section sixty- three shall be filled by the candidate or candidates who received the next largest number of votes at the nonpartisan election primary and who file with the board of elections a written consent to be nominated, duly acknowledged, not later than ten days after such death or disqualification, or four days before the election, whichever is earlier. If such candidate fails to file such cons ent, or files a duly acknowledged declination, within such period, then the candidate receiving the next largest number of votes who files such written consent within the time specified in the preceding sentence will fill the nomination vacancy. No vacanc y in a nomination may be filled pursuant to this subdivision where prohibited by section 6-150 of the election law. In the event that a vacancy in the nomination is filled in accordance with this 103   section, the board of elections shall promptly prepare and file an appropriate certificate of nomination in its own office and with the city clerk.  68. Nonpartisan general election.

No candidate for an office elected pursuant to this chapter may appear more than once on a primary ballot or general election ballot. Such ballot shall conform to sections sixty-eight , sixty- nine, and seventy of this chapter. h. Subdivision three of section 8-100 shall be deemed to include nonpartisan  primary elections and non partisan general elections held pursuant to this chapter. i. Subdivision one of section 8-500 shall be deemed to include nonpartisan  primary elections and nonpartisan general elections, provided, however, that in the general election, the rights provided to independent bodies pursuant to such subdivision shall be applied to candidates nominated pursuant to this chapter. j. Section 9-122 shall apply, provi ded that all votes of qualified voters shall be  counted for nonpartisan primary and general elections held pursuant to this chapter. k. Section 14-114 shall apply except as specified in section seventy one of this chapter. 2. Discussion Thi s section contains general provisions regarding the scope of the  Section 60:  chapter and its relation to the State Election Law. The chapter covers elections for mayor, comptroller, public advocate, council members, and borough presidents. The general theory of the Chapter is that, except where the Chapter provides otherwise, the provisions of the Election Law used to govern partisan elections also will be used for nonpartisan elections. Section 60 recognizes, however, that the Election Law has many references to party members throughout its provisions. Rather than specifically  addressing each one, the section deems Election Law references to party members to refer to qualified voters in New York City, when read in connection with offices covered 108   by the Chapter. The section also enables sections of the Election Law referenced in the Chapter to be amended without requiring the Charter also to be amended. Section 61: This section sets forth the basic rules for becoming a candidate in a  nonpartisan election. Under sub division (a), in order to run in a nonpartisan primary election, a candidate must be designated by a petition, the ""nonpartisan designating petition,"" containing the signatures of registered voters of the political unit for which the designation is made. As indicated in subdivision (b), nonpartisan designating petitions are analogous to independent nominating petitions under the Election Law, although the y are named ""nonpartisan designating petitions"" because they will be filled out at the same time that p artisan designating petitions -- used for candidates to get on the primary ballot for a party in partisan elections --will be filled out. This similarity to independent nominating petitions would help the public and the Board of Elections more readily understa nd and implement the new system. Subdivision (b) references Election Law  6 -142 for the number of signatures needed to get on the ballot for the nonpartisan primary election. Consistent with the general approach of analogizing to the independent nominati ng petition system, Section 6-142 is the provision for the number of signatures needed on an independent nominating petition to get on the ballot for various offices. It should be noted that, unlike for any other New York City office, the number of signatures needed for an independent nominating petition to get on the ballot for a City Council position (2,700) differs from the number of signatures needed for the same office for a partisan designating petition (900). Compare Election Law  6 -142(2)(d -1) a nd 6 -136(2)(c -1). Subdivision (c) sets forth many of the timing requirements for nonpartisan designating petitions. 109   Section 62:  This section sets forth provisions governing the form of nonpartisan  designating petitions. Except for the first paragraph, the form set forth in Election Law  6-140 for independent nominating petitions is used. In addition, in light of the Second Circuit's opinion in Lerman v. Board of Elections , 232 F.3d 135 (2d Cir. 2000), cert. den. , 533 U.S. 915 (2001) (invalidating requirement of Election Law  6-132(2) that witnesses to designating petitions be residents of the political subdivision in question), the requirement of Section 6-140 that the witness reside in the political unit in question is excepted out of Charter  62. See Election Law  6-140(1)(b) and 6 -138(1). Section 63: This section deals with vacancies in the designation to run for the  nonpartisan primary election. It sets forth the manner in which a person designated as a candidate for nomination may decline the designation, and how vacancies on the nonpartisan primary ballot caused by such declination, or any other reason, shall be filled. Section 64: In section 6-164, the Election Law provides the opportunity to avoid  uncontested primaries through the ""opportunity to ballot."" Section 64 of the draft does the same thing for the nonpartisan primary. Under this section, qualified voters may file a petition with the Board of Elections requesting the opportunity to write in the name of a candidate, who need not be specified, for the office in question. The number of  signatures needed for this type of petition is the same as the number needed for the nonpartisan designating petition. Upon receipt of such a petition by the Board of  Elections, the office is deemed conte sted, and the contest is resolved in the nonpartisan primary. Section 65: This section sets forth the basic provision for the nonpartisan  primary election. It is held at the time of the fall primary under the Election Law, and is 110   held in any year when a candidate for the office of mayor, comptroller, public advocate, council member, or borough president is to be elected. Section 66: This section authorizes the Board of Elections to conduct the  canvass of votes after the nonpartisan primary election, and directs the Board on how to certify the results. Section 66 provides that the candidates receiving the largest and next largest number of votes shall be the persons nominated for the office in question. Section 67: This section provides for filling vacancies in a nomination, i.e., after  the nonpartisan primary election. Basically, the person who receives the next largest number of votes at the nonpartisan primary gets the chance to consent to be nominated. Consistent with Election Law  6-150, vacancies that occur shortly before the election may not be filled. Section 68: This section provides for the nonpartisan general election, at which  the persons whose names appear on the ballot for a given office will be the persons who were nominated at the nonpartisan primary election. Section 69: This is the section that makes the nonpartisan primary and general It prohibits the placement of any partisan, party, or  election ballots nonpartisan.  independent body identification, symbol, or emblem on the ballot or voting machine at any such elections for offices covered by the Chapter. Section 70: This section sets forth the order of names on ballots for nonpartisan  primary elections and nonpartisan general elections, and is necessary in light of Election Law  7-116, which takes party strength into account in determining the placement of names on the ballot. This section also sets forth the requirement that the nonpartisan elections should be separated on the ballot from partisan elections.  111   Section 71:  Subdivision (a) relates to the campaign finance provisions of the  Election Law. In general, this subdivision adopts the contribution and receipt limitations set forth in the Election Law, except that it makes them applicable to nonpartisan primaries and nonpartisan gene ral elections. The major difference from the Election Law is that this section deems references in Election Law  14-114(1)(b) to enrolled voters in the candidate's party in the relevant district to mean the number of registered voters in the district. S ubdivision (b) relates to the provisions in the Charter and It  Administrative Code relating to the City's voluntary campaign finance system.  generally makes the system applicable to nonpartisan elections, and directs the Campaign Finance Board to promulgate rules to make the system work for nonpartisan elections. Section 72: This section makes the nonpartisan election system applicable to  the succession rules in the event of vacancies in City elective offices. Section 73 and 74: These sections, which set forth the provisions of the Election Law that are inapplicable or modified for the purposes of nonpartisan elections under the Chapter, are provided to avoid the problem illustrated in Bareham v City of Rochester, 246 N.Y. 140 (1927). In Bareham, Rocheste r's failure to name the sections it was modifying or superseding led the Court of Appeals to strike down that city's nonpartisan election system, notwithstanding the fact that the Court thought such a system could legally be adopted by local law. Although the State's home rule provisions have been amended, since Bareham, to provide that the failure to specify the changed or superseded State law provisions ""shall not affect the validity of such local law,"" Municipal Home Rule Law  22(1), State law still requires the locality to specify the affected sections. Id. 112   PART V City Agency Submissions And Public Proposals Agency Submissions The Commission also considered proposals submitted by City agencies. The Commission staff made two oral presentations on those proposals it received prior to August 21, 2001 at public meetings of the Commission. The Commission considered both the written and oral testimony that it received on these issues. At a public meeting on August 23, 2002 the Commission determined that it would not submit the proposals submitted by City agencies or the public for referendum this year. As many of these proposals would make important changes to the Charter to enhance significantly the operations of City agencies, the Commission recommends that the following proposals be considered by a future Commission. The Commission further recommends that all other issues deferred by previous Commissions also be reviewed by a future Commission. DEPARTMENT OF BUILDINGS  Clarify DOB's Subpoena Power  Issue: Should the Charter be amended to clarify the Department of Building's (""DOB"") subpoena power so that it is not limited only to cases ""where the public safety is involved""? Relevant Charter Provision:  646. Discussion: Charter  646 provides that the Buildings Commissioner ""shall have the power and duty to conduct such inquiries as may assist him or her in the performance of  113   the functions of the department where the public safety is involved and for such purpose he shall have subpoena power to compel the attendance of witnesses, to administer oaths, examine witnesses and to compel the production of books, papers and documents."" The Department of Buildings has proposed removing the requirement that the subpoena power be available to the Commissioner only when performing the functions of the Department that involve public safety. Under the current Charter provision, subpoenaed parties have questioned DOB's authority to demand certain records which, on their face, do not appear to relate to public safety. For example, the Department's Investigations and Discipline Unit may seek to subpoena the telephone records of a contractor or professional in the course of an investigation. While this may not at first appear to be a public safety issue, where the underlying investigation concerns unsafe or illegal work, there may in fact be important public safety issues and concerns that exist. To address such concerns, DOB has proposed removing the public safety limitation to allow it to perform its investigations without unnecessary delay and without being subject to legal challenges concerning subpoena authority.  CONFLICTS OF INTEREST BOARD  Assured Funding  Issue: Should the Charter be amended to assure funding for COIB? Relevant Charter Provision:  2602. Discussion: The City's Conflicts of Interest Board (""COIB""), established in Charter Chapter 68, proposes that its independence be established explicitly in the Charter by providing for an assured source of funding. As an independent ethics agency, COIB has 114   no natural constituency and no source of revenue. This position is complicated by the fact that it regulates the very people who set its budget. Thus, it could be argued that COIB's continued survival requires a source of assured financing. There are several options to be considered that could provide assured funding. One possibility is making the agency self-funding, for example, by charging all of COIB's 12,000 financial disclosure form filers a filing fee or by requiring short form disclosure by all public servants, accompanied by a nominal filing fee. The Ohio Ethics Commission receives substantial funds in this manner, although most of the filing fees are paid by the filer's agency. Another possibility is a guaranteed minimum budget. Such a provision might read: ""The appropriations available to pay for the expenses of the board during each fiscal year shall not be less than six one thousandths of one percent of the net total expense budget of the city."" See the provisions for the Independent Budget Office (Charter  259(b)), whose budget must be at least 10% of the budget of the Office of Management and Budget. See also Mich. Const. Art. XI,  5 (requiring that the  legislature appropriate to the Michigan Civil Service Commission ""a sum not less than one percent of the aggregate payroll of the classified service for the preceding fiscal year""). Under this option, every billion-dollar decrease in the City's budget would decrease the Board's budget by $60,000; the City's Fiscal Year 2003 budget would provide COIB with a budget of about $2.5 million. Another form of an assured budget could provide a specific dollar amount, adjusted for inflation. Such a provision might read: ""The appropriations available to pay for the expenses of the conflicts of interest board during each fiscal year shall not be less than two million five hundred thousand dollars, which amount shall be adjusted 115   annually to reflect changes in the consumer price index for the metropolitan New York region published by the United States bureau of labor statistics."" The adjustment language in that alternative provision is taken from current Charter  2603(a) (adjustment to threshold for ""ownership interest""). See , e.g., Calif. Gov't Code  83122 (guaranteeing a budget of $1,000,000 for fiscal year 1975-1976, adjusted for cost-of-living changes during each fiscal year thereafter, for the California Fair Political Practices Commission). COIB argues that such an increase in its budget, prudently spent, could cover the additional responsibilities given to the Board under Charter amendments presently being considered by the Board. It should be emphasized that such a provision only would set a n assured minimum budget; the City could adopt a larger budget for the Board in any particular year. Likely, the most desirable option for COIB would be an option that provides for submission of the Board's proposed budget to the Council, without amendment by the administration. This proposal is identical to the budget scheme adopted for the Campaign Finance Board in Charter  1052(12)(c), with the addition of a provision governing midyear modifications to the Board's budget. The Board's proposed budget would be public and any reductions would require affirmative action, reducing the likelihood of ill-advised cuts, while preserving the budget authority established by Chapter 10 of the Charter.  The COIB Member Nomination Process Issue: Should the Charter be amended to give the City Council and the Mayor more parity in the nomination process for the members of the C onflicts of Interest Board? Relevant Charter Provision:  2602. Discussion: To further insure impartiality and independence COIB has addressed the issue that the City Council and the Mayor be given parity in the nomination process for 116   COIB members. Prese ntly the Mayor appoints the five members of the Board ""with the advice and consent of the council"" ( 2602 (a)). It should be noted that the former Council Speaker recommended that the Council make some of the appointments to the Board. However, split appointments  some by the mayor and some by the Council - present the danger of politicizing Board appointments and undermining accountability, a charge often leveled at the Board of Education prior to the recent amendments, largely as a result of its split appointment process. As an alternative, appointments could be made only upon the recommendation of an independent body, similar to a judicial screening committee. For example,  commissioners of the Hawaii State Ethics Commission are appointed by the gover nor from a panel of ten persons nominated by the judicial council, an advisory body appointed by the Hawaii Supreme Court. See Hawaii Revised Statutes  84-21(a) and 601-4. Such a screening committee could be established for appointments to the Board and to other similar non-mayoral boards and commissions; the members of such a body could be appointed by each citywide elected official (mayor, speaker, comptroller and public advocate), perhaps with two mayoral appointments, one of whom would be the chair.  COIB Clarifying Amendments  Issue: Should the Charter be amended to clarify that (1) a COIB member can act as lobbyist on his or her behalf before the City; and (2) the staff director should be known as the executive director instead of counsel? Relevant C harter Provision:  2602. Discussion: COIB proposes that the Charter  2602(b) be amended to clarify that a Board member cannot act as a paid lobbyist on behalf of someone else but may act as a lobbyist on his or her own behalf, but not before the Board i n violation of  2604(b)(6). 117   COIB also proposes that the term ""counsel,"" which was carried over to COIB from its predecessor, the Board of Ethics, be replaced with the term ""executive director,"" as the person who shall serve as the staff director. First, the amendment reflects that the size and mission of the Conflicts of Interest Board are larger than that of the Board of Ethics. Second, it gives the Board the freedom to hire a qualified non- lawyer for the position of executive director. DEPARTMENT OF F INANCE  Uniform Right to Appeal from Determinations of the Tax Appeals Tribunal  Issue: Should the Charter be amended to permit appeals from the Tax Appeals tribunal by both the taxpayers and the Commissioner of Finance? Relevant Charter Provision:  171. Discussion: Charter  168 provides for an independent Tax Appeals Tribunal within the Department of Finance. The Charter specifies that the ""powers, functions, duties and obligations of the tribunal shall be separate from and independent of the authority of the commissioner of finance."" The Charter establishes that the Tribunal has jurisdiction to hear and determine cases initiated by the filing of petitions protesting notices issued by the Finance Commissioner for which taxpayers have the right to a hearing, including ""any notice of determination of a tax due, a tax deficiency, or a denial of a refund or credit application"" that relate to excise taxes, vault charges and taxes other than taxes on real property such as the City's business taxes. Charter 171 provides that decisions of the Tribunal are final and specifies that such Tribunal decisions are subject to judicial review pursuant to Article 78 of the Civil Practice Law and Rules. However, this right to judicial review is inequitably afforded  118   only to the taxpayer and not to the Commissioner of Finance. Specifically, Charter 171(b) provides that ""each decision of the tribunal, shall finally and irrevocably decide all the issues raised in the proceedings before it, unless the petitioner who commenced the proceeding seeks judicial review of any such decision in the manner provided in article seventy-eight of the civil practice law and rules within four months after the giving of the notice of such decision."" (emphasis added). Because the Charter specifies that the opportunity to appeal is limited to the petitioner who commenced the proceeding, which in such proceedings is the taxpayer, the City is left without any opportunity to challenge decisions of the independent tribunal. As the Tribunal is an independent entity, and in order to ensure fairness, both parties should have the same right to appeal. The ability to appeal such decisions is necessary for the Department of Finance to fairly administer and properly implement the City's tax laws on behalf of all taxpayers. To remedy this inequity, the Department of Finance has proposed amending Charter  171 to provide that both the Commissioner of Finance as well as the petitioner may seek judicial review of determinations. It is important to note that when the voters originally approved the creation of the Tax Appeals Tribunal to hear City excise tax appeals in the 1988 referendum, Charter  171 as approved explicitly permitted both the Commissioner of Finance and the taxpayer to appeal tribunal decisions. In 1992, however, when the Tribunal's jurisdiction was expanded to include City business taxes, Charter  171 was legislatively amended to limit the right to appeal to the petitioner who commenced the proceeding, thus preventing the Commissioner of Finance from appealing Tribunal determinations (Ch. 808 L. 1992). The Commission's staff believes that there may be issues concerning  119   whether this proposed change would require State law.  When this proposal is  considered by a future Commission, the staff recomme nds reviewing that issue.  Administration and Enforcement of the Payment made by Non-Resident City Employees as a Condition of City Employment  Issue: Should the Charter be amended in relation to the administration and enforcement of the payment that nonresident City employees make as a condition of their employment? Relevant Charter Provision:  1127. Discussion: Charter  1127 provides in relevant part that ""every person seeking employment with the city of New York or any of its agencies regardless of civi l service classification or status shall sign an agreement as a condition precedent to such employment to the effect that if such person is or becomes a nonresident individual . . . during employment by the city, such person will pay to the city an amount by which a city personal income tax on residents computed and determined as if such person were a resident individual, as defined in such section, during such employment, exceeds the amount of any city earnings tax and city personal income tax imposed on such person for the same taxable period."" 70  This amount is not a tax but a contractual obligation  from which the City derived more than $60 million in revenue in 2001. Since the Department of Finance has administered the  1127 program, it has been the sub ject of much debate, confusion and litigation in a number of areas including its applicability to certain classes of public servants. Further study of whether a  clarification of this Charter provision is needed should be done by another Commission.  70  Added by Local Law No. 2 of 1973, employees hired prior to and continuously employed since January 4, 1973 are exempt from the requirement.  120     Require Delinquent Taxpayers to pay the City's Collection Costs  Issue: Should the Charter be amended to ensure that the City's collection costs for the enforcement of judgments and tax warrants are paid by the delinquent taxpayers, instead of by all taxpayers? Relevant Charter Provision:  1527. Discussion: Charter 1527(1) permits the ""[Finance] commissioner [to] enter into contracts with collection agencies for the collection of (i) any or all tax warrants and judgments for all city taxes subject to collection by the department, other than real property taxes, or (ii) city water and sewer charges, or both . . . ."". Such contracts are necessary to ensure that where there is an outstanding tax warrant or judgment against a delinquent taxpayer, the City is actually able to collect the amounts due. The Department of Finance has entered into such contracts, which have successfully enabled the City to recover amounts due from delinquent taxpayers. Charter 1527(3) specifies that ""[t] he consideration to be paid to such collection agency may be a percentage or percentages of the amount collected by such agency, or as otherwise provided in the contract, but shall be within the amount appropriated and available for such purpose."" The result is that all City taxpayers, rather than the delinquent taxpayer, pay these costs of collection. To ensure that the collection agency costs are paid by the responsible parties whose failure to pay the amounts due required the City to incur such additional collection costs, the Department of Finance proposes passing such costs on to the debtors. These additional collection costs would be collected in the same manner in which the underlying delinquent taxes are collected. The Department of Finance estimates that this would provide a savings of approximately $3 million per year. 121   This proposal also would place more fairly the cost for the City's collection efforts on the tax delinquents, and not on the many City taxpayers who fully and responsibly pay their taxes. Charging the taxpayer for the increased collection costs would serve as an incentive for the taxpayer to pay the Department of Finance, as it will cost the taxpayer more to wait and ultimately pay the collection agency. It should be noted that where the City sells tax liens on real property to enforce the payment of qualifying delinquent real property taxes and/or water and sewer charges and other related charges, Administrative Code 11-332 specifically permits the tax lien certificate holder ""to receive and retain a surcharge"" on the lien. The Code also specifies that the sold tax lien will include, in addition to unpaid charges ""the costs of any advertisements and notices given pursuant to this chapter [and] any surcharge pursuant to  11-332 . . ."" Therefore, with respect to delinquent real property taxes and related charges, the local law already provides that certain increased collection costs resulting from additional collection efforts incurred by the City will be charged to the delinquent taxpayer. This proposal would simila rly serve as an important incentive for delinquent taxpayers against whom tax warrants and judgments have been issued for unpaid taxes to pay the Department of Finance, rather than waiting and paying the collection agency.  DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND MENTAL HYGIENE  Issue: Establish a Consistent Uniform Maximum Penalty for the Enforcement of Violations of the Various Public Health Laws Should the Charter be amended to establish uniform maximum penalties for  violations of the various public health laws and regulations by increasing from $1,000 to  122   $2,000 the maximum penalty that may be imposed by the Commissioner of Health and Mental Hygiene for the violation of any provision of Chapter 22 of the Charter or any notice, order or regulation issued pursuant such provision? Relevant Charter Provision:  555(b)(2). Discussion: There does not currently exist a uniform maximum penalty applicable to  the various provisions of law enforced by the Commissioner of Health and Mental Hygiene. Pursuant to  12(1) of the New York State Public Health Law, violations of the New York State Sanitary Code, much of which is enforced in the City by the Commissioner of Health and Mental Hygiene, may be penalized by fines up to a maximum amount of $2,000. Pursuant to Section 3.12(a) of the New York City Health Code, as amended by a resolution of the Board of Health on April 26, 1994, violations thereunder may also be penalized by fines up to a maximum amount of $2,000. However, Charter 555(b)(2) provides that the regulations promulgated by the Commissioner of Health and Mental Hygiene to implement requirements found in the Charter and the New York City Administrative Code may only be enforced by penalties of up to $1,000. The regulations of the Commissioner of Health and Mental Hygiene, which currently number more than twenty, are set forth in Title 24 of the Rules of the City of New York and relate to subjects as varied as window guard enforcement, enforcement of the Smoke Free Air Act and mobile food vendors. To create uniform maximum penalties applicable to the various laws and regulations enforced by the Commissioner of Health and Mental Hygiene, the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene has proposed amending Charter  555(b)(2) to increase from $1,000 to $2,000 the maximum amount which may be imposed for the violation of regulations promulgated by the Commissioner to implement requirements of the Charter and the 123   New York City Administrative Code. The $1,000 maximum has been in effect since 1977 (Local Law 25 of 1977).  DEPAR TMENT OF HOUSING PRESERVATION AND DEVELOPMENT  Deputy Commissioners  Issue: Should the Charter be amended to provide HPD the authority to appoint deputy commissioners as needed? Relevant Charter Provision:  1801. Discussion: Charter  1801 limits to five the number of deputy commissioners that may be appointed at HPD. HPD proposes that the language be made less limiting to reflect the flexibility needed to operate a large agency with many discrete functions. HPD would like to appoint deputy commissione rs ""as may be necessary.""  Jurisdiction  Issue: Should the Charter be amended to clarify HPD's jurisdiction? Relevant Charter Provision:  1802. Discussion: Charter  1802(3) gives HPD ""all powers, rights and duties as provided by any federal, state or lo cal law or resolution, relating to slum clearance . . . urban renewal . . . (and) public housing."" HPD proposes that its Charter language be clarified by  cross-referencing specifically General Municipal Law Article 16 which authorizes HPD to sell property, make loans and grant tax exemptions. HPD also requests clarification concerning its authority to administer tax exemption and abatement programs. Presently, Charter  1802 (6)(b) authorizes HPD to administer these programs pursuant to the following language:  124   administer laws authorizing tax exemption or tax abatement or both, including but not limited to, section 11-243 of the administrative code of the city of New York and section four hundred twenty one of the real property tax law [RPTL], which are in aid of construction, rehabilitation, alteration or improvement of residential buildings and structures . . . HPD would like the specific references to RPTL  421 and Administrative Code  11-243, in this section removed because they no longer reflect accurately HPD's authority and obligations regarding tax incentive programs. First, the reference to RPTL  421 is erroneous because that section is now blank. Second, HPD's authority to administer tax programs has expanded beyond  Administrative Code  11-243; HPD now administers tax programs set forth in Administrative Code  11-241 through 11 -245. HPD would like to replace the  inaccurate and outdated references with broad, open-ended, language regarding its mandate to administer tax programs generally that would permit HPD to create and administer new tax incentive programs as needed. Additionally, HPD proposes that Charter 1802 state specifically that HPD may administer loan programs.  Reducing Approval Requirements for Small Emergency Purchases  Issue: Should the Charter be amended to exempt small purchases, which are also emergency purchases, from approval by the Corporation Counsel and the Comptroller? Relevant Charter Provision:  315. Discussion: Charter Chapter 13 governs procurement. Section 315 provides for  ""[e]mergency procurement"" and requires approval for emergency purchases from the Comptroller and Corporation Counsel regardless of the dollar amount at stake. HPD  proposes to eliminate the requirement for approval by the Comptroller and the Corporation Counsel in situations involving small dollar amounts. The dollar amount threshold for small  125   purchases is established by the Procurement Policy Board (""PPB"") pursuant to Charter  314. The current small purchase limit is $25,000 for goods, $50,000 for services and $100,000 for construction and construction-related services and information technology. Presently, the Charter requires approval from the Corporation Counsel and the Comptroller for all emergency purchases. HPD's proposal would authorize PPB to  establish small emergency purchase rules eliminating the current approval requirement and making them apply only in specific circumstances, such as for purchases that do not exceed the small purchase limits.  Issue: 71  Clarifying that the Requirement to Obtain an Appraisal for the Disposition of Real Property is Limited in its Scope Should the Charter be amended to clarify specifically when appraisals are  required as a predicate to disposition of city property? Relevant Charter Provision:  384. Discussion: Presently, Charter Chapter 15, entitled ""Property of the City"" sets forth  384 as follows: Disposal of the property of the City. a. No real property of the city may be sold, leased, exchanged or otherwise disposed of except with the approva l of the mayor and as may be provided by law unless such power is expressly vested by law in another agency. b. Except as otherwise specifically provided by law: . . . 3. Real property of the city may be sold only after appraisal made within six months prior to the authorization of the sale and after a review of such appraisal by the department of citywide services within thirty days prior to the authorization of the sale, provided that advertisement for the public auction for such sale shall be commenced wi thin sixty days of such authorization. 71  HPD submitted the text of what it states is a former PPB rule: Section 3-08(i) once provided that ""[e]mergency purchases shall be made in accordance with Section 3-06 of these Rules, except that the approval of the Comptroller and the Corporation Counsel is not required for emergency purchases which are less than or equal to the small purchase limits."" This rule was repealed by current Charter  315. HPD contends that the rule worked well and should be readopted.  126   HPD finds the provision ambiguous because the final clause of subsection ""3,"" quoted above, appears to limit the provision to auction sales. However, the provision may be read as a general requirement. HPD seeks language that would eliminate the ambiguity. HPD presents a proposed amendment to  384 which clarifies that the provision does not create a general requirement for an appraisal. The new language makes clear that only in instances where the property is disposed of by auction, pursuant to the provision itself, is an appraisal required. HPD no longer disposes of property pursuant to Charter  384. The proposed change would make clear that HPD is not required to obtain a prior appraisal, which can often be very costly for the City, in all circumstances .  Updating Provisions Relating to the Prohibition of Certain City Employees from Participating in Public Auctions, Sealed Bids, and Negotiated Sales of City-Owned Real Property  Issue: Should the Charter be amended to (1) make clarifying amendments reflecting accurately the administrative structure of HPD; and (2) prohibit employees of another division of HPD from participating in negotiated sales of City-owned residential buildings containing six or less dwelling units if such employees participated in decisions affecting the property? Relevant Charter Provisions:  2604(c). Discussion: Charter  2604 is part of the Conflicts of Interest Law and imposes various restrictions on the activities of City employees . Section 2604(c)(7) prohibits certain City employees from bidding on and purchasing City-owned real property at a public auction or sealed bid sale, or purchasing any City-owned residential building  127   containing six or less dwelling units through a negotiated sale, if such employees participated in decisions affecting the property. HPD suggests a division of HPD, the Office of Development, be added to the groups of employees prohibited from participating in negotiated sales because that division handles such transactions. Furthermore, the reference to HPD's Office of  Property Management (""OPM"") relating to auctions or sealed bids in  2604(c)(7) is outdated and should be omitted because OPM no longer exists and the auction sales program it administered was d iscontinued a decade ago. HPD also recommends that the prohibition regarding negotiated sales be separated from the prohibition relating to buying City-owned property at a public auction or sealed bid sale in  2604(c)(7) and moved to its own separate section succeeding the public auction/sealed bid section.  Issue: Demolition of Buildings Pursuant to DOB Emergency Orders Should the Charter be amended to authorize the Department of Design and  Construction (""DDC"") to perform demolitions and related actions in response to Department of Buildings (""DOB"") emergency orders? Relevant Charter Provisions:  1202(a). Discussion: Currently, HPD or the Department of Citywide Administrative Services (""DCAS"") may demolish buildings pursuant to the precept process. In that process DOB notifies a landlord of the hazardous condition(s) on a property and a survey is conducted and presented at court. The court then determines the remedial action to be taken which may include demolition. DOB also can issue emergency orders to mandate the immediate demolition of a building. Although there are currently no provisions that identify the agency responsible for such demolition in an emergency situation, HPD has 128   effectively taken the sole responsibility for such demolitions despite their complicated nature. DDC, however, which is responsible for street, sewer, water main and most non- housing building construction, funded by the capital budget, has more architectural expertise and technical skills to demolish buildings on an emergency basis, particularly with regard to buildings with complex structures. Because DDC has greater expertise than HPD in this area, HPD contends it would be more efficient for DDC to be authorized to handle these demolitions. In order to recoup the costs of this demolition, HPD recommends that the DDC Commissioner be permitted to impose and collect charges for the work, and file liens for these costs.  DEPARTMENT OF INVESTIGATION (""DOI"") Issue: Should the Charter be amended to incorporate and expand the provisions of the City's Whistleblower Law to protect all City employees, including employees of quasimunicipal agencies? Relevant Charter Provision: Chapter 49. Discussion: The City's Whistleblower Law is codified at Administrative Code  12 -113 and prohibits certain City agencies from taking an adverse retaliatory personnel action against an officer or employee who reports information to DOI concerning conduct which he or she knows or reasonably believes to involve corrupt or criminal activity or a conflict of interest. The law is limited in its applicability to officers or employees of ""an agency of the city, the head or members of which are appointed by the mayor."" Thus, employees of the Comptroller, the Borough Presidents, the City Council, the Public Advocate or any quasi-City agency such as the Economic Development Corporation (""EDC""), the 129   Housing Development Corporation (""HDC""), Off -Track Betting Corporation (""OTB""), and Business Improvement Districts (""BIDs""), are not afforded whistleblower protection under City law. However, all City employees play an essential role in providing  information about fraud, corruption and mismanagement, including those who work in the offices of elected officials, as well as those who work in government-created entiti es that perform municipal functions. Accordingly, DOI proposes that the Commission  amend the current law and recodify it in the Charter. First, DOI proposes that the requirement that covered individuals be employed by an agency of the City, ""the head or members of which are appointed by the mayor,"" be deleted, and that the term ""agency"" be expanded to include not only mayoral agencies, but also the offices of elected officials and quasi-City agencies, including BIDs. Second, DOI proposes that the scope of the type of information that may be reported (e.g., criminal activity, etc.) by an individual that would enable him or her to claim whistleblower protection be expanded to include ""gross mismanagement"" and ""abuse of authority"" in order to conform the scope of whistleblower protections found in Executive Order 78 of 1984. Finally, DOI suggests that its proposals be recodified in Charter Chapter 49 because that chapter already includes several provisions relating to employee integrity. In particular, Charter  1116, inter alia, makes fraud by a council member, officer, or employee of the City a misdemeanor and bars anyone convicted from office or employment. Charter  1128 prohibits interference with any investigation pursuant to the Charter and demands full cooperation with DOI by every officer and employee of the City.  130   OFFICE OF ADMINISTRATIVE TRIALS AND HEARINGS The Office of Administrative Trials and Hearings (""OATH"") was established by Executive Order No. 32 in 1979, and was codified in Charter Chapter 45-A by the 1989 Charter revision. As stated in Mayor Koch's memorandum accompanying the executive order, administrative trials in the City had previously ""too often been characterized by procedural shortcomings and inconsistent, judicially reversible results."" The Mayor's goal, therefore, was to establish OATH as a centralized tribunal, in order ""to reform the due process trial system."" As an alternative to litigation, administrative trials are  invaluable as a means of dispute resolution, because they provide, in comparison to litigation in court, a relatively quick and simple means of resolving disputes. See  generally ""Alternative Dispute Resolution: Panacea or Anathema?"" 99 Harv. L. Rev. 668 (1986). The keys to OATH's structure are its impartiality and independence. In Executive Order No. 32, Mayor Koch mandated that all of OATH's administrative law judges (""ALJs"") ""maintain the standard of, and preside over administrative trials and hearings in accordance with the Canons of the Code of Judicial Conduc t of the American Bar Association."" OATH was made a Charter agency pursuant to the 1989 Charter revision. Part of that Charter Revision Commission's goal was to establish OATH as ""an independent adjudicative body that [could] be a resource to agencies conducting their adjudications, while at the same time establishing an independent structure outside of the agency to provide an unbiased assessment of the matters to be adjudicated."" Report of the Charter Revision Commission, Vol. 2 at p. 103 (April 1989). Since that time, OATH has become an integral part of City government. It hears over 2,000 cases per year, on behalf of numerous mayoral and non- mayoral agencies. 131   In most cases, OATH prepares findings of fact plus a recommendation as to the proper determination of the case. The agency involved in the adjudication then determines whether to accept, reject, or modify the recommendation. The agency's determination is subject to challenge in court under Article 78 of the Civil Procedure Law and Rules. In addition to the obvious value that OATH's role plays in City government, perhaps one measure of its success is that many agencies have chosen to hold their administrative trials and hearings at OATH. Despite its success, OATH's experience has shown that its current Charter provisions may not give it the administrative flexibility it requires to best serve the needs of the City's agencies and employees. Therefore, OATH has proposed changes to Chapter 45 -A that would enable this flexibility.  Issue: Should the Charter be amended to provide OATH with administrative flexibility to allow it to best serve the needs of the City? Relevant Charter Provisions: Chapter 45-A. Discussion: Under Charter 1049(1), each OATH ALJ must be an attorney admitted to practice in New York State for at least five years. In addition, each ALJ is appointed for a term of five years, and is removable only for cause after notice and an opportunity to be heard. These provisions help ensure the quality and independence of the ALJs. The f - year term, in particular, helps ensure independence, because it shields the ive ALJs from immediate retribution for unpopular findings or recommendations. However, the five - year term also has limited the administration of OATH, perhaps in unnecessary ways .  132   OATH has submitted two major proposals regarding the five - year term. The first is to allow the Chief ALJ to appoint temporary ALJs (who would not have the fixed term), in addition to the staff of full- time ALJs. In addition to the Chief and the Deputy Chief, OATH currently has eight ALJs hearing cases. Because this is not a large corps of ALJs, any temporary drop in staffing (e.g. sick leave or maternity leave) results in an assignment of new cases and redistribution of older cases that has a relatively large impact on the remaining ALJs. These temporary problems could be efficiently dealt with if the Chief ALJ had the ability to appoint temporary ALJs to handle these uncovered cases. Furthermore, the ability to appoint temporary ALJs would allow OATH to more efficiently handle unexpected or seasonal influxes of cases. For example, the City, State, and Board of Education are currently considering whether OATH should hear certain Board cases involving special education. Should OATH be designated to hear these cases, its caseload would more than double and there would be a particularly difficult seasonal spike in the late spring and summer. Considering the importance of these cases and the need to resolve them within a short period of time, the ability to hire temporary ALJs is crucial. OATH's other proposal regarding the five - year term involves creating a one - year term to which a newly appointed ALJ would be appointed, followed by an appointment to the five - year term. While an ALJ, in either type of te rm, would be removable only for cause, creation of an initial one - year term would allow OATH to determine, based on actual experience with the work of the new ALJ, whether his or her work was of sufficiently high caliber to merit reappointment. This process of an initial one - year term,  133   with subsequent longer terms, is presently used by the New Jersey Office of Administrative Law, New Jersey's central administrative hearings office. 72  When OATH was established, Executive Order No. 32 required that its Admini strative Law Judges comply with the Canons of Judicial Conduct. While OATH's judges adhere currently to the highest levels of ethical judicial conduct, OATH requests that that requirement be codified symbolically in the Charter. Finally, OATH requests that the Charter provision which establishes its adjudicatory standard be more clearly stated. Presently the provision governing its adjudicatory standards (Chapter 45-A,  1049 (2)) references OATH's adjudicatory standard as that contained in Chapter 45 of the Charter. That Chapter contains the entire City Administrative Procedures Act (""CAPA""). Section 1146 therein governs  adjudication standards. OATH requests that the specific section regarding adjudication be the reference rather than all of CAPA.  DEPARTMENT OF PARKS AND RECREATION  Retention of Funds Generated by Fees, Permits, Environmental Control Board (""ECB"") Penalties, and Litigation Regarding Tree Damage  Issue: Should the Charter be amended to permit the Parks Department (""Parks"") to deposit into a Parks account rather than the City's General Fund the following: 1) concession fees and special events payments; and 2) money collected from penalties resulting from ECB summonses for violations of Parks rules and affirmative litigation awards regarding tree damage or similar cases? Relevant Charter Provision:  109.  72  See New Jersey Permanent Statutes, Title 52, Section 52:14F- 4.  134   Discussion: The operation of concession services and special events requires a significant amount of management. In addition, the operation of special events  ultimately contributes to the deterioration of Parks property. In order to provide Parks the incentive to increase concessions revenue and to effectively prevent special events from causing long - term damage to Parks property, such concession fees and special events payments could be specifically earmarked to pay for the enhanced maintenance and upkeep of Parks property, such as re-sodding grass and replacing plantings. In addition, the money collected from summonses and litigation relating to damage to City trees could be expressly given to Parks for forestry related expenses, such as replanting trees and maintenance of City trees. Such an amendment would provide greater incentives for Parks to generate revenue and would enable Parks to more immediately see the financial impact of enforcement efforts (i.e. tree damage cases). If this exception to 109 is viewed as too broad, then Parks proposes that a certain percentage of the above revenue be retained by Parks. Moreover, Parks could dedicate all or a portion of these dedicated funds to specific Mayoral priorities, including developing waterfront parks or extending the service hours at playgrounds. Registration of Concession Agreements Issue: Should the Charter be amended to exempt Parks concession agreements from the City contrac t registration process? Relevant Charter Provision:  375. Discussion: Parks contends that its revenue and administrative functions would be made more efficient if all concession agreements, or at least concessions which earn less than $100,000 in revenue for the City, were exempt from the registration process. Registering concession agreements, where the City receives money, does not present 135   the same oversight concerns as those present in contracts where the City expends money. Moreover, the administrative expense and aggravation involved in registering every pushcart or other small concession far exceeds any benefit from the Comptroller's oversight of this large volume of concessions through the registration process. For  example, Parks managed approximately 188 small concession agreements, 90 temporary use concession agreements, and 170 special event vending permits in 2001. For many of these contracts, the City gets as little as $50-$1,000 in fees. The Comptroller's Office requires such concession agreements to be submitted 30 days before the implementation of the agreement. However, the registration process is extremely time-consuming because it requires the input of a large amount of data. Required strict compliance with the registration process wi ll likely delay the City's receipt of this revenue source. This proposed amendment would purportedly lower administrative and bureaucratic costs only with a slight concomitant decrease in financial oversight. Further, Parks is already charged with reporti ng regularly the revenue earned by such concession agreements to the Comptroller's Office, and therefore the Comptroller's Office would retain its ability to monitor these contracts. In addition, the Comptroller's Office would also still be able to conduc t audits of such contracts. In the alternative, Parks proposes that such concession agreements be subject to self- registration, whereby Parks inputs the relevant information to register a contract into the Comptroller's Office database, and the contract is deemed to be automatically registered. Although inputting such data would usually take about an hour, self-  registration still would stream -line the current 30 day registration process and eliminate unproductive delays. 136     Use of Board of Education Property When Property is not in Use  Issue: Should the Charter be amended to give Parks jurisdiction to maintain and program activities on playgrounds and playing fields that are currently under the control of the Board of Education at those times when school programs are not taking place (i.e., weekends and school vacation periods)? Relevant Charter Provisions:  521, 533. Discussion: The demand for Parks to provide youth athletic programs and playing fields is extremely high, particularly during the summer. However, many of the playgrounds and playfields of the Board of Education are not in use in the summer, and Parks' use of this property would expand its ability to provide youth athletic programs and playing fields for permitted activities throughout the City.  Issue: Authority to Value and Sell Parks Memorabilia and/or Artifacts Should the Charter be amended to authorize the Department of Citywide  Administrative Services' (""DCAS"") to issue waivers regarding the salvage process to other City agencies? Relevant Charter Provision:  811. Discussion: Currently, DCAS is responsible for receiving unwanted equipment from other agencies and for determining whether the equipment should be auctioned, reassigned or destroyed. However, Parks has the expertise necessary to assign the appropriate value for a variety of memorabilia or artifacts that are not otherwise easy to value under the DCAS salvage process, such as old stadium seats, signs, and statutes, etc. Such objects have value for collectors and often can ge nerate a much higher  revenue than what the City receives through the DCAS salvage process. Therefore, in order to ease the significant burden the salvage responsibility imposes on DCAS and to 137   generate more revenue for the City by capitalizing on Parks' expertise of specialty items, DCAS should be provided with the authority to issue waivers of its responsibility to salvage equipment to other City agencies.73 In this way, other agencies, such as Parks, with specialized expertise in specific items, would be able to value and sell the objects at a more competitive rate. Under these proposals, all revenue generated by the sale of such specialty items would be placed in the City's General Fund.  Issue: Adding the Parks Commissioner to the Environmental Control Board Should the Charter be amended to add the Parks Commissioner to the  Environmental Control Board (""ECB"")? Relevant Charter Provisions:  1404. Discussion: The ECB has the authority to issue rules and regulations regarding many environmental topics, i ncluding air and water pollution, hazardous materials, defacement of City property. It also serves as an administrative tribunal for various environmental violations. Parks plays an important role in enforcing and helping to promulgate rules and regulati ons answerable through ECB summonses 74, and therefore Parks contends that it is logical for the Parks Commissioner to be included with the Commissioners of Environmental Protection, Sanitation, Buildings, Health, Police, Fire, and Consumer Affairs on the Board. Further, it would be useful to have the Parks Commissioner on the board since the ECB has the authority to adopt and amend regulations relating to the use and regulation of all property subject to Parks' jurisdiction.  73  With this revision, Parks is not suggesting that it be given the authority to sell non -unique items. For example, Parks would not seek authority to sell old office furniture, computer equipment, vehicles, etc. 74 For example, Parks employs Parks Enforcement Police officers to issue ECB summons for the violation of Parks rules and requires these officers to be present at the hearings of these violations.  138   LAW DEPARTMENT  Bankruptcy Court Decisions Not Precedential for the Tax Appeals Tribunal  Issue: Should the Charter be amended to provide that the Tax Appeals tribunal is not required to follow as precedential decisions rendered by the United States Bankruptcy Court. Relevant Section: 170(d) Discussion: Charter section 170(d) presently requires the Tax Appeals Tribunal to follow as precedent the prior precedential decisions of the State Tax Appeals Tribunal, or of any federal or New York State Court or the U.S. Supreme Court. Where a  taxpayer is in bankruptcy, the debtor/ trustee may move the bankruptcy court for an order determining that taxpayer's liability for New York City taxes. 11 U.S.C.  505. While the City can move, pursuant to 28 U.S.C.  1334, for the bankruptcy court to abstain from hearing such local tax questions and permit them to proceed before the City Tax Appeals Tribunal, the decision of whether or not to abstain is within the court's discretion, and there is no assurance that the motion will be granted in a particula r case. Bankruptcy courts are courts of equity, and the objectives of the Bankruptcy Code, e.g., to effectuate a viable plan of reorganization and balance the competing interests of the various classes of creditors of the debtor's estate, are not necessari ly consistent with the fair adjudication, from a precedential standpoint, of sensitive local tax issues. See, e.g., Matter of Avien, Inc , 532 F.2d 273 (2nd Cir. 1976) (affirming a  decision of the bankruptcy court holding that the amount of the net operating loss that can be carried back to earlier tax years for purposes of the City's general corporation tax was not, as provided in the City statute, limited to the amount of the federal tax  139   loss). But see Matter of Royal Indemnity Company v. Tax Appeals Tri bunal, 75 NY2d 75 (1989) (where the Court of Appeals refused to follow Avien). Under the present Charter  170(d), there is a possibility that the Tax Appeals Tribunal would be bound by such decisions of the federal courts (including the U.S. Supreme Cour t) in bankruptcy cases. To remedy this, it is proposed that Charter  170(d) be amended as follows: The tribunal shall follow as precedent the prior precedential decisions of the tribunal (but not of its small claims presiding officers), the New York State Tax Appeals Tribunal or of any federal or New York state court or the U.S. Supreme Court (except for determinations rendered by any court pursuant to 11 U.S.C.  505(a) in cases under title 11 of the United States Code) insofar as those decisions pertain to any substantive legal issues currently before the tribunal.  DEPARTMENT OF CONSUMER AFFAIRS  Revocable consent approval for sidewalk cafes  Issue: Should the Charter be amended to streamline the process for approving a petition for a revocable consent to operate an unenclosed sidewalk caf? Relevant Charter Sections: Chapter 14. Discussion: The Department of Consumer Affairs (""DCA"") now processes such petitions for revocable consent to operate an unenclosed sidewalk cafe through the approval process set forth in the City Charter . Under current law, DCA issues a license to operate a sidewalk caf after the petition for a revocable consent is approved by DOT which occurs after review by various agencies and the City Council. DCA proposes amending the City Charter to streamline this process by authorizing the Department of Transportation to issue a temporary approval for a petitioner to operate an unenclosed sidewalk caf after the petitioner has certified to 140   DCA that the plans for a caf comply with all siting requirements and the Community Board has been given an opportunity to comment on the petition, but before the remaining steps in the formal approval process are completed. Conforming  amendments to the sidewalk caf licensing law would then need to be enacted to authorize DCA to issue a temporary license to operate a sidewalk caf. The temporary authorization would automatically lapse and become void on a date certain that is keyed to the maximum time provided for completing the approval process. The temporary authorization to operate should be made contingent on the applicant submitting to DCA a complete truthful application for a license and a revocable consent and a complete truthful certification of compliance with applicable siting requirements.  PROCUREMENT Issue: Should the Charter be amended in relation to procurement? Relevant Charter Provision: Chapter 13. Discussion: Both the 1999 and 2001 Charter Revision Commissions examined the City's procurement syst"

GX067-28-5696754	"Congressman Blumenauers Transit Pass Is Adopted By The House Oversight Committee  Transit riding House staffers are to benefit by receiving a monthly transit pass       August 5, 1998      Congressman Earl Blumenauers (OR-3) Transit Pass, which has 256 co-sponsors, was adopted today as part of the House rules, by the House Oversight Committee.  This passage gives Members of Congress the opportunity to provide a monthly mass transit incentive to any of their employees who ride public transportation.   This passage means the House of Representatives, which employs over 7,000 staffers who live in the. metropolitan area, will now be able to do what the Senate, the CIA, the Secret Service, and more than 100 other federal departments and agencies in Washington, D.C., and across the country have been doing for the past six years: offer an incentive for transit riders.   ""This is a huge step toward improving the livability of House employees and also for all Washington-area residents who battle traffic gridlock every day,"" said Blumenauer. ""Offering an incentive to get people out of their cars and onto public transportation is the right thing to do, both economically and environmentally.""   Under the current rules, House members can provide a tax-free parking benefit of roughly $124 a month to employees who drive, but are specifically prevented by House rules from providing an incentive to use public transportation.  The Blumenauer proposal provides an optional incentive program for a $21 a month transit pass that can be used on 68 transit systems in the Washington D.C. metropolitan area as well as public transportation systems in many cities else where.  The cost of the pass will come out of the existing budgets of House offices, at no additional expense to the Houses overall budget.   The House of Representatives was given legal authority to participate in the transit pass program in the early 1990s, but has never done so.

GX085-16-15467908	"Publications     Issue List     Vote Analysis   Main Page   No. 46   March 8, 2000         H.R. 5 - Senior Citizens' Freedom to Work Act          Calendar No. 439    Passed the House of Representatives March 1, 2000, and ordered placed on the Senate Calendar on March 2, 2000.  No Senate committee action.    NOTEWORTHY        H.R. 5 repeals the so-called earnings limit on some 800,000 Social Security recipients who are between the ages of 65 and 70.  Those senior citizens who this year are earning more than $17,000 in wages or self-employment income lose some of their Social Security benefits (equaling $1 in loss for every $3 they earn in income above the threshold amount, effectively imposing an additional 33-percent tax on these earners).  The measure is retroactive to the beginning of the year.       The House of Representatives passed H.R. 5 March 1, 2000, by a vote of 422-0.        Republicans have been seeking repeal of this Depression-era provision in law literally for decades.  Each Republican platform since at least 1980 has called for its repeal.       A CBO estimate indicates that enactment will cost $22.7 billion over the next 10 years. However, actuaries from the Social Security Administration have indicated that the cost of the measure over the long term is negligible.       The White House did not release an official statement of administration policy.  However, President Clinton sent a letter in support of the bill to House and Senate leaders on February 29, 2000, the day the bill was reported from the Ways & Means Committee. That letter says in part, ""I encourage Congress to send me a clean, straightforward bill to eliminate the retirement earnings test above the normal retirement age.""   Yet Minority Leader Daschle on that same day indicated an interest in amendments:  ""It seems to me that regardless of whether we support or oppose a bill, we ought to have the right to offer amendments, we ought to have the right to use it as a vehicle,"" said Daschle in a discussion about H.R. 5 [source:  Associated Press ].  Subsequently, he revised his opinion but the media is now reporting Senator Bob Kerrey may seek to delay the bill's consideration.       HIGHLIGHTS        The Senior Citizens' Freedom to Work Act of 1999 amends title II, the Old Age, Survivors and Disability Insurance (OASDI), of the Social Security Act to repeal an outdated limitation on the amount of outside income which beneficiaries who have attained retirement age may earn (earnings test) without incurring a reduction in benefits.       H.R. 5 assists approximately 800,000 Social Security recipients between the full retirement age (currently age 65) and age 70 by freeing them from the current law that reduces, and in some cases eliminates, their benefits if they work and earn more than the annual income limit (which equals $17,000 in 2000).       H. R. 5 affects income earned after December 31, 1999 ( i.e. , beginning this year, seniors age 65 and older may work and earn unlimited income without losing any Social Security benefits).       Repeal of the earnings limit is particularly beneficial to small business owners who are subject to both the dollar caps under the earnings limit and a more subjective and invasive self-employment test that often entails an extensive audit.          BACKGROUND    [The following background information was taken from the House Republican Conference's Daily Digest of 2/25/00.]    What is the Social Security Earnings Limit?      Originally designed to encourage seniors to retire, the limit reduces seniors' Social Security benefits if their earnings from wages and self-employment income exceed a specific threshold, or ""earnings limit.""  In 2000, the earnings limit for working seniors between ages 65 and 69 is $17,000.  Under current law, Social Security benefits are reduced by $1 for every $3 of earnings that exceed the limit.  The SSA also estimated that approximately 800,000 beneficiaries aged 65-69 lost some or all of their benefits under the earnings test.     The earnings test has always been one of the most unpopular features of the Social Security program, spawning perpetual congressional proposals to liberalize or eliminate the earnings limit.       History of the Earnings Limit      The earnings test has existed since passage of the Social Security Act in 1935.  With the 1960 Social Security Amendments ( P.L. 86-778 ), Congress introduced the concept of reducing benefits by $1 for each $2 of earnings above the exempt amount.  In 1972, Congress stipulated (P.L. 92-603) that the exempt amount under the earnings test be ""indexed"" to increase automatically with average wage levels.  During consideration of major Social Security legislation in 1977, Congress debated whether to eliminate the earnings limit for persons over age 65.  As a compromise, Congress enacted legislation (P.L. 95-216) to raise the earnings limit for individuals age 65 and older, and since then two different exempt amounts have applied, one for those under full retirement age (currently 65) and one for those between full retirement age and age 70.     The 1977 Social Security Amendments (P.L. 95-216) also lowered from 72 to 70 the age at which the earnings limit would no longer apply, to be effective in 1982, later postponed until 1983. The 1983 Social Security Amendments (P.L. 98-21) changed the withholding rate to $1 of benefits for each $3 of earnings for beneficiaries aged 65-69 (from $1 of benefits for each $2 of earnings), effective in 1990.    Recent Congressional Action      As the crown jewel of the Contract with America, Congress passed a comprehensive tax package (H.R. 2491) that included, among other things, measures to gradually raise the Social Security earnings limit.  However, President Clinton vetoed the measure.  Later in the 104 th  Congress, lawmakers enacted the 1996 Senior Citizen's Right to Work Act (P.L. 104-121), which gradually raises the retirement earnings limit over five years to $30,000 in 2002.    In 1998, the House approved the Taxpayer Relief Act (H.R. 4579) by a vote of 229-195. This measure would have accelerated the increase in the earnings test and raised the exempt amounts to $39,750 in 2008.  However, the Senate did not consider the bill before adjournment.    Critics of the earnings test maintain that it is a strong disincentive for seniors to work, as well as an oppressive tax.  Further, they argue that it is unfair and inappropriate to impose a form of ""means"" test for a retirement benefit that has been earned by a lifetime of contributions to the program. They also maintain that it can hurt elderly individuals who need to work to supplement meager Social Security benefits, while those who have other forms of income are unaffected.  The earnings limit penalizes older workers who are a critical part of the workforce.  At this time when unemployment rates are at historic lows and people are living longer, its time for repeal has come.    BILL PROVISIONS    SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

Becerra to Allow Seniors to Keep More      of Their Income If They Work Beyond Retirement Years Passes Key Committee      Vote      Washington, D.C. -- Today, legislation co-sponsored by Rep.      Xavier Becerra (D-CA), the  Senior Citizens' Freedom to Work Act of 2000       (H.R. 5), passed out of the Ways and Means committee by unanimous vote.      H.R. 5 would repeal the Social Security retirement earnings test (RET), thereby      allowing seniors to retain more of their earnings if they work beyond their      retirement years.      The RET reduces Social Security benefits by $1 for every $3      of earnings in excess of $17,000 for those individuals who have attained the      normal retirement age (65 through 69 for the year 2000). According to the      Social Security Administration (SSA), roughly 793,000 workers age 65 to 69      had some or all of their Social Security benefits withheld in 1999 because      of the RET.      ""Thousands of our seniors in Los Angeles intentionally reduce      the amount of hours they work to avoid a benefit reduction because of the      RET,"" commented Rep. Becerra. ""We must remember that retirees work because      their Social Security checks do not cover all of their basic needs from buying      groceries to paying the electric bill each month. This forces them to supplement      their checks with extra income. Withholding money from seniors is unfair and      it discriminates against them.""      During the Committee markup, Rep. Becerra noted the economic      benefits of repealing the RET. ""If H.R. 5 is finally passed and we achieve      our goal of abolishing this unfair practice, the SSA will save between $100      to $150 million in administration fees.""      ""This penalty against our seniors was created in 1935. It's      time we entered the 21st Century and remove this fossil from our tax code,""      continued Becerra.      H.R. 5 now moves to the floor of the House of Representatives      for a vote of the full body. The Social Security program has included a ""retirement      earnings test"" since its inception in 1935.      ## ## ##"

GX249-98-11432901	SOS Home   Corporations   Directory   Elections   Notaries   Rules   Securities           Legislative Forward    The legislative branch of state government drafts and passes the laws providing for the well-being, growth and development of the state, and for the protection of her citizens.    The Wyoming State Legislature consists of 30 State Senators and 60 State Representatives. The term of office for the Senators is four years, 15 of the members being elected at a general election at which a President of the United States is elected, the balance at the next general election. The entire body of the House of Representatives is elected every two years to serve a two-year term. Terms begin on the first Monday in January following the election.    The general legislative session convenes on the second Tuesday of January of the odd-numbered years and shall not exceed 40 legislative working days. In 1972, voters in Wyoming approved an amendment to the Wyoming Constitution  which permitted an additional session of the Wyoming Legislature in even-numbered years to consider the States budget. The budget session convenes on the second Monday of February of the even numbered years and the total of the general and budget sessions shall not exceed 60 legislative working days.    The present Legislature has a Republican majority in both bodies: 20 Republicans to 10 Democrats in the Senate; 45 Republicans to 15 Democrats in the House.    In 2003, there are 5 women serving in the Senate and 11 women in the House of Representatives.    The general session of the 57th Legislature convened on January 14, 2003.

During the intervening years some districts have gained population and others have lost population. The process of drawing new election district boundaries is called redistricting. In Alaska, Article VI of the state constitution grants the power to draw new election districts to a fivemember independent board. The constitution permits only single-member districts, and specifies several other requirements: each house district is required to contain a population as near as practicable to the quotient obtained by dividing the population of the state by forty - the number of election districts; each house district must be compact; and each house district must contain an integrated socioeconomic area. Senate districts are composed of two contiguous house districts. Also, the U.S. Voting Rights Act requires that election districts must be drawn in a way that does not discriminate against minority voters. On June 18, 2001, the Alaska Redistricting Board adopted a plan that established election districts for the decade ending in 2010. A number of lawsuits were filed against the plan. On February 1, 2002, the Superior Court ruled that Districts 12 and 16 of the June 18 plan were unconstitutional. The state Supreme Court entertained petitions of review of that decision. It ruled on March 21, 2002, that in the board's June 18 plan, District 16 violated the compactness requirement, that deviations of population in the Anchorage-area districts needed to be reconsidered, that the deviation in District 40 was invalid, that district 5 was not compact, and that the board should reconsider districts 12 and 32. The court otherwise affirmed the orders of the Superior Court. On April 13, 2002, the board unanimously adopted an amended final plan, and on April 25, issued a revised proclamation. On May 24, 2002, the state Supreme Court upheld the final amended redistricting plan. The redistricting plan requires that elections be held in 17 of the state's 20 senate districts this year rather than in 10 (or half) of the districts. The three senate districts not electing senators this year are Districts A,K, and T. Candidates are to run for election in all 40 house districts. There is a long history of litigation in state courts over previous Alaska redistricting plans. Every plan since statehood has been challenged. Please see the redistricting map as adopted and proclaimed in 2002 by the Redistricting Board. A table describing new house and senate districts follows.

OTHER: From 1974 to 1985 I worked north of the Yukon River as an engineer's aide, driller, chucktender, powderman's helper, insulator, rigger, and form builder. I also worked on the hydrostatic testing, stringing, pipe support, culvert, chainsaw, and gas pipeline ditching crews. I was a foreman on well-head tie-ins, remedial welds, Haul Road guard rail, and bridge redecking crews. From 1982-1991, I flew float planes and ski planes for hunting and fishing lodges.  STATEMENT: The incumbent voted to regulate the political speech of American citizens. ""Congress shall make no law...abridging the freedom of speech."" He voted to require background checks at gun shows. All federal gun control laws are unconstitutional. He voted to fund the National Endowment for the Arts. I will vote to eliminate unconstitutional funding of this pornographic art. He voted to fund the training of U.S. military doctors overseas to kill unborn Americans. It's the duty of Congress to remove the crime of abortion from the jurisdiction of all federal courts, thus nullifying Roe v. Wade. A country that kills its own unborn children is a country without a future. He voted to fund the United Nations with $582 million in ""back dues."" We need to sever our unconstitutional joint venture with the United Nations. The thousands of U.S. troops deployed overseas without a declaration of war can then be brought home to defend America. We need to get the U.S. out of the U.N. and kick that Trojan Horse full of terrorist regimes, communists, international socialists, and Anti-Americans off our shores. Pledge of Allegiance: Those 2 judges should have been impeached by the House for contempt of the Constitution, convicted and removed from the bench by the Senate before quitting time. Subsistence: Alaska's Constitution, which protects equal access for all, should never be changed so that it conforms to an unconstitutional federal law granting rural preference. Senator Jim Dore will be a stalwart defender of the Constitution.

STATEMENT: I am running for U.S. Senate because corrupt, old-guard fascist politicians must be replaced by democratic leaders, like me, if the U.S. is to remain a great country and meet future challenges. A few of my major positions are: Pro-Jobs - As Senator I will work to diversify Alaska's economy, encourage tourism and international trade, and open ANWR to exploration. Pro-Choice - Privacy rights should be protected and increased, while the constitutional separation of church and state should be strengthened. Anti-Fascist - Recent civil rights rollbacks must be reversed, secret police and military abuse of U.S. citizens must be strictly limited, and the punitive use of the mental health system against political prisoners eliminated. Reform Health Care System - Provide greater access to more people at lower cost. Eliminate the punitive use of the mental health system against political prisoners. Reform Military - Stop wasting money on the ""Maginot Line in the Sky"" known as National Missile Defense. Eliminate Cold War mentality and spending. Institute Economic and Judicial Equity - Eliminate welfare for the wealthy and corporations. Insure federal judges are appointed based on merit, not their fascist proclivities.

My goal is to work with all Alaskans to create opportunity, jobs, and a safe and secure future for our state. Alaska continues to play a critical role in national defense. We must make sure our military forces are the best in the world. And we must care for those who have served. Improved roads, airports, ports, and a strong communications network will provide an economic infrastructure for our state. I will continue to try to make sure Alaskans have the facilities to support our economy. Alaska's resources can be developed safely and without harm to the environment. I will continue to work to allow exploration in the National Petroleum Reserve Alaska and ANWR. Education for Alaskans means a brighter future. I have helped to get more support to the University and to make sure that federal education laws recognize Alaska's needs. Improved health care is essential. I support a prescription drug benefit for Alaska's seniors. Telemedicine, the PET scan, and improved medical education, which I have supported, will bring the highest quality care to all Alaskans. I continue to support research into breast and prostate cancer, Alzheimer's, and other diseases. I am also working to help Alaskan fishermen compete in world markets and to ensure that our fisheries are sustainably managed for the future. ""Do what's right for Alaska"" continues to be my motto. I ask for your vote in this election.

The incumbent supported BP's monopolistic Arco takeover. With diverse Alaskans, former Republican governors and the FTC, Sykes helped stop it. Phillips's purchase of Arco preserved needed competition. We need to remove national energy policy from oil industry control. American energy security can be accomplished only through conservation and shifts to renewable fuels. Alaska can help America by building the All-Alaska Gas Line and providing leadership in developing renewable energy sources while keeping the Arctic Refuge intact. The incumbent has avoided action to establish national comprehensive health care. I'll continue my long-term efforts to establish universal health care. I'll continue working to exclude big money from politics and stop massive Outside corporate special interest money like that funneled to the incumbent. My campaign accepts donations only from Alaskans. I support rigorous reforms including public campaign financing. Treaties Alaska's process Outside like NAFTA and GATT, supported by the incumbent, stifle ability to build a sustainable economy. We need to raw resources into value-added products here, reducing control over our economy.

I'll help stop unworkable, unneeded military projects like the ""Star Wars"" National Missile Defense System. Such pork only provides temporary Alaskan construction jobs - defense contractors make billions, filling the incumbent's campaign chest, and Alaska becomes a nuclear target contaminated with toxic waste.

Jim Sykes  provided and paid for by the candidate  REGION lV  Page 19  Back to Candidate List   United States Senate Leonard J. ""Len"" Karpinski, Libertarian STATEMENT: Whenever you ask the government to do anything, you transform what had been a financial, scientific, military, moral, or social matter into a political issue. The program you propose will turn into one more Christmas tree on which every politician can hang his favorite pork-barrel boondoggle - and can use to sneak through his favorite scheme for controlling your life and money. Government programs too often wind up doing the opposite of what their original supporters had expected. Look how programs to end racial discrimination have produced racial quotas, how federal programs to improve education have turned schools into laboratories for crackpot social theories, how ""welfare reform"" has greatly increased the cost of welfare, how ""good works"" to foreign countries have produced such ill will. You don't control the government. Your dreams of what government can achieve are just that - dreams. They bear no resemblance to what government will really do if your program is enacted. If government is going to do someone's bidding, is it likely to be your bidding - or that of people far more determined, far wealthier, and far more influential than you are - people who see the operation as a chance to further their own self-interest? Libertarians are determined to reduce government to as small an entity as we can - where it can do as little damage as possible, and be used as little as possible for someone's gain at someone else's expense. That's why I want to be your U.S. Senator.

STATEMENT: As Alaska's only Representative in the 435-member U.S. House of Representatives, it is important that Alaska be represented by a proven leader who is dedicated to serve people from every region of our state. Your continued trust and support has enabled me to serve as the Chairman of the House Resources Committee and now as Chairman of the powerful Transportation and Infrastructure Committee.

These will all play a key role in improving America's Homeland Security effort. I also serve as the Vice Chairman of the House Resources Committee, which has jurisdiction over federal lands, fisheries, wildlife, energy and minerals, forests, and Native American issues. This session I was able to successfully include ANWR oil and gas development provisions in the House-passed national energy bill. Alaska's future is one of unlimited potential. We have an abundance of natural resources, wildlife and the most beautiful lands in the world.

Imagine innovative public policies which steer economic and community development in a healthy direction while supporting the ability for people and communities to provide for themselves. Imagine an empowered citizenry, with meaningful access to government. Imagine a more democratic society. If we choose to be leaders in the transition to a sustainable economy we will not only preserve Alaska's unique character and value, but create the opportunities which will be the foundation of our future. In an industrial world dominated by harmful and abusive (unsustainable) practices, where people are subordinate to corporations, where economic development means missile defense contracts and privatized prisons, we need some signs of human hopefulness.

Strategies which address people's needs in this way would go a long way toward stemming the rising tide of violence, substance abuse and apathy which tear at the fabric of our communities.

That is why I signed the Alaska Term Limits Pledge in 2000. The corporatists that want the country run in their own narrow interests as opposed to the good of society need long-term congressmen, which is why there is a debate over PAC-money (which I won't accept, except from the party campaign committees) and the campaign finance system overall. This is why there is no ban on or labeling of genetically modified foods. This is why defense contractors can get the Congress to begin the militarization of space, which is akin to the Spanish Armada and the Maginot Line and counter to the spirit of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. This is why there is no national health care insurance.

Yet, our national policies should reflect our bond with all humanity. In this respect, we must veer away from Pax Americana globalism, but seek greater international cooperation to deal with the problems of weapons of mass destruction, poverty, disease and global warming. We can start by trying to get a worldwide consensus for an international council for nuclear disarmament, non-proliferation and inspection.

STATEMENT: My roots in Alaska go back more than seven generations, to the Russian fur traders who arrived on Kodiak in the late 1790s and intermarried with the Native Aleuts and Alutiiq. I was raised in Ninilchik on the Kenai Peninsula, when Alaska was still a territory. Our state's growth has been dramatic, but we must chart a new course if we are to assure a prosperous future. We need a new Administration with a different set of priorities to address today's challenges: Budget - State government must learn to live within its means, rather than finding excuses to spend and tax more. Economic Development - Building new transportation infrastructure and streamlining the regulatory process are among the changes we must make to create both new jobs and revenues. Families - Many social burdens we face, such as welfare dependency, drug abuse, and crime are related to family breakdown. Strong families will do more to heal our communities than all the government programs money can buy. I support policies to strengthen families and increase parental rights. I support greater parental choice in education. Fisheries - Thousands of Alaskans - including my own family earn a living in the seafood industry, but our fisheries face grave challenges. State government must play a constructive role in protecting this valuable resource. Military - Our military personnel make a huge contribution to our economy and culture. We must work to protect existing defense assets in Alaska, and attract new military investment, such as the strategic missile defense facilities.

STATEMENT: I believe in Alaska and I want to help end the Republican/Democrat gridlock that prevents healthy development and resolution. I believe that Alaska can lead the nation in innovative community development rather than rank amongst the highest in violence, alcoholism, and economic disparity. We can do this by, A Comprehensive Health Care Plan -to provide care to every man, woman and child. It is possible at no more (if not less the cost) than we spend now. As we have seen, band-aid solutions do not provide results. We can help reduce government by focusing on building healthy families rather than legislating ""family values."" Education - as a priority. All public schools must be funded and schools made safer. Let's install Conflict Resolution programs rather than metal detectors in our schools. Build Alaskan pride and teach Alaska History. Public Safety - that includes not only protection of citizens, but the protection of rights and fair application of the law. Private prisons erode accountability and due process and cost society more in the long run. Supporting Local Industry - that develops value-added resources, builds sustainable Alaskan based industries, creates incentives, and hires Alaskans, including building an AlI-Alaska gas-line. Windfall Equal Sharing Tax on Oil - that means the state receives a more equitable share of the profit from its own oil with no harm to the company. Election Reform -that levels the playing field so that principles not capital helps elect a candidate. Greens do not accept outside contributions or ""soft money.""

Coburn, Green  STATEMENT: Rather than moving the capital, we can make the capital more accessible, by video-conferencing for instance, from each community in Alaska. Oil companies should be made to pay their fair share of the tax burden, since they take out 5 times as much profit as they bring into Alaska. All who are dependent on the fishing, hunting, gathering and sharing ways of subsistence, deserve the wild foods in Alaska, not only those who are poor, rural, or Native. Food is a basic human right. ""Dependence"" means cultural, nutritional, economic, social need for the food animals and plants in our state and national forests and waters. There are needy urban people and veterans, elderly, widows, and disabled urban people who should also receive these foods, by proxy. We need a more equitable distribution of state education funds, based on actual education costs, and ample funding for sanitation systems in rural Alaska, since Alaskans pay a high price due to diseases and infections resulting from poor sanitation. We need Alaskan gas piped through and delivered throughout the state where it is feasible, in order for most Alaskans to receive this cleaner fuel, and the jobs this development creates. We should not export all of Alaska's gas resources. We need our own, for our own. The closed primary works against true democracy. Closing it ignores our citizens' best interests. Freedom of choice means everyone has the inherent right to cross party lines. That constitutes a truly free and open electoral process.  OTHER: Born in Ketchikan, my home village is Kasaan. I served 8 years on the City Council, and now sit on Kasaan's Tribal Council. I am the librarian for the village.

By voting for a lesser of two evils, you only perpetuate an already corrupt system by giving it your support. The so-called two-party system is evil by its very nature, because it has become one party with two names, and is monopolistic; the difference being that this monopoly has armed enforcement agencies to make you live the way they want.

My vision is for an Alaska with a sound financial future, excellent job opportunities for our children and grandchildren, and a quality of life that enriches citizens and makes them love our state as much as I do. As Lt. Governor, I will support and work for:  An honest, workable solution to close the fiscal gap.  Full time, high-wage Alaskan jobs that contribute to the state's revenues.  Quality public education.  Efficient and cost-effective delivery of state services.  Stable funding of public safety.  Maintenance of Alaska's infrastructure. For 31 years my wife and I have run our furniture manufacturing business from a plan. Alaska State government must also have a plan - one to close the fiscal gap and to create a stable economy for revenue generating job growth. We need to begin with the sturdy foundation of a balanced state budget, the efficient and cost-effective delivery of state services, good use of Alaska's assets, and a fair and equitable tax policy. Any modification to our current tax policy must involve all Alaskans and Alaskan businesses. To fuel our economy, we need a sound financial plan that ensures sustainable revenues.

STATEMENT: While the other parties struggle for workable solutions to Alaska's Fiscal gap, the Republican Moderates have proposed a clearly workable plan to balance our state's budget. It doesn't require cuts in dividends and services or new taxes on you. Education for all of Alaska's children and other programs crucial to our well-being would be adequately funded without difficulty for the foreseeable future using the revised funding formula proposed by the Moderates. Other things we should be doing include encouraging mineral exploration, stabilizing prices for commercial fisheries, developing a better marine highway system and expanding our railroad to the lower 48. Subsistence is important to Alaskans of all walks of life. We need a solution that is inclusive and regains State control of fish and game. Tourism is our third largest industry and our state parks need to be open for business. Republican Moderates favor an open tolerant government; we are best described as moderately conservative on fiscal issues, moderately liberal on social issues. The Republicans closed your primary. The Republican Moderate Party is taking the issue to court to stop the Republicans from closing it again. You can get more of the same by voting the Republican's back in OR, If you value your personal liberties, vote Republican Moderate in November. Regardless of whether I win, Moderates are likely to win seats in the Legislature this year and, if I get 3% in the general election, the Moderates will continue to be a recognized Party and change Alaska's future.

STATEMENT: Currently, arrogant politicians adhere to rigid platforms that represent their parties but not the people. The Republican Moderate Party does NOT have a platform. Instead, we listen to and will truly represent our constituents. We are not politicians for the people, separate and above; we are the people. Republican Moderates are allowed to and do differ in opinion. However, we are all committed to integrity and to upholding individual rights and freedoms. The Republican Moderate Party is not for sale to big oil or special interests. Republican Moderates are neither conservative nor liberal. We are middle-ofthe-road everyday people who use common sense and basic smarts to evaluate issues and solve problems. We are Alaskans for Alaska. I believe in maintaining an efficient and compassionate infrastructure. I also want government out of my face, my pocket, and my bedroom. Dividends - Yes! Taxes - No! (unless you're an oil company) Subsistence - Let the voters decide! The Budget - The Republican Moderate Party has a proposal that, clearly and painlessly, balances the budget. Most Alaskans believe that the man or woman running should be of more importance than the party. We think so too. Please consider Republican Moderate candidates when you vote. THANK YOU!

Invest in wind generators and let the communities cut their own costs for a magnitude of generations. The fishing industry is in dire straits. For all those hard working Fishermen who are about to lose their boats and gear, I say it's time for legislation which forgives paying back interest on boat loans from the state. Double the length of loan terms so as to lower the payments. The state can't afford to not have people working. The state sure doesn't need to own boats. High school dropout rate in Alaska is appalling. I believe the state should withhold the dividend money of any dropout until they turn 21 years of age or at the least provide proof of GED or return to school. Bethel graduated almost 100 less kids than what started 1st grade 12 years ago. Each student is worth almost $6,000 to our district. Over half a million dollars lost, one year, one class. It's no wonder we can't afford to pay and keep good teachers.

Education - My wife and I have had the pleasure of raising two children. We now have two grandchildren and it is very important that they and all children receive the best education possible. This is why I have fought to fund educatiojn at its highest level. I have also fought to fund new school construction. It is very hard for our children to learn when they are sitting in old worn out buildings. Water and Sewer - During the last several years the legislature has focused on water and sewer needs for all Alaskans, particularly those in rural Alaska. We must continue this effort in conjunction with the Federal Government until all Alaskans enjoy the benefits of running water and sewer. Fish and Wildlife Management - Over the past few years we have seen a decline in both our moose and salmon populations. At the time the republican controlled legislature cut the general fund portion to the Fish and Game budget. This must be reversed in order for the managers of our resources to address this major problem. With my sixteen years in the Legislature, ten of them in the Senate and eight years on the Finance Committees, I believe I am the most qualified to represent you in the next Alaska Legislature.

STATEMENT: It's been an honor to represent the people of District 40, an area encompassing a diverse and rich culture, as well as, the vast natural resources that are responsible for providing much of the state's wealth. Some of the state's upcoming challenges include; Resource Development: We need to continue developing our natural resources responsibly as part of an overall plan for steady growth in the Alaskan economy. Responsible development must include protecting our subsistence resources and environment while providing jobs for our people. DATE OF BIRTH: PLACE OF BIRTH: NAME OF SPOUSE: CHILDREN: July 14, 1952 Nome, Alaska Linda Lovisa, Reggie III, Angela, Dawn, and Puyuk Education: Our people are the state's greatest resource. The key to the state's economic success is linking economic opportunity with a trained work force. Our district and the state have solid academic, vocational, and postsecondary institutions to train our people. It is up to all of us to take advantage of these opportunities. There is a shortage of trained workers not a shortage of jobs. The key to a successful K-12 system is to build partnerships with the whole community. Fiscal Gap: We need to close the fiscal gap by implementing a long range fiscal plan. I have been working with a bipartisan group of legislators to solve this problem but there is still much more work that needs to be done. I will continue to be a bridge in overcoming the urban rural divide in the political arena. I ask your continued support as I seek reelection and once again thank you for all the help and assistance you have provided me over the years.

""Bud"" Carpeneti SPECIAL INTERESTS: Coach, youth basketball, 15 years; long-distance family bicycle touring. OTHER: As a lawyer and trial judge, I served on various supreme court advisory committees. As a member of the supreme court, I have served as chair of the supreme court's Judicial Education Committee, responsible for all continuing legal education for Alaska judges.  STATEMENT: It has been a great honor for me to serve as a trial judge (on the superior court) for 16 years and an appeals judge (on the supreme court) for almost 4 years. I appreciate very much that in three previous retention elections - 1984, 1990, and 1996 - the voters chose to retain me as a judge. In 1984 I wrote in this pamphlet that a judge ""should make sure that persons who are involved in disputes have a place to come to where they are fairly heard and where a decision will be reached that is based on the law and that is reasonably prompt."" I still believe those words. While being an appeals judge is different from being a trial judge, these principles remain. The work requires the members of the court, on a monthly basis, to review thousands of pages of legal briefs and records of proceedings in the trail courts, consult the law as found in written laws and previous decisions, and then produce written opinions explaining the court's reasons for ruling as it does. It also involves deciding, in the criminal area, which cases to take for review. I believe that I have learned a great deal since I was appointed to the supreme court, and that with this learning has come increased efficiency in serving the people of Alaska. I hope that the voters see fit to retain me to continue this work.  DATE OF BIRTH: PLACE OF BIRTH: NAME OF SPOUSE: CHILDREN: MAILING ADDRESS:  December 1, 1945 San Francisco, California Anne D.

SPECIAL INTERESTS: Walking, jazz, golf, World War II History, reading.  STATEMENT: I have been a Superior Court Judge for the past nine years, and I have thoroughly enjoyed being a ""community father."" Citizens present all types of problems for my assistance, and I find the work very challenging. I feel that my life experiences, including working various jobs while attending college, have prepared me well for being a judge. My goal is always to insure that 'justice is done"" in my courtroom. Many people come to court without an attorney, and though I cannot advise them on the law, I feel that I must give such persons as much information as I can about how the system works. Judges are called upon to make very tough decisions, regardless of the criticism that they may receive from those who may only hear a fraction of what the judge has heard or seen. I have tried to make my decisions for the right reasons, as supported by the law. It takes courage to make what one believes is the right decision, even if that decision proves to be unpopular at the time. I personally believe in strong moral values, and I raised my children with these values. I have been married to the same wonderful woman for over 33 years, and I am proud of being a father and a grandfather, as well as a citizen of Alaska. In summary, I enjoy my work as a judge, and I will continue to serve the citizens of Alaska in an honest and fair manner.

Adams, Third Judicial District STATEMENT: It has been almost three years since Governor Knowles appointed me to the District Court Bench. During that time, it has been my goal to decide cases without bias, to be firm when necessary, and to understand the problems that bring my fellow Alaskans to court. In reaching these goals, I feel that my experiences prior to becoming a lawyer and then a judge have helped greatly. Those life experiences include spending my first 12 years growing up in Anchorage and on our family homestead on Butterfly Lake in the Susitna Valley, living in West Africa from the ages of 12 to 16, and working as a surveyor in rural Alaska, on the Pipeline and in Prudhoe Bay. Although I enjoy all aspects of being a judge, my greatest reward comes from speaking to groups of children about our legal system, particularly our criminal justice system. It is just possible that a tour of the courthouse, including a visit to the holding cells and the chance to be handcuffed in jest, and a fun discussion with me will help convince a young person not to break the law. I also greatly enjoy watching jurors learn the importance of our legal system. Many prospective jurors are unhappy with the sacrifices that jury service requires. If I can help those unhappy jurors feel that they have made an important contribution then I have done my job. Thank you for your time. I look forward to many more years of public service.

Motyka, Third Judicial District STATEMENT: Prior to taking the bench in 1991, I spent most of my professional life as either a prosecutor or a trial attorney. For the past eleven years I have had the honor of serving the people of the State of Alaska as a district court judge. The job is challenging, personally satisfying and frustrating - usually all at the same time. I meet people from all walks of life on a daily basis. I strive to treat all who appear before me with courtesy and respect and to be fair and impartial in my decisions. With the remaining space available to me here, I'd like to invite each of you to come into the courts to observe how our justice system operates. When I was an Assistant District Attorney in Manhattan back in the 70's, it was commonplace to have several observers sitting in the gallery area of the courtroom. Here in Alaska, it has been my experience that, with the exception of CourtWatch which reports to the public as a public service, the general public rarely comes to court to see for themselves how the justice system works. Instead, we Alaskans tend to rely on the news media to tell us what happens in court.

OTHER: Domestic Violence Committee, Civil Rules Committee, numerous justice-related committees in an attempt to improve the justice system.  STATEMENT: I appreciate this opportunity to address you on the subject of my retention. My judicial philosophy is straight forward. As a judge I hold a public trust to administer justice fairly and impartially. I believe in God and country and begin each court day with the pledge of allegiance to remind all present of our obligation to ensure ""justice for all."" In all criminal proceedings, while mindful of the rights of the accused, I also consider the rights of victims and when imposing criminal sentences I weight numerous factors, including the need to confine a defendant to prevent further harm to the public and to deter the defendant and others from future criminal conduct. Because of my concern about such issues as the high cost of litigation and the increase in violence in our society, I am a member of various private and public boards and committees to include the Domestic Violence Committee. I believe in the power of an informed public and therefore promote awareness of the judicial system by giving speeches, teaching at schools, and hosting court tours. Constant public scrutiny motivates judges, prosecutors, jurors and witnesses to adhere strictly to their oaths of duty. I believe judges must be intelligent, hardworking civil servants, which is why you will often find me working on weekends and holidays. My judicial colleagues exhibit exemplary integrity, diligence and compassion. I am honored to be a member of one of the best state judicial system in our country.

BALLOT QUESTION The Alaska State Constitution states that during any ten-year period, if a constitutional convention has not been held, the lieutenant governor shall place on the ballot for the next general election the question: SHALL THERE BE A CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION? YE S NO legislature's operating budget, including salaries and expenses with a flexible lid. ADOPT A STATE FISCAL PLAN. A plan has proven to be beyond the capability of recent legislatures. The convention can also adopt initiative proposals for legislation, not part of the constitution. These are voted on by the public and still leave room for the flexibility of future legislative amendment. You may have other concerns you would like to see addressed. Now, only the legislature can originate amendments, all to be sifted through the self-interest of career legislators. A convention can, and probably will propose amendments to be voted on separately. It is not necessarily one up or down vote. In any case, nothing will change without a confirming vote of the people. A convention, with appropriate preliminary proceedings, is a statewide town meeting. Its delegates are elected like legislators, but for one time, one task only. Everything can be discussed, but nothing becomes law without voter approval. DON'T LET YOUR VOTE BE GUIDED BY FEAR. There is a lot of common sense in the people. You do not have to elect extremists. The state bill of rights duplicates those protected in the federal constitution. They can't be changed. Unique in the Alaska constitution is the right of privacy. Who is going to tear that down? Privacy could be strengthened by applying it to corporate intrusions. In 1956 a small group of people invented Alaska's state and local governments from scratch. They did well, but could not have anticipated fifty years of radical change. We the People in 2002 also have a right and a duty to critically scrutinize these designs and update them for ourselves and future generations. VOTE YE S The constitution's authors could not have imagined that so much power would be centered in the state by oil money. A new convention could consider shifting power and responsibility to communities and regions. It could establish a complete pattern of regional governments as the first convention thought it had done. Give local government adequate funding and responsibilities. FIX THE LEGISLATURE. The legislature has become rudderless and self-interested. Too much money pulls too many hidden strings. Give the legislature back to the people by creating small, single member districts that can be won with shoe leather, not money, districts which don't have to include communities remote from each other. Cut the bloat in the The statement printed on this page is the opinion of the author and is presented as submitted to the Division of Elections.  BALLOT MEASURE SUMMARY Prepared by the Legislative Affairs Agency This question relates to a call for a constitutional convention. At the convention the state constitution may be amended or revised, subject to approval by the voters. Under the state constitution, the voters must have the chance to vote on the question of whether there should be a constitutional convention if there has not been a convention during the last ten years. There has not been a convention in the last ten years. This question asks voters to say whether there should be a constitutional convention.  STATEMENT IN SUPPORT ONLY A CONVENTION CAN: PROTECT THE PERMANENT FUND DIVIDEND. protect it - cap it and inflation proof it. First,  HEAL URBAN RURAL DIVIDE. Only one Native served in the 1956 convention. Since 1956, circumstances of rural life have changed dramatically. With full representation of Alaska Natives, this convention can positively address subsistence and the rifts that separate urban and rural people.  John Havelock, Attorney General of Alaska (1970-1973) Director of Legal Studies, University of Alaska (1975-1985)  Page 90  REGION lV  Back to Ballot Measure List   Ballot Measure 1 Shall there be a Constitutional Convention? STATEMENT IN OPPOSITION The League of Women Voters of Alaska (LWVAK) urges Alaskans to vote ""NO"" on this ballot measure. It is unnecessary, costly and potentially dangerous. The Alaska Constitution is considered a model constitution. It is a flexible and concise document that can adapt to changing needs. UNNECESSARY. Although there are criticisms of government in Alaska, the problems are not with the Constitution, but with how it is implemented. While certain issues prompt intense public interest, a constitutional convention is NOT the best way to address these issues. The Alaska Constitution can be amended as follows: The legislature can propose specific amendments to the Constitution by a two-thirds vote of each house. Such proposed amendments must then be placed on the ballot and ratified by a majority vote of the people at a general election. The LWVAK supports the amendment process for any needed changes. The amendment process has worked more than forty times, and it can continue to work in the future. In this way the people have an opportunity to address specific issues rather than risk opening up the entire Constitution for major changes. COSTLY. No dollar amount has been determined for the cost of holding a constitutional convention, but undoubtedly it would be large. The Constitution states that election of delegates to the convention shall be chosen at the next regular statewide election, unless the legislature provides for the election of the delegates at a special election. A special election would be extremely costly. In addition, there would be costs associated with holding the convention itself. With our current ""budget gap"" can we afford the cost? When we can't even afford basic services in some parts of Alaska, we certainly should not spend scarce funds on a constitutional convention with no clear purpose. DANGEROUS. A constitutional convention would have plenary powers to amend or revise our Constitution. In other words, the entire Constitution would be open to change. This could put the Constitution at risk with unlimited and unpredictable amendments being proposed by special interest groups. The convention could be slanted toward special interest rather than the good of the general public. The legislature would set the ground rules for election of The statement printed on this page is the opinion of the authors and is presented as submitted to the Division of Elections.  delegates to the constitutional convention. A legislator may be a candidate for delegate. It is likely that delegates to the convention would be elected from districts - as legislators are now. With the current demographics in Alaska, this would mean a minimal representation for the rural areas of the state, thereby lessening the chance that their voices would be heard and their needs and concerns considered. In 1972, 1982 and 1992, the LWVAK opposed a constitutional convention. Now, in 2002, we again oppose a constitutional convention. We urge you, the voters, to also oppose it. Let us not sail into uncharted waters and run the risk of unnecessary changes to Alaska's model Constitution. VOTE ""NO"" ON BALLOT MEASURE NO. 1 ON NOVEMBER 5th.

The revisor of statutes for the State of Alaska is authorized and directed to make these corrections with appropriate language.  BALLOT MEASURE SUMMARY Prepared by the Legislative Affairs Agency This would make the legislature hold sessions in the Matanuska-Susitna Borough. Until there is a suitable place for sessions in that borough, they must be held in Anchorage. A special session might be held elsewhere. The law that relates to voter approval of costs of a capital move is changed. It would no longer apply to a move of the legislature. Other laws are or will be changed to conform. Sessions held after January 1, 2005 must be moved. The legislature should move sooner if practical.

Additionally, these legislators travel back and forth during session to meet with constituents in their own districts. If the Legislature is moved to a central location, the moving and travel expenses for nearly half the legislators would be saved. Additional money would be saved because state employees would not have to travel to Juneau to appear before the Legislature. It will not be necessary to build expensive buildings to support a legislative move. More than half the legislators already have offices in Anchorage. Facilities for meetings are available in Anchorage, and can be made available in the Matanuska/Susitna Borough by remodeling existing buildings. Land already owned by local governments is available, if necessary. Moving the Legislature out of Juneau will not destroy Juneau. Juneau's economy is strong with tourism, fishing, mining, and federal and state offices which will not be abandoned just because the Legislature meets elsewhere. In addition, Juneau has a bright future if it develops and markets its many attributes. Juneau will remain the capital of Alaska. This initiative simply requires that the Legislature be accessible to the vast majority of Alaskans. Please vote YE S on Ballot Measure No. 2 and bring the Legislature back to the people of Alaska. Alaskans for Efficient Government By Bill Dam and Karen Bretz Senator Randy Phillips Muldoon - Fort Richardson - Eagle River  STATEMENT IN SUPPORT In November, 2002, the voters of Alaska will have an opportunity to bring the Legislature back to the people of Alaska. In the distant past, Juneau was the population center of Alaska. Not any more. Now, more than 85% of Alaskans live closer to Anchorage and the Matanuska/Susitna Borough than they do to Juneau, and this percentage is continuing to increase. It is now time to bring the Legislature back to the people of Alaska. The Legislature should meet in Anchorage or the Matanuska/Susitna Borough, for the following reasons: * ACCE SSIBILITY - The Legislative sessions will be much more accessible to the vast majority of Alaskans. The meetings will be on the road system, instead of in a location inaccessible by road and rail, and often closed to air travel. Because it is so expensive to travel to Juneau, many Alaskans have never even visited our capital city. With an accessible Legislature, citizens will have the opportunity to communicate more effectively with their legislators and participate more fully in their government. Electronic communication cannot replace face-to-face contact. * ACCOUNTABILITY - At present, the Legislature is accountable to well-funded special interest groups and lobbyists, who inhabit the legislative halls during the legislative sessions. The average citizen cannot afford to travel to Juneau. When the citizens of Alaska are actually able to attend and participate in the legislative process, we can expect more accountability to the people. The legislators will complete their business more efficiently when under public scrutiny, and sessions should be shorter. * AFFORDABILITY - Contrary to the claims of the move, the taxpayers will save money moving the Legislature to a central location. three legislators must move themselves, of the opponents in the long run by Currently, all but their offices, and  STATEMENT IN OPPOSITION  The statement printed on this page is the opinion of the authors and is presenteded as submitted to the Division of Elections.

The Authority would acquire and condition North Slope natural gas, and construct a pipeline to transport the gas. The Authority's powers would include buying property or taking it by eminent domain, and to issue state tax-exempt revenue bonds. The gasline route would be from Prudhoe Bay to tidewater on Prince William Sound and the spur line from Glennallen to the Southcentral gas distribution grid. The Authority would operate and maintain the gas pipeline, ship the gas, and market the gas. SHOULD THIS INITIATIVE BECOME LAW? YE S NO FINDINGS AND INTENT. (a) The people find that (1) The Phillips-Marathon liquefaction facility at Nikiski has been supplying Cook Inlet natural gas to Japan and Southcentral Alaska at great profit and without interruption since 1969; (2) Cook Inlet gas supplies are dwindling rapidly with shortfalls anticipated as early as the winter of 2003; (3) Alaska's North Slope contains vast proven reserves of natural gas that have been known for at least 25 years but have never been developed; (4) these gas resources have never been offered for sale, because there has been no way to transport them to market; (5) multiple markets in North America and Asia have recently expressed an interest in receiving a proposal from Alaska for the purchase of Alaska gas; (6) if developed, these natural gas resources could represent substantial economic benefits to Alaskans in jobs, state revenue, and gas for Alaska citizens and businesses; (7) the major North slope leaseholders have competing gas reserves in other parts of the world vying for the same markets, creating a conflict of interest for them in advancing the sales of Alaska gas; (8) the North slope Producers agreed in 1991 to strand North Slope gas until at least 2005; (9) given the producer's conflicts of interest and their historic refusal to make North Slope natural gas available it may be necessary to take the gas back; (10) the permits necessary for an Alaskan gasline project have been pledged to the Alaska Natural Gas Development Authority, operating as a port authority, to facilitate the development of the project; (11) there is sufficient gas for an all-Alaskan gasline project; (12) the Alaska Natural Gas Development Authority offers substantial tax benefits that improve the economics of a gasline project; (13) state ownership of the pipeline and associated facilities has the potential to provide substantial revenues to the state and the Alaska Permanent Fund; and (14) Alaska's constitution requires that Alaska's resources are developed, utilized, and conserved for the maximum benefit of Alaska's people. (15) an all-Alaskan gasline maximizes jobs for Alaskans, revenues for the Alaskan treasury, and access to gas for Alaskans. (b) It is the intent of this Act to create the All-Alaskan Natural Gas Development Authority for the purpose of developing, constructing, managing, and operating a gas pipeline from the North Slope of Alaska and a spur line to the Southcentral Alaska natural gas distribution grid. *Sec. 2. AS 41 is amended by adding a new chapter to read:  BALLOT MEASURE SUMMARY Prepared by the Legislative Affairs Agency This measure proposes a new public corporation. It would be called the Alaska Natural Gas Development Authority. It would have a seven-member board of directors appointed by the governor. The board is required to design, construct, operate, and maintain a natural gas pipeline system. That system or project would transport North Slope natural gas. It would move the gas to Prince William Sound and to the Southcentral Alaska gas distribution system. The board could market and ship gas. It could acquire property by purchase or eminent domain. To meet project costs, the board could issue revenue bonds. To build the project, it would have to enter into project agreements with labor unions. It also must use Alaska contractors and suppliers to the greatest extent possible. The measure requires the board to prepare a development plan for the project within one year. It declares a goal of having the project operate by 2007.

Sec. 41.41.350. Capital reserve funds. (a) For the purpose of securing one or more issues of its obligations, the authority may establish one or more special funds, called ""capital reserve funds,"" and shall pay into those capital reserve funds (1) money appropriated and made available by the state for the purpose of those funds, (2) proceeds of the sale of its obligations, to the extent provided in the resolution or resolutions of the authority authorizing their issuance, and (3) other money that may be made available to the authority for the purposes of those funds from another source. All money held in a capital reserve fund, except as provided in this section, shall, subject to appropriation, be used as required solely for the payment of the principal of obligations or of the sinking fund payments with respect to those obligations; the purchase or redemption of obligations; the payment of interest on obligations; or the payment of a redemption premium required to be paid when those obligations are redeemed before maturity. However, money in a fund may not be withdrawn from that fund at any time in an amount that would reduce the amount of that fund to less than the capital reserve requirement set out in (b) of this section, except for the purpose of making, with respect to those obligations, payment, when due, of principal, interest, redemption premiums, and the sinking fund payments for the payment of which other money of the authority is not available.

(b) If the authority decides to issue obligations secured by a capital reserve fund, the obligations may not be issued if the amount in the capital reserve fund is less than a percent, not exceeding 10 percent, of the principal amount of all of those obligations secured by that capital reserve fund then to be issued and then outstanding in accordance with their terms, as may be established by resolution of the authority, called the ""capital reserve fund requirement,"" unless the authority, at the time of issuance of the obligations, deposits in the capital reserve fund from the proceeds of the obligations to be issued or from other sources an amount that, together with the amount then in the fund, will not be less than the capital reserve fund requirement. (c) In computing the amount of a capital reserve fund for the purpose of this section, securities in which all or a portion of the funds are invested shall be valued at par or, if purchased at less than par, at amortized costs as the term is defined by resolution of the authority authorizing the issue of the obligations or by some other reasonable method established by the authority by resolution. Valuation on a particular date must include the amount of interest earned or accrued to that date. (d) To assure the continued operation and solvency of the authority for the carrying out of its corporate purposes, provision is made in (a) of this section for the accumulation in capital reserve funds of an amount equal to their capital reserve fund requirement. (e) The chair of the authority shall annually, not later than January 2, make and deliver to the governor and chairs of the house and senate finance committees a certificate stating the sum, if any, required to restore a capital reserve fund to the capital reserve fund requirement. The legislature may appropriate that sum, and all sums appropriated during the current fiscal year by the legislature for the restoration shall be deposited by the authority in the appropriate capital reserve fund. (f) This section does not create a debt or liability of the state. Sec. 41.41.360. Remedies. A holder of obligations or coupons attached to them issued under the provisions of this chapter, and a trustee under a trust agreement or resolution authorizing the issuance of the obligations, except as restricted by a trust agreement or resolution, either at law or in equity, may enforce all rights granted hereunder or under the trust agreement or resolution, or under another contract executed by the authority under this chapter, and may enforce and compel the performance of all duties required by this chapter or by the trust agreement or resolution to be performed by the authority or by an officer of it.

Of the members first appointed under AS 41.41.020(a), enacted by sec. 2 of this Act, 1. three members shall be appointed to three-year terms; 2. two members shall be appointed to two-year terms; and 3. two members shall be appointed to one-year terms. Building the gasline to Valdez gives us the option to diversify our markets into Asia and our own U.S. West Coast. Equally important, an All-Alaska gas project will make it feasible to bring cheap, clean energy to Alaskans in other parts of the state including Southcentral, which is projected to start having gas shortages within the next 10 years. Alaska's gas has been stranded on the North Slope for almost 30 years now and the oil companies seem no closer to building a gasline than ever. They all seem to have different worldwide agendas and can't seem to work together to develop Alaska's North Slope gas. If the oil companies won't do it, this initiative at least gives us the option to do it ourselves with the spirit that built Alaska in the first place. The Authority this initiative would establish would be similar to the Alaska Permanent Fund Corporation with a governing board to set policy, a small administrative structure and the actual work to design and build the project contracted out by bid to private companies who are experts in their field and who are held strictly accountable. The initiative is not a guarantee that the project would be built. It requires that, within a year, the permits that already exist for the All-Alaskan route would be acquired, gas supply contracts would be secured from the North Slope producers, and an economic model would be completed to take to the market to seek sales contracts. At least our gas would be presented for sale to the market, which has never been done before. The section of the initiative entitled ""Credit of state not pledged"" (Sec. 41.41.400) was carefully written so that the project would stand alone based on this project's revenues. This is not another Delta barley project. Nothing will be built until markets for the gas are secured. Development of Alaska's gas represents a major stake in the future of all Alaskans. As Alaska now faces an impending fiscal crisis in coming years, the marketing of its gas in the most prudent and lucrative manner is paramount. Wouldn't it be better to solve our fiscal problems through an in-state project such as this rather than taxing Alaskans or taking your Permanent Fund dividend? We think so. Please vote YE S on ballot measure # 3. Scott Heyworth Mike Macy Tyrone Neel  STATEMENT IN SUPPORT Last year more than 40,000 Alaskans signed an initiative petition to place the choice to develop Alaska's gas in the hands of the owners of the gas: Alaska's people. If adopted, this would establish the Alaska Gas Development Authority supporting a project to build a natural gas pipeline from Prudhoe Bay to Valdez, keeping it completely in Alaska and not going through Canada. It only makes sense to keep the jobs and revenues within Alaska and within America. In addition, the potential for value added processing of Alaskan gas into petrochemicals should also be within Alaska, not in Canada or Chicago.  The statement printed on this page is the opinion of the authors and is presented as submitted to the Division of Elections.  REGION lV  Page 101  Back to Ballot Measure List   Ballot Measure 3 - Initiative Petition Gas Pipeline Development Authority STATEMENT IN OPPOSITION The All-Alaska Gasline Initiative will force the State of Alaska to create a new, inefficient government bureaucracy that will compete and interfere with private enterprise. By law, the state's first task would be to expend state funds restudying an expensive, risky project that has already been shown to not be feasible. Therefore, this initiative should be defeated. A recent report commissioned by the Legislature and completed by the Administration states that The All-Alaska Gasline Initiative is not in the best interest of the State. The report found that - should the State undertake construction of such a project - the financial risks are substantial. Except for the Permanent Fund, there is no ready source of investment money. Given the scope of such a project the potential for permit and construction delays leading to cost overruns, Alaska's entire savings account could be jeopardized. The State's credit rating would be put at risk because of the reliance on debt, thus devaluing any bonds should they be issued to finance the project. In addition, it is unlikely that State ownership would automatically add value. The argument that the State of Alaska should do more to discharge its constitutional obligation to develop natural resources for the benefit of all Alaskans rings hollow. The State has long discharged its obligations by regulating the extraction and use of gas consistent with its existing lease agreements. The State also realizes profits from ongoing production through taxes and royalties. The Initiative is restricted to a pipeline and liquefied natural gas (LNG) project in Valdez. Industry studies show that this restriction proves less feasible in the foreseeable future due to inadequate markets and the financial demands of the project. The market for such a project will be oversupplied by almost a factor of 2 from cheaper sources through at least 2010. This oversupply recently resulted in the first downturn of LNG prices into Japan since the business began in the late 1960's. The All-Alaska Gasline Initiative specifies that the State can only consider the most expensive project. Current estimates indicate that capital costs of an Alaskan LNG project will be at least double that of competing new supplies. The Government lacks the technical expertise and experience for this big, risky project, especially at a time when smaller, more efficient government is needed to strengthen Alaska's long-term economic health. Just the feasibility study of the project would cost the State $200 million. Since there is no assurance that it will be built, such a cost is likely a waste of money that the State can ill afford. It makes more sense for the State to support private industry efforts to commercialize North Slope Gas rather than create a bloated State-Owned The statement printed on this page is the opinion of the author and is presented as submitted to the Division of Elections.  project that could end up costing more to build and run than it would generate in revenue.

Young people are invited to join the Green Party, with full participation, before reaching voting age as part of a needed voice for a better future. Instant Runoff Voting is used to elect Green Party officers in multi-candidate elections; assuring voters have maximum power to show majority support for a candidate without requiring a runoff vote. The Green Party utilizes guiding principles for its actions, expressed through ""10 Key Values"" : Community-based Economics  Grassroots Democracy  Ecological Wisdom  Future Focus  Decentralization Respect for Diversity  Feminism  Global Responsibility  Personal/Social Responsibility/Social Justice  Nonviolence  The Green Party is values-based, not beholden to corporate and other special interests. We are in a unique position to take a holistic look at the serious issues facing Alaska Fiscal Plan: Enact an oil windfall profits tax above $18 per barrel, equalizing state and oil company profits. There would be no budget gap had this been implemented the past two years. Additional revenues require everyone's help--corporations, tourists, summer workers and residents. A summer sales tax, general sales tax or income tax, should be considered, if needed. Alaskans can no longer allow corporate control over state spending or legislative inaction and the unfair taxes that were proposed. Health Care: Implement statewide access to healthcare and childcare for all Alaskans (including outpatient medications) as the Green Party first proposed in 1990. Education, intervention and treatment are integral parts of the plan for a healthier Alaska. Green Economics: Gain additional economic self-sufficiency by creating value-added products from raw materials before export to reduce Outside economic control. Implement a product development corporation to help establish a sustainable, environmentally safe, small manufacturing economy. Subsistence: Guarantee continuing access to subsistence resources--the core part of all Alaska Native cultures involving special skills and knowledge, sharing and other cultural values. Resource survival and subsistence economies are top priorities. Sport and commercial uses are secondary. Energy: Alaskans can lead the nation to energy security through conservation, building the all-Alaska gas line that will also serve the rail belt, and developing hydrogen as a future fuel. Sun, wind, and geothermal energy provide additional potential. Arctic Refuge: It makes no sense to open the Arctic Refuge. 30 to 40 years worth of oil are available in the areas already open. The state would lose 40% of the revenue on Refuge oil. Most natural gas lies outside the Refuge. Alaska can provide national energy security and keep the Arctic Refuge intact. Corporate Reform: Create meaningful penalties for corporate crime such as jail time for corporate executives and repeal of corporate charters. Corporations should pay their fair share of taxes. Democracy: Get big special interest money out of politics, implement public financing of elections, and eliminate corporate and special interest contributions. Outside contributions should not be allowed. Law and Order: Spend largest sum of money on education, intervention and treatment to reduce the need for police enforcement and prisons. Implement conflict resolution, youth courts and tribal courts as better alternatives to the current adversarial court proceedings. For profit prisons should not be allowed. Defense: Stop military expenditures for unworkable, programs like the ""Star Wars"" National Missile Defense System. Such military pork provides only temporary chump change jobs while defense contractors make billions, and gives some to our Congressional Delegation. Alaska becomes a nuclear military target, and is left with toxic waste. Paid for by: Green Party of Alaska/Terri Pauls, Treasurer/P.O.

Despite double-digit negative returns from the U.S. stock market, the welldiversified Fund managed to moderate its losses by earning significant positive returns in bonds and real estate and ended the year down only 2.2 percent, thus out-performing both its benchmark (-3.7 percent) and the average public pension fund (-5.2 percent). Investing for generations For the 20th consecutive year, Fund principal was fully inflation-proofed in 2002, its long-term purchasing power kept whole so that the Fund can continue to provide real benefits to future generations. For the benefit of the current generation, the Fund was able to provide sufficient income to fully pay the 2002 Permanent Fund dividends  thanks to a large earnings reserve account built up and retained during the good years. The earnings reserve, which acts as a cushion against poor financial markets, ended the fiscal year with a June 30 balance, after accounting for dividends and inflation-proofing, of $1.6  billion. Two years ago, this account totaled $6.5 billion. What caused the $4.9 billion decline in the earnings reserve? About one-quarter of it ($1.3 billion) was transferred to principal for inflation-proofing over the last two years. That money remains in the Fund, ensuring its longterm purchasing power. Another 40 percent of it has gone to dividends ($2 billion combined for 2001 and 2002). The rest, approximately onethird ($1.6 billion) reflects the depreciation in the market value of the Fund's investment portfolios, primarily stocks. Corporate governance The rash of accounting scandals in corporate America was another source of difficulty in fiscal 2002, particularly in June when, coupled with poor economic news, the Fund's performance actually turned from positive to negative after recovering from losses earlier in the year. To fully protect the interests of Alaska shareholders, the Board has become increasingly engaged in corporate governance.

BALANCE. PERMANENCE.  The increased involvement began last year with Board educational sessions on proxy voting practices in April 2001; fiduciary responsibilities in May 2001; class action litigation in February 2002; and external manager conflict of interest policies in March 2002. The Board has also taken a number of actions: in November 2001, we established a Corporate Governance Committee chaired by the Attorney General; in February of this year, the Fund joined the Council of Institutional Investors, a shareholders' rights organization comprised of public, private and union pension plan sponsors; and in March and June, the Board adopted new policies on proxy voting and class action litigation. The Board will continue to be active on corporate governance issues and we will do our best to hold the companies in which the Fund invests to high standards of accountability. Suppor t for complete and protected inflation-proofing The Board and the staff were also engaged during the year in public policy debates. The Board recommended an important amendment to the state constitution which, while it has not yet been adopted by the legislature, has been widely discussed and supported by prominent Alaskans and newspaper editorial boards. This proposed constitutional amendment will again be proposed in 2003 as an essential part of any long-range fiscal plan for the State of Alaska. Use of Fund income since inception $25 billion of realized income 1976-2002  For more information on this issue, please read The Trustees' Papers, Volume VII: Making the case for complete and protected inflationproofing, which is available on the APFC web site at www.apfc.org. Staying the course While periodic market corrections are inevitable  and frequently healthy over the long term  they can challenge even the most focused, long-term investor. The Board's asset allocation policy balances the risks of negative returns in the short term against the rewards of higher positive returns over the long term. For a patient investor with good diversification like the Alaska Permanent Fund  which as of June 30, 2002, held 34 percent of its assets in U.S. stocks, 16 percent in non-U.S. stocks, 11 percent in real estate and 39 percent in fixed income  risk is diminished over time. Although there is a one-in-four chance that the total Permanent Fund will earn a negative return in any single year, there is only a one-in-20 chance that the Fund will earn a negative return over a five-year holding period, and virtually no chance of a negative return over a 10-year period. That is the benefit of investment discipline and ""staying the course.""  Sincerely,  Jim Sampson Chair, Board of Trustees  Robert D.

He is not employed                by another in a gainful occupation.""  This was the retirement                earnings test (RET) provision.               The Administration's bill was developed by the President's Committee                on Economic Security (CES). The actuarial calculations underlying                the Administration's proposal were based on the assumption that                a retirement test would be included in the law.               The Economic Security Bill was introduced simultaneously in the                House and the Senate on January 17, 1935 and was referred to the                House Ways and Means Committee and the Senate Finance Committee.                The House Ways & Means Committee held hearings on the bill from                January 21, 1935 through February 12, 1935. The Senate Finance Committee                held hearings from January 22, 1935 through February 20, 1935.               On April 4, 1935 the Ways and Means Committee reported the bill                to the House, without the RET provision, which was removed during                Committee consideration. According to the Executive Director of                the CES, Professor Edwin Witte, who was present in the closed mark-up                sessions: ""All actuarial calculations were made on the assumption                that annuities would be paid only to employees retiring from active                employment, and this was provided in the original economic security                bill. The only person to object to this provision was Mr. Beaman.                He raised the point that 'active employment' needed to be defined                and rejected every attempted definition. . . .It apparently was                not realized by anyone that this change would operate to again create                a large deficit in the old age insurance fund; in fact, there was                no discussion of the financial aspects whatsoever. When the subcommittee                made its report to the full committee, its recommendation to eliminate                the provision relating to retirement was adopted with discussion.                As a result, no provision to this effect was included in the House                bill.""               On June 12, 1935 the Senate Finance Committee reported its bill                to the Senate--with the RET provision. Again according to Witte:                "" . . . the Senate committee gave some attention to the                requirement of retirement which was stricken from the original bill                by the House Committee. . . . there was no difference of opinion                among the members of the committee. In a public statement given                out after passage of the House bill, the President included an item                to the effect that retirement, of course, should be a condition                of granting of any annuity. This seemed to be taken for granted                by all members of the Senate committee . . . This amendment was                adopted without any dissent.""               The House version of the bill, without a RET, was passed in the                House on April 19, 1935 by a vote of 372 to 33. The Senate version                of the bill, including a RET, was passed on June 19, 1935 by a vote                of 77 to 6.               The Conference met throughout July 1935 and into early August,                as a dispute about an unrelated provision forestalled agreement.                The House receded to the Senate position on the RET provision. According                to Witte: "" Later on it was quite readily agreed upon by                the House conferees, who explained that the House committee had                never understood that the amendment eliminating the requirement                of retirement completely upset the actuarial calculations.""               The Conference Report was passed by voice vote in House on August                8th and in the Senate on August 9 th . President Roosevelt                signed the bill into law on August 14, 1935.               The final version of the Social Security Act of 1935 contained                this language on the subject:  ""Whenever the Board finds                that any qualified individual has received wages with respect to                regular employment after he attained the age of sixty-five, the                old-age benefit payable to such individual shall be reduced, for                each calendar month in any part of which such regular employment                occurred, by an amount equal to one month's benefit.""               There was essentially no discussion of the RET provision in the                Congressional floor debates or in the hearings held on the bill.                The only known discussions of the provision were those in the mark-up                sessions and the Conference.               The 1939 Amendments               The RET in the 1935 law prohibited any Social Security payment                when income was earned in ""regular employment."" ""Regular                employment"" was not explicitly defined.   Therefore,                in the 1939 Amendments Congress adopted a provision defining retirement                as the receipt of less than $15 of earnings in a month from jobs                covered under the Social Security program.               The $15 figure represented earnings at about 25 percent of the                minimum wage, so it was a measure which necessitated substantial                retirement. (The current retirement test exempt amounts, $800 per                month for those under age 65 and $1,292 per month for those age                65-69, constitute 90 percent and 145 percent of the current minimum                wage, respectively.)               Placing a dollar figure on the RET was done primarily for practical                administrative reasons, to clarify with some precision what was                meant by ""regular employment."" This change did not signal                any change in the fundamental operation of the RET.               The 1950 Amendments               With the coming of World War II, prices and wages increased dramatically                over pre-war levels. However, throughout the War years, the RET                had little effect since many older workers remained employed or                returned to the workforce rather than retiring, in support of the                war mobilization. Following the war, the nation's retirement and                pension policies came under new scrutiny and the RET came under                increasing criticism. There were obvious problems with the existing                test:                               wages levels had risen since 1939 and the $15 figure was outdated;                 the ""all-or-none"" nature of the test was viewed as                  excessively harsh, it was thought that a more gradual reduction                  could facilitate the transition from full-time work, to part-time                  work, to full retirement;                 some workers, especially among the self-employed, never retired                  and hence would never be in a position to collect a benefit for                  their contributions;                 the RET was generally unpopular with those who wanted Social                  Security to be more like an annuity, payable simply by virtue                  of attaining retirement age.                             Following recommendations of the 1947-1948 Advisory Council, in                the 1950 amendments Congress agreed to eliminate the RET starting                at age 75 and to increase the threshold from $15 to $50, but to                retain the all-or-nothing nature of the test.               The elimination of the RET for those age 75 and older was rationalized                as making the program more equitable for the newly-covered self-employed,                who, it was argued, tend to not retire and hence they would be unable                to benefit from their contributions.               So by 1950, the nature of the Social Security retirement program                had been altered on the issue of the RET. From that point on, it                was established policy that the RET need not always apply.               The 1952 and 1954 Amendments               Following the outbreak of the Korean War, wages and prices again                soared. The administration and the Congress realized that an adjustment                in the RET earnings level was in order. In the 1952 Act the exempt                amounts were raised, but no other significant changes were made.               The 1954 amendments again made significant changes in the RET.                Wages were put on an annual test. This was a considerable liberalization                because it meant one could earn over the monthly exempt amount for                several months each year without any loss of benefits provided the                total earnings stayed under the annual exempt amount. However, the                test was still ""all or none,"" with the full benefit withheld                when the limits were exceeded. The exempt amount was raised and                the age at which the RET no longer applied was reduced from 75 to                72. The argument again was one of equity; that lowering the RET                cap would make the program fairer to self-employed farmers, who                were being covered for the first time.               The 1960 Amendments               The 1960 Amendments brought another key change in the operation                of the RET. For the first time, earnings over the exempt amount                did not always produce a total loss of benefits. For earnings between                $1,200 and $1,500 the reduction was $1 for every $2 of earnings.                For earnings over $1,500 the old rule applied. This was done to                alleviate the perverse result of earnings above the exempt amount                sometimes yielding a net decrease in income, compared with simply                earning up to the exempt amount. From this point forward, the RET                would utilize this principle.               The 1972 Amendments               The 1972 amendments introduced another important innovation-the                Delayed Retirement Credit (DRC). This credit increases the benefit                amount for those workers who delay retirement past the Normal Retirement                Age (NRA). The credit was initially set at 1 percent per year. The                1983 amendments raised this credit to an eventual level of 8 percent                (by 2009).               DRCs were added to the law as a partial offset to the RET. The                argument was one of fairness. It was argued that if program participants                continue to work after 65, and forgo benefits due to the RET, it                is only fair that they receive some additional compensation for                their extra work.               The 1972 act introduced one other very important innovation. Previously,                the RET exempt amounts were only raised when a specific act of Congress                mandated an increase. The 1972 law put the increases ""on automatic""                by tying them to increases in average earnings, starting in 1975.               The 1977 Amendments               The 1977 amendments brought considerable legislative activity surrounding                the RET. The House passed a bill eliminating the RET at age 65.                The Senate passed a similar bill setting the end age at 70. The                Conference accepted the Senate position and the final legislation                ended the RET at age 70, effective in 1982. (An amendment in 1981                later pushed the effective date back to 1983 due to short-term cost                concerns.)               The 1977 law also separated the cohort aged 62-64 from the 65-69                cohort, creating a more generous RET for the second group.               Changes in the 1980s               The major change to the RET in the 1980s was included in the 1983                Amendments which increased the offset from $1 for every $2 of excess                earnings to $1 for every $3-but only for the NRA cohort. Even though                this change was legislated in 1983, its effective date was 1990.                This was because the thrust of the 1983 Amendments was to address                short-range solvency problems and Congress did not want provisions                such as this one, which had a programmatic cost, from taking effect                during the 1980s while solvency was being restored.               1996 Legislation               Following the 1972 changes in the law, increases in the exempt                amounts were no longer determined solely by legislative act but                were indexed to increases in average wage levels in the economy.                This had the dual effect of providing regular increases and of constraining                the level of those increases. However, the Contract with America                Advancement Act of 1996 made another departure from the indexing                by again making ad-hoc increases in the exempt amounts for the NRA                cohort. A schedule of increases were programmed into the law which                dramatically raised the exempt levels. Indeed, the value of the                exempt amount was more than doubled.               Also, this second set of ad-hoc increases for the NRA cohort had                the effect of increasing the disparity between this cohort and the                age 62-64 cohort. Under the 1977 law, the exempt amount for the                62-64 group was 72% of that for the NRA cohort in 1995. Under the                estimates in the 1996 law, the percentage would fall to 35% by 2002.               Repeal in 2000               In his January 1999 State of the Union Address, President Clinton                stated that ""we should eliminate the limits on what seniors                on Social Security can earn."" On  March                1, 2000, the House of Representatives approved  an earlier version                of H.R. 5.  The Senate approved  an amended                version of the legislation on March 22, 2000. The House agreed to                the Senate amendment to the legislation and cleared the measure                for transmission to the President on March 28, 2000. The votes were                unanimous in both houses of Congress.               At a signing ceremony  on                April 7, 2000, in the Eisenhower Presidential Room of the Old Executive                Office Building, President Clinton signed the bill into law.

GX140-34-3021070	"Press             Release                                   FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE         Contact: Michael Mershon             January 31, 2001   (202) 225-6101               U.S. REP. JIM MCGOVERN PROPOSES TAX BREAKS    FOR MASS TRANSIT COMMUTERS     U.S. Representative Jim McGovern (D-MA) today introduced legislation    to revise the tax code by increasing the amount of money that mass transit users    could deduct from their taxes.    Current law allows for a tax-free fringe benefit for transportation    of up to $175 per month to subsidize the parking of expenses of employees that    drive their own cars to work every day, but only $65 per month for those employees    who utilize mass transit. This arrangement unfairly penalizes mass-transit commuters    by taxing them on as much as an additional $110 per month in income, just for    choosing mass transit.    This encourages more people to choose to drive their own vehicles,    further contributing to traffic congestion, accidents, pollution, smog, and    lost time waiting in rush-hour traffic. Further, in many regions of the country,    monthly commuter rail fares far exceed the $65 limit. For example, the maximum    monthly fare on the MBTA from Worcester to Boston is $136.    The bill Rep. McGovern introduced today, the ""Commuter Benefit    Equity Act of 2001,"" would remedy this disparity by revising the tax code to    allow the same $175 per month for all employees, eliminating the discrimination    against mass-transit commuters. The bill's cosponsor is Rep. Chris Shays, Republican    of Connecticut. Sen. John Warner (R-VA) and Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-NY) have introduced    a similar bill in the Senate.    ""We should reward people for utilizing mass transit - not punish    them,"" Rep. McGovern said. ""The bill I am introducing today would eliminate    an unfair provision in the tax code and lower taxes for mass transit commuters.    I look forward to working with Chris Shays and my other colleagues on this important    issue.

Under a typical nonpartisan election system, on the other hand, candidates do not run in party nominating primaries and ballots do not denote a candidate's party affiliation. Instead, all candidates for a particular office run together in a nonpartisan ""primary."" Typically, the two candidates who receive the most votes in the primary advance to the general election. The Commission has certain issues that it must address as it considers whether to propose a system of nonpartisan elections.  Issue: Should elections for City elective office be conducted in a nonpartisan manner? Options: The Commission must obviously first consider the threshold issue of whether any City elective office should be filled through a system of nonpartisan elections.    Issue: If nonpartisan elections are appropriate for any City elective office, should they be held for all City elective offices, or only for some? Options: The Commission could propose, if it chooses to make any proposal at all about nonpartisan elections, that no npartisan elections be conducted for all City elective office or only for some of them. Prior recent Commissions have discussed the issue in terms of instituting nonpartisan elections only for Citywide elective offices, i.e., for the Mayor, the Comptrolle r, and the Public Advocate.  i     Issue: If the Commission proposes nonpartisan elections, what should the effective date of the change be? Options: The Commission could choose to make the change effective upon adoption by the voters, in which case the 2003 elections would be nonpartisan. Alternatively, it could choose a later effective date. Considerations that the Commission may want to consider include a desire for prompt implementation versus a need to phase in such a change.  ii   Introduction Overview of the Charter Revision Process The New York City Charter is the basic document that defines the organization, power, functions and essential procedures and policies of City government. As a ""short form"" charter, it sets forth the institutions and processes of the City's political system and defines the authority and responsibilities of elected officials --the Mayor, Council, Comptroller, Borough Presidents, and Public Advocate --and City agencies in broad strokes, while leaving the details of operation to local law and agency rulemaking. Unlike the United States  Constitution, which is amended rarely, the City's Charter is a fluid document that is amended often. Indeed, while the U.S. Constitution has been amended only 27 times in its 215 year history, the Charter has been amended more than 100 times since 1989. In the United States, city governments receive their legal authority from the states in which they are located. In the State of New York, municipalities have broad authority to structure how they operate by virtue of the Home Rule provisions of the State Constitution and the Municipal Home Rule Law. The City's Charter, along with the State Constitution, the Municipal Home Rule Law and other State statutes, provides the legal framework within which it may conduct its affairs. Under State law, charter revision may occur as an ongoing process through the passage of local laws. There are limitations on that authority;  however; for example, there can be no curtailment of powers of an elected 1   official. A char ter can also be revised pursuant to a State or City charter revision commission, which has the authority to put proposals before the voters. A  charter revision commission may put proposals before the voters regarding all elements of a charter, including the curtailment of powers of an elected official, as well as provisions that could also be adopted through local law. Municipal Home Rule Law (""MHRL"")  36(4) permits the Mayor to establish a ""charter commission"" in New York City. The composition of a mayoral charter  commission must consist of nine to fifteen members. The members must be City residents and may hold other public offices or employment. The Mayor  designates the chair, vice-chair and secretary of the commission pursuant to MHRL  36(4) and (6)(d). Charter commissions are not permanent commissions. MHRL  36(6)(e) limits the term of a charter commission. A commission expires on the day of the election at which a proposed new charter or amendments prepared by a commission are submitted to the voters. However, if a commission fails to  submit a new charter or any amendments to the voters, the commission expires on the day of the second general election following the commission's creation. There are no prohibitions against the reappointment of a commission or appointment of a new commission upon the expiration of an existing commission. A charter commission may propose a broad set of amendments that essentially ""overhauls"" the entire charter, or may narrowly focus upon certain areas and expla in why such an approach is preferable in a report to the public. MHRL  36(5)(a); see Matter of Cruz v. Deierlein, 84 N.Y.2d 890, 892-893  2   (1994). The proposed amendments must be consistent with general State laws and can only effect changes that are other wise within the City's local legislative powers as set forth in the State Constitution and the MHRL. The proposed amendments must be filed with the City Clerk for action by the voters no later than the second general election after the commission's creati on, and must be voted on at a general or special election held at least sixty days after the filing. The proposed amendments may be submitted to voters as one question, or a series of questions or alternatives. MHRL  36(5)(b). The Commission's Membership In July 2002, Mayor Michael R.

How the Commission's Staff Developed Its Options Report on Nonpartis an Elections In preparing this report, the staff took its direction from Commission Chair Robert J. McGuire and the Commission members. The staff also looked to the reports and records of the 1998, 1999 and 2001 Charter Revision Commissions. Each of those Commissions produced reports and heard testimony on the issue of nonpartisan elections. In addition, the Commission's staff solicited input from the public, conducted new research, contacted other cities to learn of their experiences, engaged the services of expert consultants, and consulted with various City officials, including other City lawyers and Charter experts, election and campaign finance officials and procurement officers.  Nonpartisan Elections Issue: Should elections for City elective offices be conducted on a nonpartisan basis? Relevant Charter Provisions: While the Charter provides for nonpartisan  special elections to fill vacancies in the offices of Public Advocate, Council member, Borough President, and Comptroller, Charter  24(c), 25(b), 81(e), 94(c), the Charter does not provide for nonpartisan elections to fill those offices, or the office of the Mayor, during the regular Citywide election cycle.  10   Discussion: 1. Introduction The electoral process for City elective offices, like those for federal and state offices, are conducted in a partisan fashion; candidates compete in party nominating elections and a candidate's party affiliation appears with his or her name on the ballot. Under a typical nonpartisan election system, candidates do not run in party nominating primaries and ballots do not denote a candidate's party affiliation. Instead, all candidates for a particular office run together in a nonpartisan primary. Typically, the two candidates who receive the most votes in the primary advance to the general election. The Commission has certain issues that it must address as it considers whether to propose a system of nonpartisan elections.    Issue: Should elections for City elective office be conducted in a nonpartisan manne r? Issue: If nonpartisan elections are appropriate for any City elective office, should they be held for all City elective offices, or only for some? Issue: If the Commission proposes nonpartisan elections, what should the effective date of the change be?  Advocates of nonpartisan elections have identified several potential benefits. First, candidates would be freer to offer voters competing ideologies and visions. Candidates would no longer be forced to tailor their positions to appeal mainly to the ins iders within their own parties who tend to vote in primaries. Instead, candidates would be challenged, from the outset of the  campaign, to articulate a vision that resonates with a broad spectrum of voters. By having to appeal to the electorate as a whole, candidates would be forced to  11   offer ideas on actual issues and problems likely to arise during their terms in office, rather than focusing on the more esoteric and ideological concerns of the vocal few who tend to vote in partisan primaries. Furthermore, adherents argue that a nonpartisan system would create the opportunity for people from outside of a party's machinery to compete on a more equal footing with party insiders and loyalists. Many candidates' fates, especially in partisan primaries, hinge on whether they can successfully convince party insiders to support them. Newcomers, and people with careers outside of  politics, often find it difficult to run for elective office because of their lack of access to party organizations. Adherents argue that by controlling access to the ballot with an iron fist, the party bosses perform a far larger role in selecting the City's leaders than the voters themselves, making the current system inaccessible to all but the chosen few. With real world example after example of backroom dealing, corruption and patronage, supporters argue that nonpartisan elections are the only way to remove the system from the control of the party bosses, and produce elected officials chosen by the people for their ability rather than candidates selected by the party for their utility. ""Supporters of nonpartisan elections envision direct representation of citizens rather than indirect representation through party intermediaries. They seek to make local government more businesslike and less political. The  ultimate goal is to create a more responsive and effective local government system."" 1  1  When coupled with the City's voluntary campaign finance program,  ""Local Nonpartisan Elections, Political Parties and the First Amendment"" 87 Columbia Law Review 1677, 1679 (1987). Id.  12   which provides public matching dollars to participating candidates, a nonpartisan system could allow far more people to compete and win. Moreover, nonpartisan elections , when combined the campaign finance program , will allow people with more limited means to compete, whereas the current system often is hinged on party donations and fundraising. See Title 3, Chapter 7 of the Administrative Code of the City of New York. In particular, see Administrative Code  3 -705, the public financing section of the New York City Campaign Finance Act, which details the circumstances under which candidate may receive matching funds, including ""four-to -one"" matching funds. 2  Opponents of nonpartisan elections, on the other hand, argue that partisan elections are necessary to a democratic system, because they force candidates to make commitments that result in political accountability, and they allow voters to affiliate themselves with a cause. Opponents further question the impact of nonpartisan elections on voter turnout. In addition, opponents argue that, in the absence of party identification, nonpartisan elections may lead to ethnic block voting, because voters may have nothing but ethnic identity on which to base their vote. This concern is highlighted in races for less high profile offices, where voters may not have been sufficiently exposed to the candidates' messages. Finally, opponents argue that the current system should not be  changed at this time, when minorities are becoming a force within the parties, because the change might splinter minority voting power.  2  For a general discussion of spending by political parties in campaigns, see ""Party Favors: A Report of the New York City Campaign Financ e Board"" (Jan. 1995).  13   2. Background and History The use of nonpartisan elections has been considered in recent years by the 1998, 1999 and 2001 Charter Revision Commissions, which both studied the issue itself and received extensive public comment. 1998 Charter Revision Commission The 1998 Commission extensively examined the issue of nonpartisan elections. As part of its work, the Commission conducted an expert forum  specifically on this issue. A summary of this forum is attached as Appendix A. The efforts of the 1998 Commission culminated in a comprehensive staff report. The report noted, among other things, that 60 of the 75 largest cities in the United States with an elected mayor use nonpartisan elections, including Los Angeles, Houston, San Diego, Detroit, Dallas, Phoenix, San Antonio, San Francisco, Boston, and Seattle . In addition, the report noted that, in 1988, New York City adopted nonpartisan elections for special elections to fill vacancies in City elective offices other than the Mayor's office.3 Frank Mauro, Research  Director for the 1988 Charter Revision Commission, described the rationale: ""The purpose of the nonpartisan special election was to dilute the power of the party 3  The Charter provides for nonpartisan independent nominating petitions to fill vacancies in the offices of the Comptroller (Charter  94(c)(7)), Public Advocate (Charter  24(c)(7)), Council member (Charter  25(b)(7)), and Borough President (Charter  81(e)(7)). However, it should be noted that this provision for the office of Public Advocate has never been precleared by the Department of Justice. While the provision must be precleared before it can be implemented, the 1988 Charter Revision Commission recommended that State law be changed prior to the City seeking preclearance. Specifically, that Commission was concerned that General City Law (""GCL"")  2-a(2) might preempt the Charter's provisions regarding Public Advocate vacancies , because it mandates that the vice-chairman of the local legislative body, i.e., the Speaker of the Council, becomes the presiding officer of the Council, i.e., the Public Advocate, for the remainder of the unexpired term. However, to the extent that the Commission might choose to propose removing from the Public Advocate the now ceremonial role of presiding over the Council, see Charter  24(e), the concern of the 1988 Commission would become moot because the terms of GCL  2- a(2) would, on their face, no longer apply.  14   leaders and to make it easier for those not chosen by the leaders to qualify for the ballot."" 4  The 1998 Commission's staff report explored the potential benefits of nonpartisan elections. Statistical data revealed that nonpartisan elections foster diversity, while partisan elections do the opposite. examined data from the 48 largest American cities. For example, the report In the 11 cities using  partisan elections, only two had minority mayors. In comparison, of the 37 cities that used nonpartisan elections, 15 had minority mayors. The 1998 staff report conducted a thorough analysis of the legality of establi shing nonpartisan elections for citywide offices in New York City, focusing on considerations arising from the requirements of the New York State Election Law and the federal Voting Rights Act. The Commission staff concluded that cities in New York State are permitted, under the principles of home rule, to amend their charters in order to adopt nonpartisan elections. The 1998 Commission retained Professor Allan J. Lichtman, Chair of the Department of History at American University and an expert in voti ng rights, to conduct an analysis of whether the establishment of nonpartisan elections would violate the federal Voting Rights Act. Dr. Lichtman analyzed statistics concerning race, voting patterns, and election results. He concluded that the change from partisan to nonpartisan elections would not violate the Act. As summarized in Appendix A, Dr. Lichtman testified that his statistical analysis showed that party identification is not necessary for minority candidates to be elected.  4  The New York Times , July 11, 1990 at B2.  15   As to the mechanics of nonpartisan elections, the 1998 report explored various possibilities for the ballot layout, as well as solutions to the problem of conducting both partisan and nonpartisan elections on the City's older voting machines. 1999 Commission The 1999 Commission began its examination of the issue of nonpartisan elections by conducting a thorough review of the 1998 Commission's staff report. The 1999 Commission held an expert forum on election issues on August 6, 1999. Lawrence Mandelker, an election lawyer, had favorable views on Stanley  nonpartisan elections, as did Dr. Lichtman, based on his research.  Schlein, counsel to the State Assembly Election Law Commission, and Professor Robert Bailey of Rutgers University disagreed with nonpartisan elections. Dr. Bailey stated that party affiliation and race are the two main predictors of voting patterns. 5  He further stated that removing party affiliation would 6  highlight race as a factor in elections.  Dr. Bailey further explained that by  removing party, ""you in a sense are eliminating one filter or one other umbrella identity that could mitigate some racial voting patterns in this city."" 7  Dr. Lichtman performed extensive statistical analysis of citywide elections within the City from 1989 through 1997.8 He emphasized the uniqueness of the  5  Transcript of 1999 Charter Revision Commission Expert Forum, August 6, 1999 (""1999 Expert Forum Transcript"") at p. 114. 6 Id. 7 Id. 8 Id at pp. 121- 122.  16   City's voting patterns, and concluded that, in the primaries, blacks and Hispanics do not vote cohesively to form a single minority block. 9  Dr. Lichtman noted that the lack of minority cohesion in the City is significant because, as a result of the large number of white voters in the City's Democratic Party, minority cohesion is necessary to advance a minority candidate out of the partisan primary and into the general election. As a result, Dr. Lichtman concluded that nonpartisan elections would even the playing field between whites and minorities in New York in regard to candidate selection, because a minority candidate would be more likely to advance to the general election. Stanley Schlein testified that ""it still should be the right of parties to put forward candidates to run in primaries, to coalesce behind philosophical ideas... ."" 10  The 1999 Commission also received testimony about the practical difficulties that New York City would face if it were to implement nonparti san elections. As in 1998, these difficulties primarily concerned New York City's  older voting machines. Lawrence Mandelker pointed out some of the logistical issues that needed to be resolved in order to use New York's voting machines for nonpartisan elections. 11  He noted that it could be problematic for a partisan primary election  to be held simultaneously with a nonpartisan election, because of the lockout mechanism used to ensure that primary voters vote in the primary for party in 9 10 11  Id. at pp. 118- 143. Id. at p. 103. Id. at pp. 92 -94.  17   which they are registered. Mr. Mandelker proposed solutions such as buying new voting machines, requesting the Legislature's approval to conduct partisan and nonpartisan primaries on different days, or using paper ballots, an alternative he disfavored. 2001 Commission The 2001 Commission also considered the issue of nonpartisan elections for the Citywide offices of Mayor, Comptroller, and Public Advocate. The  Commission's staff reviewed the work of the 1998 and 1999 Commissions on the issue. In addition, the Commission received public comment about nonpartisan elections. As set forth in its final report, the 2001 Commission decided to defer the issue of nonpartisan elections. Nonetheless, the Commission specifically noted the compelling testimony of candidates for City offices whose candidacies had been frustrated by partisan election procedures. The Commission further noted that while term limits and campaign finance reform had opened the door to election reform, party politics nonetheless controlled primary elec tions and the overall electoral process. 3. Legal Issues State law issues The City's authority to enact local legislation creating nonpartisan elections for local offices derives from Article IX of the New York State Constitution and Section 10 of the Municipal Home Rule Law (""MHRL""). 12  12  In  Under MHRL  10(1), cities have the power to adopt local laws relating to the ""powers, duties, qualifications, number, [and] mode of selection . . . of its officers and employees ,"" provided that  18   Bareham v. City of Rochester, 246 N.Y. 140 (1927), the Court of Appeals considered whether Rochester had the authority, under the State's home rule provisions, to adopt nonpartisan elections in light of the inconsistent provisions of the Election Law. Although the Court struck down the Rochester law at issue  because of its technical failure to cite the Election Law provisions that were being superseded, it nonetheless held that cities in New York State possess the authority to establish nonpartisan election systems. 13  As discussed more fully below, several cities in New York State continued to use nonpartisan election schemes for some time after the decision in Bareham, including the cities of Sherrill and Watertown. The existence of these schemes strengthens the argument that New York City has the authority to create nonpartisan elections. Furthermore, although the Election Law has been recodified since the decision in Bareham , the Bareham analysis applies to the current Election Law. Election Law  1-102 specifically states that ""[w]here a specific provision of law exists in any other law which is inconsistent with the provisions of this chapter, such provision shall apply unless a provision of [the Election Law] specifies that such provision of [the Election Law] shall apply notwithstanding any other provision of law."" There is no existing provision of the  such local law is not inconsistent with the State Constitution or any general State law, and provided that the State Legislature has not restricted the adoption of such a local law on a matter of State concern. See MHRL 10(1)(ii)(a)(1) (emphasis added). This provision derives directly from Article IX,  2(c), of the State Constitution. 13 The Court in Bareham acknowledged that Rochester would not have had the authority to pass a local law inconsistent with the Election Law had that State law been a ""general"" law, see MHRL 2(5) (general law is one that ""in terms and in effect applies alike"" to, for example, all cities within the State), but noted that, on its face, the Election Law was instead a ""special"" law, with which a properly enacted local law could be inconsistent. See MHRL 2(12) (special law is one which ""in terms and in effect"" applies to, for example, one or more, but not all cities within the State).  19   Election Law that mandates partisan elections ""notwithstanding any other provision of law."" In 1991, New York City's authority to adopt nonpartisan elections in its Charter was explicitly recognized in City of New York v. New York City Board of Elections , Index No.41450/91 (Sup. Ct., New York Co.), aff'd, __ A.D. 2d __, (1st Dept. ), lv. app. den., 77 N.Y.2d 938 (1991). That case concerned the validity of Charter  25(b)(7), the nonpartisan special election provision for City Council vacancies that was added by the 1988 Commission. In that case, the Board of Elections, despite the new Charter amendment, accepted the party nomination of a candidate and attempted to place that candidate's name and party affiliation on the ballot in a special election to fill a Council vacancy. The Board of Elections claimed that Election Law  6-114, which provides that party nomina tions for an office to be filled at a special election be made in accordance with party rules, preempted the Charter. Relying on Bareham , MHRL  10, and Election Law  1102, the Court ruled that New York City had the right to adopt nonpartisan elections in its Charter, notwithstanding the Election Law. Specifically, the Court held that although the Election Law allowed party labels in elections, ""the Election Law gives way to inconsistent local law provisions."" This decision was affirmed unanimously by the Appellate Division, First Department. Indeed, local authority to implement nonpartisan elections for local offices, as identified in Bareham, has never been compromised by the Legislature's enactment of a general law or an explicitly restrictive special law. Thus, the  20   Election Law may be reasonably construed only to set forth the framework for governing partisan elections for those cities that choose to use them. In light of Bareham and City of New York , it appears clear that cities in New York State possess the home rule authority to adopt nonpartisan elections by amending their charters. See also Steinberg v. Meisser, 291 N.Y. 685 (1943) (upholding the denial of an injunction against the City of Long Beach placing before the voters a proposed local law amending its charter to provide, inter alia, for nonpartisan elections for City Council). Description of Nonpartisan Elections in New York State Nonpartisan election systems have in existed in New York State for over 80 years. For example, in addition to Rochester, the cities of Sherrill and 14  Watertown have had nonpartisan elections since 1916 and 1920, respectively.  As discussed above, Rochester attempted to institute nonpartisan elections for its Citywide officers by local law, but its legislation was struck down in Bareham because of the law's failure to cite the provisions of the Election Law that were to be superseded. Following the decision in Bareham, in 1929,  Rochester again instituted nonpartisan elections by local law, but this time the law contained the required list of superseded Election Law sections. 15  14  Other cities in New York that have had nonpartisan primary elections at some point in their history include Buffalo, Saratoga Springs, Long Beach, Jamestown, Mechanicville, Auburn, New Rochelle, Rome, and Batavia. 15 The sections of the then-existing Election Law superseded by Rochester's law were: 83 (lists of nominations); 84 (publication by Board of Election of nomination lists); 89 (poll-books); 102 (placing names on ballot); 103 (order of names on ballot); 104, 105, 108, 119, 249, 268 (official ballots); 131 (party nominations); 135, 136 (designating petitions); 137 (independent nominations); 138 (declination of designation or nomination); 139 (filling vacancies in designations and nominations); 140 (times for filing petitions and certificates for holding conventions); 156 (additional meetings for registration); 157 (registration for other than general  21   The City of Sherrill's nonpartisan primary system was instituted by the State Legislature in 1916. 16  In creating this scheme, the Legislature effectively  superseded various provisions of the then-applicable Election Law as it applied to Sherrill. 17  At its most basic, Sherrill's system of nonpartisan elections modified  the method by which a candidate qualified for the general election. While the Election Law at that time provided that the candidate who received the most votes in each party's primary proceeded to the general election, see theneffective Election Law  89, Sherrill's nonpartisan system mandated that the two candidates who received the most votes at the nonpartisan primary would run in the general election, regardless of party. 18  The City of Watertown's nonpartisan primary system was instituted by the State Legislature in 1920. 19  Like for Sherrill, the Legislature effectively 20  superseded various provisions of the Election Law as it applied to Watertown.  The Legislature amended Watertown's nonpartisan election system in 1993,21 but the basic structure of nonpartisan primary elections remained the same. The amendments merely conformed Watertown's system to certain  administrative requirements of the Election Law and addressed certain elections); 204 (challenges at primary elections); 212 (proceedings of inspectors at close of polls); 213, 270 (canvassing vote); 217 (tallying votes); 233 (proclamation of results). 16 Laws of 1916, Chapter 172. 17 In 1985, the Election Law was reenacted into its current form. 18 Sherrill's legislation varied from numerous sections of the 1916 Election Law. See, e.g. , Sections 3 (definition of a primary election); 48 (process to choose candidates for primary election); 49 (filing declaration of candidacy); 58 (party affiliation on ballot); and 79 (when election supplies are to be delivered). 19 Laws of 1920, Chapter 276. 20 Watertown's 1920 legislation varied from numerous sections of the then- applicable Election Law. See, e.g. , 3 (defining primary as a party-based election); 74 (designation of polling places in accordance with political parties); 79 (number of ballots to be provided at election); 89 (two candidates receiving most votes at primary proceed to general election); and 122 (independent nominating petitions). 21 Laws of 1993, Chapter 247.  22   administrative details.  22  As amended in 1993, Watertown's legislation effectively 23  superseded various provisions of the modern Election Law. Federal Voting Rights Act  A change to nonpartisan elections could arguably be considered a change in a ""standard, practice, or procedure with respect to voting."" Such a change could require the City to seek preclearance from the Justice Department pursuant to the Voting Rights Act. Under the Voting Rights Act, a State or political subdivision may not impose a ""standard, practice, or procedure . . . which results in a denial or abridgement of the right of any citizen of the United States to vote on account of race or color . . . ."" 42 U.S.C.  1973(a). In establishing whether such an  abridgement has occurred, one must determine whether, ""under the totality of circumstances, it is shown that the political processes leading to nomination or election in the State or political subdivision are not equally open to par ticipation by members of a [protected] class [i.e., race or color] in that its members have less opportunity than other members of the electorate to participate in the  22  These administrative requirements addressed issues such as the filing and sufficiency of petitions; primary dates; revision and correction of registers of voters; the quality, weight, size, etc., of ballots; and the general conduct and canvassing of elections. The amendments also addressed details regarding the binding of petitions, the equipment to be furnished to the polling locations, the movement of voters between election districts, write-in candidates, and the conduct of general elections. 23 Watertown's legislation varies from the following sections of the Election Law as it existed in 1993: 1-104 (defining a primary as a party-based election); 2- 120 (statement of party positions to be filled at primary); 4-118 (party designation on notices of primary election); 6-119 and 6-132 (designating petition to include party); 6-128 (first nominations for new party); 6-136 (designation of candidates for primary); 6 138, 6- 140, and 6 142 (independent nominating petitions ); 6-156 (certificates of nomination to include party designations); 6-158 (filing of certificate of acceptance or declination of candidacy); 7- 104, 7- 106, 7- 114 (party designations on ballots); 9-200 (selection of candidates to run at general election); and 9- 210 (statements of canvassing results to include political parties).  23   political process and to elect representatives of their choice."" 1973(b).  42 U.S.C.   Whenever the City seeks, in general, to change a ""standard, practice, or procedure with respect to voting,"" it seeks preclearance from the Justice Department as to whether the change will have the effect of denying or abridging the right to vote on account of race or color. 42 U.S.C.  1973c. The change may not take effect until the City receives preclearance. Id. When preclearance is sought from the Justice Department, the change may take effect if ""the Attorney General has not interposed an objection within sixty days after such submission, or upon good cause shown, to facilitate an expedited approval within sixty days after such submission, the Attorney General has affirmatively indicated that such objection will not be made."" Id. As to preclearance of a change such as one to nonpartisan elections, which would require approval by referendum, see Municipal Home Rule Law 23(d), Charter 38(3), the Department of Justice has set forth instructions regarding the timing of such preclearance. Under 28 C.F .R.  51.22, entitled, ""Premature submissions,"" The Attorney General will not consider on the merits: (a) any proposal for a change affecting voting submitted prior to final enactment or administrative decision or (b) any proposed change which has a direct bearing on another change affecting voting which has not received Section 5 preclearance. However, with respect to a change for which approval by referendum, a State or Federal court or a Federal agency is required, the Attorney General may make a determi nation concerning the change prior to such approval if the change is not subject to alteration in the final  24   approving action and if all other action necessary for approval has been taken. Thus the Justice Department could, but would not be required to, co nsider for preclearance any change to the Charter's mayoral succession provisions prior to approval by the voters at referendum. As stated above, Dr. Lichtman, the expert on voting rights for the 1998 and 1999 Commissions, concluded that a change to nonp artisan elections for Citywide offices would not violate the Voting Rights Act. Dr. Lichtman's 1998 statistical analysis showed that party identification is not necessary for minority candidates to be elected. This Commission has retained Dr. Lichtman to conduct a new Voting Rights Act analysis. 4. Policy Considerations Use throughout the United States Nonpartisan elections are used by the overwhelming majority of municipalities across the nation, including Los Angeles, Chicago, Houston, San Diego, Detroit, Dallas, Phoenix, San Antonio, San Francisco, Boston, and Seattle . Attached as Appendix B is a chart that identifying the type of election system used in the 50 largest cities in the United States, their mayors and the mayors' ethnicity over the last decade, and whether those cities use runoff elections. According to the U.S. Conference of Mayors, as of the 2000 census, 41 of the nation's 50 largest cities elected their mayors using nonpartisan elections. Of those 41 cities, 34 percent elected black or Hispanic mayors. Of the nine cities that used partisan elections, only two cities (22 percent) elected a black or Hispanic mayor. Attached as Appendix C is a chart of 2000 Census  25   data for the 50 largest cities. attached as Appendix D.  A chart summarizing the se race statistics is  According to data from the National Conference of Black Mayors, based on U.S. Census Bureau data, 41 cities in the United States with populations of 50,000 or more have black mayors. Of the mayors in these 41 cities, 30 were elected through nonpartisan elections, while 11 were elected with partisan elections, a difference of almost three to one (73% in cities with nonpartisan elections compared to 27% in cities with partisan elections). details of these 41 cities is attached as Appendix E. Arguments in favor of nonpartisan elections Supporters of nonpartisan elections argue it produces a system aimed at allowing citizens to seek elected office directly without first having to win approval from local party bosses. Nonpartisan elections, its supporters believe, would force candidates to address issues facing the population as a whole, rather than the narrow group of insiders who tend to vote in partisan primaries, and would offer an opportunity for candidates w hose positions may not fit with the party machines. Potential candidates who might not otherwise run for office would have the opportunity to do so without modifying their beliefs. 24  A chart listing  Instituting a system of nonpartisan elections could mean an end to a system where only candidates approved by the party system and with views that do not offend the party leaders receive the financial support often necessary to 24  See generally ""Local Nonpartisan Elections, Political Parties and the First Amendment,"" cited in footnote 1, at p. 1679 (""[N]onpartisan systems give qualified candidates of the minority party or independents a better chance to succeed. These systems...permit voters to analyze local issues independently on their merits and to focus on the intelligence and experience of the candidates themselves rather than on their political affiliations."") (citations omitted)  26   mount an effective campaign. When coupled with the City's voluntary campaign finance program, nonpar tisan elections could widen the electoral field to a broader group of candidates, and offer voters more choices in their leaders and policies. Nonpartisan elections also could encourage diversity of candidates. The analysis performed by the 1998 Commission, and the statistics discussed above, indicate that minority group candidates in cities with nonpartisan elections have outperformed minority group candidates in cities with partisan elections. Nonpartisan elections may also increase minority voter turnout. The 2001 Commission heard testimony regarding the need for nonpartisan elections, particularly for City Council positions, in order to increase minority voter participation, because such elections would help counter the perception that minority needs were not met by nominees selected through a partisan process. 25  25  According to Michelle McCleary, a candidate for the City Council in the 9 District, ""In a one party borough like Manhattan, the winner of the Democratic primary is the winner of the elections. So our elected officials are chosen by a very small percentage of eligible voters. ...This leads to elected officials who are more responsive to the Democratic Party than to the voters. It also tends to discourage many talented members of [the African American] community from running for public office. And it turns our young people away from the electoral process altogether. The voter turnout among African American youth ranges between the single digits and the teens."" Transcript, Aug. 15, 2001, at pp. 9- 11. th Similarly, Alex Cox, a candidate for the City Council in the 7 District, stated, ""In the Harlem community where I am running, for example, as in many black communities across the country, young black voters are increasingly choosing to not identify themselves with a party label. A recent poll conducted by the Joint Center for Political and Economic studies found that 42.6 % of African Americans between the ages of 18 -25 view themselves as politically independent. Young black voters interests are not represented in a partisan election where a local Democratic party machine dominates. This is particularly troubling in a district like mine because it means that more and more potential voters will become disillusioned with the voting process and pull out altogether. In 1999, only 20% of eligible voters cast their ballots for a City Council candidate."" Transcript, Aug. 15, 2001, at pp. 11 -12.  th  27   Supporters of nonpartisan elections also argue that since City government is mainly operational, as opposed to ideological, the value of the party banner and the ideals it represents is mi nimal at best. The Commission's staff and consultants are currently researching the question of whether a change to nonpartisan elections would increase voter participation rates generally. Arguments against nonpartisan elections Nonpartisan elections frustrate democracy and lead to political gridlock. 26  ""Part[y politics] force candidates to make choices, take stands, and make commitments to groups of people with long collective memories and high collective standards."" 27  As one writer notes:  What do politicians do? They get up meetings, circulate handbills and pamphlets, blaze away in the newspapers, send ships about the streets on wheels with flags and sailors, and send conveyances all over town, with handbills, to bring people to the polls  all to gain attention to their cause and elect their candidate. All these are these are their measures,"" and for their end they are wisely calculated. The object is to get up an excitement, and bring the people out. 28 It is argued that the party system gives vote rs a chance to affiliate themselves with a cause; and that cause, is bigger than any candidate could be."" 29  26 27  See July 29, 1998 Forum on Nonpartisan Citywide Elections, at p. 71. Susan Reefer, ""No to Nonpartisan Elections, available at www.gothamgazette.com/ elections/jun.02.shtml. 28 See Jeff Pasley, Party Politics, Citizenship, and Collective Action in Nineteenth Century America: A Response to Stuart Blumin and Michael Schudson (""Party Politics"") available at www. mtsu.edu/~seig/pdf/pdf_response_ pasley.pdf. 29 See Reefer, ""No to Nonpartisan Elections,"" available at www. gothamgazette.com/elections/ june.02.shtml.  28   Opponents also argue that nonpartisan elections discourage informed citizen participation. They argue that when party labels for the City's highe st offices are removed, it disadvantages vast numbers of voters and deprives them of the historical perspective needed to project the nature of an administration. 30  This could harm those with low income and low education who have strong party identification. Loss of party identity is believed to make it more difficult for the voters to keep track of candidates. 31  According to opponents, a person in a partisan system who lacks personal wealth can rely on party or organizational support not only to start campaigning, but also to move up the political ladder. Nonpartisan elections would give  advantages to persons with personal wealth or with close ties to persons and institutions with great wealth. 32  Finally, opponents argue that nonpartisan elections encourage extremism and discourage moderation.33 Opponents also argue that voter turnout may  decline with nonpartisan elections because a lack of party identification could make it more difficult for voters to keep track of candidates. Ballot and voting mac hine issues A. The 1998 Commission The 1998 Commission identified a number of practical problems with conducting nonpartisan elections, particularly problems relating to the ballots and voting machines. The 1999 and 2001 Commissions identified the same issues. 30 31 32 33 34  34  See July 29, 1998 Forum on Nonpartisan Citywide Elections, at p. 90. Id. at p. 70. Id. at p. 91. Id. at p. 92. Id. at p. 72.  29   As to the form of the ballot, the 1998 Commission noted that, pursuant to Election Law  7-104(5), the names of candidates of a particular party must appear on voting machines in the same column or row containing generally the names of candidates of such party, 35  and that, generally, the ballots as they  appear on the voting machines already face space limitations. The Commission proposed several options as to how to structure ballots so that they could accommodate nonpartisan and partisan elections, and still meet these constraints. These options included the use of a bifurcated ballot, double column bifurcation, or use of the final column. Attached as Appendix F is the 1998 This Commission's staff also is  Commission's description of these options.  currently reviewing options new options not discussed in the 1998 Commission's report. Regarding the voting machines themselves, the 1998 Commission noted that, as a practical matter, it is more difficult to conduct a nonpartisan primary than it is to cond uct the general election following such a primary, because of the presence of a ""lockout"" mechanism on each voting machine. Where nonpartisan and partisan primaries are being held simultaneously, all registered voters must be allowed to vote in the nonpartisan elections, while only voters registered for a particular party may be allowed to vote in that party's primaries. That  Commission noted that the City's voting machines have a lockout mechanism that prevents a voter who is not the member of a particular party from voting for  35  Election Law  1-104(3) defines a ""party"" as a ""any political organization which at the last proceeding election for governor polled at least fifty thousand votes for its candidate for governor.""  30   candidates of that party; when a voter enters the booth, the inspector flips a switch that allows the voter to select candidates from his or her party. While the 1998 Commission recognized that the City did not have a sufficient number of voting machines to devote some to nonpartisan primaries and others to partisan primaries, it believed that there were other viable solutions using the existing machines. For example, the Commission identified setting a separate nonpartisan primary date, using paper ballots, and using electronic voting machines as potential solutions to the lockout problem. It is also true that elections for City officials do not occur in the same year as State or federal elections, a fact that would tend to minimize the voting machine problem. For example, the 2003 elections will primarily be for elections to the City Council; there are no State or federal elections scheduled for next year. B. Electronic voting machines Federal legislation: Legislation is no w pending in Congress to assist state and local governments nationwide in an effort to upgrade voting machines. The Senate bill, known as The Bipartisan Election Reform Bill (S. 565), will, among other things, provide $3.5 billion through grants to states and localities to improve voting systems. The sponsors of the legislation in the Senate estimate that $3.5 billion will enable every locality in the nation to upgrade every voting machine, replacing older machinery with state of the art technology. These grants would be an 80% -20% federal-state match. Regardless of whether a state or locality uses the grant, states would have an obligation under the bill to meet certain  31   standards regarding the quality of their voting systems. For example, by 2006 state s must have voting systems in place that allow voters to verify their votes and to correct them before the votes are cast. The voting system must also conform to the error standards issued by the Federal Election Commission. The Senate bill mandates tha t, by 2004, states must be able to permit a voter who appears at the polls on election day to vote provisionally, even if there is no registration on file or it is alleged that the voter is ineligible. This bill, and one passed by the House, are currently before a conference committee, and is expected to pass the full Congress in September. President Bush has already said he will sign the legislation. New York State Task Force on Electronic Modernization: In February  2001, Governor Pataki signed an executive order creating the New York State Task Force on Election Modernization, a bipartisan panel charged with examining methods for conducting and administering elections and making recommendations designed to ensure the accuracy and fairness of elections held throughout the State.36 The seven-member task force issued its final report to the Governor on June 18, 2002.37 The report contains 64 recommendations and calls for dramatic reforms to modernize the State's election processes. The report recommends that each local board of elections, in consultation with the State Board, develop a plan, due by June 30, 2003, to gradually transition to full accessible electronic voting equipment, with a goal of substantial implementation in time for the 2004 presidential election. According to the report, 36 37  www.state.ny.us/governor/electionmodernization. www.state.ny.us/governor/electionmodernization/PDFS/nystaskforce.pdf.  32   the plans should include strategies for maintaining existing equipment during the transition, comprehensive voter outreach, and education and training of election personnel. Over the next several years, modernizing the State's voting systems and election process is expected to require more than $200 million in new resources and will require a federal, State and local partnership. Under the federal legislation currently pending before Congress, New York may be eligible for more than $135 million over the next several years to replace its voting machines and modernize its elections process. The report recommends that the State create an Election Modernization Capital Fund to leverage anticipated federal assistance. 38  The report also recommends amending State law to allow the use in New York State of voting technologies that do not use full -face ballots, that is, where a full ballot is displayed on a single surface.39 New York State is one of only two states to require a full- face ballot. 40  Summary of Charter Revision Options on Nonpartisan Elections: As stated, the Commission has certain issues that it must address as it considers whether it should propose a system of nonpartisan elections.  Issue: Should elections for City elective office be conducted in a nonpartisan manner? Options: The Commission must decide this issue.  38  The City's Board of Elections developed a plan for an electronic voting system more than a decade ago, and entered into a contract for that system's development and implementation in 1993. A dispute arose, however, with a subcontractor developing some of the necessary software. The dispute led to a lawsuit, which was settled in only in the past few years. No contract is currently in place for electronic voting machines or an electronic voting system. 39 See 9 N.Y.C.R.R.  6209.2. 40 Id. at pp. 18 -29.  33     Issue: If nonpartisan elections are appropriate for any City elective office, should they be held for all City elective offices, or only for some? Options: The Commission must decide this issue. Prior recent Commissions have discussed the issue in terms of instituting nonpartisan elections only for Citywide elective offices, i.e., for the Mayor, the Comptroller, and the Public Advocate.    Issue: If the Commission proposes nonpartisan elections, what should the effective date of the change be? Options: The Commission could choose to make the change effective upon adoption by the voters, in which case the 2003 elections would be nonpartisan. Alterna tively, it could choose a later effective date. Considerations that the Commission may want to consider include a desire for prompt implementation versus a need to phase in such a change.  Draft Charter Provisions If the Commission were to decide to propose shifting to a system of nonpartisan elections for all City elected offices, here is how the proposal might read. Since the Commission has neither decided whether to shift to a system of nonpartisan elections or how that system would function, this section exists merely to help demonstrate how the proposal might look should the Commission decide to place the issue before the voters.  34   HYPOTHETICAL NONPARTISAN ELECTIONS CHAPTER Section one. The New York city charter is amended by adding a new chapter three to read as follows: CHAPTER 3 ELECTION TO CITY OFFICE  60. General scope of chapter; election law; board of elections.

Nonpartisan primary election. At the time of the fall primary as  provided by the election law, in any year when a candidate for any of the offices of the mayor, comptroller, public advocate, member of the city council, or borough president is to be elected, there shall be held a nonpartisan primary election for the purpose of nominating the candidates for such offices.

There shall be no partisan, party or independent body identification, symbol or emblem of any kind for the candidates for the offices of mayor, comptroller, public advocate, member of the council, and borough president on the ballot or voting machine at a nonpartisan primary election or general election conducted pursuant to this chapter.  70. Order of names on ballot. The order of names on the ballot for a nonpartisan primary election and nonpartisan general election shall be determined as provided in the election law for candidates of a single party at a primary election as set forth in subdivision six of section 7-116 of the election law. When candidates for offices elected pursuant to this chapter appear on the same ballot as candidates for offices or party positions not covered by this chapter, the candidates for the offices covered by this chapter shall appear together on one part of the ballot, distinctly and prominently separated from the part or parts of the ballot used for candidates not covered by this chapter. 71.

The provisions of chapter forty-six of the charter and any local law regarding the voluntary system of campaign finance shall apply to elections held pursuant to this chapter, notwithstanding any inconsistent provisions, except that any reference to a primary, general election, or runoff election shall be deemed to refer to a nonpartisan primary, general, or runoff election held pursuant to this chapter. Notwithstanding any inconsistent provision of law, the campaign finance board shall promulgate such rules and take such other actions as may be necessary to effectuate this section and to ensure the full implementation of such voluntary system of campaign finance in relation to elections held pursuant to this chapter.  72.

The persons who testified were : Allan Lichtman, Chair of the Department of History at American University; Fred Siegal, Political Science Professor at Cooper Union and Fellow at the Progressive Policy Institute; Arthur Bramwell, Chairman Kings County Republi can Committee; Thomas Ognibene, Queens County Councilmember; and Kenneth Sherrill, Political Science Chair at Hunter College. Allan Lichtman was the first to testify. Lichtman is the author of numerous scholarly writings on political trends in American History and is recognized for his extensive public commentary on contemporary political developments. Lichtman also previously served as a consultant to the Charter Revision Commission on issues concerning Voting Rights Act compliance. Lichtman stated tha t he had been asked to answer one question by the Commission: whether or not, in his opinion, the move from partisan to nonpartisan elections would violate the Voting Rights Act. In considering this question, he specifically considered whether such a cha nge would diminish the opportunities for minorities within the City of New York to elect candidates of their choice for positions of Public Advocate, Comptroller, and Mayor. 43  According to Lichtman, there are two main minority  groups in New York City-African-Americans and Latinos- which together constitute about half of the population of the city and perhaps slightly under that  43  Transcript, New York City Charter Revision Commission, July 29, 1998 Nonp artisan Citywide Elections Forum (""Transcript 1998 Nonpartisan Forum""), at p. 7.  A-1   in terms of the voting age population.  44 45  Lichtman noted that the City also ha s a  significant Asian-American population.  Lichtman stated that, in order to do his analysis he would both look at the experience of other cities and at data about elections within the City itself. 46  He first considered the experience of other cities that have conducted nonpartisan elections. Of the 48 of the top 50 cities in the United States for which he had data , 37 had nonpartisan elections for mayor, while only 11 had partisan elections. Lichtman noted that one of those eleven cities, Chicago, had adopted nonpartisan elections for its upcoming mayoral election. 47  According to  Lichtman, nine out of the 11 cities ha d Anglo mayors, and two ha d black or Hispanic mayors. 48  Lichtman testified that of the cities that conduct nonpartisan elections, 22 had Anglo mayors, and 15 had black or Hispanic mayors. 49  As the ratio of  minority candidate success was higher in cities with nonpartisan elections, Lichtman concluded that partisan elections ha d failed as mechanism to allow Hispanics or blacks to advance to the position of mayor. 50  Lichtman noted that a Voting Rights Act analysis requires an examination of the success of minority candidates, because most often minority voters have  44 45 46 47 48 49 50  Id.

A-2   some tendency to vote for candidates of their own race.51 Lichtman testified that there were no cities with partisan systems that had bla ck or Hispanic population majorities that have a black or Hispanic mayor. He noted that in cities with nonpartisan systems, 28 percent of such cities had either a black or Hispanic mayor. He also noted that, based on his data, there was a positive correlation between nonpartisan systems and the election of black and Hispanic mayors. 52  Lichtman testified that he had done a statistical analysis looking at a number of factors that might affect the election of black or Hispanic mayors; such as the actual black and Hispanic population; the educational levels in the city; the existence of partisan or nonpartisan systems; and the positive correlation between nonpartisan systems and the election of a minority candidate for mayor . 53  According to Lichtman, this analysis indicated, based on the experience  of other cities, that: (1) nonpartisan elections we re the norm; and (2) there was no need for the identification that occurs from partisan elections in order to elect a minority candidate . 54  Lichtman testified that, under a nonpartisan system , candidates are not forbidden from stating their party affiliation while campaigning. However, on the ballot, the party label or affiliation is not disclosed at the time of voting.55 He stated that, typically, a nonpartisan primary is different from a partisan primary only in that all the candidates run in one primary without party labels. According to Lichtman, the candidates who prevail in the primary advance to a general 51 52 53 54 55  Id. Id. Id. Id. Id.  at p. 11. at pp.11- 12. at p. 12. at p. 13.  A-3   election if no one candidate gets the majority of the vote in the nonpartisan primary. 56  Lichtman testified that there are two different schemes typically used to choose how candidates advance to the general election. The first is that the top two candidates advance to the general election irrespective of their percentage of vote. The second is that, if a plurality of candidates obtain over 25 percent of the vote, then the top three move on the general election. Lichtman opined that a city like New York might choose the latter system to help minority candidates move onto the general election ballot. New York has a white majority but also sizable and strong minorities which might benefit from a three way split. 57  Lichtman also analyzed the voter turnout and voting patterns of New York City. He offered a typical example of how a minority candidate could be elected: A congressional district, for example, contains a 40 percent minority population; and that minority group votes cohesively in one party while the white population is divided between Democratic and Repub lican. Lichtman noted that, in such a case, the cohesive minority could easily predominate in the primary election, elect a candidate of their choice and then on occasion get enough white crossover votes in the general election to elect a minority candidate. 58  According to  Lichtman, this was the scenario that allowed Cynthia McKinney, a representative from Georgia, to be elected in her district.  56 57 58  Id. at p. 14. Id. Id. at p. 15.  A-4   Lichtman testified the minority population in New York City is nearly evenly split between black and Hispanic. 59  Therefore, the extent to which minorities  vote cohesively could determine elections . Lichtman noted that Hispanics, although they are overwhelming Democratic in New York, have a relatively low turnout rate in the primaries; and that in two of the three primaries, whites, who are half Democratic, had a higher voting turnout rate than Hispanics. 60  Based on  his analysis of the general elections in 1989, 1993, and 1997, Lichtman stated that whites have the highest turnout rates, blacks second, and Hispanic tur nout is very low relative to either whites or blacks. 61  Lichtman next analyzed actual voting habits in both primaries and in general elections from 1987 to 1997 by looking at all Mayoral elections and all Public Advocate and Comptrollers elections. 62  He noted that blacks and  Hispanics do not necessarily vote together in primary elections.63 He noted, however, that with the Dinkins election, blacks and Hispanics were united in voting together for Dinkins in 1989, although that this was unusual. He also noted that b lacks and Hispanics tend to vote together for a Democratic candidate in the general election regardless of whether the candidate was white or black. 64  Lichtman stated that based on his statistical analysis of primary and general elections there wa s no indication of a solid minority voting block of any kind in primary elections, although he did note that there was evidence of  59 60 61 62 63 64  Id. Id. at p. 17. Id. Id. at p. 18. Id. Id at p. 19.  A-5   minorities uniting behind Democratic candidates in general.  65  He also noted that  there is no great base of minority electoral success in New York for Citywide office from which retrogression can be measured.66 Lichtman did an internal statistical analysis of the exit polls and noted that, in New York, whites are about half Democratic, blacks are overwhelmingly Democratic, and Hi spanics are strongly Democratic. 67  He stated that it appears,  based on the exit polls, whites are the plurality group within the Democratic party, at between 43 and 45 percent, depending on the counting mechanism used. He further noted that whites predominate in the Republican Party. 68  Lichtman used the exit poll data to analyze the three major ethnic groups in New York in terms of party affiliation and who they voted for in 1993 and 1997.69 Lichtman noted that Ruth Messinger, a white candidate for Mayor,  received a smaller percentage of the white Democratic vote than Dinkins, the black candidate, suggesting that the white vote was not based simply on racial cues. 70  According to Lichtman, black Independents tended to vote similarly to  black Democrats and white Independents tended to vote similarly to white Republicans. Hispanic Independents tended to vote more like Democrats.  Lichtman stated that, based on this analysis, it did not appear that there was a reason to conclude that a move towards nonpartisan elections in New York would constitute a violation of the Voting Rights Act. 65 66 67 68 69 70 71  71  Id.

In response to a question posed by Commissioner Byrne regarding the importance of party labels, Lichtman stated that the party designation was very powerful and that in the absence of a party cue, voters would turn to other cues. He stated that one could generalize that party cues are less important in high visibility elections, such as in one for Mayor, than in elections where the voters are unlikely to know much about the candidates. 72  Lichtman also hypothesized that, in nonpartisan elections, the personality of the individual candidate becomes a more important issue.73 Lichtman stated, in response to another question, that a switch from partisan to nonpartisan would cause an increase in candidates running in the primary. 74  He also stated that a  narrowing of the field in the general election would not harm minority candidates because it was his experience that candidates und er third party labels have not been successful. 75  Commissioner Rubin noted that advancing only two candidates to the general election would result in fewer candidates appearing in the general election because there are often third-party candidates on the general e lection ballot. Commissioner Rubin asked whether that reduction could have an adverse impact on minority voting rights.76 Lichtman answered that since it was  72 73 74 75 76  Id. Id. Id. Id.

A-7   extremely unlikely to have a successful candidate under a third party label, there should not be a finding of an adverse impact. 77  The next speaker, Professor Fred Siegal, spoke regarding the failure of New York City's present electoral system. Professor Siegal noted that the  present system resulted in officials too comfortable with the disastrous and long term decline of New York City. 78  Professor Siegal opined that, should such a  downturn happen again, the political system now in place would once again fail to react. Professor Siegal stated that nonpartisan elections should be extended to all elections in New York City for several reasons: (1) New York has low voter participation; (2) New York is heavily weighted towards incumbents; (3) New York leads the nation in ballot access lawsuits and elections cases; and (4) the present system is a political monopoly which eliminates competition and accountability. 79  Professor Siegal disagreed with Mr. Lichtman only in that he believed the nonpartisan election mechanism should advance only two candidates to the general election, in order to avoid a successful candidate without a majority of the vote.80 Professor Siegal supported a system similar to that used in Los 81  Angeles, which establishes majorities.  He stated that the present system in  New York allows a small faction of one party to domi nate a large electorate.82 In response to a question from Commissioner Crotty, Professor Siegal stated that  77 78 79 80 81 82  Id.

Councilman Ognibene testified that he was a minority leader of the City Council and the Executive Director of the Queens Count y Republican Party. 84  He stated that the City Council was at its best when it was  least political. He claimed that anyone can be elected for City Council if they ran on the Democratic ticket. He claimed that many good Republican and  Independent candidate s have, in the past, not had a very good chance of prevailing at the general election. 85  He claimed that the City would be better off  if there were nonpartisan elections , because the City Council works best without regard to political affiliation. 86  Ognibene also stated that he believed that 87  nonpartisan elections would obviate the need for term limits.  Ognibene testified  that it is most important to serve the interests of the people and the community and that an elected official does not need to be steeped in party tradition to do that effectively. 88  Ognibene stated that he believed that the quality of the  candidate would be higher for City Council elections if the voters did not have to rely on party cues and if voters were required to judge a candidate on their beliefs and opinions. 83 84 85 86 87 88 89  89  When questioned by Commissioner Crotty as to whether  Id.

A-9   he believed his views were applicable to Citywide elections, Ognibene stated that they were.90 Ognibene stated, in response to a question as to what would  happen to the Conservative Party if nonpartisan elections were implemented, that the Conservative party had no potency. Ognibene claimed that if  nonpartisan elections were in effect, minorities would rally around their candidates based on racial cues more than on party cues. 91  Arthur Bramwell was the next speaker to testi fy. He stated that he was opposed to nonpartisan elections. Bramwell claimed that neither party affiliation nor race swayed voters; rather, voters were swayed by candidates who promise good government. 92  Bramwell stated that good government is not reserved for  any one group and that nonpartisan elections are just another gimmick for change. He claimed that by changing the electoral process, there will be a need for new voting apparatus and money therefore to support that change, which will inevitably lead to higher taxes. 93  Kenneth Sherrill, the Political Science Chair at Hunter College, then spoke against nonpartisan elections. He stated that there are many factors that affect a voter's choice, includ ing ones representing long -term and short- term values. He noted that party is a long -term value for most people and an important factor in their voting choice.94 Sherrill opined that the alternative to party politics is  ""everyone for oneself"" and that, in government, such an approach leads to  90 91 92 93 94  Id.

He believed this to be a poor result.95 Sherrill opposed nonpartisan elections for the following reasons: (1) they are likely to lead to gridlock in government; (2) they are likely to reduce the influence of the Mayor over the City Council, if the City Council elections were to remain partisan; (3) they encourage extremism and reduces moderation; (4) they diminish collective responsibility in gove rnment; (5) they are likely to intensify rather than diminish racial and ethnic tensions; (6) they are likely to lead to lower voter turnout; (7) they will erect serious barriers to the political incorporation of those New Yorkers who are relatively disadvantaged; (8) they impose substantial difficulties on the average citizen's efforts to evaluate competing candidates; (9) they increase the influence of campaign contributions; and (10) they significantly disadvantages those who are least well off in society: racial minorities, immigrant groups, those with low income, and those with the least education. 96  Commissioner Crotty noted that the present party structure did not deliver the vital things that Professor Sherrill claims they do. 97  Professor  Sherrill  then  stated that nominations through primaries as opposed to nominations through party organizations would cure the ills of the current system. He also added that fundraising matters much more in primaries than in general elections. 98  95 96 97 98  Id Id. Id. Id.  at pp. 84. at pp. 85- 93. at p. 96. at p. 97.  A-11   Commissioner Tsambi nos stated that the problem with Professor Sherrill's analysis is that New York does not have a competitive two -party system. 99  In response to a question, Lichtman stated that there is no systematic relationship between partisan versus nonpartisan voter turnout in the top 25 cities. 100  Commissioner Crotty expressed his concern that there were over  500,000 voters who were not members of a particular party and therefore, under the present system, could not vote in any primary. 101  Bramwell responded that  the solution is to change the Election Law to provide for open primaries so that everyone can vote.102  99 100 101 102  Id. at p. 99.

In 1922 women became eligible to vote and run for election to the Minnesota Legislature. From 1922 to 1970 the percentage of the Legislature comprised by women was very low, ranging from zero to 2.5 percent. Over the next twenty years the representation by women increased steadily from 3.0 percent in 1972 to 27.4 percent in 1992. In the 1996 general election a historic high of 61 (30.4%) women were elected to the Minnesota Legislature. The numbers of women elected in the 1998 and 2000 elections were lower, at 57 (28.4%) and 58 (28.9%), respectively. The decline of representation by women continued in the 2002 general election with the number of women elected to the Legislature decreasing to 54 (26.9%).

Never have they been more important than in recent years as they find themselves pinned between federal mandates and local needs. Issues once addressed only in the halls of Congress are now being debated in state capitols throughout the nation. Programs once funded with federal dollars are now being funded through state and local budgets. Local governments increasingly look to the states for assistance and finances. Like never before, the decisions made by state legislatures impact the citizenry. For our democratic system of government to prosper, it is vital that citizens get involved in government at all levels. Involvement in government doesn't necessarily include running for office or helping candidates. It does, however, include being familiar with the process, being informed on the issues, and voting for those candidates we feel will best serve and represent us. This guide serves to explain the state legislative process in South Dakota. At a time when citizen apathy is on the rise across the country, it is our hope that those learning from this guide will translate their knowledge into involvement. Our system depends on it.  State (SDCL 20-13) and Federal (Title VI of Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 as amended, and the Americans With Disabilities Act of 1990) laws require that the Legislative Research Council provide services to all persons without regard to race, color, creed, religion, sex, disability, ancestry, or national origin.  1   2   THE SOUTH DAKOTA LEGISLATURE: AN OVERVIEW State governments, like the federal government, are divided into three distinct branches. The legislative branch makes the laws, the executive branch carries out the laws, and the judicial branch interprets the laws. This guide's focus is the legislative branch and the process by which laws are made in South Dakota. The South Dakota Legislature is bicameral, or composed of two bodies. The other states also have bicameral legislatures with one exception. The Nebraska Legislature is unicameral, or composed of only one body. In South Dakota, the two bodies are the Senate and the House of Representatives. The state constitution provides that the Senate shall consist of not fewer than 25 nor more than 35 members and that the House shall consist of not fewer than 50 or more than 75 members. Currently, the Senate has 35 members and there are 70 members of the House of Representatives. The state comprises 35 legislative districts. (See following map.) Voters in each district elect one senator and two representatives. Every ten years, in accordance with the state constitution, the Legislature must redraw the boundaries of the legislative districts to reflect shifts in the state's population. This reapportionment process keeps the districts as equally populated as possible. That way, every state citizen receives equal representation. As mandated in our state constitution, the Legislature meets annually at the seat of government, which is the state capitol in Pierre. The sessions begin every year on the second Tuesday in January at noon. The state constitution limits the length of these sessions. In odd-numbered years, the session is limited to 40 legislative days, and in even-numbered years, the session is limited to 35 legislative days. Legislative days do not include Sundays, holidays, or days when the Legislature is in recess. In addition to these regular sessions, special sessions are held periodically when a need arises. The constitution gives the Governor the right to convene a special session, but the Legislature may also call itself into special session. The Legislature, in a Special Session on October 23-24, 2001, adopted a new redistricting plan for distribution of legislative seats based on the 2000 federal census figures. Each of the thirty-five senate districts also constitutes a congruent, dual-member house district with one exception. Senate District 28 constitutes two house districts, House District 28A and House District 28B. The separate districts were created to protect minority voting rights. The average population of a legislative district in 2000 was 21,567 people. Since it is a practical and political impossibility to have every district consist of exactly the ""ideal"" number of inhabitants, the Legislature adopted an apportionment plan with variances. The Legislature redistricts every ten years using the federal census figures. The Legislature determined that, as a matter of policy, the legislative districts be constituted, as nearly as practicable, in accordance with the following principles:  3   (1)  Adherence to standards of population deviance as established by judicial precedent and to standards of population deviance as prescribed by Article III, section 5, of the South Dakota Constitution; Protection of communities of interest by means of compact and contiguous districts; Respect for geographical and political boundaries; and Protection of minority voting rights consistent with the United States Constitution, the South Dakota Constitution, and federal statutes, as interpreted by the United States Supreme Court and other courts with jurisdiction.

The people who serve in the South Dakota Legislature are as diverse as the population of the state in general. There is no way to define a ""typical legislator"" in South Dakota. Nonetheless, it is safe to say that most legislators fit the image of an average South Dakotan more closely than they fit the image of a politician. This is due to the fact they are part-time legislators who must juggle public service with all their responsibilities in the private sector. W hen they are not in Pierre devoting their time to lawmaking, legislators are in their respective districts living among those they represent. Legislators come from all walks of life; some are just beginning careers and others are of retirement age. There are teachers, homemakers, and doctors. In years past, farmers and ranchers dominated the Legislature. In more recent years, there are still plenty of legislators involved in agriculture, but there are plenty of others in different pursuits. Among the legislators elected in 1999, for example, those engaged in business outnumber those involved in agriculture. Another one-fifth of them is in a profession. Recent years have also brought another change in the make-up of the Legislature. More and more women are running for the office and being elected. There were no women in the Legislature until 1923 when Representative Gladys Pyle took office. From that year through the early 1970s, at any given time, the number of female legislators could be counted on one hand. Since that time, however, their numbers have increased rapidly. In 1991, twenty-six women, the most ever, were sworn in as legislators. The increasing number of women in the Legislature has done more than just change its composition. To a certain degree, it has changed its agenda because women tend to bring certain issues, such as childcare and other family issues, to the forefront where they have not always been in the past. The qualifications necessary to run for the Legislature are simple, and are the same in both the Senate and the House of Representatives. Candidates must be at least twenty-one years old. They must be United States citizens who have resided in South Dakota for the two years just prior to the election. Additionally, they must be qualified electors in the particular legislative district they wish to represent, which means they must live and be registered voters in that particular district. The term of office for both senators and representatives is two years. The entire membership of the Legislature is elected in every even-numbered year. Since 1993, no senator or representative may serve more than four consecutive terms or eight consecutive years, in one house. South Dakota voters approved an amendment to the state constitution in 1992 calling for these term limits. Many other states also limit terms of state legislators. It is an idea gaining in popularity across the country not only for state legislators, but for all elected officials. Throughout the past decade, the legislative turnover rate has remained fairly constant, hovering around 25 percent. This means that roughly one-fourth of the state legislators are replaced at each election. Some of them choose not to run again, and others are defeated at the ballot box. If at any time between elections a legislator dies in office or resigns, the state constitution provides that the Governor appoint a replacement to fill the vacancy.  7   Before entering upon their official duties, members of the Legislature and its officers take and subscribe to the following oath or affirmation: I do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will support the Constitution of the United States and the Constitution of the state of South Dakota, and will faithfully discharge the duties of (senator, representative, or officer) according to the best of my abilities, and that I have not knowingly or intentionally paid or contributed anything, or made any promise in the nature of a bribe, to directly or indirectly influence any vote at the election at which I was chosen to fill said office, and have not accepted, nor will I accept or receive directly or indirectly, any money, pass, or any other valuable thing, from any corporation, company or person, for any vote or influence I may give or withhold on any bill or resolution or appropriation, or for any other official act. This oath is administered by a Justice of the Supreme Court, Judge of the Circuit Court, or the presiding officer of either house. The Secretary of State records and files the oath subscribed to by each member and officer.  8   NUMBER OF WOMEN LEGISLATORS  YEAR 1923 1925 1927 1929 1931 1933 1935 1937 1939 1941 1943 1945 1947 1949 1951 1953 1955 1957 1959 1961 1963 1965  SENATE 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0  HOUSE 1 4 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 3 2 1 2 3 2 3  TOTAL 1 4 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 3 2 1 2 3 2 3  YEAR 1967 1969 1971 1973 1975 1977 1979 1981 1983 1985 1987 1989 1991 1993 1995 1996 1997 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003  SENATE 0 0 0 1 5 2 3 3 3 4 5 8 11 7 5 6 5 5 5 5 6 4  HOUSE 2 2 3 4 7 8 6 8 12 11 16 13 15 14 14 14 13 10 11 11 11 11  TOTAL 2 2 3 5 12 10 9 11 15 15 21 21 26 21 19 20 18 15 16 16 17 15  NOTE: First woman legislator: Representative Gladys Pyle (Beadle) (1923)  9   10   ORIGIN OF BILLS W hen state legislators are in Pierre every year for the annual session, the bulk of their time is spent discussing ideas for change in state law. Some of the ideas involve changing only a word or two of a current law; others involve rewriting an entire section of law. Still others include repealing or getting rid of a current state law. All of the ideas, regardless of their size or scope, must be presented to the Legislature in the form of a bill. Bills are simply the ideas recorded on paper in a prescribed format. Only legislators and legislative committees may present or introduce bills to the Legislature, but ideas for bills come from a multitude of sources. Often legislators have their own ideas for bills stemming from their expertise in a certain field or simply from an experience they've had or an observation they've made. For example, a teacher who is also a legislator, may sponsor a bill proposing a change in the education system he or she feels is necessary. Or, a legislator whose granddaughter is attacked by a vicious dog may seek to tighten the restrictions on keeping dangerous animals. Special interest groups are another source of ideas. Members of these groups often ask legislators to sponsor bills promoting their interests. M.A.D.D. (Mothers Against Drunk Drivers), for instance, may persuade a legislator to sponsor a bill aimed at reducing the numbers of drunk drivers. Also, groups like the South Dakota Retailers' Association might seek sponsorship for bills addressing the concerns of small business owners. Many ideas for bills come from government agencies. Each year several bills are introduced by legislators and committees at the request of the Governor or on behalf of a department in state government. Those who work closely with state law are often able to recommend ways to improve it. The Secretary of State, for example, may seek a change in an election law. The Attorney General might try to stiffen the penalty for a particular crime, or officials from the Department of Revenue may attempt to clarify a tax law. Last, but not least, ideas for bills also come from those individuals represented by the legislators, the constituents. You do not have to be a state employee or a member of a special interest group to let your ideas be known. In fact, most legislators are very receptive to the suggestions and concerns of the people who live in their district. In one instance, some constituents complain to their legislator about having to leave the state to receive a certain medical treatment. In turn, their legislator sponsors a bill, which would allow them to receive the treatment in state. In another case, a constituent's problems with an insurance company lead a legislator to introduce a bill changing an insurance law. W hatever the circumstances, it takes only one individual with an idea to make a change. Once a legislator has an idea in mind, the next step is to put the idea into the form of a bill. Though virtually anyone can draft a bill, the rules of the Legislature stipulate that all bills must be in the form and style dictated by the Legislative Research Council (LRC). Therefore, a legislator wishing to introduce a bill generally brings the idea or the draft of a proposed bill to the LRC where staff members either draft the bill or make final preparations on one drafted by others.  11   The legislator who begins to move the prime sponsor.

Senate bills have senators as prime sponsors, as prime sponsors. However, members of either  Although bills may not be officially introduced until the first day of a legislative session, those elected to serve in the upcoming Legislature may prefile bills with the Legislative Research Council up to thirty days in advance. Interim committees often prefile legislation under the names of individual legislators who served on the committee. The rules require executive agencies to prefile any legislation they wish to have considered. They also must get permission from the chair of a legislative standing committee to do so. A bill in its proper form consists of three main parts: the title, the enacting clause, and the body. The state constitution dictates that bills embrace only one subject, and that subject must be expressed in the title. Therefore, the title gives the reader a brief summary of the subject of the bill. The enacting clause, ""BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF SOUTH DAKOTA,"" is also prescribed by the constitution and shows that everything listed below it is to become the law of the state. If it is not included, the bill has no force of law. Lastly, the body is the remainder of the bill, the part that will actually become law. It is divided into sections to make it easier to read and to reference. In addition to the three main parts, a bill also includes a list of sponsors and a number. The name of the prime sponsor always appears first on the bill, and the co-sponsors are alphabetically listed thereafter. If a committee is sponsoring a bill, then only the name of the committee is listed. A number is assigned to the bill upon introduction and is used to identify the bill as it works its way through the process. Though legislators spend a majority of their time in sessions discussing bills, they are not the only proposals that come before the Legislature. Listed below are four types of resolutions that may be introduced. (1) A simple resolution is unique in that it pertains to and is acted on by only one house. It is used primarily to express an opinion, express gratitude, or condolences, or to make a request of the other house. A concurrent resolution expresses an opinion of the Legislature, but it has no force of law. Often it is used to persuade the Congress to act in a certain way or to make a request of the Governor or a government agency. A joint resolution is, by law, used to propose changes to the state constitution and submit them to the voters at the next election. It is also used to ratify or propose amendments to the United States Constitution. Unlike the previous two types of resolutions, a joint resolution must only contain matters of legislation. A resolution of disapproval allows the Legislature to disapprove of any reorganization of the executive branch done by the Governor during the preceding year. It is the newest form of resolution and used less frequently than the others. 12  (2)  (3)  (4)   LEGISLATIVE STRUCTURE AND ORGANIZATION To fully understand the legislative process and how laws in this state are made, it is first necessary to understand the Legislature's rather complex structure and organization. The Legislature really consists of two structures. First, there is the official, bicameral structure. The Senate and the House of Representatives are each a separate unit and act independently of the other. Secondly, there is the underlying political structure. The members of each political party within each house also form separate units. This allows legislators who share the same political philosophy to work together to accomplish their legislative goals. Though the two structures are completely different in nature and function, they both provide the Legislature with its organizational base. In accordance with the constitution, each house elects its own officers and employees with one exception. In the Senate, the presiding officer is not elected. The Lieutenant Governor serves as President of the Senate. However, the membership does elect a President Pro Tempore from its ranks to preside in the absence of the President. In the House, the presiding officer is the Speaker of the House. Also elected is a Speaker Pro Tempore to preside in the absence of the Speaker. The election of officers occurs every year on the first day of the legislative session. The presiding officers of both houses perform such duties as maintaining order in the legislative chambers, controlling the flow of business, recognizing those legislators wishing to speak, and signing bills and resolutions after they have passed. Beyond the presiding officers, the main officers elected are the Secretary of the Senate and the Chief Clerk of the House. Other employees include assistants to the Secretary and Chief Clerk, Sergeants-at-Arms, and others necessary to properly conduct business in each of the houses. W hile the official structure of the Legislature and the duties of its presiding officers are laid out by the constitution and rules of the Legislature, the political structure is much less defined. It is a structure that operates to a large extent outside the public eye. The political structure is organized by caucus. A caucus is simply a meeting of members of one political party. In each house there are two caucuses, one Democratic and one Republican. The party in each house that has the most members in its caucus is the majority party, and the party with fewer members is the minority party. Each of the caucuses elects a leader and one or more assistant leaders. The leader of the caucus of the majority party is the majority leader, and the leader of the caucus of the minority party is the minority leader. The duties of the leaders within the political structure are very different from those of the presiding officers. W hile the presiding officers concentrate on the day-to-day procedures of the Legislature, the party leaders focus on the actual legislation being discussed. They have duties to perform within their caucuses and duties to perform on behalf of their caucuses. If the political party decides to take a stand on a particular issue, for example, the caucus leader generally works hard to persuade all the members of the caucus to vote accordingly  13   on the issue. Also, the leader is often called upon to be the spokesperson for the caucus when the Legislature is in session. Throughout most of South Dakota's history, the Republican party has been the majority party in both the Senate and the House of Representatives. This is especially true in the House where the Democrats were the majority for only four years during the mid 1930s. In the Senate, the Democrats were in the majority for most of the 1930s, for two years in the late 1950s and from 1973 to 1976. More recently, they controlled the Senate in 1993 and 1994. Beyond that, Republicans have always outnumbered Democrats. Although the official structure and the political structure are separate, one is not completely independent of the other. The power of the majority party extends into the official structure. In both houses, for example, the majority party selects those presiding officers who are elected. They propose the nominees who are then formally voted on by the entire house. Additionally, the majority party is able to select the other officers and employees who will serve in that house. Due to this control, the majority leaders are key players in regulating the flow of business in both houses. They have more power than the minority leaders and they use it to try to get their parties' proposals signed into law.  14   Official Structure  South Dakota Senate and House of Representatives SENATE (35 Members) HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES (70 Members)  PRESIDENT OF THE SENATE (LT.

In fact, many bills never make it to the end of the journey. In an average year, about sixty percent of the bills introduced become law; forty percent do not. At some point along the way they fail to receive enough support to continue in the process. Following is an outline of the steps a bill must go through to be enacted into law. The numbered paragraphs below correspond with the numbered sequences in the illustration. The bill in the example is a house bill. A senate bill goes through the same process except it would begin in the Senate rather than in the House. 1) BILL IS DRAFTED. As discussed earlier, it is at this point when the legislator's idea is put into bill form, usually by a staff member of the Legislative Research Council. INTRODUCTION & ASSIGNMENT OF NUMBER. To introduce the bill, the house member deposits seven copies of it with the Bill Clerk in the House. This must be done at least two hours prior to the opening of the daily session. The Bill Clerk then assigns a number to the bill. House bills are numbered consecutively beginning with No. 1001. In the Senate, bills are numbered consecutively beginning with No. 1. Once a bill is numbered, it cannot be withdrawn. FIRST READING. The rules of the Legislature dictate that each bill be read, or presented, twice by number and title. The first of these occurs upon introduction by the Chief Clerk of the House. COMMITTEE ASSIGNMENT & PRINTING. After the first reading, the Speaker of the House assigns the bill to a standing committee. The bill is then sent to the printer where several hundred copies are made for distribution to legislators, legislative staff, lobbyists, and any other interested parties. COMMITTEE CONSIDERATION & REPORT. At this point, the committee to which the bill was assigned begins its work reviewing the bill. Public testimony is taken and members of the committee discuss and vote on the bill. Committee members may also amend the bill. A report of the committee's actions is then submitted to the entire House by the chair. SECOND READING. If the bill is acted upon favorably in committee, it then goes back to the House for its second reading. By rule, the second reading takes place at least one legislative day after the House receives the committee report on the bill. Once again, the Chief Clerk presents the bill by number and title.  2)  3)  4)  5)  6)  18   20   7)  DEBATE & VOTE. Now the bill comes before the entire membership of the House. Members use this opportunity to speak on the bill, offer amendments, and ultimately cast their votes for or against it. The bill passes if a majority of the members of the House vote in favor of it. ENGROSSED. If the bill is amended on the House floor, it must be engrossed before it moves on to the Senate. This means the amendments are added to the text of the bill, and it is put into the exact form it was in when it received final passage in the House. Bills are also engrossed before their second readings if amendments were placed on them in committee. FIRST READING. The bill begins its journey in the Senate. The Secretary of the Senate reads its number and title. COMMITTEE ASSIGNMENT. Next the bill is assigned to a standing committee by the President of the Senate. COMMITTEE CONSIDERATION & REPORT. As in the other house, the committee takes public testimony on the bill, discusses it, and votes on it. Amendments may also be added. The chair of the committee reports the committee's action on the bill to the Senate. If the bill is not supported by a majority of the committee members, it does not proceed further. SECOND READING. At least one legislative day after the Senate receives the committee report and after the bill is engrossed, if necessary, it is given second reading by the Secretary of the Senate. DEBATE & VOTE. The entire Senate is now given the chance to speak on the bill, offer amendments, and vote on it. If a majority of the Senate votes in favor of the bill, it moves on. ENGROSSED. If the bill did not undergo any changes in the Senate, it is engrossed and moves ahead in the process. ENROLLED, SIGNED BY SPEAKER & CLERK, SIGNED BY PRESIDENT & SECRETARY. After the bill passes both houses in the same form, it is enrolled. Enrollment is the process whereby all amendments and corrections are incorporated into the bill, and it is put into its final form. Following enrollment, the presiding officer of each house signs the bill. GOVERNOR. Next, the bill is delivered to the Governor, who, in most cases, determines its fate. In this regard, the Governor has several options, all of which are clearly stipulated in the state constitution. APPROVAL. If a bill is delivered to the Governor while the Legislature is still in session, it becomes law if he signs the bill or takes no action within five days of the delivery date. If a bill is delivered to the Governor within five days of a recess or  8)  9)  10)  11)  12)  13)  14)  15)  16)  17)  21   adjournment, it becomes law if he signs the bill or takes no action on it within fifteen days of the date of recess or adjournment. 18) VETO. To show his disapproval of a bill, the Governor can veto it within the time frame stated above. This action prevents the bill from becoming law, at least temporarily, and sends it back to the Legislature. The Governor may also return bills with errors in style or form to the Legislature with specific recommendations for change. CHIEF CLERK OF THE HOUSE. Since the bill originated in the House, the vetoed bill, along with a message from the Governor explaining why he vetoed it, is delivered to the House. LEGISLATURE CONSIDERS VETO. Members of the Legislature review the Governor's veto message and then must decide whether to override the veto and let the bill become law despite the Governor's objections. In order for a veto to be overridden, two-thirds of the members of each house must vote in favor of the override. Since the bill is a House bill, the House votes first. If two-thirds of the House members support the override, the bill then goes to the Senate for a vote. If the House does not vote to override the veto, the veto is sustained and the legislation is dead. In cases where the bill was vetoed due to a style and form error, the bill becomes a law if a majority of the Legislature agrees to the style and form changes suggested by the Governor. SECRETARY OF STATE. All bills enacted into law are ultimately filed with the Secretary of State. This includes bills signed by the Governor, those he took no action on, and those that the Governor vetoed, but the veto was overridden by the Legislature. PROMULGATION OF LAW. In the end, the Secretary of State delivers a copy of each new law to the Code Counsel in the Legislative Research Council, who is responsible for publishing the new laws. They are compiled in the Session Laws of South Dakota, an annual publication that is given to all legislators and which is available for purchase from the South Dakota Bureau of Administration. The Code Counsel is also responsible for adding the new laws to the South Dakota Codified Laws, a multiple-volume compilation of all the current laws of the state. The ""code,"" as it is often called, is on the shelves of most public libraries across the state. Thus, the new laws are added to the books and are accessible to the public within a few months following each legislative session. no law can take effect sooner than ninety days following existing state law sets the effective date of bills passed 1, unless the new law itself lists a later effective date. his.  19)  20)  21)  22)  The state constitution provides that the legislative session. In addition, during the regular session at July There are, however, exceptions to t  Certain bills going through the legislative process are declared to be emergency measures. Emergency measures are those measures necessary for the support of state government or for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health, and safety. They are treated  22   differently from most other bills in two respects. First, in order to pass, they must receive the support of at least two-thirds of the members of each house. Secondly, these bills take effect immediately upon receiving the approval of the Governor. Emergency measures are readily identified because they all must contain an emergency clause in their titles. The illustration on how a bill becomes a law depicts the progression of a bill in its simplest form. The progress of most bills is somewhat more complicated. One frequently occurring example of this is when a bill passes each house in a different form. Say, for instance, the bill in the illustration is amended both in the House and in the Senate. After the bill passes the Senate, it has to backtrack. The bill returns to the House, where the members vote on whether or not to accept the changes made to the bill by the Senate. If the House approves the changes, the bill proceeds to the Governor's desk. If the House does not approve the changes, the bill goes to a conference committee. A conference committee is comprised of three members from each house. Its mission is to arrive at a compromise on the bill that is acceptable to both sides. Some conference committees are successful; others are never able to reach a consensus, and the legislation is never enacted. Often a conference committee simply runs out of time. They are usually appointed late in the session and must quickly complete their work. At first glance, the journey of a bill appears lengthy and complex, but with familiarity, the legislative process becomes less complicated and easy to follow. W ithout such a streamlined process, it is unlikely the Legislature would be able to review all the bills each year in such a timely manner. The progress of each bill through the legislative process is documented in the computerized Bill Status Report. It is updated daily and provides the current status of each bill and resolution. These reports are available to the public outside of each of the legislative chambers. They can be viewed either in hard copy or on a computer terminal. The public may also purchase subscriptions to the reports or view them free of charge on the LRC web site.  23   Bill Status Report  VETOES 1974-2003 35 30 25 Vetoes 20 15 10 5 0 74 75 76 77 78 79 80 81 82 83 84 85 86 87 88 89 90 91 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 99 00 01 02 03 LEGISLATIVE YEAR  24   THE COMMITTEE PROCESS If it were not for committees, the Legislature would probably be in session all year. It would take that long for the entire Senate and the entire House of Representatives to scrutinize and take public testimony on every bill. Fortunately, however, the workload in each house is divided among several subunits. These subunits are the standing committees. Their primary role in the legislative process is to thoroughly examine the bills assigned to them and recommend if these bills should become law. There are thirteen standing committees in each house. In the Senate most committees consist of seven or nine senators. The majority leader, President Pro Tempore, and minority leader select the members of each committee and the chair and vice-chair. In the House, most committees consist of thirteen or fifteen representatives. The Speaker of the House, with advice from the minority leader, picks the members and the chair and vice-chair of the committees. Most legislators are members of two committees. Some serve on more than two committees, but that is often impossible due to the fact that two or three committees are usually meeting at the same time. From a political standpoint, the composition of each standing committee composition of the house as a whole. Say, for example, the Republicans hold majority in the Senate. They would also hold a two-thirds majority in each of standing committees, and the chair and vice-chair of the committees would Republicans. The Democrats would not be in the majority on any committee. mirrors the a two-thirds the Senate likely all be  Following the introduction and first reading of a bill in either house, the presiding officer assigns it to a committee. The committees are divided by subject matter. Generally speaking, this means all the bills dealing with one subject are assigned to the same committee. For example, there are transportation committees in both houses, which ordinarily receive bills regarding state highways, railroads, aviation, and other topics related to transportation. However, the committee assignment of a particular bill is not always predictable due to the fact that the presiding officers may assign any bill to any committee. Once a bill is assigned to a committee, the chair decides when the bill will be heard, and the bill is placed on the agenda for that particular meeting. An agenda is prepared for each meeting. It contains not only the date, time, and location of the meeting, but also a list of bills likely to be discussed by the committee at that particular time. By rule, one legislative day must come between the posting of the agenda and the meeting date. This is to give legislators, lobbyists, and other interested parties enough notice so they can be in attendance at the meeting when the bill is acted upon. The committees in the Senate and the House meet during the morning hours of each legislative day. Some of them meet three times a week, and others meet twice a week. As the legislative session progresses, some of the committees are unable to complete their work within the allotted time and must schedule additional meetings in the evenings. Each committee is staffed by at least one research analyst or fiscal analyst from the Legislative Research Council and a committee secretary.  25   Committee meetings are open to the public. They are all held in meeting rooms within the State Capitol. Seating is available on a first come, first served basis. W hen controversial bills such as those dealing with abortion or environmental issues are discussed, meetings usually draw large crowds. At other times, few people are present beyond the committee members and staff. In addition to the meetings being open to the public, the committee minutes are available to anyone desiring them. Committees usually discuss several bills at each of their meetings. The same general procedure is routinely followed on each bill, though there are extenuating circumstances which might alter it, and the chair is free to run the meeting as he or she sees fit. First of all, the legislator sponsoring the bill or someone he or she designates presents the bill. This involves explaining the bill and the reason why it was introduced. Following that presentation, the committee generally takes public testimony on the bill. Proponents speak first, then opponents. The testimony comes from a variety of sources. Most often, it comes from lobbyists, or individuals hired to promote the views of a group, organization, or industry on measures considered by the Legislature. Other legislators also sometimes wish to share their views. Finally, it comes from members of the general public. Anyone is free to express an opinion during the committee process whether they are in favor of a bill or against it. Upon completion of the public testimony, members of the committee discuss the bill. Some committee members ask questions of those who have testified. Others express their opinions on the merit of the bill. Still others offer amendments, or proposed changes, to the bill they think will improve it. At times, amendments are offered which change the bill entirely. These amendments are known as hoghouses, and they involve deleting the entire content of the bill following the enacting clause and replacing it with different material. Next, the committee must make their recommendation on the bill. Below are the recommendations a committee makes. (1) (2) DO PASS, which means the committee recommends the bill pass in its original form. DO PASS AMENDED, which means the committee recommends the bill pass, not in its original form, but in an altered form set out by the committee. DO NOT PASS, which means the committee feels it is important for the bill to be considered by the entire house, but does not recommend its passage. WITHOUT RECOMMENDATION, which means the committee cannot come to a consensus or has no feelings on the bill one way or another, so feels the entire house should determine whether it should pass.  (3)  (4)  In addition to the above-mentioned recommendations, there are other actions a committee can take on a bill. A committee is able to kill a bill, or prevent it from getting any further in the process, in two different ways. First, they can table it, which postpones further discussion on the bill until such time as a majority of members of the committee vote to have it brought up for discussion once again. Secondly, a committee can kill a bill by postponing it to a date that falls after the adjournment date of the legislative session.  26   Committees must take final action on every bill they are assigned, and that action must be reported to the entire house. All final actions taken on bills by standing committees require a majority vote of the members-elect. This means that a majority of the entire membership of the committee is needed, not just a majority of those present at that particular meeting. If there is unanimous agreement that a certain bill be recommended ""do pass"" or ""do pass amended,"" and the bill does not require a two-thirds vote for passage, the committee can recommend that the bill be placed on the consent calendar of the particular house. This allows the other members of the house know that the bill passed unanimously and prohibits further discussion on the bill by the entire house unless one of the members feels it is warranted. Following is a list of the standing committees in both houses and some of the subjects they cover. Agriculture and Natural Resources Bills relating to the production and distribution of agricultural products; soil conservation; animals and livestock; the state fair; regulation of grain elevators, pesticide and fertilizer dealers and livestock auctions; weather modification; and brand inspection. Bills relating to game, fish and parks; mining; water development and irrigation; forestry; environmental protection; energy conservation; trespass laws; and nuclear waste disposal. Appropriations The general appropriation bill, which contains the budgets of all departments of state government; all bills for special appropriation of state revenues; and bills relating to the appropriation process. Commerce Bills relating to insurance; banking; investment; loans and interest; labor; liquor; mercantile transactions; regulation of professions and occupations engaged in commerce; Uniform Commercial Code; OSHA; corporations; property; litter; and minimum wage. Education Bills relating to the school districts; the finance, operations, and curriculum of public schools; the teaching profession; special education; higher education; the board of regents; the department of education and cultural affairs; and vocational education. Government Operations and Audit Bills relating to legislative auditing and state and local government departments and agencies.  27   Health and Human Services Bills relating to health mat disabled; the medical and regulation of hospitals and or retarded; spousal abuse; Judiciary Bills relating to the courts and court administration; the legal professions; crimes; criminal procedure; law enforcement; personal rights; civil law and procedure; domestic relations; succession and probate; guardianship; administrative procedures; prisons and jails; code commission; and human rights. Legislative Procedure Bills relating to legislative procedures; the Legislative Research Council; and basic housekeeping matters during the legislative session. Local Government Bills relating to the organization and administration of county, municipal, and township government; special districts; elections; and planning and zoning. Retirement Laws Bills relating to the pensions, annuities, and benefits of employees and officers in public service. State Affairs Bills relating to the organization of the executive branch of state government; policy decisions of overriding state concern; public employees; worker's compensation; public fiscal administration; veterans and military affairs; the state Legislature; the state constitution; relations with the Indian tribes; the state building authorities and state authorized bonds; and regulation of electrical and telephone utilities. Bills not clearly identified with any other committee or subject area will usually find their way to the State Affairs Committee. Taxation Bills relating to the levying and collection of property, sales and other taxes; assessment procedures; mill levies; and classification of property. Transportation Bills relating to highways and bridges; motor vehicles; public safety; regulation of motor carriers; traffic ordinances; and licensing. ters; mental illness; drugs; chemical dependency; the aged or nursing professions; medical malpractice; welfare assistance; nursing homes; state institutions for the mentally ill, blind, deaf, and abortion.  28   In addition to the standing committees, there are also select committees, which are generally composed of three members from each house. Select committees are appointed periodically to perform specific tasks such as arranging for a joint session of the Legislature, determining the compensation of legislative employees, or notifying the Governor that the Legislature has completed its work for the year.  29   30   THE APPROPRIATIONS PROCESS One of the greatest challenges legislators face each year is the task of dividing state funds among many competing interests. It is difficult for the simple reason that there never seems to be enough money to do everything requested. Not every program within every state agency can be fully funded. Therefore, the legislators must set priorities and distribute funds accordingly. The ultimate goal in any state budget-making process is to provide a high level of services to the citizens of the state, while at the same time keeping taxes low. In recent years, this ultimate goal is becoming an impossible dream in almost every state in the union. As the federal government and local governments look to the states for increased financial support, states are feeling the pinch. They are left with the grim reality that, in many instances, budget cuts must be made or taxes must be raised, and neither option is popular with the citizenry. W hile South Dakota has not experienced the severe economic shortfalls many other states have, it is certainly not immune from them. The appropriations process, or the process whereby moneys are set aside for specific uses, is two-fold. First, it involves determining the amount of revenue available. Secondly, it involves appropriating money for the operation of state government and for various other uses. The state appropriations process is the responsibility of both the Governor and the Legislature. Each of them plays a role in ultimately deciding how state funds are spent. In South Dakota, the Governor's role in the process begins in late summer of every year. By that time, he and his economic advisors are busy preparing a budget for the upcoming fiscal year, which begins on the next July 1 and runs through the following June 30. The Governor's budget contains revenue projections and recommended expenditures. It contains a separate budget for each state agency. W ithin each agency budget, expenditures are broken down by program. In addition, expenditures for salaries are listed separately from expenditures for other operating expenses. Funding sources are also listed separately. If, for example, a program is partially funded by the federal government, those funds are listed separately from the funds projected to come from the state treasury. By early December, the Governor must submit his budget to the Legislature, and its involvement in the appropriations process begins. The Legislature's role involves two separate tasks. The first of these is to formulate the general appropriations act. Often referred to as the general bill, it appropriates money for the ordinary expenses of the three branches of state government. The second task is to act upon special appropriations bills, which appropriate money for certain special projects and various other uses. The responsibility for these tasks is held to a great extent by the appropriations standing committees in the two houses. Though these committees are regular standing committees, they operate somewhat differently than the others. Their workload requires them to meet on every legislative day, so their members do not generally belong to other standing committees. Their attention is focused solely on the state's finances. In most years, the appropriations committees in the Senate and House meet as a joint committee for the purpose of formulating the general bill. The chairs of the two committees act as co-chairs. Further, the joint committee divides into two subcommittees, both of which  31   are comprised of senators and representatives. Each of the two subcommittees is chaired by one of the co-chairs. The procedures followed by the Joint Appropriations Committee in formulating the general bill are similar to those followed by the Governor and his staff in preparing the Governor's budget. First, they must estimate the amount of revenue that will be available at the start of the fiscal year, and then they must decide how they want it distributed. Legislative rule requires that the general appropriations bill be introduced by the sixteenth legislative day of every session. It is alternately a Senate or House bill. In past years, the committee did not introduce the bill until all the joint committee work was complete. In recent years, however, the originating committee has introduced the general bill before the joint committee's work is complete. Therefore, the bill may contain figures from the Governor's budget or elsewhere, which the joint committee may amend as the bill proceeds. Early in session, the fiscal staff of the Legislative Research Council presents the committee with the revenue projections they have prepared. The committee also hears the Governor's economic advisors present their revenue projections, then sets a revenue estimate. In recent years, the committee has adopted a revenue estimate very late in the session. By far, most of the committee's time is spent deciding how and where to spend money. Representatives of each agency in state government appear before the committee for a budget hearing. At the budget hearing, the agency representatives explain to the committee members how much money they feel their particular agency needs and why they need it. Agencies under the control of the Governor request the amount of money allotted to them in the Governor's budget. Agencies from the other branches of government may well ask for funding in excess of what has been recommended for them by the Governor. Fund amounts appropriated in the general bill are good for one year. If they are not spent within that time, the general funds revert back to the general fund and from which they may be appropriated the next year. Federal funds and other amounts represent authority to spend, and may not necessarily correspond to actual money. Generally, the joint committee focuses almost exclusively on budget hearings for the first several weeks of the legislative session. W hen the hearings are completed, the committee then must give each request careful consideration and set a budget for each agency. W hen a particular budget set by the joint committee is different from that set by the Governor, the general bill is amended accordingly. Finally, all of the amendments adopted by the committee are included in the committee report on the bill, and it proceeds to the floor of the house of origin. W ith the bulk of the general appropriations act behind them, the appropriations committees are free to concentrate on the special appropriations bills. W hen the joint committee's work is done, the Senate and House members each form separate units once again take final action on the special bills, just as the other standing committees act upon the bills presented to them. Often, however, the House and Senate Appropriations Committees meet to hear bills, only to defer them for final action until the end of session when they have a better idea of how much money is available.  32   As indicated earlier, special appropriations bills are normally used to fund special, one-time projects. They can, however, also be used to fund items ordinarily funded through the general bill if the Legislature chooses to use this means to give the items special emphasis. In order to pass, special appropriations bills must receive the support of two-thirds of the members of both houses. Late in the legislative session after all the spending decisions are made, the general bill is debated on the floors of both houses in the same manner as other bills. Legislators are free to offer further amendments to the bill at that time, though they are not frequently adopted. Unlike the special appropriations bills, the general bill requires only a majority vote for passage. W hen the general bill has passed both houses, it is delivered to the Governor, and he resumes his role in the appropriations process. As with other bills, he can sign the general bill or veto it. Additionally, the state constitution gives him another option concerning the general appropriations bill. The Governor can use a line-item veto. A line-item veto gives him portions of the general bill while leaving the remaining portions of he is in agreement with the Legislature on the amount of funds agencies except one particular agency, he could veto the amount and let the remainder of the bill stand. the ability to it intact. For appropriated allocated to veto certain example, if to all state that agency  As with any other veto, the Legislature can override a line-item veto if two-thirds of its membership is in support of such an action. Unlike other bills, however, which may never become law, the general appropriations act must be enacted in some form. If it is not, state government will not have funding for its day-to-day operation. The general appropriations act and most of the special appropriations bills enacted during the legislative session take effect the following July 1. Thus, state government's appropriations process draws to a close only to have it begin all over again in a few short weeks.  33   Funding Sources for FY 2004 Budget (Total Budget = $2.69 billion)  Other Funds 25%  General Funds 34%  Gener al Funds Feder al Funds Other Funds  Federal Funds 41%  FY 2005 Governor's Recommended General Fund Expenditures (General Fund Tot al = $962, 676,487) All Els e 8% Courts & Correc tions 10% Health & W elfare 30%  Loc al Support 37%  Higher Educ at ion 15%  34   FY 2004 General Fund Budget (General Fund Budget = $906,434, 844) All Els e 9% Health & W elfare 29% Health & W elfare Higher Educ ation Loc al S upport Court s & Correc tions All Els e  Courts & Correc t ions 9%  Loc al S upport 37%  Higher E duc ation 16%  35   36   FLOOR SESSIONS The image that usually comes to peoples' minds when they think about the state legislature is the image of legislators in the two legislative chambers. They are in a formal setting and surrounded by a flurry of activity. Say, for example, a representative is addressing the House with a long speech. At the same time, a group of representatives are gathered in the back of the chamber discussing a bill on which they will soon vote. Another representative is reading mail from her constituents. In the Senate, a vote is about to be taken on a bill. One senator is catching up on the events of the day by reading the newspaper. Another is asking some of his colleagues for their votes on a particular bill. Yet another senator is outside the chamber seeking information from a lobbyist. These are typical scenes from the daily sessions that take place every legislative day. Though the legislators do a lot of their work and spend a lot of their time away from the legislative chambers, the time spent there for daily sessions is what the public thinks of most. The legislative chambers are located on the third floor of the State Capitol. The rotunda separates the two chambers; the Senate chamber is on the west side, and the House chamber is on the east side. Extensive renovations in recent years within the chambers as well as throughout the building have restored the original beauty of the Capitol, which was built in 1910. The Senate chamber is horseshoe-shaped. The room is decorated in pastel green, and its woodwork is mahogany. Ornate stenciling and a mural adorn the high ceiling. Reproductions of the original antique chandeliers provide lighting. Looking into the chamber from the back, the Republicans sit on the left side, and Democrats sit on the right side. Each senator has a roll-top desk equipped wit microphone. The podium for the President of the Senate is front and center. In front of a large desk for the Secretary of the Senate and other legislative employees. To President's right, there is an area reserved for members of the press. Sergeants-at-Arms sit at desks by the main entrance. the ha it is the The  The House chamber is larger than the Senate chamber and rectangular in shape. Its woodwork is quartersawn oak, and it is decorated in earth tones. Its furnishings and arrangement are similar to the Senate except the Republicans and Democrats sit on opposite sides. Along with the ornate stenciling, the ceiling of the House chamber contains the largest mural in the Capitol. Unlike the Senate, the House is equipped with an electronic voting system. Large panels on either side of the podium display votes within seconds after they are cast. W ith rare exceptions, no one but legislators and staff are permitted on the floors of the chambers. Although the public is not allowed to participate in debates occurring on the Senate and House floors, they are able to observe the proceedings. Both chambers are surrounded by a gallery, which is located on the fourth floor. The galleries provide ample  37   seating and allow the public a bird's eye view of all that is taking place just below them on the Senate or House floor. From time to time during a legislative session, members of both the Senate and House of Representatives meet together in a joint session. A prime example of this is on the first legislative day of every session, when members of both houses convene in the House chamber for the Governor's State-of-the-State address. Legislators of both houses also come together once each year to honor former members of the South Dakota Legislature who have died during the past year. During these joint sessions, the President of the Senate presides and the Secretary and Chief Clerk record the proceedings. For the most part, however, the two legislative bodies do their work independently of each other. The chambers come alive each legislative day at 2 p.m. At that time, the legislators, having just met in their respective caucuses, descend upon the House and Senate floors and are ready to begin their daily sessions. Legislators begin the session each day with a prayer led by the designated chaplain of the day, followed by the Pledge of Allegiance. The roll is called in their respective houses by the Secretary of the Senate and by the Chief Clerk of the House. W hen the formalities are complete, the lawmaking begins. The focus shifts to the day's calendar. Calendars are prepared daily by the Secretary of the Senate and the Chief Clerk of the House. The purpose of the calendar is to inform legislators and other interested parties of the motions and resolutions, committee reports, consent calendar bills and resolutions, and second reading of bills and resolutions to be considered that day. The Secretary and Chief Clerk are directed in their preparation of the calendars by each house's calendar committee, which consists of the presiding officer, the majority leader, and the minority leader. Most of the time spent in the daily sessions is devoted to the bills scheduled for second reading. Consent calendar bills are ordinarily read and voted on first. Then, one by one, the other bills are read the second time, debated, and ultimately voted upon. One tool that legislators find very useful at this point is the Daily Reader. It is a publication containing the bills on that day's calendar in their current form. So, if a bill has been amended in a committee or on the other floor, legislators have quick access to this information. A separate Daily Reader is prepared for each house, and it is distributed to the membership prior to the start of the daily session. Early in the legislative session, the daily floor sessions are brief. Many bills have not yet been introduced or at least have yet to be heard in a committee so there is little work to do on the floors. As time progresses, more and more bills begin to appear on the calendars, spend more time on the floors. Late in the session, the controversial bills, progress through the legislative process more slowly than other bills, reach elicit a lot of debate. The daily sessions may well extend into the evening and legislators which tend to the floors and hours. At this  38   point, it is not uncommon for one or both houses to defer, or postpone, action on bills listed near the end of the calendar simply because the debates have run long and members are weary. Generally speaking, most members of the Legislature already know how they are going to vote on a particular bill before it is ever debated on the Senate or House floor. This is due to the fact that some of them are members of the committee that heard the bill. Others likely discussed the bill with lobbyists or constituents and may have decided how to vote based on those discussions. Still others may have decided how to vote after attending their respective caucuses just prior to the start of the day's session. This does not mean, however, that debates are without purpose or are never able to persuade members of the Legislature. Speeches given and questions asked by members of both houses on the floors are often used to draw media attention or garner public support for a particular point of view. They are also used to clarify certain aspects of a bill that may be vague or misleading. All in all, the daily floor sessions give members of both houses the only chance they get during a legislative day to come together as a unit and discuss the issues at hand. They provide an arena for members to voice their views and cast their votes on the issues confronting the state. A visitor to the State Capitol observing a daily session for the first time may find it chaotic and time-consuming. Legislators and those familiar with the legislative process, however, tend to look beyond the flurry of activity and the sometimes endless debates to the important role the daily sessions play in creating the laws of this state.  39   40   RULES GOVERNING THE LEGISLATURE The legislative procedures followed in this stat sources. Some of them are stipulated in the constitution. Others are found in South Dakota custom. They have been in practice for so many e are governed by rules from a variety of United States Constitution or in the state Codified Laws. Still others are a matter of years they have become unwritten laws.  In addition to the other sources of rules, the two houses each have their own sets of rules, and probably the most commonly referred to rules are the joint rules which apply to both houses. The rules are adopted early in each session by a majority of the membership in each house. Both the Senate and House rules can be amended if two-thirds of the members-elect of that particular house approve the change. Likewise, the joint rules can be amended with the approval of two-thirds of the members-elect of both houses. The primary reason these rules are in place is to keep the legislative process operating efficiently and fairly. If there were no rules, the chances are good that some pieces of legislation, and perhaps even some legislators, would not receive fair treatment. Efficiency in the lawmaking process is increased dramatically due to the legislative cutoff dates, which are designated in the joint rules. These cutoff dates are the final legislative days on which certain activities can take place. For example, there is a cutoff date for bill introduction, and no bills may be introduced once that deadline is passed. There are also cutoff dates dictating the last legislative day for bills to be heard in their house of origin, and once in the second house, the last legislative day for bills to be heard in the second committee. They keep the bills moving through the process at a fairly even pace. W ithout these and the other cutoff dates, it is likely that many bills simply would not make it through the legislative process by the time the session was over. During the daily sessions, many of the rules come into play; they provide structure to the conduct of business and the debate of bills. The state constitution requires that the proceedings of the daily sessions in both houses be recorded. Therefore, a journal is prepared in both the Senate and House on every legislative day. They are compiled by Legislative Research Council employees under the direction of the Secretary of the Senate and Chief Clerk of the House. Each day's journal is printed and made available to all of the members and other interested parties the following morning. At the end of the legislative session, all of the daily journals of each house are bound together and become a permanent record of the proceedings of that year. The journals contain such items as the roll call, reports of the standing committees, messages from the other house, and motions and resolutions. The journals also list bills that received first reading and those that received second reading. More importantly, they contain a record of how the members of the body voted on the bills and resolutions coming before them on that day. The journals are not verbatim transcripts of proceedings. The conduct of business within each house is governed by the joint rules and by Mason's Manual of Legislative Procedure, the official guide to parliamentary procedure used by bicameral Legislatures. The procedures followed allow the work to be accomplished in an  41   orderly fashion, and most importantly, provide the members with equal opportunities to address the body. A majority of the members of each house constitutes a quorum necessary for the transaction of business in that chamber (although a smaller number of members may adjourn from day to day). The state constitution also gives a smaller number of members in each house the authority to compel the attendance of absent members. Once the daily session begins, any member wishing to speak must stand and respectfully address the presiding officer. Once the presiding officer recognizes that member, he or she is free to address the body. Also, if a member wishes to ask a question of another member, the question must be asked through the presiding officer and only if the member to whom the question is addressed is willing to answer it. Only questions relating to the subject-at-hand are allowed. Unlike in the committees where there are no limits on debate, the joint rules limit legislators in their debate of bills on the Senate and House floors. First of all, every member is entitled to speak on a particular subject before any member of the body speaks on it more than once. Additionally, no member of the Senate or House can speak on the same subject more than twice or longer than ten minutes without the consent of a majority of the members present. If a member wishes to speak beyond the time limit, other members not desiring to speak on the issue may yield up to twenty minutes of their time to the member speaking. At certain times during the course of a daily session, members of either house may wish to debate the question before them on a more informal basis than the rules ordinarily allow. Under these circumstances, they have the option of sitting as a committee of the whole. W hen a committee of the whole is formed, the presiding officer appoints one of the members to serve as the chair. Most procedures followed in the committee are the same ones followed by the house. The main exception to this is that members are given greater leeway in discussions and there may not be a limit on debate. The proceedings of a committee of the whole are not recorded in t actions may be taken. The committee of the whole is used to open public testimony, and to make a recommendation to the house on like the standing committees do. They are not utilized very often during special sessions. he journals, and no final up dialogue, to allow for a given question, much in South Dakota except  Throughout the debates on bills and resolutions during the daily sessions, the legislators are allowed to make motions, or formal suggestions. The joint rules clearly stipulate the motions that may be offered. All motions must be seconded before any action can occur on them. They cannot be withdrawn unless all of the members agree to the withdrawal. Some of these motions are debatable. Others are not debatable and are voted on immediately. Most of the motions require the support of the majority of the members-elect, but others require less support. Listed below are some of the most common motions and a brief description of them.  42   TO ADJOURN. This motion brings the proceedings to a close for the day. It is always in order except when roll is being called. It is not debatable. TO RECESS. This motion stops the proceedings temporarily usually until a designated time when the session reconvenes. It is not debatable. TO AMEND. This motion alters in some way the language of the bill or resolution being discussed. It is debatable. The amendment is ordinarily distributed to all of the members in writing. TO POSTPONE TO A DAY CERTAIN. This motion delays action on a bill until a later date. Postponing bills to a date that falls after the legislative session has ended is often a tactic used to kill legislation. It is debatable. TO LAY ON THE TABLE. This motion ends the discussion on a bill until such a time as a majority of the members-elect agree to remove it from the table. It is not debatable. W hen a legislator makes a motion to amend, the proposed amendment can be as minor as changing only a word or two, or as major as completely changing the bill. In fact, some amendments delete the entire content of a bill with the exception of the enacting clause and insert completely different material. In South Dakota, this type of amendment is known as a hoghouse; several bills are changed in this fashion during every legislative session. Another fairly common motion is a motion for reconsideration. After a bill or resolution been voted upon for final passage and while it is still in the possession of that house, member may move for reconsideration. The member making such a motion is asking the vote be reconsidered, or canceled and retaken. The motion requires a majority vot the members-elect and must be made no later than the next legislative day. has any that e of  One other motion stipulated in the joint rules is a motion to order a committee to send a bill to the full body. If one-third or more of the members-elect of either house supports the motion, the committee must deliver the bill to that house by the next legislative day. The committee may send it with or without recommendation. This procedure is referred to as a smoke out. It is used to force certain bills to be considered by the entire body even though the committees to which they have been assigned have not yet reported on them. The same rules that give the legislative proceedings their order and structure can at times be a hindrance. Therefore, certain rules of the Legislature may at times be suspended, or set aside. The joint rules may be suspended if two-thirds of the members of both houses support the action. Likewise, the rules of either house may be suspended if two-thirds of the members of that particular house support the action. To the contrary, no rules provided for in state statutes or in the federal or state constitution may be set aside at any time. Most rule suspensions occur date for bills to be heard in t has several senate bills to suspended to allow action on late in the session. he house of origin. act upon. In that senate bills the day Say, for example, it is the legislative cutoff The hour is very late, and the Senate still instance, it is likely the rules would be after the cutoff date.  43   Rules are only suspended for specific purposes. W hile they do give the legislators some latitude they would not otherwise have, these suspensions do not occur routinely and are generally avoided if at all possible. The Joint Rules provide that the three days preceding the final day of the legislative session are reserved for concurrence by each house with actions of the other house and for action upon conference committee reports. Traditionally, the last day of the session is held two to three weeks later and is reserved for the consideration of vetoes. At the close of the final day, both houses adjourn sine die, or without a day being set for reconvening, at a time determined by a select committee appointed for that purpose. In accordance with dictates of the state constitution and state law, the Senate must confirm many of the Governor's appointees. A nomination requiring confirmation is first assigned to a committee that considers the nomination and reports to the full Senate. The Senate as a whole then considers the nomination and either consents to it or rejects confirmation of the nominee. Appointees of the Governor who must be confirmed include all the executive department heads and a host of other officials. Lastly, the state constitution gives the House of Representatives the sole power of impeachment, or the power to remove a public official from office due to misconduct. Officials subject to impeachment include the Governor and other state and judicial officers. They may be impeached only if a majority of the members elected to the House of Representatives are in favor of it. If an official were impeached, he or she would then be tried by the Senate in a fashion similar to the way those accused of a crime are tried in a court of law. The official would be convicted only if two-thirds of the senators were in support of such an action. Legislators new to the process are more than likely overwhelmed by all the rules the Legislature follows. They may initially hesitate to voice their opinions in a daily session for fear of breaking the rules. W ithin a short time, however, the rules become familiar, and their importance becomes evident.  44   VOTING PROCEDURES Voting is, without question, the most crucial part legislators are asked to express their opinions on Hours and hours of research or debate cannot legislation. Getting enough votes at every juncture what turns bills into laws. of lawmaking. It is at that point when a particular issue in no uncertain terms. guarantee the success of a piece of through the entire legislative process is  In order for most bills and resolutions to pass, they need the votes of a majority of the members-elect in both houses. However, just as some motions require more support than others to be adopted, some bills require additional support to be passed. As discussed earlier, special appropriations bills are one example of this. In order to pass, they must receive support of at least two-thirds of the members-elect in each house. Another group of bills which require the same level of support are those containing an emergency clause. They are unique because they take effect immediately upon being signed by the Governor rather than at least ninety days later or on July 1 as most other bills do. During a daily session, the Joint Rules require every member who is in the chamber at the time a question is posed to cast a vote. At the same time, members not inside the chamber at the time may not vote. Votes taken on the passage of bills and resolutions must be recorded in the journal. Therefore, a roll call vote is always taken in those instances. It is also used at other times when the presiding officer deems it necessary or if one-sixth or more of the members present support its use for a particular vote. Roll call votes are conducted somewhat differently in each of the two houses due to the fact the House has an electronic voting system and the Senate does not. In the House, the Chief Clerk under the direction of the Speaker of the House operates the electronic roll call system. W hen a roll call vote is taken, the voting system is unlocked and members are given enough time to cast their votes by pressing one of the two buttons positioned on their desks. Pushing the green button signifies a positive vote and pushing the red button signifies a negative vote. W hen all the members present have voted, the voting system is locked. Then, the vote is displayed and recorded in the journal. Members of the House and those in the gallery can view the votes of all the members, who are listed alphabetically on the large electronic voting boards on either side of the podium. The voting system not only displays how each member voted, but it also tallies and records the vote on ballot sheets containing the members' names. In the Senate, roll call votes are conducted in a more traditional manner. The Secretary of the Senate calls the names of all the senators alphabetically, and they, in turn, cast their votes verbally. W hen all the senators present in the chamber have voted, the Secretary tallies the votes, announces the outcome, and the votes are recorded in the journal.  45   This is the same voting procedure that has been used in the Senate since it began. In recent years, some senators have suggested that an electronic voting system similar to that in the House be installed in the Senate. Thus far the idea has been resisted by a majority of the senators. The Senate did, however, recently install a computer system that the secretary uses to tally and record the votes, but it is far from an electronic voting system. W hen the roll call vote is not used, a voice vote is usually taken. It is the quickest and simplest method of voting. In most instances, there is an obvious majority on one side or the other, and the presiding officer can readily judge the vote by the sound. Occasionally, however, the presiding officer is in doubt and must call for the members to divide. All the members voting in the affirmative rise. Once they are counted and seated, the members casting negative votes rise and are counted, and the vote is determined in that way. Deciding how to vote on the many issues confronting them is often difficult for legislators. This is especially true when their constituents are fairly evenly divided on the issue, or when their own sentiments disagree with those of constituents. Also, to complicate matters further, legislators may be feeling pressure from their caucus leaders to vote a certain way. In the end, the legislators must make the decision, and it may be a decision that will follow them throughout their political lives.  46   LEGISLATIVE SERVICES Legislative sessions are hectic. Legislators are busy garnering support for the bills they have introduced. They are doing research, meeting with lobbyists, communicating with constituents, and tending to many other responsibilities. They are able to accomplish all of this, in part, due to the assistance they get from the session employees and a variety of other sources. One of the main sources of this assistance is the staff of the Legislative Research Council. Established in 1951 by legislative action, the Legislative Research Council (LRC) is the state's legislative service operation. By statute, the LRC is composed of all the members of the state legislature. It is directed by an executive board consisting of fifteen legislators, seven senators and eight representatives. The Speaker of the House and the President Pro Tempore are always members of the Executive Board, and the other members are elected by their respective houses. The main function of the LRC is to consider legislative policies between sessions. Its staff, however, provides service to the Legislature throughout the entire year. Members of the staff perform research, draft bills, and provide budgetary analysis. They also staff the committees that meet between sessions. The LRC is also charged with the task of printing all administrative rules and regulations promulgated, or put into action, by state government agencies in the Administrative Rules of South Dakota (ARSD). The Legislature authorizes state agencies to promulgate rules to carry out legislative mandates. Authorization is given when an agency has special expertise the Legislature does not have time to acquire, when frequent changes, such as dates or fees, need to be made, or when a general law needs to be made more specific. The LRC Library houses a historical collection of legislative documents including bills, journals, and committee minutes. The library also contains research materials pertaining to current legislative topics. The office of the Code Counsel is within the LRC. The Code Counsel is the attorney responsible for compiling the new laws after each session and revising the South Dakota Codified Laws. Another source of assistance to the state legislature is the Department of Legislative Audit. It is headed by the Auditor General, an experienced public accountant who is appointed by the Legislature to an eight-year term. The Auditor General's activities are directed by the Executive Board of the LRC. The department is charged with the task of auditing all state and local government agencies. This is done primarily to ensure that revenues are being collected in compliance with state law, and funds are being spent in accordance with the intentions of the Legislature. The objective information gathered by the department is used by the Legislature to monitor the fiscal practices of these agencies and perhaps as a basis for legislative action to improve the state's fiscal structure.  47   W hile the LRC and the Department of Legislative Audit serve the Legislature year round, other groups provide assistance only during the legislative sessions. One of these groups is the session employees. They are individuals who serve the Legislature in a variety of capacities. Among them are the Sergeants-at-Arms who keep order in the legislative chambers, the documents personnel who distribute bills and journals, and the committee secretaries who prepare the committee minutes. Additionally, there are those who work in the chambers assisting the Secretary of the Senate and the Chief Clerk of the House. Two of the groups assisting the Legislature during sessions, pages, are unique because their roles are two-dimensional. Legislature, but they also take from it. The interns and pages for the Legislature, and at the same time, they learn about the able to view it first hand. the legislative interns and They not only give to the perform necessary services legislative process and are  Legislative interns are college students, usually in their junior or senior year, whom the leadership of the political parties in each house selects. A total of twenty-two college students may participate in the intern program, which is administered by the LRC. Participants assist the legislators to whom they are assigned with research, answering mail, and numerous other tasks. Legislative pages are high school seniors. They are assigned to work in either the Senate or the House. Their work duties consist of distributing bills and journals, answering phones, and running errands for the legislators. Students interested in being pages must apply through a legislator and submit their applications to the LRC. The pages serve in staggered terms, each lasting about two weeks. W hen added all together, those serving the Legislature represent a large group. They don't all perform the same tasks, but they do all help the legislators accomplish what they were elected to do.  48   THE INTERIM Although the legislators complete the bulk of their legislative duties during the annual sessions, they are involved in lawmaking to a certain degree throughout the entire year. They use the time between legislative sessions, or the interim, to study certain topics in-depth. The topics studied during this time period are generally topics that require more analysis than they can be given during the busy sessions. The topics discussed are determined by the Executive Board of the Legislative Research Council. The board makes its determination based on the suggestions it receives from standing committees and individual legislators. Once the topics are decided, interim committees are formed to study them. Some interim committees discuss one major topic while others discuss several smaller topics on related subjects. Legislators are polled as to which committees, if any, they would like to belong. Then, using the polling results, the Executive Board selects the members of each committee. The board also selects the chair and vice-chair of each committee. Interim committees are comprised of both senators and representatives. On average, the committees meet about three times at various intervals throughout the interim months and are staffed by employees of the LRC. There is one committee that is somewhat different from the ones described above. The Interim Appropriations Committee meets during every interim. Its members are the same legislators who make up the Joint Appropriations Committee, which meets during the legislative sessions. Likewise, it is co-chaired by the chairs of the standing Appropriations Committees in each house. Upon completion of their work at the end of the interim, each committee issues a final report to the Executive Board. The final reports list the committee members, the dates and locations of their meetings, and a summary of their accomplishments. Also included in the final report is a list of legislation adopted by the committee. The legislation is based upon the findings of the committee, and is introduced at the next legislative session by some of the members on the committee's behalf. During the interim, a legislator's lawmaking duties may consist of more than serving on interim committees. Legislators may also find themselves in a special session. Special sessions are, quite simply, sessions other than the regular session. They are only held for specific purposes. In South Dakota, special sessions are not common. In fact, only about twenty of them have been held since statehood. Historically, the Governor had the sole authority to convene a special session. In 1990, however, voters agreed to a constitutional change allowing the  49   members to call themselves into special session if two-thirds of the members of each house support the idea. The Governor convened two special sessions in 1994. Both of them were precipitated by court decisions. The first one, held in July, was in response to the Supreme Court decision ruling the state's video lottery unconstitutional. At that time, the Legislature voted to place a constitutional amendment on the November ballot to authorize video lottery, and allowed money from the budget reserve fund to be transferred to the general fund. The second one occurred in September after a circuit court judge ruled that the Governor, faced with a revenue shortfall due to the video lottery shutdown, lacked the constitutional authority to cut the state's budget. During that session, the legislators repealed several special appropriations bills passed during the regular session in 1994, and also reduced the amount of money allocated to various state agencies. Another special session was held on April 14, 1997. The legislators came back to Pierre not long after the culmination of the regular session. The Governor called them back to address the problems facing the state as a result of the record-breaking blizzards and floods. Legislators voted to temporarily increase the excise tax on motor fuels to pay for road and bridge repair. They also provided financial assistance to local governments to assist with disaster relief. Since that time, there have been three additional special sessions. In 2000, the Governor called the legislators to Pierre to consider selling the South Dakota Cement Plant. The idea won the support of the Legislature. In 2001, the legislators called themselves into a special session to deal with the issue of redistricting following the 2000 Census. Finally, in the summer of 2003, Governor Mike Rounds called a special session to create, implement, and fund a health insurance risk pool for persons who had lost health insurance coverage through no fault of their own. In addition to their work on interim committees and the rare special session, legislators spend time during the interim focusing on the upcoming regular session. Often, they use the time to take input from constituents, and work on bills they want to introduce. Lastly, the interim period of every even-numbered year finds many legislators seeking re-election. They often spend long hours campaigning; all in the hope they will be able to return to Pierre in January and continue to shape the laws of this state.  50   HOW CAN I PARTICIPATE? VOTE.

In 1996, a record of 61 women (30.3%) were elected to the Minnesota Legislature. The numbers of women elected in the 1998 and 2000 elections were lower, at 57 (28.4%) and 58 (28.9%), respectively.

Twenty-six (15 DFL, 11 R) of the 35 women who were elected were incumbents. Nine women (7 DFL, 2 R) were newly elected to the House (however, three of these women, Geri Evans, Ruth Johnson and Nora Slawik, had previously served in the House).

Minnesota Legislative Commission on the Economic Status of Women, #263  Page 8   WOMEN  IN  C  ONGRESS  , GOVERNORSHIPS  AND  STATE LEGISLATURES  United States House of Representatives As a result of the 2002 general election, fifty-nine women (38 Democrats, 21 Republicans) serve in the U.S. House of Representatives, holding 13.6 percent of the 435 seats. This equals the level of female representation from the 2000 general election which was a record high. Of the women elected to the U.S. House of Representatives, fiftytwo were incumbents and seven are new members. In addition, three women are delegates from Guam, the Virgin Islands, and Washington, DC. Betty McCollum (DFL) was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives from the 4th congressional district in Minnesota in the 2000 and 2002 general elections. McCollum is the second woman elected to the U.S. House from Minnesota. In 1954, Coya Knutson (DFL) was elected from the 9th congressional district in northwestern Minnesota. Coya Knutson served two consecutive terms in the U.S. House of Representatives. United States Senate Fourteen (14%) women (9 Democrats, 5 Republicans) serve in the U.S. Senate as a result of the 2002 general elections and the appointment shortly after the election of Lisa Murkowski of Alaska to serve out the unexpired term of her father who resigned from the Senate because he was elected governor. Two women, Elizabeth Dole (R-North Carolina) and Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska), are new Senate members. Muriel Humphrey (DFL) is the only Minnesota woman to have served in the U.S. Senate. Muriel Humphrey was appointed in 1978 by the governor to fill the vacancy caused by the death of her husband, Senator Hubert H. Humphrey. Governorships In 2003, a record number of six women (4 Democrats, 2 Republicans) serve as governors, comprising 12 percent of state governors. One state, Hawaii, elected its first female governor, Linda Lingle (R), in the 2002 general election. Other governors elected were Kathleen Sebelius (D-Kansas), Jean Napolitano (D-Arizona), and Jennifer Granholm (D-Michigan). Ruth Ann Minner (D-Delaware) and Judy Marts (R-Montana), whose terms were not up for reelection, also serve as governors in 2003. State Legislatures As a result of the 2002 general elections, women hold 1,645 seats (22.3%) of the 7,382 seats in state legislatures nationwide. This is the same percentage of representation by women as result of the 2000 general elections. The percentage of state legislatures comprised by women varies widely by state. In 2003, Washington has the highest proportion (36.7%) and South Carolina has the lowest proportion (9.4%) of women legislators. Minnesota was ranked 16th in the proportion of women (26.9%) serving in the State Legislature in 2003, down from a ranking of 11th after the 2000 general election.

The procedure would be similar in format to the procedure already set forth in the Charter to fill vacancies in the Offices of Public Advocate, Comptroller, Borough President and City Council member, except that in the special election for the Office of the Mayor, where no candidate receives forty percent or more of the vote, the two candidates receiving the most votes would advance to a run-off election to be held on the second Tuesday following the special election. Pending the result of the election, the Publi c Advocate would act as Mayor. In order to implement the proposal consistent with State law, this proposal  would confer upon the Speaker of the City Council the responsibility to preside over meetings of the City Council, instead of the Public Advocate ha ving that duty. The Public Advocate would remain a nonvoting member of the City Council, and have all other powers arising from that position. This proposal would take effect immediately, and would apply to vacancies in the Office of the Mayor occurring after September 20, 2002.  1   PART II Introduction A. Overview of the Charter Revision Process The New York City Charter is the basic document that defines the organization, power, functions and essential procedures and policies of City government. As a ""short form"" charter, it sets forth the institutions and processes of the City's political system and defines the authority and responsibilities of elected officials --the Mayor, Council, Comptroller, Borough Presidents, and Public Advocate --and City agencies in broad strokes, while leaving the details of operation to local law and agency rulemaking. Unlike the United States Constitution, which is amended rarely, the City's Charter is a fluid document that is amended often. Indeed, while the U.S. Constitution has been amended only 27 times in its 215 year history, the Charter has been amended more than 100 times since 1989. In the United States, city governments receive their legal authority from the states in which they are located. In the State of New York, municipalities have broad authority to structure how they operate by virtue of the Home Rule provisions of the State Constitution and the Municipal Home Rule Law. The City's Charter, along with the State Constitution, the Municipal Home Rule Law and othe r State statutes, provides the legal framework within which it may conduct its affairs. Under State law, charter revision may occur as an ongoing process through the passage of local laws. There are limitations on that authority. For example, there can be no curtailment of powers of an elected official. A charter can also be revised  pursuant to a State or City charter revision commission, which has the authority to put 2   proposals before the voters. A charter revision commission may put proposals before the voters regarding all elements of a charter, including the curtailment of powers of an elected official, as well as provisions that could also be adopted through local law. Municipal Home Rule Law (""MHRL"")  36(4) permits the Mayor to establish a ""charter commission"" in New York City. The composition of a mayoral charter commission must consist of nine to fifteen members. The members must be City residents and may hold other public offices or employment. The Mayor designates the chair, vice-chair and secretary of the commission pursuant to MHRL  36(4) and (6)(d). Charter commissions are not permanent commissions. MHRL  36(6)(e) limits the term of a charter commission. A commission expires on the day of the election at which a proposed new charter or amendments prepared by a commission are submitted to the voters. However, if a commission fails to submit a new charter or any  amendments to the voters, the commission expires on the day of the second general election following the commission's creation. There are no prohibitions against the reappointment of a commission or appointment of a new commission upon the expiration of an existing commission. A charter commission may propose a broad set of amendments that essentially ""overhauls"" the entire cha rter, or may narrowly focus upon certain areas and explain why such an approach is preferable in a report to the public. MHRL  36(5)(a); see Matter of Cruz v. Deierlein, 84 N.Y.2d 890, 892-893 (1994). The proposed amendments must be consistent with general State laws and can only effect changes that are otherwise within the City's local legislative powers as set forth in the State Constitution and the MHRL.  3   The proposed amendments must be filed with the City Clerk for action by the voters no later than the second general election after the commission's creation, and must be voted on at a general or special election held at least sixty days after the filing. The proposed amendments may be submitted to voters as one question, or a series of questions or alternatives. MHRL  36(5)(b).  B.  The Commission's Membership In July 2002, Mayor Michael R.

Scope of Review On July 25, 2002, the Commission held its initial public meeting. At that meeting,  Commission staff provided an orientation to the Commission members on the Charter, the process of Charter revision and the range of issues addressed by the previous three Charter Revision Commissions: the 1998 Powers Commission, and the 1999 and 2001 Mastro Commissions. Among the numerous issues addressed by those Commissions, all three of them studied the issues of mayoral succession and nonpartisan elections. At that initial meeting, the Commission Chair directed staff to review the entire Charter. Further, he asked staff to review the prelimi nary and final reports of the 1998, 1999 and 2001 Charter Revision Commissions, and Commission member and public inquiries, comments and proposals. Finally, he requested that the staff draft preliminary options reports on the topics of nonpartisan electio ns and mayoral succession, and provide summaries of other proposals submitted by City agencies and the public. At the August 6, 2002, public meeting, the staff presented the Commission with three reports. The first two reports were extensive in scope and provided a detailed analysis of the options for the Commission to consider on the issues of mayoral succession and nonpartisan elections. The third report presented summaries of the proposals and issues submitted to the Commission from the public and vari ous City agencies, including the Departments of Investigation, Housing Preservation and Development, Finance and Parks and Recreation, as well as the Conflicts of Interest Board and the Office of Administrative Trials and Hearings. The staff reports were released to the public and posted on the Commission's website for public review and comment.  11   Between August 13 and 22, 2002, the Commission held a series of expert briefings and public hearings concerning the options and proposals in all five boroughs. 1  Both expert briefings and public hearings were held on August 13, 2002 in Brooklyn, August 15, 2002 in Queens, August 20, 2002 in Staten Island, August 21, 2002 in Manhattan, and August 22, 2002 in the Bronx. On the topics of nonpartisan elections and mayo ral succession, the Commission heard expert testimony and received comments from elected officials and the public. The Commission also received proposals for changes to the Charter on a wide range of issues from City agencies and from members of the public. On August 21, 2002, the staff made a second presentation to the Commission on additional proposals submitted by agencies as well as proposals submitted by members of the public. Both the substantive and process-based comments from the public were of enormous value to the Commission in helping it determine whether to put before the voters any proposals on the November 2002 ballot. Indeed, although the Commission received substantive comments on the issues of mayoral succession and nonpartisan elections, members of the public also criticized the Commission, its process and work. Principally, these comments centered on two points: that the Commission's public hearings were held during August, a time when many people are on vacation; and the issues required further review and public comment.  1  The Queens hearing, held at LaGuardia Community College, was directly accessible by four major subway lines as well as bus lines. The Brooklyn hearing at Metro- Tech Center was within a short walk from the borough's downtown hub and accessible by eleven subway lines as well as numerous bus lines. Manhattan's public hearing at the Adam Clayton Powell State Office Building was easily reached by subway as well as by bus. The hearing at Eugenio de Hostos Community College in the Bronx was accessible both by subway and bus. The Staten Island hearing, held at the College of Staten Island, was accessible by a bus line and by car, a principal means of transportation for Staten Islanders . All of these facilities were fully handicap accessible and equipped to accommodate more than 200 persons.  12   In reviewing the substantive proposals, the Commission found that some of them could be accomplished legislatively, and therefore did not require a referendum immediately, while others required further study and comment from the public and other City agencies that also would be affected by the proposals. Although the Commission believes that many of the agency and public proposals would greatly enhance the operations of City government, it determined ultimately, at its August 23 , 2002, public meeting, that it would defer consideration of these issues, and the remaining issues in the reports of the 1999 and 2001 Commissions, to another election cycle. At the same time, the Commission determined that it would focus on the issues of mayoral succession and nonpartisan elections for possible inclusion on the ballot. After further consideration of the issues and the opinion expressed publicly by Mayor Bloomberg, the Commission concluded, at its September 3, 2002, meeting that it would defer the issue of nonpartisan elections to another election cycle to afford the public more opportunity for comment and debate on this important issue. The Commission nonetheless determined that it would put forth a proposal to the voters providing for a nonpartisan special election within sixty days of a vacancy in the Office of the Mayor which, by virtue of State law, would necessitate that the Speaker of the Council be placed in the role of presiding officer of the Council instead of the Public Advocate. The 13 member Commission unanimously approved the proposal. E. The Commission's Public Outreach and Proceedings The Commission developed its proposals for the November 2002 ballot by: (1) initiating a public outreach campaign to solicit proposals for Charter revision from the 2  2  It should be noted that Commissioner Badillo was not physically present at the meeting to vote, but cast his vote on the proposal symbolically by telephone.

The public was afforded the opportunity to submit proposals for Charter revision before the staff made its preliminary reports, and the Commission remained open to new public and City agency proposals throughout the process. Moreover, the principal issues considered by the Commission were analyzed thoroughly and made public before the Commission's final hearing and vote. As a result, the public was able to shape the Commission's agenda and critique the proposed Charter revisions. On July 22, 2002, Commission Chair Robert J. McGuire issued a ""Solicitation of Proposed Revisions to the New York City Charter."" A Notice announcing the first public hearing also was issued on July 22, 2002. On August 5, 2002, a second notice was issued with the complete listing of all upcoming public meetings and hearings . These notices were published in the City's newspapers, as well as the language newspapers of the Spanish, Chinese, Russian and Korean speaking communities. 3  The notices  3  The advertisements were placed in the New York Times, the World Journal, the Daily News, the New  14   were also published on a daily basis in the City Record, and on the Web. Finally, the notices were sent by mail to approximately 2,300 interested persons . 4  In response to  the Chair's solicitation, the Commission's staff received many letters, telephone calls and e-mails either requesting information on, or containing proposals for, Charter revision. In six weeks , from July 22 through August 30, 2002 , the re was a heavy  volume of ""hits"" on the Commission's Web-site by people seeking Commission reports, notices, and other information, checking the meeting, and hearing schedule. At the August 6, 2002 public meeting , the Commission's staff presented three reports to the Commission, entitled Preliminary Options for Mayoral Succession, Preliminary Options for Nonpartisan Elections, and City Agency and Public Proposals. Chairman McGuire stressed that the Commission was committed to reviewing the entire Charter , and encouraged the other Commissioners , the public and City agencies to continue to raise issues for possible Charter revision. Chairman McGuire further  emphasized that the Charter review process would be held in a fair and non- judgmental way and that all meetings, hearings and forums conducted by the Commission would be open to the public. The Commission held public hearings on the issues before it on August 13, 2002 in Brooklyn, August 15, 2002 in Queens, August 20, 2002 in Staten Island, August 21, 2002 in Manhattan, and August 22, 2002 in the Bronx. All of the hearings were  scheduled to begin at 7:00 p.m.. Many elected officials and members of the public, including former candidates for public office, spoke. All elected officials and members York Post, El Diario, the Korean Times, Sing Tao, Hoy, and Novoye Russkoye Slovo. 4  Interpretation in American Sign Language was provided at the first meeting and was made available for all public meetings, hearings and forums.  15   of the public were urged to limit their remarks to three minutes as a courtesy to the other speakers. Although many of the speakers spoke for more than their allotted time, all were nonetheless permitted to conclude their remarks. televised repeatedly on Crosswalks. The Commission's Chair also held briefings on August 13, 15, 20, 21 and 22, 2002, for the purpose of hearing expert testimony from many invited speakers, including experts on the Voting Rights Act implications associated with the issues of mayoral succession and nonpartisan elections, and the Justice Department's Voting Rights Act preclearance process. These experts addressed the main issues reported on by the Commission's staff and considered by the Commission. These five bri efings also were repeatedly televised on Crosswalks. On September 3, 2002, the Commission held its final public meeting and voted to propose that a single ballot question be submitted to the voters on November 5, 2002, and to issue this report . The proposal would provide for a special election to be held to fill a vacancy in the Office of the Mayor within sixty days of the vacancy, and would give the Speaker of the City Council the ceremonial role to preside over meetings of the City Council rather than the Public Advocate. The Public Advocate would remain a All of the hearings were  nonvoting member of the City Council, and have all other powers arising from that position. This proposal would take effect immediately, and would apply to vacancies in the Office of the Mayor occurri ng after September 20, 2002. The Commission asked the staff to issue , as soon after September 3, 2002, as possible, a summary of its proposals, for publication in various newspapers, including the City Record, and in foreign language papers, as required by law. It also asked the  16   staff to post this information on the Web and mail it to interested persons in English, Spanish, Chinese and Korean.  17   THE CITY IN TRANSITION: INTERIM SUCCESSION AND THE MAYORALTY PART III Proposal The Commission determined that it will place one issue before the voters on the November 5, 2002, ballot: whether Charter  10(b) should be amended to require a special election within 60 days of a mayoral vacancy, with a runoff election if no candidate receives at least 40 percent of the vote. The merits of this proposed change are clear. As detailed in Part IV(A) of this report, Charter  10(b) currently provides that, upon a permanent vacancy (i.e., failure to qualify, resignation, removal, death, or permanent inability to discharge powers and duties), the powers and duties of the Mayor devolve upon the Public Advocate, the Comptroller, or a person selected by the Council, in that order of succession, until a new Mayor is elected. If the vacancy occurs prior to September 20 in any year, it is filled at the general election of that year. If the vacancy occurs on or after September 20 in any year, it is filled at the general election held the following calendar year. The result of this provision is that, if a vacancy were to occur o n or after September 20 in any year of the Mayor's term (except the last), the interim successor (e.g., the Public Advocate) could potentially serve as Acting Mayor for more than 15 months before an elected Mayor takes office. This system contrasts sharply with the election system for filling vacancies in other elected offices, where voters are given the opportunity to elect a successor in short order.  18   The Office of the Mayor is obviously a crucial one. It is the seat of executive power in the City's gove rnmental structure and is the focal point of policies affecting the lives of City residents. As the City's chief executive officer, the Mayor is most  responsible for the effectiveness and integrity of City government and is the City's most politically accountable elected official. Providing for the prompt selection of a new  Mayor by the voters in the event of a mayoral vacancy is closely related to issues of democracy, stability, and effective government. In light of these considerations, the Commission has determined that changing Charter  10(b) to provide for a prompt election for a new Mayor is a change that is in the best interest of all New Yorkers. In addition to being good policy, such a change also appears, as set forth in Part IV(A) of this report, to be legal, and within the mainstream of practice on this topic. Furthermore, as indicated by the description of the public comment on this issue contained in Part IV(A) (particularly the comments of elected officials), a change to prompt elections is broadly accepted by the citizens of this City; there were very few dissenting voices.5 The Commission has determined, however, that the other main issue relating to mayoral succession-- which official should be first in the line of succession in the event of a vacancy--should not be placed on the ballot this year. As indicated by the  discussion in Part IV(A), there are serious arguments on both sides of the question of whether the Public Advocate should be the first in the line of succession. Furthermore, even if one were to conclude that it was more appropriate to have a different official be  5  The Public Advocate has publicly supported the institution of a sixty day special election in the succession system to the mayoralty. See below.  19   the first interim successor, the question of who that official should be (e.g., a deputy mayor) would need to be resolved. Therefore, the Commission defers a determination on this issue, and recommends that it be considered by a future Commission. The Commission also defers a determination on the other major issue it considered, the institution of nonpartisan elections. As indicated by the discussion in Part IV(B) of this report, this issue raises profound questions of representative democracy, and has raised considerable passion among the public and the members of the Commission. As with the issue of the line of mayoral succession, a cogent  argument has been made tha t nonpartisan elections would best serve the members of minority communities in the City, as well as the public in general, by allowing for a greater range of candidates and expertise to be presented to the voters. However, counter -arguments have also been made concerning the effect of nonpartisan elections on minority communities in the City, as well as the effect such elections could have on voter turnout and informed voter participation. In light of all these arguments, the  Commission has determined that this issue requires further public review and comment, and recommends that it be considered by a future Commission. 6  The Commission defers a determination on the other issues it has studied, which are set forth in Part V of this report. As stated in the Scope of Review section of Part II, the Commission has found that some of these issues could be accomplished legislatively, and therefore did not require a referendum immediately, while others required further study and comment from the public and other City agencies that also would be affected by the proposals. Although the Commission believes that many of 6  Commissioner Harry Kresky made a statement on the record regarding the decision to defer a consideration of nonpartisan elections at the Commission's September 3, 2002 public meeting. His statement is contained in Appendix I.  20   the agency and public proposals would greatly enhance the operations of City government, it determined ultimately, at its August 23, 2002, public meeting, that it would defer consideration of these issues, and the remaining issues in the reports of the 1999 and 2001 Commissions, to another election cycle. The Commission notes that it has reviewed the entire Charter. In addition to the reasons stated in connection with the issues above, the Commission has determined not to propose amendments to other sections of the Charter for several reasons. First, the Charter was extensively amended in 1989, only 13 years ago, and has been reviewed by three subsequent Charter Revision Commissions, with changes adopted by the public in 1998 and 2001. Furthermore, in light of recent events, the Commission decided to prioritize a consideration of the issue of mayoral succession, i.e., how the City should fill a mayora l vacancy. Finally, in light of the time constraints, the  Commission decided to prioritize only one other issue, i.e., nonpartisan elections.  21   PART IV(A) Mayoral Succession Issue: Should the Charter's provisions governing the filling of mayoral vacancies be revised? Relevant Charter Provisions: Mayoral succession is governed by Charter  10. Other provisions that are relevant to a discussion of mayoral succession are Charter  8(f) (mayor's power to delegate functions, power, and duties), 24 (powers of the public advocate and succession), 25 (council member election and vacancies), 81 (borough president election and vacancies), and 94 (comptroller vacancies). Discussion: 1. Introduction The issue of ""mayoral succession"" really consists of two majo r issues: who should serve as the Acting Mayor when a vacancy first occurs, and how, if at all, elections should be scheduled to choose the person or persons who will complete the remainder of the term. In considering whether to amend the Charter's mayoral  succession provisions, the Commission has reviewed the following issues:    Who should be the first in the line of succession? Who should be the next person(s) in the line of succession? If the Commission chooses not to keep the portion of the current system relating to elections, whether or not it removes the Public Advocate's office from the line of succession, should the Acting Mayor serve for the remainder of the unexpired term, or should a special election be held for someone to succeed the Acting Mayo r?  22         If a special election is provided for, should it be partisan or nonpartisan? If a special election is provided for, what should the timing of that election be (i.e., 45, 60, 90, or 120 days after the vacancy)? If a special election is provided for, should a runoff election be held if the winner of that election does not get a high enough percentage of the vote? If a runoff election is provided for, what should the trigger percentage be and how many candidates would qualify for the runoff? Does the person elected at a special election serve for the remainder of the unexpired term, or should a general election be held following the special election? If such a general election is held, should it be partisan or nonpartisan? What is the proper relationship between the choice of the person who will serve as the Acting Mayor and the choices about the election system? For example, if a Deputy Mayor would be Acting Mayor, should a special election be held more or less quickly than if it were, for example, the Public Advocate?     Elections to complete the term While the City has a consistent system for filling vacancies in almost every elected City office, the office of the Mayor is the exception. Voters are currently  empowered to fill a vacancy in any other elected office by, in the usual circumstance, special election within 45 days of the vacancy. 7  The City now has over a decade of  experience with these special elections, which were established by the 1988 Charter Revision Commission. Section 10(b) of the Charter currently provides that, upon a permanent vacancy (i.e., failure to qualify, resignation, removal, death, or permanent inability to discharge powers and duties), the powers and duties of the Mayor devolve upon the Public Advocate, the Comptroller, or a person selected by the Council, in that order of  7  Regarding succession to the office of the Public Advocate, see footnote 17.  23   succession, until a new Mayor is elected. If the vacancy occurs prior to September 20 in any year, it is filled at the general election of that year. If the vacancy occurs on or after September 20 in any year , it is filled at the general election held the following calendar year.8 The result of this provision is that, if a vacancy were to occur on or after September 20 in any year of the Mayor's term (except the last), the interim successor (e.g., the Public Advocate) could potentially serve as Acting Mayor for more than 15 months before an elected Mayor takes office. This system contrasts sharply with the election system for filling vacancies in other elected offices, where voters are given the opportunity to elect a successor in short order. The office of the Mayor is crucial. It is the seat of executive power in the City's governmental structure and the focal point of policies affecting the lives of City residents. As the City's chief executive officer, the Mayor is most responsible for the effectiveness and integrity of City government and is the City's most politically accountable elected official. Providing for the prompt selection of a new Mayor by the voters in the event of a mayoral vacancy appears closely related to issues of democracy, stability, and effective government. 9  Who should serve as Acting Mayor pending an election? The other major issue is whether the Public Advocate should remain first in line to be interim successor to the Mayor. As identified by the staff and as reflected in public comment to this Commission, there are benefits and drawbacks to having the Public 8 9  The person elected at a general election would then serve until the end of the original mayoral term. A special election to select an interim Mayor within 90 days of the vacancy has been suggested by The New York Times (Editorial, July 9, 2002). In a subsequent editorial, the Times stated that ""[i]t makes sense to shorten the time to three months when voters can choose a mayoral replacement."" (Editorial, August 17, 2002). Furthermore, as described below, there appears to be widespread support for the idea of changing the Charter to provide for the prompt election of a new Mayor. For example, Betsy Gotbaum, the Public Advocate, has supported such a change.  24   Advocate be the first interim successor. The benefits are that the office of the Public Advocate is an elected office and has a Citywide constituency. The drawbacks are that, in the event of a vacancy, particularly in times of crisis, the Public Advocate would often be someone who lacked sufficient executive knowledge of the City's operations to ensure stability in the City, simply because the day-to-day role played by the Public Advocate is that of ombudsperson. 2. Background and History For over 25 years charter revision commissions have considered the issue of mayoral succession. The 1989 Charter Revision Commission's discussions on  succession are particularly relevant to the issue of who the first successor should be, because that Commission had to address the issue within the larger context of the abolition of the Board of Estimate (""the Board"") and its replacement with the City government structure we have today. For most of this century, the Board was the most powerful and important governing body of the City. At the time of its abolition in 1989, the Board was  comprised of eight members: the Mayor, the City Council President, and the Comptroller, each of whom had two votes, and the five Borough Presidents, each of whom had one vote. Membership on the Board was the most significant source of power for the office of the Council President. The Board exercised authority over some of the City's most important functions and responsibilities. It participated in the budget process, granted leases of City  property, and maintained final authority over the use, development and improvement of City land, including through zoning regulations. It also had final approval of all capital  25   projects and City contracts that were not awarded through competitive sealed bids. While the Council had the power to pass local laws and participate in the budget process, and the Mayor was responsible for implementing the City's programs, the Board possessed authority over important policy decisions that affected the City on a daily basis. In 1989, however, the United States Supreme Court, in Board of Estimate v. Morris, 489 U.S. 688 (1989), declared the Board's voting scheme unconstitutional, holding that it violated the principle of ""one person, one vote."" Because Borough  Presidents held equal amounts of power on the Board, the Court held that residents of some less populous boroughs, such as State n Island, were over-represented, while residents of relatively more populous boroughs, such as Brooklyn, were underrepresented. The Court ordered the City either to reorganize the Board or abolish it. Between March 22 and August 2, 1989, the 1989 Charte r Revision Commission worked to comply with the Court's ruling. The 1989 Charter Revision Commission proposed to abolish the Board and create a new governance structure for the City that would receive the Board's powers. The Commission wanted to continue the City's tradition of a strong mayoralty and, therefore, it transferred many of the Board's functions to the Mayor. The Commission also decided that the Council, as the legislative branch, should be the primary check on the mayoralty. The Commission expanded the Council's membership from 35 to 51 members, and granted it power to approve the budget and authority over land use decisions.  26   The 1989 Commission continued the offices of the Comptroller and the Borough Presidents but with significantly different powers than they had enjoyed by virtue of their seats on the Board. The Comptroller retained certain executive - like functions including the duty to audit every City agency at least once every four years. Borough Presidents lost a significant amount of power with the end of the Board, but retained appointment powers with respect to community boards and were given some control over funding for their boroughs. The City Council President's role in government underwent a major transformation as a result of the 1989 Charter revision, which eliminated the Board of Estimate and, of course, the Council President's votes on the Board. Like the Mayor and Comptroller, the Council President enjoyed two votes on the Board and thus had the ability to exercise significant influence over budgetary issues, land use decisions, approval of contracts, and zoning regulation changes. The duties of the Council  President outside of the Board, however, were limited. As the Council's presiding officer, the Council President could cast a vote to break a tie but was not permitted to vote under any other circumstance. The Vice-Chair of the Council (predecessor to the position of the Speaker) was the person who effectively led the Council, not the Council President. Although the Council President had little input regarding the day-to-day workings of the legislative body, he was the immediate successor to the mayoralty. This  arrangement was rational because the Council President had the same number of votes on the Board as the Mayor and was involved in the day-to-day executive decisions of the Board.  27   With the elimination of the Board came a heated debate over whether to redefine the Council President's responsibilities or whether instead to eliminate that office altogether. It is widely understood that the 1989 Commission ultimately retained that office as part of a political compromise: certain Commissioners did not want thenCouncil President Andrew Stein to be ousted from City government. Indeed,  Commission Chair Frederick A. O. Schwarz, Jr. has since acknowledged that the office was kept, in part, to keep the Commission's majority coalition from falling apart; he noted that this issue aroused ""puzzling passion."" 10  In the 1989 Commission's ""Summary of Final Proposals,"" the Council President is described as ""the city's `Public Advocate' . . . charged with receiving, investigating and attempting to resolve individual citizen complaints.""11 The Public Advocate has  been described as the country's only elected ombudsman.12 In 1993, the City Council passed Local Law 19, officially changing the title of that office from ""President of the Council"" to ""Public Advocate."" In passing that law, the Council acknowledged that ""the most important duty of the President of the City Council is to serve as the public advocate for the citizens of New York City."" 13  In short, it appears that while the provision empowering the Council President, now the Public Advocate, to succeed to the mayoralty has remained constant, the nature of the Public Advocate's office has been radically transformed, and now bears little resemblance to that of its predecessor under the Board of Estimate system.  10  Frederick A.

Review by Previous Commissions  Both the 1999 and the 2001 Charter Revision Commissions reviewed the issue of mayoral succession. These Commissions analyzed different options for an  appropriate interim successor in the event of a mayoral vacancy as well as the need to hold a special election following the vacancy. 1999 Charter Revision Commission The 1999 Commission reviewed whether the Charter's provisions for filling mayoral vacancies should be amended to provide for a special election or a different successor or both. In its report to the Commission, issued July 22, 1999, the staff analyzed these issues, considering facto rs such as the need for stability and continuity in the event of a vacancy, succession systems in major cities throughout New York State and the country, and the legal issues implicated by a change in the City's mayoral succession system. One such legal issue was the question of whether a change to a system of special elections to fill mayoral vacancies would violate the federal Voting Rights Act. The Commission retained Dr. Allan J. Lichtman, Chair of the History Department at American University and a no ted voting rights expert, to provide a detailed analysis of this issue. Dr. Lichtman ultimately concluded that there was no evidence that special elections for Citywide offices would disadvantage minority voters or result in relatively larger reductions in minority voter turnout. Based on this and other expert testimony, the 1999 Commission concluded that its proposal for filling mayoral vacancies with special elections would not violate the Voting Rights Act. 14  14  This Commission also retained Dr. Lichtman to study this issue. As described below, Dr. Lichtman has concluded that the use of special elections with a runoff provision for filling mayoral vacancies would not  29   The Commission's ultimate proposal regarding special elections, contained in its September 1, 1999, final report, provided, in essence, that a nonpartisan special election would be held within 45 days after the occurrence of a vacancy, with a runoff election held if no candidate received at least 40 percent of the vote. A partisan general election would then be held to fill the remainder of the unexpired term. In addition to the special elections issue, the 1999 Commission also analyzed options regarding who could serve as the interim successor to the Mayor in the event of a vacancy. The offices of Public Advocate, Comptroller, Council Speaker, a (newly created) Vice Mayor, and Deputy Mayor were identified as possible successors. The Commission concluded, however, that it would not propose any chang e to the line of succession. The issue of mayoral succession received much public comment. A summary of the comments that were received by the Commission is attached in Appendix D.  2001 Charter Revision Commission The 2001 Charter Revision Commission als o considered the issue of mayoral succession. Ultimately, while the Commission stated that the City should adopt special elections to fill mayoral vacancies and should remove the Public Advocate from the line of succession, it concluded that such Charter reform should not be proposed to the voters ""on the eve of elections for every citywide office."" A summary of the public comment on succession issues received by the 2001 Commission is attached in Appendix D.  violate the Voting Rights Act.  30   4.  Succession in Other Major Cities  A comparison of the mayoral succession provisions for other cities in New York State and across the United States shows the wide variety of approaches cities have taken to address the issue of succession to the mayoralty. Other Cities in New York Under General City Law  2-a(1), where the mayor and the presiding officer of the local legislative body are elected at the same time, for the same term, by the electors of the entire city, the presiding officer becomes mayor for the remainder of the term in the event of a vacancy. As discussed below, New York City's existing mayoral succession provision, Charter  10(b), which differs significantly from Section 2-a(1), is given effect as a grandfathered exception to that section. See General City Law  2a(3)(b). Of the other cities in New York State described in this section, some are  governed by Section 2-a(1), while others are not so governed, because the conditions set forth in that section are not met. Albany. 15  A vacancy in the office of the Mayor is filled by the City Council President,  who serves as Mayor for the remainder of the unexpired term. Buffalo. The vacancy is filled by the City Council President for the remainder of the unexpired term. Rochester. The Council appoints a successor, who must be registered in the same party as the vacating Mayor. An interim Mayor is then elected for the remainder of the unexpired term at the next general election for which there is time to file nominating petitions. If the Council fails to appoint a successor within 30 days of the vacancy, a 15  Any change to the City's current system would require that the Charter be harmonized with General City Law  2-a(1). See discussion of State law issues, below.  31   special election must be held within 90 days of the vacancy to elect a successor to serve for the remainder of the unexpired term. As the President of the Council is  selected from among the members of the Council, the succession rule s forth in et General City Law  2 -a(1) does not apply. Syracuse. The Council President succeeds to the mayoralty for the remainder of the unexpired term. Yonkers. A vacancy in the office of the Mayor is filled by the City Council designating a deputy mayo r, commissioner, or department head as acting Mayor. A special election to fill the remainder of the term is then held 90 days after the vacancy or as soon thereafter as legally possible. If the vacancy occurs within 180 days of the regular midterm muni cipal election, the special election is held concurrently with that election. If the vacancy occurs within 180 days of a regular mayoral election, no special election is held. As the Mayor has a four - year term and the City Council President has a two - year term, the succession rule set forth in General City Law  2 -a(1) does not apply. Mayoral Succession in Other Selected United States Cities The succession provisions for major cities throughout the United States fall into three main categories: (a) cities where the mayor appoints the person who is the  successor; (b) cities where the City Council President becomes the Mayor; and (c) cities where the City Council chooses the successor. Details of the various succession  systems vary by city. Such details include the qualifications of the interim successor, whether a special election is held to fill the remainder of the term, and the length of time before such an election is held. A number of major cities throughout the U.S. hold special elections in the eve nt that a Mayor leaves office. These cities include: Atlanta, Boston, Chicago, Cincinnati, 32   Cleveland, Dallas, Denver, Kansas City, Los Angeles, Miami, Minneapolis, Philadelphia, Portland, Oregon, Orlando, Phoenix, Providence, Sacramento, San Diego, San Francisco, Seattle, Tampa, and Washington, D.C. Furthermore, many cities have  endorsed the designation of a mayoral appointee as the interim mayor. These cities include: Cleveland (Law Director), Denver (Deputy Mayor), and Cincinnati (Vice-Mayor; member of Council selected by Mayor), Houston (Mayor pro tem, member of Council nominated by the Mayor, confirmed by Council) and Kansas City (Mayor pro tem; member of Council appointed by Mayor). On the other hand, many cities take other approaches. 16  Charts summarizing various approaches taken by major U.S. cities are attached in Appendix D. 5. Related State and Federal Law Issues State Law While the options regarding changes to the mayoral succession system implicate provisions of State law, a change to the City's system appears completely consistent with State law. For example, a change to the system of mayoral succession elections to provide for prompt nonpartisan special elections, as is provided for in the Charter for vacancies in all other City elective offices, would be legal. See Charter  24 (public advocate), 25 (council members), 81 (borough presidents), and 94 (comptroller). This existing Charter procedure was upheld in City of New York v. Board of Elections , Index No. 41450/91 (Sup. Ct. New York Co.), aff'd __ A.D.2d __ (1st Dep't), lv. den. , 77 N.Y.2d 938 (1991), 16  One factor that may affect the approach a city takes is whether the city's form of government follows a ""strong mayor"" model, like New York City, or instead a ""council/city manager"" model, like Kansas City. A chart analyzing this issue is attached in Appendix D.  33   on municipal home rule grounds, against a claim that the Charter provisions were preempted by inconsistent provisions of the State Election Law. See State Constitution, Article IX; Municipal Home Rule Law  10; Election Law  1-102; and Bareham v. City of Rochester, 246 N.Y. 140 (1927). 17  Any change to the terms of mayoral succession, whether as to the interim successor or the form of elections would implicate General City Law  2-a(1). Under this provision, where a city's mayor and the presiding officer of the local legislative body are elected at the same time for the same term by the voters of the entire city, the presiding officer of the legislative body becomes the mayor for the remainder of the unexpired term. Currently, as the Public Advocate ""presides over"" the Council, Charter  24(e), and is elected at the same time as the Mayor, for the same term as the Mayor, by the voters of the entire City, the terms of Section 2-a(1) appear to apply. However, the City's current mayoral succession provision, Charter  10(b), is ""grandfathered"" as an exception to Section 2 -a(1) by General City Law  2 -a(3)(b). Because this exemption from application of the provisions of Section 2-a(1) arguably would not continue, however, after modification of any of the current mayoral succession provisions, it would be necessary to eliminate the Public Advocate's  17  It should be noted that the special election provision intended to be triggered by a vacancy in the office of Public Advocate has never been precleared by the Department of Justice. While the provision must be precleared before it can be implemented, the 1988 Charter Revision Commission recommended that State law be changed prior to the City seeking preclearance. Specifically, that Commission was concerned that General City Law (""GCL"")  2 a(2) might preempt the Charter's provisions regarding Public Advocate vacancies, because it mandates that the vice-chairman of the local le gislative body, i.e., the Speaker of the Council, becomes the presiding officer of the Council, i.e., the Public Advocate, for the remainder of the unexpired term. However, any change to the current succession system would necessitate that the Public Advocate be switched out of the now ceremonial role of presiding over the Council, see Charter  24(e). Thus, the concern of the 1988 Commission will become moot because the terms of GCL  2-a(2) would, on their face, no longer apply. See discussion of GCL  2- a(1) and 2-a(3). The provisions regarding who shall be the interim successor to the Public Advocate pending a special election, in the event of a vacancy, are therefore clarified in the proposed Charter changes.  34   ceremonial right to ""preside"" over the Council--or transfer the right to a public official who is elected on a different election cycle, or for a different term, or not by all the citizens of the City--so that the terms of Section 2-a(1) would not apply in the first place. 18  While one could, alternatively, amend the starting point of the Public  Advocate's term, so that it would not run concurrently with the term of the Mayor, this approach might create additional complications regarding, for example, the application of term limits. Under either approach, the Public Advocate's authority to introduce legislation in the Council would not need to be changed. Federal Voting Rights Act A change in the rules governing mayoral succession could arguably be considered a change in a ""standard, practice, or procedure with respect to voting."" Such a change could require the City to seek preclearance from the Justice Department pursuant to the Voting Rights Act. Under the Voting Rights Act, a State or political subdivision may not impose a ""standard, practice, or procedure . . . which results in a denial or abridgement of the right of any citizen of the United States to vote on account of race or color . . . ."" 42 U.S.C.  1973(a). In establishing whether such an abridgement has occurred, one must determine whether, ""under the totality of circumstances, it is shown tha t the political processes leading to nomination or election in the State or political subdivision are not equally open to participation by members of a [protected] class [i.e., race or color] in  18  Under Charter  24(e), a major power of the Public Advocate that relates to the power to preside over the Council is the ability to break a tie vote. However, under Municipal Home Rule Law  20(1), passage of a local law requires a majority affirmative vote of the total voting power of the legislative body. See also Charter  34 (passage of local law or resolution requires majority affirmative vote of all the council members). Thus, 26 affirmative votes are needed in the Council to pass any local law. In light of this fact, a meaningful tie vote is extremely unlikely.  35   that its members have less opportunity than other members of the electorate to participate in the political process and to elect representatives of their choice."" 42 U.S.C.  1973(b). Whenever the City seeks, in general, to change a ""standard, practice, or procedure with respect to voting,"" it seeks preclearance from the Justice Department as to whether the change will have the effect of denying or abridging the right to vote on account of race or color. 42 U.S.C.  1973c. The change may not take effect until the City receives preclearance. Id. When preclearance is sought from the Justice  Department, the change may take effect if ""the Attorney General has not interposed an objection within sixty days after such submission, or upon good cause shown, to facilitate an expedited approval within sixty days after such submission, the Attorney General has affirmatively indicated that such objection will not be made."" Id. As to preclearance of a change such as one to the Charter's mayoral succession provisions, which would require approval by referendum, see Municipal Ho me Rule Law 23(d), Charter 38(3), the Department of Justice has set forth instructions regarding the timing of such preclearance. submissions,"" The Attorney General will not consider on the merits: (a) any proposal for a change affecting voting submitted prior to final enactment or administrative decision or (b) any proposed change which has a direct bearing on another change affecting voting which has not received Section 5 preclearance. However, with respect to a change for which approval by referendum, a State or Federal court or a Federal agency is required, the Attorney General may make a determination concerning the change prior to such approval if the change is not subject to alteration in the final approving action and if all other action necessary for approval has been taken. Under 28 C.F.R.  51.22, entitled, ""Premature  36   It thus appears that the Justice Department could, but would not be required to, consider for preclearance any change to the Charter's mayoral succession provisions prior to appro val by the voters at referendum. In 1999, the Charter Revision Commission's consultant, Dr. Allan J. Lichtman, analyzed whether establishing a system of special elections to fill mayoral vacancies would have a detrimental impact on voting power or representation of the City's minority communities and thus violate the Voting Rights Act. He analyzed recent special  elections in the City and other municipalities with high minority populations. Specifically, he analyzed data for seven special elections for Sta te Assembly and Senate, Congressional and Council positions between 1992 and 1998. Dr. Lichtman also  reviewed special elections in Washington, D.C., Chicago and Memphis. He found no evidence to support a conclusion that New York City mayoral special elections would be likely to disadvantage minority voters by producing large reductions in minority turnout relative to the reductions in white turnout. Indeed, he inferred from the data that in a Citywide special election minority turnout would likely be high relative to white turnout if a minority candidate or choice of minority candidates was competing for office. The Commission also consulted on this issue with Gerald Hebert , a legal expert on the Voting Rights Act, who worked at the Department of Justice for over 20 years and served as Acting Chief, Deputy Chief, and Special Litigation Counsel in the Voting Rights Section of the Civil Rights Division at the Justice Department. After reviewing the opinions of Professor Lichtman and Mr. Hebert, the Commission concluded that filling a mayoral vacancy through a special election (using the procedure proposed by the 1999 Commission) would not violate the Voting Rights Act.  37   Dr. Lichtman was retained by this Commission to again review this issue. He concluded that the use of nonpartisan special elections, with a runoff provision for filling vacancies in the mayoralty, should not impede the opportunity for minority voters in the City to participate fully in the electoral process and elect candidates of their choice. Dr. Lichtman noted that, while the 40 percent runoff provision might undermine minority voting opportunity, because a minority candidate could have received a plurality (but under 40 percent) of the vote if the white vote split, the same was true for a white candidate, who could receive a plurality (but under 40 percent) of the vote if the minority vote split. In either event, the runoff provision would prevent that candidate with the under 40 percent plurality from winning the office. Thus, the runoff provision itself did not present a Voting Rights Act problem. Dr. Lichtman's analysis of citywide special elections in Washington, D.C., Memphis, and Chicago did not show any consistent pattern of lower minority than white turnout or greater minority fall-off than white fall-off. He stressed that it was the  competitiveness of the elections that mattered and not the nature of the elections. He stated that if there is a hotly contested election with a strong minority candidate there would be minority turnout. 6. Policy Considerations Prompt Elections As described above, while the City has a consistent system for filling vacancies in almost every elected City office, the office of the Mayor is the exception. Under Charter  10(b), the Public Advocate could potentially serve as Acting Mayor for more than 15 months before an elected Mayor takes office. In light of this situation, the  38   Commission has studied whether it would be appropriate to provide for prompt elections for the person who would next be Mayor. The Commission received extensive comment on this issue, both from elected officials and from the public. Elected officials expressed a range of opinions with regard to the timing of elections for mayoral succession, with suggestions ranging from 45 days to the current 15- month period. A number of officials favored a 90-day period. Some officials believed that a shorter period of time might not afford candidates sufficient time to establish a campaign or give voters sufficient time to make an informed decision. However, while the exact suggestions varied, the testimony of the elected officials was notably in favor of instituting a system of prompt elections for mayoral succession. For example, Betsy Gotbaum, the Public Advocate, while stating her belief that the Commission should take more time to deliberate, stated that she ""would support a change in the Charter that allowed a special election to take place at some point after a successor takes office, whether it's 45, 60, or 90 days. That's what I've always said and what I truly believe."" (Public Hearing, August 13, 2002, Transcript p. 40) 19  Similarly, Bill Thompson, the Comptroller, C. Virginia Fields, the Manhattan Borough President, and Fernando Ferrer, the former Bronx Borough President, stated that they supported a special election being held within 90 days of a mayoral vacancy. See Thompson (Public Hearing, Aug ust 22, 2002, Transcript p. 49), Fields (Public Hearing, Aug ust 21, 2002, Transcript p. 41), and Ferrer (Public Hearing, Aug ust 21, 2002, Transcript p. 86). 19  Helen Marshall, the Queens Borough President, thought that a  In a letter to the editor of the New York Times dated January 20, 2002, Gotbaum stated that ""[w]hat she did promise in [her] campaign was to propose legislation toward a swifter special election for the new mayor. Under the current system, in the event of the elected mayor's inability to serve, the public advocate could have the job as long as 15 months. We can probably arrange an opportunity for the people to choose their own new mayor in significantly less time than that .""  39   special election within 90 days was a possibility. (Public Hearing, Aug ust 15, 2002, Transcript p. 69) Both Denny Farrell, a Member of the New York State Assembly, and Leroy Comrie, a New York City Council Member, testified in favor of shortening the period before an election is held. See Farrell (Public Hearing, Aug ust 21, 2002,  Transcript p. 102) and Comrie (Public Hearing, Aug ust 15, 2002, Transcript p. 59). Steven Fiala, the County Clerk of Richmond County and a former New York City Council Member and Minority Whip, thought the election should occur within 60 days. Only Scott Stringer, a New York State Assembly Member, and G. Oliver Koppel, a New York City Council Member , opposed substantially shortening the period before an election; Stringer (a former candidate for Public Advocate, who evidently thought that the Public Advocate served automatically for 12 to 15 months as successor) thought Charter  10(b) should remain as is, and Koppel thought there should be ""a substantial period of time"" before an election took place. See Stringer (Public Hearing, Aug ust 13, 2002, Transcript p. 51), and Koppel (Public Hearing, Aug ust 13, 2002, Transcript p. 69). Marty Markowitz, the Brooklyn Borough President, thought more time was needed to study this issue. (Public Hearing, August 13, 2002, Transcript p. 59) 20  Public comment was consistent with the implementation of prompt elections. Line of Mayoral Succession A. Staff analysis In its August 5, 2002, report, the staff analyzed various options for which City office was appropriate as first in the line of succession. The offices considered included  20  Elected officials who supported special elections in testimony before the 1999 Commission included Comptroller Alan Hevesi, Queens Borough President Claire Shulman, Staten Island Borough President Guy Molinari, Council Member Noach Dear, Council Member Martin Golden, Council Member James Oddo, Council Member Priscilla Wooten, State Senator Guy Velella, and Congressman Vito Fosella.  40   the Public Advocate, the Comptroller, the Speaker of the Council, a newly created Vice Mayor, and a Deputy Mayor. This analysis follows: Public Advocate -- The Public Advocate is currently the immediate successor to the mayoralty in the event of a vacancy. Charter  10(b). 21  The most significant power  of the office is that of an ombudsperson, i.e., an officer that monitors government operations and investigates complaints. See Charter  24. Though the Public  Advocate maintains a seat on a limited number of boards, the office performs virtually no executive functions other than managing a small staff. As the prior discussion of the history of the office indicates, the powers and responsibilities of the Public Advocate are not of the magnitude of those exercised formerly by the Council President on the Board of Estimate. This analysis can lead to the conclusion, as it did for the 2001 Commission, that the Public Advocate is not the appropriate choice as first in line to succeed to the mayoralty in the event of a vacancy. 22  It may be argued that, in a time of crisis, the  person who immediately becomes Acting Mayor should be someone who has an intimate knowledge of the daily workings of the executive function performed by the Mayor. Either a Deputy Mayor or arguably the Comptroller would meet this criterion. In fact, it may be argued that the Public Advocate, exercising an ombudsperson function, is particularly unsuited to be first in the line of succession to the City's most important executive office. The ""ombuds"" concept originated in Sweden in the early 1700s; by the 1800s, ""the Swedish Ombuds man had evolved into an administrative 21  For a comprehensive description of the office of the Public Advocate, see Mark Green & Laurel Eisner, The Public Advocate for New York City: An Analysis of the Country's Only Elected Ombudsman, 42 N.Y.L. Sch. L. Rev. 1093 (1998). 22 See Making Our City's Progress Permanent: Report of the New York City Charter Revision Commission, at 112 (Sept. 5, 2001).  41   body appointed by the Parliament to protect individuals against the excesses of the bureaucracy."" 23  Even today, the accepted definition of ombudsperson is ""a public  official appointed by the legislature to receive and investigate citizen complaints against administrative acts of government."" 24  While the office of the Public Advocate is elective  rather than appointive, its powers under the Charter remain largely within the classic ombudsperson model. Therefore, one could argue that the Public Advocate does not gain the experience necessary to step immediately into the mayoralty, particularly in a time of crisis. Furthermore, the Public Advocate's ombudsperson role may put the office institutionally at odds with the mayoralty; in the event of succession, this fact may create a blurring of institutional separation of powers. On the other hand, it is significant that the office of the Public Advocate is an elected, Citywide office. One could argue that it is more democratic, even when  considering an office that may be filled for only a relatively short period of time (assuming that a special election will be held), to have the person who is first in the line of succession to be someone who has been elected to public office. Furthermore, considering that the Public Advocate has been chosen by the entire electorate of the City, it would not be inappropriate for the Public Advocate to be the interim successor for another, elected Citywide office. An alternative between either keeping the Public Advocate as first in line of succession or simply replacing that office with another one could be made along the lines of Charter  10(a), the provision governing mayoral suspension, absence, or temporary inability to discharge powers. Under that section, the Public Advocate or the  23 24  Green & Eisner, Public Advocate, at 1104. See the website of the United States Ombudsman Association, at www.usombudsman.org.  42   Comptroller, in that order, acts as mayor with certain limited powers until the suspension, absence, or inability ceases. While so acting, the Public Advocate or Comptroller may not appoint or remove from office, and may not exercise any power lawfully delegated by the Mayor to a Deputy Mayor prior to the suspension or inability, or before or after the commencement of the absence. Furthermore, the Public  Advocate or Comptroller may not, as a general matter, sign, approve, or disapprove any local law or resolution until the suspension, absence, or temporary inability has continued for at least nine days. While the Deputy Mayor may exercise many powers during this period, he or she may not act on local laws or resolutions of the Council, act as a magistrate, or appoint or remove officials. Thus, while the Public Advocate or Comptroller may assume certain functions, the operational functions are retained by a deputy mayor. The advantages of such an approach for the vacancy situation is that would not necessarily involve removing the Public Advocate from the line of succession, and it would be familiar. 25  The disadvantage is that it might result in a tension between the  Acting Mayor and the Deputy Mayor, even if they were officially exercising different powers. Comptroller-- The Comptroller performs several significant functions and is responsible for the fiscal integrity of the City. The Charter vests the Comptroller with the power to audit all City agencies and all matters relating to the City's finances, and to settle and adjust all claims against the City. Furthermore, under Charter  8(c), the Comptroller participates in the issuance of City debt. In addition, the Comptroller is  25  This bifurcated approach would be possible with either the Comptroller or the Public Advocate as the Acting Mayor.  43   responsible for the registrati on of contracts for the procurement of goods, services and construction. Hence, the Comptroller, unlike the Public Advocate, exercises certain functions that may be viewed as ""executive"" in nature. Conversely, the responsibility to audit and monitor the executive branch may put the Comptroller institutionally at odds with the executive branch on various issues. This could create, at a minimum, an  awkwardness in how the Comptroller, as Acting Mayor, would act in relation to the Comptroller's office. Furthermore, as the Comptroller's responsibilities are largely postaction audits and approvals, and not service delivery or the implementation of legislative mandates, some might see the Comptroller's executive experience as limited. Speaker of the Council-- The Speaker of the City Council is the leader of the City Council, and is elected by its members. The Speaker does not possess an executive function and is not a Citywide elected official but, as the leader of the City's legislative body, is a powerful player in the affairs of the City. This role could give the Speaker the experience necessary to exercise the powers and duties of the Mayor until there is an election to fill the remainder of the unexpired mayoral term. On the other hand, the Charter, like the State and federal constitutions, contains a framework based on a separation of powers, which could be compromised by allowing the Speaker to succeed to the mayoralty. The Charter's separation of powers is manifested in a number of ways that would be compromised if the Speaker became the Acting Mayor. For example, the Mayor provides a check on the Council by approving or vetoing local laws passed by the Council. Conversely, the Council has an oversight role in relation to the activities of mayoral agencies. If the Speaker succeeded to the mayoralty, even on an interim basis, these checks could be lost.  44   A possible variation on the idea of Speaker as first in the line of succession is to have a person chosen by the Council be the interim successor. This is currently the third possibility for succession under Charter  10(b), which is the provision governing the order of succession in the event of a mayoral vacancy. Vice Mayor--As discussed above, the 1989 Charter Revision Commission considered establishing an office of the Vice Mayor, who would be elected along with the Mayor. The Vice Mayor proposal was designed by its sponsors as a vehicle to help minority candidates win election to Citywide office based on the theory that mayoral candidates would choose to run with Vice Mayor candidates who came from a community other than their own, in order to create a broad-based coalition. Opponents of the proposal, however, argued that the creation of a Vice Mayor position would relegate minorities to a secondary role beholden to the Mayor. Others maintained that the Council President could have the ability, even after the reorganization of the government, to serve as a check on the Mayor, but that, if the position of Vice Mayor replaced that of Council President, such a check would be lost. After considerable debate, the Commission rejected a motion to abolish the Council President's office and create a Vice Mayor who would succeed to the mayoralty. Bill Thompson, the current Comptroller, stated this year that the concept of a Vice Mayor would be a ""prescription for disaster."" Transcript, August 22, 2002, p. 54. Creating the office would represent a significant alteration of the City's electoral structure, with possible legal consequences, and would require framing the specific powers and duties of that office. Deputy Mayor-- The Charter provides that the Mayor may appoint Deputy Mayors, as appropriate, with powers and duties as the Mayor determines. Of the  various existing options for who should be the interim successor, a Deputy Mayor is 45   most likely to subscribe to the views of the vacating Mayor and would be the person most likely to continue the Mayor's policies. In addition, a Deputy Mayor would be intimately familiar with the operation of City government and the role played by the executive branch, an asset that would be critical in a period of crisis and transition. A vacancy in the office of Mayor would inevitably create the possibility of significant volatility in the City. It would therefore be valuable to guarantee that someone with knowledge of the City's operations, such as a Deputy Mayor, become the Acting Mayor to ensure and facilitate stability in the City. Furthermore, if an act of war, natural disaster or other disaster in the City claimed the li fe of the Mayor, the need for stability and experienced leadership would be essential. The tragic events of September 11th have demonstrated the need for continuity in a time of grave crisis. As is widely known, Mayor Giuliani was able to develop a  comprehensive emergency response plan immediately after the attack. The execution of that plan was possible because the Mayor had extensive knowledge of the operation of City government and a close working relationship with the City officials responsible for executing the emergency response plan. It is arguable that, had there been a  vacancy in the mayoralty related to the sudden attacks, a Deputy Mayor would have been best able to replicate the Mayor's knowledge and working relationships. Additionally, someone who is already in the chain of command to the Mayor, such as a Deputy Mayor, would likely be one of the only persons who could effectively command and deploy police, fire, and other resources necessary to respond in a time of crisis. On the other hand, it may be argued that the fact that a Deputy Mayor is not an elected official makes a Deputy Mayor inappropriate to become the interim mayoral  46   successor. In addition to the general democracy concerns that would be raised, making a Deputy Mayor the interim successor could be perceived as giving him or her an unfair advantage in any election to fill out the remainder of the term, assuming that the Deputy Mayor were inclined to run in such an election. Therefore, if a future Commission were to consider proposing that a Deputy Mayor be first in the line of succession, it might want to consider barring that person from running in such an election to fill the unexpired term. Furthermore, the concerns about the Deputy Mayor being Acting  Mayor become more significant the longer the period of time for which he or she would serve as Acting Mayor. Therefore, if a future Commission decides to consider  proposing a change to Deputy Mayor in the line of succession, it needs to consider closely the amount of time before a n election is held. B. Public Comment The elected officials who spoke at the public hearings believed it would be best if the successor to the Mayor were an elected official. In support of this position, some stated that elected officials have experience dealing with citywide issues, are aware of the public's concerns, and have a relationship with the commissioners. Others cited a concern that a m ayor removed for illegal conduct should not be succeeded by that person's appointee. Some officials believe d that the average individual does not know who the deputy mayors are, thus making it inappropriate to appoint one of them to the highest level of municipal government. Others believe d that the current succession model works and should be retained, that it is undemocratic to have the Mayor's hand picked assistant run the City, or that mayoral appointees may not have sufficient public experience.  47   Many elected officials believed that the Public Advocate should succeed the Mayor, while others endorsed the concept of an elected Vice-Mayor. A few officials specifically supported abolishing the position of Public Advocate; on the other hand, some of those in favor of succession by the Public Advocate believe d that the position should be given a budget line or subpoena power. Those supporting mayoral  succession by the Public Advocate believed that the Public Advocate is familiar with City government and that the public is familiar with that person through a citywide election process. Some officials were influenced by the belief that the voters elected the Public Advocate knowing that the position is designated to succeed the Mayor in the event of a vacancy. Some elected officials were concerned that an interim successor should be focused on running the City, not on the next special election, and that any interim mayor would have an advantage in the subsequent election. Some concluded that the interim mayor should not be permitted to run at the next mayoral election. Public comment at the public hearings both supported and opposed changing the line of succession. Of those in support of a change, some commented that a deputy mayor would be best suited to be the interim mayor because that person would be familiar with the operations of City government. Some speakers expressed the view that the Public Advocate's office should not be the next in line for succession. In fact, some speakers expressed their opinion that the office should be eliminated. Some speakers noted that, due to the nature of the Public Advocate's role as ombudsperson, the Public Advocate often takes positions counter to the Mayor, and that it would therefore not be proper for the Public Advocate to succeed the Mayor.  48   On the other hand, many members of the public spoke in support of retaining the current line of succession. Some supported this position because the Public Advocate is a Citywide elected official. Others were concerned that the Mayor should not be able to designate a successor who is not an elected official.  Options Considered for Charter Change: This section contains two sets of proposed Charter revisions regarding mayoral succession: one in which (A) the election system is shortened by requiring, in the usual case, a special election within 60 days of a vacancy, but in which the line of succession is unchanged from the current Charter provision; and one in which (B) a deputy mayor is substituted for the Public Advocate as the interim successor and the subsequent election system would provide, in the usual case, for a special election within 60 days of a vacancy. Each set of proposed changes is followed by a discussion of its provisions. The Commission has decided to put proposal ""A"" before the voters on the November 2002 ballot, and defer proposal ""B"" for consideration by another Commission. A. The Line of Succession Remains Unchanged, but a Prompt Election is Required Subdivision b of section 10 of the New York city charter, as  Section one.  amended by local law number 19 for the year 1993, is amended to read as follows: b. In the case of a failure of a person elected as mayor to qualify, or a vacancy in the office caused by the mayor's resignation, removal, death or permanent inability to discharge the powers and duties of the office of mayor, such powers and duties shall devolve upon the public advocate, the comptroller or a person selected pursuant to subdivision c of section twenty-eight, in that order of succession, until a new mayor shall 49   be elected as provided herein. [If the vacancy shall occur before the twentieth day of Septe mber in any year, such vacancy shall be filled in the general election held in that year, otherwise it shall be filled in the general election held in the following year. The term of the person then elected mayor shall begin on January first after such election and shall expire on the date when the term of the mayor originally elected would have expired.] Upon the commencement of the term of the [thus] person first elected mayor pursuant to the provisions of subdivision c of this section, the [public advo cate or the comptroller] person then acting as mayor pursuant to the provisions of this subdivision, if an elected official, shall complete the term of the office to which such person was elected if any remains.  2. Subdivision c of section 10 of the New York city charter is re-lettered  subdivision d, and a new subdivision c is added to read as follows: c. 1. Within three days of the occurrence of a vacancy in the office of the mayor, the person acting as mayor shall proclaim the date for the election or elections required by this subdivision, provide notice of such proclamation to the city clerk and the board of elections and publish notice thereof in the City Record. After the proclamation of the date for an election to be held pursuant to paragraphs fo ur or five of this subdivision, the city clerk shall publish notice thereof not less than twice in each week preceding the date of such election in newspapers distributed within the city, and the board of elections shall mail notice of such election to all registered voters within the city. 2. If a vacancy occurs during the first three years of the term, a general election to fill the vacancy for the remainder of the unexpired term shall be held in the year in which the vacancy occurs, unless the vacancy occurs after the last day on which an  50   occurring vacancy may be filled at the general election in that same year with party nominations of candidates for such election being made at a primary election, as provided in section 6-116 of the election law. If suc h a vacancy occurs in any year after such last day, it shall be filled for the remainder of the unexpired term at the general election in the following year provided, however, that no general election to fill a vacancy shall be held in the last year of the term, except as provided in paragraph nine of this subdivision. Party nominations of candidates for a general election to fill a vacancy for the remainder of the unexpired term shall be made at a primary election, except as provided in paragraph five of this subdivision. 3. If a special or general election to fill the vacancy on an interim basis has not been previously held pursuant to paragraphs four, six, seven and eight of this subdivision, the person elected to fill the vacancy for the remainder of the unexpired term at a general election shall take office immediately upon qualification and shall serve until the term expires. If a special or general election to fill the vacancy on an interim basis has been previously held, the person elected to fill the vacancy for the remainder of the unexpired term at a general election shall take office on January first of the year following such general election and shall serve until the term expires. 4. If a vacancy occurs during the first three years of the term and on or before the last day in the third year of the term on which an occurring vacancy may be filled for the remainder of the unexpired term at a general election with party nominations of candidates for such election being made at a primary election, as provided in section 6116 of the election law, a special or general election to fill the vacancy on an interim basis shall be held, unless the vacancy occurs less than ninety days before the next primary election at which party nominations for a general election to fill the vacancy may 51   be made and on or before the last day on which an occurring vacancy may be filled for the remainder of the unexpired term at the general election in the same year in which the vacancy occurs with party nominations of candidates for such election being made at a primary election, as provided in section 6 -116 of the election law. 5. If a vacancy occurs after the last day in the third year of the term on which an occurring vacancy may be filled for the remainder of the unexpired term at a general election in each year with party nominations of candidates for such election are being made at a primary election, as provided in section 6-116 of the election law, but not less than ninety days before the date of the primary election in the fourth year of such term, a special or general election to fill such vacancy for the remainder of the unexpired term shall be held. 6. Elections held pursuant to paragraph four or five of this subdivision shall be scheduled in the following manner: a special election to fill the vacancy shall be held on the first Tuesday at least sixty days after the occurrence of the vacancy, provided that the person acting as mayor, in the proclamation required by paragraph one of this subdivision, may schedule such election for another day not more than ten days after such Tuesday and not less than forty days after such proclamation if the person acting as mayor determines that such rescheduling is necessary to facilitate maximum voter participation; except that (a) if the vacancy occurs before September twentieth in any year and the first Tuesday at least sixty days after the occurrence of the vacancy is less than ninety days before a regularly scheduled general election or between a primary and a general election, the vacancy shall be filled at such general election; and  52   (b) if the vacancy occurs before September twentieth in any year and the first Tuesday at least sixty days after the occurrence of the vacancy is after a regularly scheduled general election, the vacancy shall be filled at such general election; and (c) if the vacancy occurs on or after September twentieth in any year and the first Tuesday at least sixty days after the occurrence of the vacancy is after, but less than thirty days after, a regular ly scheduled general election, the vacancy shall be filled at a special election to be held on the first Tuesday in December in such year. 7. All nominations for elections to fill vacancies held pursuant to paragraphs four and five of this subdivision sha ll be by independent nominating petition. A signature on an independent nominating petition made earlier than the date of the proclamation required by paragraph one of this subdivision shall not be counted. 8. A person elected to fill a vacancy in the office of the mayor at an election held pursuant to paragraph four of this subdivision shall take office immediately upon qualification and serve until December thirty- first of the year in which the vacancy is filled for the remainder of the unexpired term pursuant to paragraph two of this subdivision. A person elected to fill a vacancy in the office of the mayor at an election held pursuant to paragraph five of this subdivision shall take office immediately upon qualification and serve until the term expires. 9. If a vacancy occurs less than ninety days before the date of the primary election in the last year of the term, the person elected at the general election in such year for the next succeeding term shall take office immediately upon qualification and fill the vacancy for the remainder of the unexpired term. 10. If at any election held pursuant to this subdivision for which nominations were made by independent nominating petitions, no candidate receives forty percent or more 53   of the vote, the two candidates receiving the most votes shall advance to a runoff election which shall be held on the second Tuesday next succeeding the date on which such election was held.  3. Subdivision e of section 24 of the New York city charter, as amended by  local law number 19 for the year 1993, is amended as follows: e. The public advocate [shall preside over the meetings of the council and]  shall have the right to participate in the discussion of the council but shall not have a vote [except in case of a tie].  4. Section 44 of the New York city charter, as amended by local law number  68 for the year 1993, is amended to read as follows:  44. Speaker. The council shall elect from among its members a speaker and such other officers as it deems appropriate. The speaker shall preside over the meetings of the council. During any period when the public advocate is acting as mayor, or when a vacancy exists in the office of the public advocate, the speaker shall act as public advocate pending the filling of the vacancy pursua nt to subdivision c of section twentyfour, and shall be a member of every board of which the public advocate is a member by virtue of his or her office.  5. Section 1152 of the New York city charter is amended by adding a new  subdivision i to read as follows: i. 1. The amendments to the charter, amending sections ten, twenty- four,  and forty-four, approved by the electors on November fifth, two thousand two, shall take effect immediately, provided that any vacancy that occurs in the office of the mayor on or after September twentieth, two thousand two, and before the effective date of the  54   amendments referenced in this subdivision, shall be governed by such amendments, and any such vacancy shall be deemed to have occurred on such effective date. 2. Notwithstanding the provisions of section 1153, in the event that the  amendment set forth in paragraph 10 of the new subdivision c of section 10 is finally adjudicated to be invalid or otherwise cannot be implemented, all of the amendments referenced in this subdivision shall be without any further force and effect and, at such time, sections ten, twenty- four, and forty-four as they existed immediately prior to the effective date of such amendments shall be reinstated and shall be deemed to have always remained in full force and effect and unamended by such amendments. Discussion The proposed changes in section one , regarding Charter  10(b), eliminate the current election system for filling a vacancy in the mayoralty with someone who will serve for the remainder of the term after the initial successor. Section two of the proposal establishes a new election system, which would be contained in a new Charter  10(c). The proposal takes the basic approach that  currently exists for filling vacancies in other City offi ces, in which nonpartisan special elections are promptly held and general elections generally follow. The benefits of this approach are that it is convenient (because familiar) for the public and the Board of Elections, and it has been upheld in court. It should be noted, however, that this  approach creates the possibility that a number of people could serve as Mayor within too short a period of time.26 26  Using the Charter's current provision for filling vacancies in the office of the Comptroller, Charter  94(c), as an example for how a mayoral special election system might work, here is an example: Mayor Number One vacates the office on January 10 of the second year of his or her term. Mayor Number Two then immediately takes office as the Acting Mayor, pending a special election. Mayor Number Three wins  55   As provided in paragraph 1 of new subdivision (c), the person acting as mayor in the event of a vacancy (i.e., the interim successor) must proclaim the date for the election or elections required by the subdivision, provide notice of the proclamation to the City Clerk and the Board of Elections, and publish notice in the City Record. The City Clerk and the Board of Elections must then also publish or provide notice. The next step is that an election would be held. In the usual case, it would be a special election held on the first Tuesday at least sixty days after the occurrence of the vacancy. See paragraph 6 of new subdivision (c). The date of the special election could be varied somewhat if the mayor determined that rescheduling was necessary to maximize voter participation, id., or if the special election would occur too soon after the general election, see id. at subparagraph (c). In addition, the vacancy could be filled at the general election (rather than a special election) if it occurred in the summer or early fall, to avoid an excess of elections. See id. at subparagraphs (a) and (b). A special election would be required to occur approximately sixty days after the vacancy for several reasons. First, it should be noted that this sixty-day period is longer than the 45 days provided for in the Charter succession provisions for other elected offices. A longer period of time prior to the special election is appropriate for the choice of someone to be Mayor, considering that the City might be facing a crisis situation that would complicate its ability to hold an election in less than two months after the vacancy. However, a longer period of time was not chosen because of the need to  a special election, see Charter 94(c)(4), scheduled for late February, Charter  94(c)(6), and takes office immediately upon qualification. Charter  94(c)(8). He or she then serves until December 31 of that of that year. Id. Meanwhile, a general election is held to elect someone to fill the remainder of the term. Charter  94(c)(2). The winner of that election, Mayor Number Four, takes office on January 1 of the next year. Charter  94(c)(3).  56   have an elected person serving as mayor as soon after the vacancy as would likely be practicable. Furthermore, the timing of the vacancy would affect whether the person elected would serve for the remainder of the unexpired term or only on an interim basis. If a vacancy occurs in the first three years of the mayoral term, and on or before the last date in that year when vacancies may be filled at a general election through party nomination of candidates at a primary election, pursuant to Election Law  6-116, and if the vacancy occurs at least 90 days before that year's primary, then the election would be held to fill the vacancy on an interim basis, see paragraph 4, and wo uld be followed by a general election in that year to fill the remainder of the term. See paragraph 2. In the same situation, but where the vacancy occurs less than 90 days before the primary but with enough time to conduct a partisan primary and general election, no interim election is held; if there is not enough time to use the general election, a special election is held. See paragraphs 2, 4, and 5. If the vacancy occurs after the last day in the third year of the term when vacancies may be filled at a general election through party nomination of candidates at a primary election, pursuant to Election Law  6-116, but not less than 90 days before the date of the primary in the fourth year of the term, the election is to fill the vacancy for the remainder of the unexpired term. See paragraph 5. Elections held under paragraph 4 for filling a mayoral vacancy on an interim basis, and under paragraph 5 for filling the vacancy for the remainder of the term in basically the last year of a term, are nonpartisan elections. See paragraph 7. General elections to fill a vacancy for the remainder of a term that follow a special election are partisan elections. See paragraph 2. As with the existing Charter provisions for  vacancies in other elected offices, the paragraph 4 and paragraph 5 elections are 57   nonpartisan elections (through the independent nominating petition process) in order to allow ballot access to a broad range of candidates where use of a primary is not possible. See Election Law  6-116. This is the rationale that was used by the 1988 Charter Revision Commission when it instituted nonpartisan elections for vacancies in the other City offices. The provisions set forth exactly when a person elected under this system takes office and until when he or she serves. A person elected under paragraph 4 to fill a vacancy on an interim basis takes office immediately upon qualification and serves until December 31 of the year when the vacancy is filled for the remainder of the term at a general election under paragraph 2. See paragraph 8. The person elected at that general election then takes office on January 1 of the next year (i.e., the next day), and serves until the term expires. See paragraph 3. Similarly, a person elected under  paragraph 5 to fill the remainder of the unexpired term takes office immediately upon qualification and serves until the term expires. See paragraph 8. In addition, if no election has been held pursuant to paragraph 4 to fill the vacancy on an interim basis (if, for example, the timing requirements of paragraph 4 are not met), the person elected at a general election to fill the remainder of the unexpired term takes office immediately upon qualification and serves until the term expires. See paragraph 3. Finally, if the vacancy occurs less than 90 days before the date of the primary election in the last year of the term, the person elected at the general election for the next term shall take office immediately upon qualification (as opposed to the next January 1), and fill the vacancy for the remainder of the unexpired term (and then begin his or her own term). See paragraph 9.  58   Under paragraph 10 of new subdivision (c) of Charter  10, when a nonpartisan election is held for succession (i.e., under paragraphs 4 or 5), and no candidate receives 40 percent or more of the vote, the two candidates receiving the most votes advance to a runoff election held approximately two weeks later. Such a runoff election may be appropriate since special elections tend to produce a crowded fi eld. Considering that the winner of this election will be mayor, he or she should be required to demonstrate a substantial level of support from the electorate . Moreover, such a runoff provision would be analogous to the Election Law, which requires runo ff elections for primary elections prior to general elections, for the offices of the Mayor, Comptroller and Public Advocate , in the event no candidate receives forty percent of the vote. Election Law  6 -162. Under sections three and four of the proposal, regarding Charter  24(e) and 44, the power to preside over the meetings of the Council is moved to the Speaker from the Public Advocate . As explained above, any change to the Charter's mayoral  succession provision implicates General City Law  2-a(1). Under this provision, where a city's mayor and the presiding officer of the local legislative body are elected at the same time for the same term by the voters of the entire city, the presiding officer of the legislative body, after a vacancy occurs in the mayoralty, becomes the mayor for the remainder of the unexpired term. Currently, the Public Advocate ""presides over"" the Council, Charter  24(e), and is elected at the same time as the Mayor, for the same term as the Mayor, by the voters of the entire City. Thus , the terms of Section 2-a(1) would seem to apply. However, the City's current mayoral succession provision,  Charter  10(b), is ""grandfathered"" as an exception to Section 2-a(1) by General City Law  2 -a(3)(b). 59   Because this exemption from application of the provisions of Section 2-a(1) arguably would not continue, however, after modification of any of the current mayoral succession provisions, the law requires that the Public Advocate's ceremonial right to ""preside"" over the Council be moved to another official, so that the terms of Section 2a(1) would not apply in the first place.27 Note that the Public Advocate's authority to introduce legislation in the Council would not be changed, nor would the Public Advocate's other powers be affected i n any way. The Speaker of the Council was selected to be the presiding officer in this proposal for two reasons: (1) The Speaker is the logical choice given his or her prominent operational role in the Council; and (2) The Speaker is not a Citywide elected official, unlike the Public Advocate, and thus he or she would not, in any event, qualify to succeed to the mayoralty under GCL  2 -a(1). Finally, section five of the proposal, regarding Charter  1152, provides an effective date for the amendments. B. Deferred Option: Deputy Mayor as Interim Successor and a Prompt Election is Required Subdivision b of section 10 of the New York city charter, as  Section one.  amended by local law number 19 for the year 1993, is amended to read as follows: b. In the case of [a failure of a person elected as mayor to qualify, or] a vacancy in the office of mayor caused by the mayor's resignation, removal, death or permanent inability to discharge the powers and duties of the office of mayor, such powers and 27  Under Charter  24(e), a major power of the Public Advocate that relates to the power to preside over the Council is the ability to break a tie vote. However, under Municipal Home Rule Law  20(1), passage of a local law requires a majority affirmative vote of the total voting power of the legislative body. See also Charter  34 (passage of local law or resolution requires majority affirmative vote of all the council members). Thus , 26 affirmative votes are needed in the Council to pass any local law. In light of this fact, a meaningful tie vote is extremely unlikely.  60   duties shall devolve upon [the public advocate,] a deputy mayor designated by the mayor before the commencement of such vacancy, the comptroller or a person selected pursuant to subdivision c of section twenty-eight, in that order of succession, until a new mayor shall be elected as provided herein. Designation of a deputy mayor pursuant to this subdivision shall be by executive order filed with the city clerk. In the case of a vacancy caused by a failure of a person elected as mayor to qualify, the powers and duties of the mayor shall devolve upon the comptroller, or a person selected pursuant to subdivision c of section twenty-eight, in that order of succession, until a new mayor shall be elected as provided herein. [If the vacancy shall occur before the twentieth day of September in any year, such vacancy shall be filled in the general election held in that year, otherwise it shall be filled in the general election held in the following year. The term of the person then elected mayor shall begin on January first after such election and shall expire on the date when the term of the mayor originally elected would have expired.] Upon the commencement of the term of the [thus] person first elected mayor pursuant to the provisions of subdivision c of this section, the [publi c advocate or the comptroller] person then acting as mayor pursuant to the provisions of this subdivision, if an elected official, shall complete the term of the office to which such person was elected if any remains.  2. Subdivision c of section 10 of t he New York city charter is re-lettered  subdivision d, and a new subdivision c is added to read as follows: c. 1. Within three days of the occurrence of a vacancy in the office of the mayor, the person acting as mayor shall proclaim the date for the election or elections required by this subdivision, provide notice of such proclamation to the city clerk and the board of  61   elections and publish notice thereof in the City Record. After the proclamation of the date for an election to be held pursuant to paragraphs four or five of this subdivision, the city clerk shall publish notice thereof not less than twice in each week preceding the date of such election in newspapers distributed within the city, and the board of elections shall mail notice of such election to all registered voters within the city. 2. If a vacancy occurs during the first three years of the term, a general election to fill the vacancy for the remainder of the unexpired term shall be held in the year in which the vacancy occurs, unless the vacancy occurs after the last day on which an occurring vacancy may be filled at the general election in that same year with party nominations of candidates for such election being made at a primary election, as provided in section 6-116 of the election law. If such a vacancy occurs in any year after such last day, it shall be filled for the remainder of the unexpired term at the general election in the following year provided, however, that no general election to fill a vacancy shall be held in the last year of the term, except as provided in paragraph nine of this subdivision. Party nominations of candidates for a general election to fill a vacancy for the remainder of the unexpired term shall be made at a primary election, except as provided in paragraph five of this subdivision. 3. If a special or general election to fill the vacancy on an interim basis has not been previously held pursuant to paragraphs four, six, seven and eight of this subdivision, the person elected to fill the vacancy for the remainder of the unexpired term at a general election shall take office immediately upon qualification and shall serve until the term expires. If a special or general election to fill the vacancy on an interim basis has been previously held, the person elected to fill the vacancy for the  62   remainder of the unexpired term at a general election shall take office on January first of the year following such general election and shall serve until the term expires. 4. If a vacancy occurs during the first three years of the term and on or before the last day in the third year of the term on which an occurring vacancy may be filled for the remainder of the unexpired term at a general election with party nominations of candidates for such election being made at a primary election, as provided in section 6116 of the election law, a special or general election to fill the vacancy on an interim basis shall be held, unless the vacancy occurs less than ninety days before the next primary election at which party nominations for a general election to fill the vacancy may be made and on or before the last day on which an occurring vacancy may be filled for the remainder of the unexpired term at the general election in the same year in which the vacancy occurs with party nominations of candidates for such election being made at a primary election, as provided in section 6 -116 of the election law. 5. If a vacancy occurs after the last day in the third year of the term on which an occurring vacancy may be filled for the remainder of the unexpired term at a general election in each year with party nominations of candidates for such election are being made at a primary election, as provided in section 6-116 of the election law, but not less than ninety days before the date of the primary election in the fourth year of such term, a special or general election to fill such vacancy for the remainder of the unexpired term shall be held. 6. Elections held pursuant to paragraph four or five of this subdivision shall be scheduled in the following manner: a special election to fill the vacancy shall be held on the first Tuesday at least sixty days after the occurrence of the vacancy, provided that the person acting as mayor, in the proclamation required by paragraph one of this 63   subdivision, may sche dule such election for another day not more than ten days after such Tuesday and not less than forty days after such proclamation if the person acting as mayor determines that such rescheduling is necessary to facilitate maximum voter participation; except that (a) if the vacancy occurs before September twentieth in any year and the first Tuesday at least sixty days after the occurrence of the vacancy is less than ninety days before a regularly scheduled general election or between a primary and a general election, the vacancy shall be filled at such general election; and (b) if the vacancy occurs before September twentieth in any year and the first Tuesday at least sixty days after the occurrence of the vacancy is after a regularly scheduled general electi on, the vacancy shall be filled at such general election; and (c) if the vacancy occurs on or after September twentieth in any year and the first Tuesday at least sixty days after the occurrence of the vacancy is after, but less than thirty days after, a regularly scheduled general election, the vacancy shall be filled at a special election to be held on the first Tuesday in December in such year. 7. All nominations for elections to fill vacancies held pursuant to paragraphs four and five of this subdivision shall be by independent nominating petition. A signature on an independent nominating petition made earlier than the date of the proclamation required by paragraph one of this subdivision shall not be counted. 8. A person elected to fill a vacancy in the office of the mayor at an election held pursuant to paragraph four of this subdivision shall take office immediately upon qualification and serve until December thirty- first of the year in which the vacancy is filled for the remainder of the unexpired term pursuant to paragraph two of this subdivision. A person elected to fill a vacancy in the office of the mayor at an election 64   held pursuant to paragraph five of this subdivision shall take office immediately upon qualification and serve until the term expires. 9. If a vacancy occurs less than ninety days before the date of the primary election in the last year of the term, the person elected at the general election in such year for the next succeeding term shall take office immediately upon qualification and fill the vacancy for the remainder of the unexpired term. 10. If at any election held pursuant to this subdivision for which nominations were made by independent nominating petitions, no candidate receives forty percent or more of the vote, the two candidates receiving the most votes shall advance to a runoff election which shall be held on the second Tuesday next succeeding the date on which such election was held. 11. If the person acting as mayor pursuant to the provisions of subdivision b of this section is a deputy mayor designated by the mayor, such deputy mayor shall not be qualified to be a candidate in any election held pursuant to paragraphs 2, 4, or 5 of this subdivision.  3. Subdivision e of section 24 of the New York city charter, as amended by  local law number 19 for the year 1993, is amended as follows: e. The public advocate [shall preside over the meetings of the council and]  shall have the right to participate in the discussion of the council but shall not have a vote [except in case of a tie].  4. Section 44 of the New York city charter, as amended by local law number  68 for the year 1993, is amended to read as follows:  65    44. Speaker. The council shall elect from among its members a speaker and such other officers as it deems appropriate. The speaker shall preside over the meetings of the council. During any period [when the public advocate is acting as mayor, or] when a vacancy exists in the office of the public advocate, the speaker shall act as public advocate pending the filling of the vacancy pursuant to subdivision c of section twentyfour, and shall be a member of every board of which the public advocate is a member by virtue of his or her office.  5. Section 1152 of the New York city charter is amended by adding a new  subdivision i to read as follows: i. 1. The amendments to the charter, amending sections ten, twenty- four,  and forty-four, approved by the electors on November fifth, two thousand two, shall take effect immediately, provided that any vacancy that occurs in the office of the mayor on or after September twentieth, two thousand two, and before the effective date of the amendments referenced in this subdivision, shall be governed by such amendments, and any such vacancy shall be deemed to have occurred on such effective date. 2. Notwithstanding the provisions of section 1153, in the event that the  amendment set forth in paragraph 10 of the new subdivision c of section 10 is finally adjudicated to be invalid or otherwise cannot be implemented, all of the amendments referenced in this subdivision shall be without any further force and effect and, at such time, sections ten, twenty- four, and forty-four as they existed immediately prior to the effective date of such amendments shall be reinstated and shall be deemed to have always remained in full force and effect and unamended by such amendments.  66   Discussion of Deferred Proposal In this approach, the changes in section one of the proposed changes, regarding Charter  10(b), not only eliminate the current election system for mayoral succession after the initial successor, but also change the initial successor from the Public Advocate to a deputy mayor. The rest of the line of succession (Comptroller, person chosen by the Council) is unchanged. The line of successio n is broken into two parts-- one in the event of a vacancy and one in the event that the person elected as mayor fails to qualify--because it would not make sense to have a deputy mayor succeed to the mayoralty when the mayor -elect did not qualify for office in the first place. The remainder of the proposed changes in this version are the same as in the first one, except for the addition of a new Charter  10(c)(11). Under paragraph 11, if the deputy mayor has initially succeeded to be the interim mayor, prior to any election, he or she may not run in any of the elections under Charter  10(c) to act as mayor on an interim basis or to fill out the remainder of the term. Such a provision prevents the deputy mayor from getting an unfair advantage in such an ele ction, so that elected officials and others who may wage a campaign to fill the vacancy will have a level playing field.  67   PART IV(B) Nonpartisan Elections This issue has been deferred by the Commission for consideration in another election cycle.  Issue: Should elections for City elective offices be conducted on a nonpartisan basis? Relevant Charter Provisions: While the Charter provides for nonpartisan special elections to fill vacancies in the offices of Public Advocate, Council member, Borough President, and Comptroller, Charter  24(c), 25(b), 81(e), 94(c), the Charter does not provide for nonpartisan elections to fill those offices, or the office of the Mayor, during the regular Citywide election cycle. Discussion: 1. Introduction The electoral process for City elective offices, like those for federal and state offices, is a partisan one ; candidates compete in party nominating elections and a candidate's party affiliation appears with his or her name on the ballot. Under a typical nonpartisan election system, candidates do not run in party nominating primaries and ballots do not denote a candidate's party affiliation. Instead, all candidates for a  particular office run together in a nonpartisan primary. Typically, the two candidates who receive the most votes in the primary advance to the general election. In considering whether to propose a system of nonpartisan elections, t he Commission has looked at the following issues: 68       Issue: Should elections for City elective office be conducted in a nonpartisan manner? Issue: If nonpartisan elections are appropriate for any City elective office, should they be held for all City elective offices, or only for some? Issue: If the Commission proposes nonpartisan elections, what should the effective date of the change be?  Arguments regarding nonpartisan elections made prior to this Commission's study As outlined by the Commission's staff in its August 6, 2002, report to the Commission, advocates of nonpartisan elections ha d identified several potential bene fits. First, candidates would be freer to offer voters competing ideologies and visions. Candidates would no longer be forced to tailor their positions to appeal mainly to the insiders within their own parties who tend to vote in primaries. Instead,  candidates would be challenged, from the outset of the campaign, to articulate a vision that resonates with a broad spectrum of voters. By having to appeal to the electorate as a whole, candidates would be forced to offer ideas on actual issues and problems likely to arise during their terms in office, rather than focusing on the more esoteric and ideological concerns of the vocal few who tend to vote in partisan primaries. Furthermore, adherents argue d that a nonpartisan system would create the opportunity for people from outside of a party's machinery to compete on a more equal footing with party insiders and loyalists. Many candidates' fates, especially in partisan primaries, hinge on whether they can successfully convince party insiders to support them. Newcomers, and people with careers outside of politics, often find it difficult to run for elective office because of their lack of access to party organizations. Adherents argue d that by controlling access to the ballot with an iron fist, the party bosses perform a far larger role in selecting the City's leaders than the voters themselves, making the  69   current system inaccessible to all but the chosen few. With real world example after example of backroom dealing, corruption and patronage, supporters argue d that nonpartisan elections are the only way to remove the system from the control of the party bosses, and produce elected officials chosen by the people for their ability rather than candidates selected by the party for their utility. ""Supporters of nonpartisan elections envision direct representation of citizens rather than indirect representation through party intermediaries. They seek to make local government more businesslike and less political. The ultimate goal is to create a more responsive and effective local government system."" 28  When coupled with the  City's voluntary campaign finance program, which provides public matching dollars to participating candidates, a nonpartisan system could allow far more people to compete and win. Moreover, nonpartisan elections, when combined the campaign finance  program, could allow people with more limited means to compete, whereas the current system often is hinged on party donations and fundraising. See Title 3, Chapter 7 of the Administrative Code of the City of New York. In particular, see Administrative Code  3705, the public financing section of the New York City Campaign Finance Act, which details the circumstances under which candidate may receive matching funds, including ""four - to-one"" matching fund s. 29  Opponents of nonpartisan elections, on the other hand, have argue d that partisan elections are necessary to a democratic system, because they force candidates to make commitments that result in political accountability, and they allow  28  ""Local Nonpartisan Elections, Political Parties and the First Amendment"" 87 Columbia Law Review 1677, 1679 (198 7). Id. 29 For a general discussion of spending by political parties in campaigns, see ""Party Favors: A Report of the New York City Campaign Finance Board"" (Jan. 1995).  70   voters to affiliate themselves with a cause. Opponents further questioned the impact of nonpartisan elections on voter turnout. In addition, opponents argue d that, in the  absence of party identification, nonpartisan elections may lead to ethnic block voting, because vote rs may have nothing but ethnic identity on which to base their vote. This concern is highlighted in races for less high profile offices, where voters may not have been sufficiently exposed to the candidates' messages. Finally, opponents argue d that the current system should not be changed at this time, when minorities are becoming a force within the parties, because the change might splinter minority voting power. Following the staff's August 6, 2002, presentation, the Commission received extensive commentary on whether the City should change to a system of nonpartisan elections. As described below, the Commission received comments from elected  officials and members of the public. In addition, the Commission received the benefit of testimony from a number of experts. 2. Background and History The use of nonpartisan elections has been considered in recent years by the 1998, 1999 and 2001 Charter Revision Commissions, which both studied the issue itself and received extensive public comment. 1998 Charter Revision Commission The 1998 Commission extensively examined the issue of nonpartisan elections. As part of its work, the Commission conducted an expert forum specifically on this issue. A summary of this forum is attached in Appendix E. The efforts of the 1998 Commission culminated in a comprehensive staff report. The report noted, among other things, that 60 of the 75 largest cities in the United States with an elected mayor use nonpartisan elections, including Los Angeles, 71   Houston, San Diego, Detroit, Dallas, Phoenix, San Antonio, San Francisco, Boston, and Seattle. In addition, the report noted that, in 1988, New York City adopted nonpartisan elections for special elections to fill vacancies in City elective offices other than the Mayor's office.30 Frank Mauro, Research Director for the 1988 Charter Revision  Commission, described the rationale: ""The purpose of the nonpartisan special election was to dilute the power of the party leaders and to make it easier for those not chosen by the leaders to qualify for the ballot."" 31  The 1998 Commission's staff report explored the potential benefits of nonpartisan elections. Statistical data revealed that nonpartisan elections foster  diversity, while partisan elections do the opposite. For example, the report exa mined data from the 48 largest American cities. In the 11 cities using partisan elections, only two had minority mayors. In comparison, of the 37 cities that used nonpartisan  elections, 15 had minority mayors. The 1998 staff report conducted a thorough analysis of the legality of establishing nonpartisan elections for citywide offices in New York City, focusing on considerations arising from the requirements of the New York State Election Law and the federal Voting Rights Act. The Commission staff concluded that cities in New York State are permitted, under the principles of home rule, to amend their charters in order to adopt nonpartisan elections. The 1998 Commission retained Professor Allan J. Lichtman, Chair of the Department of History at American University and an expert in voting rights, to conduct 30  The Charter provides for nonpartisan independent nominating petitions to fill vacancies in the offices of the Comptroller (Charter  94(c)(7)), Public Advocate (Charter  24(c)(7)), Council member (Charter  25(b)(7)), and Borough President (Charter  81(e)(7)). However, as discussed above, see footnote 17 ,the succession provision for Public Advocate has never been precleared. 31 The New York Times , July 11, 1990 at B2.  72   an analysis of whether the establishment of nonpartisan elections would violate the federal Voting Rights Act. Dr. Lichtman analyzed statistics concerning race, voting patterns, and election results. He concluded that the change from partisan to  nonpartisan elections would not violate the Act. As summarized in Appendix E , Dr. Lichtman testified that his statistical analysis showed that party identification is not necessary for minority candidates to b e elected. As to the mechanics of nonpartisan elections, the 1998 report explored various possibilities for the ballot layout, as well as solutions to the problem of conducting both partisan and nonpartisan elections on the City's older voting machines. 1999 Commission The 1999 Commission began its examination of the issue of nonpartisan elections by conducting a thorough review of the 1998 Commission's staff report. The 1999 Commission held an expert forum on election issues on August 6, 1999. Lawrence Mandelker, an election lawyer, had favorable views on nonpartisan elections, as did Dr. Lichtman, based on his research. Stanley Schlein, counsel to the State Assembly Election Law Commission, and Professor Robert Bailey of Rutgers University disagreed with nonpartisan elections. Dr. Bailey stated that party affiliation and race are the two main predictors of voting patterns. 32  He further stated that removing party affiliation would highlight race 33  as a factor in elections.  Dr. Bailey further explained tha t by removing party, ""you in a  32  Transcript of 1999 Charter Revision Commission Expert Forum, August 6, 1999 (""1999 Expert Forum Transcript"") at p. 114. 33 Id.  73   sense are eliminating one filter or one other umbrella identity that could mitigate some racial voting patterns in this city."" 34  Dr. Lichtman performed extensive statistical analysis of citywide elections within the City from 1989 through 1997. 35  He emphasized the uniqueness of the City's voting  patterns, and concluded that, in the primaries, blacks and Hispanics do not vote cohesively to form a single minority block. 36  Dr. Lichtman noted that the lack of minority cohesion in the City is significant because, as a result of the large number of white voters in the City's Democratic Party, minority cohesion is necessary to advance a minority candidate out of the partisan primary and into the general election. As a result, Dr. Lichtman concluded that  nonpartisan elections would even the playing field between whites and minorities in New York in regard to candidate selection, because a minority candidate would be more likely to advance to the general election. Stanley Schlein testifi ed that ""it still should be the right of parties to put forward candidates to run in primaries, to coalesce behind philosophical ideas... ."" 37  The 1999 Commission also received testimony about the practical difficulties that New York City would face if it were to implement nonpartisan elections. As in 1998, these difficulties primarily concerned New York City's older voting machines. Lawrence Mandelker pointed out some of the logistical issues that needed to be resolved in order to use New York's voting machi nes for nonpartisan elections.38 He noted that it could be problematic for a partisan primary election to be held 34 35 36 37 38  Id. Id. Id. Id. Id.  at at at at  pp. 121-122. pp. 11 8-143. p. 103. pp. 92 -94.  74   simultaneously with a nonpartisan election, because of the lockout mechanism used to ensure that primary voters vote in the primary for party in which they are registered. Mr. Mandelker proposed solutions such as buying new voting machines, requesting the Legislature's approval to conduct partisan and nonpartisan primaries on different days, or using paper ballots, an alternative he disfavored. 2001 Commission The 2001 Commission also considered the issue of nonpartisan elections for the Citywide offices of Mayor, Comptroller, and Public Advocate. The Commission's staff reviewed the work of the 1998 and 1999 Commissions on the issue. In addition, the Commission received public comment about nonpartisan elections. As set forth in its final report, the 2001 Commission decided to defer the issue of nonpartisan elections. Nonetheless, the Commission specifically noted the compelling testimony of candidates for City offices whose candidacies had been frustrated by partisan election procedures. The Commission further noted that while term limits and campaign finance reform had opened the door to election reform, party politics nonetheless controlled primary elections and the overall electoral process.  3. Legal Issues State law issues The City's authority to enact local legislation creating nonpartisan elections for local offices derives from Article IX of the New York State Constitution and Section 10 of the Municipal Home Rule Law (""MHRL""). 39  In Bareham v. City of Rochester, 246 N.Y.  39  Under MHRL  10(1), cities have the power to adopt local laws relating to the ""powers, duties, qualifications, number, [and] mode of selection . . . of its officers and employees ,"" provided that such local  75   140 (1927), the Court of Appeals considered whether Rochester had the authority, under the State's home rule provisions, to adopt nonpartisan elections in light of the inconsistent provisions of the Election Law. Although the Court struck down the  Rochester law at issue because of its technical failure to cite the Election Law provisions that were being superseded, it nonetheless held that cities in New York State possess the authority to establish nonpartisan election systems. 40  As discussed more fully below, several cities in New York State continued to use nonpartisan election schemes for some time after the decision in Bareham, including the cities of Sherrill and Watertown. The existence of these schemes strengthens the argument that New York City has the authority to create nonpartisan elections. Furthermore, although the Election Law has been recodified since the decision in Bareham, the Bareham analysis applies to the current Election Law. Election Law  1102 specifically states that ""[w]here a specific provision of law exists in any other law which is inconsistent with the provisions of this chapter, such provision shall apply unless a provision of [the Election Law] specifies that such provision of [the Election Law] shall apply notwithstanding any other provision of law."" There is no existing  provision of the Election Law that mandates partisan elections ""notwithstanding any other provision of law.""  law is not inconsistent with the State Constitution or any general State law, and provided that the State Legislature has not restricted the adoption of such a local law on a matter of State concern. See MHRL 10(1)(ii)(a)(1) (emphasis added). This provision derives directly from Article IX,  2(c), of the State Constitution. 40 The Court in Bareham acknowledged that Rochester would not have had the authority to pass a local law inconsistent with the Election Law had that State law been a ""general"" law, see MHRL 2(5) (general law is one that ""in terms and in effect applies alike"" to, for example, all cities within the State), but noted that, on its face, the Election Law was instead a ""special"" law, with which a properly enacted local law could be inconsistent. See MHRL 2(12) (special law is one which ""in terms and in effect"" applies to, for example, one or more, but not all cities within the State).  76   In 1991, New York City's authority to adopt nonpartisan elections in its Charter was explicitly recognized in City of New York v. New York City Board of Elections , Index No.41450/91 (Sup. Ct., New York Co.), aff'd, __ A.D. 2d __, (1st Dept. ), lv. app. den. , 77 N.Y.2d 938 (1991). That case concerned the validity of Charter  25(b)(7), the nonpartisan special election provision for City Council vacancies that was added by the 1988 Commission. In that case, the Board of Elections, despite the new Charter  amend ment, accepted the party nomination of a candidate and attempted to place that candidate's name and party affiliation on the ballot in a special election to fill a Council vacancy. The Board of Elections claimed that Election Law  6-114, which provides that party nominations for an office to be filled at a special election be made in accordance with party rules, preempted the Charter. Relying on Bareham , MHRL  10, and Election Law  1-102, the Court ruled that New York City had the right to adopt nonpartisan elections in its Charter, notwithstanding the Election Law. Specifically, the Court held that although the Election Law allowed party labels in elections, ""the Election Law gives way to inconsistent local law provisions."" unanimously by the Appellate Division, First Department. Indeed, local authority to implement nonpartisan elections for local offices, as identified in Bareham, has never been compromised by the Legislature's enactment of a general law or an explicitly restrictive special law. Thus, the Election Law may be reasonably construed only to set forth the framework for governing partisan elections for those cities that choose to use them. In light of Bareham and City of New York , it appears clear that cities in New York State possess the home rule authority to adopt nonpartisan elections by amending their charters. See also Steinberg v. Meisser, 291 N.Y. 685 (1943) (upholding the denial of 77 This decision was affirmed   an injunction against the City of Long Beach placing before the voters a proposed local law amending its charter to provide, inter alia, for nonpartisan elections for City Council). Description of Nonpartisan Elections in New York State Nonpartisan election systems have in existed in New York State for over 80 years. For examp le, in addition to Rochester, the cities of Sherrill and Watertown have had nonpartisan elections since 1916 and 1920, respectively. 41  As discussed above, Rochester attempted to institute nonpartisan elections for its Citywide officers by local law, but its legislation was struck down in Bareham because of the law's failure to cite the provisions of the Election Law that were to be superseded. Following the decision in Bareham , in 1929, Rochester again instituted nonpartisan elections by local law, but this time the law contained the required list of superseded Election Law sections. 42  The City of Sherrill's nonpartisan primary system was instituted by the State Legislature in 1916. 43  In creating this scheme, the Legislature effectively superseded 44  various pro visions of the then-applicable Election Law as it applied to Sherrill.  At its  most basic, Sherrill's system of nonpartisan elections modified the method by which a candidate qualified for the general election. While the Election Law at that time  41  Other cities in New York that have had nonpartisan primary elections at some point in their history include Buffalo, Saratoga Springs, Long Beach, Jamestown, Mechanicville, Auburn, New Rochelle, Rome, and Batavia. 42 The sections of the then- existing Election Law superseded by Rochester's law were: 83 (lists of nominations); 84 (publication by Board of Election of nomination lists); 89 (poll-books); 102 (placing names on ballot); 103 (order of names on ballot); 104, 105, 108, 119, 249, 268 (official ballots); 131 (party nominations); 135, 136 (designating petitions); 137 (independent nominations); 138 (declination of designation or nomination); 139 (filling vacancies in designations and nominations); 140 (times for filing petitions and certificates for holding conventions); 156 (additional meetings for registration); 157 (registration for other than general elections); 204 (challenges at primary elections); 212 (proceedings of inspectors at close of polls); 213, 270 (canvassing vote); 217 (tallying votes); 233 (proclamation of results). 43 Laws of 1916, Chapter 172. 44 In 1985, the Election Law was reenacted into its current form.  78   provided that the candidate who received the most votes in each party's primary proceeded to the general election, see then-effective Election Law  89, Sherrill's nonpartisan system mandated that the two candidates who received the most votes at the nonpartisan primary would run in the general election, regardless of party. 45  The City of Watertown's nonpartisan primary system was instituted by the State Legislature in 1920.46 Like for Sherrill, the Legislature effectively superseded various provisions of the Election Law as it applied to Watertown. 47  The Legislature amended Watertown's nonpartisan election system in 1993,48 but the basic structure of nonpartisan primary elections remained the same. The  amendments merely conformed Watertown's system to certain admini strative requirements of the Election Law and addressed certain administrative details. 49  As  amended in 1993, Watertown's legislation effectively superseded various provisions of the modern Election Law. 50  45  Sherrill's legislation varied from numerous sections of the 1916 Election Law. See, e.g. , Sections 3 (definition of a primary election); 48 (process to choose candidates for primary election); 49 (filing declaration of candidacy); 58 (party affiliation on ballot); and 79 (when election supplies are to be delivered). 46 Laws of 1920, Chapter 276. 47 Watertown's 1920 legislation varied from numerous sections of the then-applicable Election Law. See, e.g. , 3 (defining primary as a party-based election); 74 (designation of polling places in accordance with political parties); 79 (number of ballots to be provided at election); 89 (two candidates receiving most votes at primary proceed to general election); and 122 (independent nominating petitions). 48 Laws of 1993, Chapter 247. 49 These administrative requirements addressed issues such as the filing and sufficiency of petitions; primary dates; revision and correction of registers of voters; the quality, weight, size, etc., of ballots; and the general conduct and canvassing of elections. The amendments also addressed details regarding the binding of petitions, the equipment to be furnished to the polling locations, the movement of voters between election districts, write-in candidates, and the conduct of general elections. 50 Watertown's legislation varies from the following sections of the Election Law as it existed in 1993: 1104 (defining a primary as a party-based election); 2 120 (statement of party positions to be filled at primary); 4- 118 (p arty designation on notices of primary election); 6-119 and 6-132 (designating petition to include party); 6- 128 (first nominations for new party); 6- 136 (designation of candidates for primary); 6138, 6-140, and 6-142 (independent nominating petitions); 6 156 (certificates of nomination to include party designations); 6-158 (filing of certificate of acceptance or declination of candidacy); 7-104, 7-106, 7114 (party designations on ballots); 9- 200 (selection of candidates to run at general election); and 9-210 (statements of canvassing results to include political parties).  79   Federal Voting Rights Act A change to nonpartisan elections could arguably be considered a change in a ""standard, practice, or procedure with respect to voting."" Such a change could require the City to seek preclearance from the Justice Department pursuant to the Voting Rights Act. Under the Voting Rights Act, a State or political subdivision may not impose a ""standard, practice, or procedure . . . which results in a denial or abridgement of the right of any citizen of the United States to vote on account of race or color . . . ."" 42 U.S.C.  1973(a). In establishing whether such an abridgement has occurred, one must determine whether, ""under the totality of circumstances, it is shown that the political processes leading to nomination or election in the State or political subdivision are not equally open to participation by members of a [protected] class [i.e., race or color] in that its members have less opportunity than other members of the electorate to participate in the political process and to elect representatives of their choice."" 42 U.S.C.  1973(b). Whenever the City seeks, in general, to change a ""standard, practice, or procedure with respect to voting,"" it seeks preclearance from the Justice Department as to whether the change will have the effect of denying or abridging the right to vote on account of race or color. 42 U.S.C.  1973c. The change may not take effect until the City receives preclearance. Id. When preclearance is sought from the Justice  Department, the change may take effect if ""the Attorney General has not interposed an objection within sixty days after such submission, or upon good cause shown, to  80   facilitate an expedited approval within sixty days after such submission, the Attorney General has affirmatively indicated that such objection will not be made."" Id. As to preclearance of a change such as one to nonpartisan elections, which would require approval by referendum, see Municipal Home Rule Law 23(d), Charter 38(3), the Department of Justice has set forth instructions regarding the timing of such preclearance. Under 28 C.F.R.  51.22, entitled, ""Premature submissions,"" The Attorney General will not consider on the merits: (a) any proposal for a change affecting voting submitted prior to final enactment or administrative decision or (b) any proposed change which has a direct bearing on another change affecting voting which has not received Section 5 preclearance. However, with respect to a change for which approval by referendum, a State or Federal court or a Federal agency is required, the Attorney General may make a dete rmination concerning the change prior to such approval if the change is not subject to alteration in the final approving action and if all other action necessary for approval has been taken. Thus the Justice Department could, but would not be required to, consider for preclearance any change to the Charter's mayoral succession provisions prior to approval by the voters at referendum. As stated above, Dr. Lichtman, the expert on voting rights for the 1998 and 1999 Commissions, concluded that a change to nonp artisan elections for Citywide offices would not violate the Voting Rights Act. Dr. Lichtman's 1998 statistical analysis showed that party identification is not necessary for minority candidates to be elected. This Commission retained Dr. Lichtman to conduct a new Voting Rights Act analysis. As described below, Dr. Lichtman has again concluded that a change to nonpartisan elections for Citywide offices would not violate the Voting Rights Act. Dr. Susan Welch, the Dean of the College of Liberal Arts and a professor of political science at  81   Pennsylvania State University, was also retained by the Commission, for the purpose of examining Dr. Lichtman's analysis. She agreed with this conclusion.51 Dr. Lichtman has also concluded that a change to nonpartisan elections for Borough Presidents and City Council members would not violate the Voting Rights Act. 4. Policy Considerations Use throughout the United States Nonpartisan elections are used by the overwhelming majority of municipalities across the nation, including Los Angeles, Chicago, Houston, San Diego, Detroit, Dallas, Phoenix, San Antonio, San Francisco, Boston, and Seattle. Attached in Appendix E is a chart that identifying the type of election system used in the 50 largest cities in the United States, their mayors and the mayors' ethnicity over the last decade, and whether those cities use runoff elections. According to the U.S. Conference of Mayors, as of the 2000 census, 41 of the nation's 50 largest cities elected their mayors using nonpartisan elections. Of those 41 cities, 34 percent elected black or Hispanic mayors. Of the nine cities that used partisan elections, only two cities (22 percent) elected a black or Hispanic mayor. Attached in Appendix E is a chart of 2000 Census data for the 50 largest cities. A chart summarizing these race statistics is attached in Appendix E. According to data from the National Conference of Black Mayors, based on U.S. Census Bureau data, 41 cities in the United States with populations of 50,000 or more have black mayors. Of the mayors in these 41 cities, 30 were elected through  nonpartisan elections, while 11 were elected with partisan elections, a difference of almost three to one (73% in cities with nonpartisan elections compared to 27% in cities  51  As described below, Dr. Welch stated other concerns that political scientists would have about a change to nonpartisan elections.  82   with partisan elections). A chart listing details of these 41 cities is attached in Appendix E. Arguments in favor of nonpartisan elections The Commission received extensive comments from elected officials and the public both for and against nonpartisan elections. These comments are summarized below and in detail in Appendix A (summary of comments from elected officials). Appendix B (the summary of public proposals) also has, among other things, a summary of comments related to nonpartisan elections. Elected officials who supported nonpartisan elections cited their own ability to be elected without party support as evidence that partisan elections were unnecessary. Some officials identified the  unwillingness of certain minorities to belong to political parties as proof that voter participation would increase with nonpartisan elections. Certain officials expressed the opinion that nonpartisan elections would elevate the quality of the candidates and electoral debate, and that nonpartisan elections would increase access to the ballot. Another sentiment in favor of nonpartisan elections was that persons elected through the nonpartisan process would feel accountable to their constituencies, as opposed to partisan elected officials who are accountable to the party that helped them get elected. The concern was also expressed that incumbent elected officials oppose nonpartisan elections because they want to maintain the status quo. Members of the public supporting nonpartisan elections expressed the belief that such electi ons would limit the power of political parties to control who actually is able to become a candidate for office. Some speakers recounted their own attempts to run for office, emphasizing that they spent an inordinate amount of time gathering signatures  83   and in court, defending themselves against challenges brought by party lawyers in efforts to keep them off the ballot. Some speakers indicated that a nonpartisan system would better represent the true preferences of voters because, under the current primary system, candidates with the broadest appeal may not have the opportunity to actually run for office. According to some speakers, this problem was particularly acute in New York City, where there is one dominant party and the outcome of the elections is often effectively decided in the primary. It was noted that the current party-driven process compels unions, PAC's, and other organizations to back the party hierarchy's candidate. Failure to do so risks incurring the wrath of the hierarchy, which can retali ate by thwarting or delaying the legislative and funding priorities of these organization's constituencies. In a similar  vein, speakers suggested that nonpartisan elections, by diminishing the power of the party bosses, would increase the diversity of ca ndidates and allow more minority participation. Some speakers cited the fact that large cities with nonpartisan elections have been more successful in electing minority mayors than cities with partisan mayoral elections. Some speakers noted that a nonpartisan system would enable voters to focus on the ideas and qualifications of candidates, rather than solely on a party label. Speakers stated that they believed that, with a nonpartisan system, candidates would be more accountable to the public rather than to a party machine. The Commission also heard testimony that a nonpartisan system would improve the performance of government in that it would create a system that is more open and fair and less subject to corruption by political parties.  84   The comments received by this Commission built on prior testimony and analysis of nonpartisan elections. As outlined in the staff's August 6, 2002, report, supporters of nonpartisan elections have argue d that such elections produce a system aimed at allowing citizens to seek elected office directly without first having to win approval from local party bosses. Nonpartisan elections have been seen as having the benefit of forcing candidates to address issues facing the population as a whole, rather than the narrow group of insiders who tend to vote in partisan primaries, and offering an opportunity for candidates whose positions may not fit with the party machines. Potential candidates who might not otherwise run for office would have the opportunity to do so without modifying their beliefs. 52  Instituting a system of nonpartisan elections could mean an end to a system where only candidates approved by the party system and with views that do not offend the party leaders receive the financial support often necessary to mount an effective campaign. When coupled with the City's voluntary campaign finance program,  nonpartisan elections could widen the electoral field to a broader group of candidates, and offer voters more choices in their leaders and policies. This point was discussed by NYU researcher Francis Barry at the August 20, 2002 expert briefing on Staten Island. See below. Nonpartisan elections also could encourage diversity of candidates. The  analysis performed by the 1998 Commission, and the statistics discussed above,  52  See generally ""Local Nonpartisan Elections, Political Parties and the First Amendment,"" cited in footnote 1, at p. 1679 (""[N]onpartisan systems give qualified candidates of the minority party or independents a better chance to succeed. These systems...permit voters to analyze local issues independently on their merits and to focus on the intelligence and experience of the candidates themselves rather than on their political affiliations."") (citations omitted)  85   indicate that minority group candidates in cities with nonpartisan elections have outperformed minority group candidates in cities with partisan elections. Nonpartisan elections may also increase minority voter turnout. The 2001  Commission heard testimony regarding the need for nonpartisan elections, particularly for City Council positions, in order to increase minority voter participation, because such elections would help counter the perception that minority needs were not met by nominees selected through a partisan process. 53  Supporters of nonpartisan elections also argue that since City government is mainly operational, as opposed to ideological, the value of the party banner and the ideals it represents is minimal at best. Arguments against nonpartisan elections The Commission received testimony from elected officials and the public against nonpartisan elections. Elected officials opposing nonpartisan elections expressed the concern that voters would be less aware of candidates' positions, since part y affiliation sends a message about the issues to the voters. They were also concerned that  53  According to Michelle McCleary, a candidate for the City Council in the 9 District, ""In a one party borough like Manhattan, the winner of the Democratic primary is the winner of the elections. So our elected officials are chosen by a very small percentage of eligible voters. ...This leads to elected officials who are more responsive to the Democratic Party than to the voters. It also tends to discourage many talented members of [the African-American] community from running for public office. And it turns our young people away from the electoral process altogether. The voter turnout among African-American youth ranges between the single digits and the teens."" Transcript, Aug. 15, 2001, at pp. 9-11. Similarly, Alex Cox, a candidate for the City Council in the 7 District, stated, ""In the Harlem community where I am running, for example, as in many black communities across the country, young black voters are increasingly choosing to not identify themselves with a party label. A recent poll conducted by the Joint Center for Political and Economic studies found that 42.6 % of AfricanAmericans between the ages of 18- 25 view themselves as politically independent. Young black voters ' interests are not represented in a partisan election where a local Democratic party machine dominates. This is particularly troubling in a district like mine because it mea ns that more and more potential voters will become disillusioned with the voting process and pull out altogether. In 1999, only 20% of eligible voters cast their ballots for a City Council candidate."" Transcript, Aug. 15, 2001, at pp. 11- 12. th  th  86   nonpartisan elections would favor incumbents and the wealthy because lower income candidates could not raise enough money to run without the support of established political parties. Minority communities and candidates could thus be hurt because of the loss of funding and, in the opinion of some, because minority candidates who had started to establish themselves through the party system would lose the advantages they had earned. Certain officials believed that the election of Republicans in the most recent mayoral elections indicated that the process was working well. Some believed in general that the current system was functioning properly and that there was the refore no benefit to altering it. Concern was also expressed that instituting nonpartisan  elections might violate the federal Voting Rights Act. Conflicting studies were cited concerning whether nonpartisan elections would increase voter turnout or minority participation. Concern was expressed that new voting machines would be required to conduct partisan and nonpartisan elections at the same time. Members of the public opposing nonpartisan elections focused not only on the substance of the issue but als o on the process of study undertaken by this Commission. The prime criticism centered on the time frame for review, as well as on the fact that the hearings were being held over the summer when some people would be on vacation. Many speakers commented that the Commission should not propose a change to nonpartisan elections this year, and should study the matter further. Concerns were raised that there would be an insufficient amount of time for voters to be educated on this topic. On the merits, several speakers expressed the belief that a change to nonpartisan elections would result in voter confusion. Speakers commented that,  because candidates would not be identified as being members of a particular political 87   party, voters would not know what a candidate stood for. Another concern raised was the impact of nonpartisan elections on minority candidates. Speakers were concerned that nonpartisan elections would benefit wealthy candidates who could afford to make themselves known and gain media exposure. Some speakers also feared that  nonpartisan elections would result in lower voter turnout because, without party affiliation, voters would be less aware of particular candidates (except those with wealth and thus exposure to the media), and would therefore be less interested in the elections. Members of the public commented that we have now reached a point where minorities have had success within the Democratic Party, and that a change to nonpartisan elections would serve to undo this success. Others questione d whether a change to nonpartisan elections would violate the Voting Rights Act. New York's long history of partisan elections and of political parties was also raised as a reason to not change to nonpartisan elections. Finally, the concern was expressed that the City's voting machines would not be capable of handling nonpartisan elections. The comments received by this Commission built on prior testimony and analysis of nonpartisan elections. As outlined in the staff's August 6, 2002, report, opponents of nonpartisan elections have argue d that such elections frustrate democracy and lead to political gridlock. 54  ""Part[y politics] force candidates to make choices, take stands, and  make commitments to groups of people with long collective memories and high collective standards."" 55  As one writer notes:  54 55  See July 29, 1998 Forum on Nonpartisan Citywide Elections, at p. 71. Susan Reefer, ""No to Nonpartisan Elections, available elections/jun.02.shtml.  at  www.gothamgazette.com/  88   What do politicians do? They get up meetings, circulate handbills and pamphlets, blaze away in the newspapers, send ships about the streets on wheels with flags and sailors, and send conveyances all over town, with handbills, to bring people to the polls  all to gain attention to their cause and elect their candidate. All these are these are their measures,"" and for their end they are wisely calculated. The object is to get up an excitement, and bring the people out.56 It is argued that the party system gives voters a chance to affiliate themselves with a cause; and that cause, is bigger than any candidate could be."" 57  Opponents have also argue d that nonpartisan elections discourage informed citizen participation. They argue that when party labels for the City's highest offices are removed, it disadvantages vast numbers of voters and deprives them of the historical perspective needed to project the nature of an administration. 58  This could harm those  with low income and low education who have strong party identification. Loss of party identity is believed to make it more difficult for the voters to keep track of candidates. 59  According to opponents, a person in a partisan system who lacks personal wealth can re ly on party or organizational support not only to start campaigning, but also to move up the political ladder. Nonpartisan elections would give advantages to  persons with personal wealth or with close ties to persons and institutions with great wealth. 60  56  See Jeff Pasley, Party Politics, Citizenship, and Collective Action in Nineteenth Century America: A Response to Stuart Blumin and Michael Schudson (""Party Politics"") available at www.mtsu.edu/~seig/pdf/pdf_response_pasley.pdf. 57 See Reefer, ""No to Nonpartisan Elections,"" available at www. gotham gazette.com/elections/ june.02.shtml. 58 See July 29, 1998 Forum on Nonpartisan Citywide Elections, at p. 90. 59 Id. at p. 70. 60 Id. at p. 91.  89   Finally, opponents have argue d that nonpartisan elections encourage extremism and discourage moderation. 61  Opponents also argue that voter turnout may decline  with nonpartisan elections because a lack of party identification could make it more difficult for voters to keep track of candidates. Expert testimony As summarized in Appendix C, the Commission received extensive expert opinion on the issue of nonpartisan elections. Much of that opinion was from Dr. Lichtman, who was retained by the Commission to study whether a change to nonpartisan elections for City elective offices would violate the Voting Rights Act. His analysis for the Commission expanded upon the work that he performed for the 1999 Charter Revision Commission. Based on his analysis of electoral results and of partisan and nonpartisan electoral systems in the nation's 100 largest cities, 82 percent of which have nonpartisan mayoral elections, Dr. Lichtman concluded that nonpartisan elections are not an impediment to the election of mayors fro m members of minority demographic groups. Twenty-seven percent of cities with nonpartisan systems (including 62  approximately 18 percent with white majorities) have African-American or Hispanic mayors, while only 22 percent of those with partisan elections h ave minority mayors, none of them in any of the 11 cities with white majorities. Controlling statistically for the demographics of cities, the slight lead in terms of minority mayors for nonpartisan elections systems widens quite substantially. Lichtman stated that these results hold up over time.  61 62  Id. at p. 92. Id. at p. 72.  90   Dr. Lichtman's analysis indicated that voter turnout is not reduced after the institution of nonpartisan elections, but rather that voter turnout tends to be low in municipal elections that do not occur simultaneously with elections for higher office such as governor or president. Minority turnout is generally higher for such elections, and voting in general is higher for higher offices. Thus elections that produce greater  turnout do not necessarily translate i nto more votes cast in lower municipal contests. Dr. Lichtman also concluded that citywide elections and voting within the City shows that standard explanations for how partisan elections might help minority voters elect candidates of their choice do not apply to citywide elections in New York City for multiple reasons. For example, there is a big fall-off from the primary to the general election not for white Democrats but for minority voters whose candidate is defeated in the primary. Additionally, the phenomena of minorities being able to dominate  Democratic primaries and of major differences between minority and white voting strengths in Democratic primaries and general elections do not apply in the City, perhaps because of the diversity of significant minority populations in New York City and the failure of minority voters to coalesce in support of candidates from other minority groups. Dr. Lichtman found that a change from partisan to nonpartisan elections of citywide officials in New York City might enhance the prospects for minority candidates or voters to compete in elections for citywide offices because, under a nonpartisan system, two candidates from the field, rather than one candidate from each partygenerally white candidates--advance to the ge neral election. Finally, Dr. Lichtman found that a change from partisan to nonpartisan elections for Borough President and City Council elections would not violate the Voting Rights 91   Act, because it would not produce a retrogression of minority opportunities to participate fully in the political process and elect candidates of their choice. Dr. Susan Welch, who was also retained by the Commission to help its study of nonpartisan elections, submitted written testimony dated August 22, 2002. Dr. Welch was retained to review Dr. Lichtman's current analysis. She analyzed his conclusions regarding the effect of a change to nonpartisan mayoral elections. Dr. Welch agreed with Dr. Lichtman's conclusion that ""nonpartisanship does not violate the Voting Rights Act,"" and stated that ""[i]t would be hard to argue a race bias in its voter impact."" Dr. Welch further noted that Dr. Lichtman's conclusions agreed with previous findings ""that neither type of election [partisan or nonpartisan] facilitates or hinders the election of African-American mayors (or Latino mayors either)."" Apart from Voting Rights Act considerations, however, Dr. Welch expressed that nonpartisan elections could have adverse impacts. According to Dr. Welch, political science research has shown that political parties play an important role in ""linking people to the political system,"" by increasing participation, providing information to voters, and promoting accountability. Francis Barry, from the New York University Taub Urban Research Center, described the development of the debate over nonpartisan elections, concluding that the current literature has undermined old concerns that nonpartisan elections advantage Republicans, depress turnout, and favor incumbents. He stated that New York may be uniquely well-suited to hold nonpartisan elections because of three recent reforms: the campaign finance system, which provides public money to candidates, thus reducing reliance on party funds and better equalizing funding available to each candidate; the Vote r Guide, which is mailed to every household with a registered voter and provides 92   information in a low-cost manner to enable voters to distinguish between candidates without the help of party labels; and term limits, which weaken the power of incumbency. Barry suggested that the City's campaign finance system strengthens  challengers and its term limits law weakens the power of incumbency, and that together they would significantly diminish any advantage that might accrues to incumbents under nonpartisan ele ctions. Although Richard Flanagan, Professor of Political Science at the College of Staten Island, agreed with Mr. Barry that studies about the impact of nonpartisan elections were inconclusive, he did believe that such elections could increase competitive ness in New York City, because of the high ratio of Democrats to Republicans in the City. Clayton Gillette, a Professor of Law at New York University Law School, approved of party affiliation as a proxy for voter knowledge of individual positions, but he warned that political parties may not focus on the concerns of the City electorate in selecting candidates for local office. Nonpartisan elections could thus have the benefit of advancing candidates who were well qualified for municipal office although not necessarily in line with national party positions, as well as breaking party dominance in a particular locality. He also opined that introducing nonpartisan elections would not eliminate the role of political parties, which would continue to support particular candidates. Elected officials of three jurisdictions that hold nonpartisan elections also testified about their experience. They were Bill McKoy, President of the Paterson, New Jersey City Council; Gus Garcia, Mayor of Austin, Texas; and Glenda Hood, the first woman to be elected Mayor of Orlando, Florida. In the last five years, Paterson elected its first 93   African-American and Hispanic mayors. Mr. McKoy believed that nonpartisan elections and a relatively low signature requirement render access to the ballot easier. A range of nonprofit organizations have sponsored public forums for candidates, broadening involvement in the political process, while political parties have remained somewhat involved in funding. In Austin, nonpartisan elections have successfully contributed to the election of minority candidates to various positions, although voter turnout is greater when there is a statewide or national election as well, and can be depressed when nonpartisan elections take place on different dates f rom the party elections. Nonpartisan elections have resulted in a large number of candidates getting on the ballot, leading to the election of many minority candidates. Mayor Hood testified that nonpartisan elections allow public officials to make good p ublic policy and remain focused on the issues without disruptive interference from political parties. She  believed that nonpartisan elections also permit neighborhoods and businesses to be more involved in the political process and to develop valuable alliances with one another and with nonprofits. Minority candidates have achieved success throughout Florida, whose municipalities all have nonpartisan elections except for Jacksonville.  Ballot and voting machine issues A. The 1998 Commission The 1998 Commission identified a number of practical problems with conducting nonpartisan elections, particularly problems relating to the ballots and voting machines. The 1999 and 2001 Commissions identified the same issues. As to the form of the ballot, the 1998 Commission noted that, pursuant to Election Law  7-104(5), the names of candidates of a particular party must appear on 94   voting machines in the same column or row containing generally the names of candidates of such party, 63  and that, generally, the ballots as they appear on the voting  machines already face space limitations. The Commission proposed several options as to how to structure ballots so that they could accommodate nonpartisan and partisan elections, and still meet these constraints. These options included the use of a  bifurcated ballot, double column bifurcation, or use of the final column. Attached in Appendix E is the 1998 Commission's description of these options. Regarding the voting machines themselves, the 1998 Commission noted that, as a practical matter, it is more difficult to conduct a nonpartisan primary than it is to conduct the general election following such a primary, because of the presence of a ""lockout"" mechanism on each voting machine. Where nonpartisan and partisan  primaries are being held simultaneously, all registered voters must be allowed to vote in the nonpartisan elections, while only voters registered for a particular party may be allowed to vote in that party's primaries. That Commission noted that the City's voting machines have a lockout mechanism that prevents a voter who is not the member of a particular party from voting for candidates of that party; when a voter enters the booth, the inspector flips a switch that allows the voter to select candidates from his or her party. While the 1998 Commission recognized that the City did not have a sufficient number of voting machines to devote some to nonpartisan primaries and others to partisan primaries, it believed that there were other viable solutions using the existing machines. For example, the Commission identified setting a separate nonpartisan  63  Election Law  1- 104(3) defines a ""party"" as a ""any political organization which at the last proceeding election for governor polled at least fifty thousand votes for its candidate for governor.""  95   primary date, using paper ballots, and using electronic voting machines as potential solutions to the lockout problem. It is also true that elections for City officials do not occur in the same year as State or federal elections, a fact that would tend to minimize the voting machine problem. For example, the 2003 elections will primarily be for elections to the City Council; there are no State or federal elections scheduled for next year. B. Electronic voting machines Federal legislation: Legislation is now pending in Congress to assist state and local governments nationwide in an effort to upgrade voting machines. The Senate bill, known as The Bipartisan Election Reform Bill (S. 565), will, among other things, provide $3.5 billion through grants to states and localities to improve voting systems. The  sponsors of the legislation in the Senate estimate that $3.5 billion will enable every locality in the nation to upgrade every voting machine, replacing older machinery with state of the art technology. These grants would be an 80%-20% federal-state match. Regardless of whether a state or locality uses the grant, states would have an obligation under the bill to meet certain standards regarding the quality of their voting systems. For example, by 2006 states must have voting systems in place that allow voters to verify their votes and to correct them before the votes are cast. The voting system must also conform to the error standards issued by the Federal Election Commission. The Senate bill mandates that, by 2004, states must be able to permit a voter who appears at the polls on election day to vote provisionally, even if there is no registration on file or it is alleged that the voter is ineligible.  96   This bill, and one passed by the House, are currently before a conference committee, and is expected to pass the full Congress in September. President Bush has already said he will sign the legislation. New York State Task Force on Electronic Modernization: In February 2001, Governor Pataki signed an executive order creating the New York State Task Force on Election Modernization, a bipartisan panel charged with examining methods for conducting and administering elections and making recommendations designed to ensure the accuracy and fairness of elections held throughout the State.64 The sevenmember task force issued its final report to the Governor on June 18, 2002.65 The report contains 64 recommendations and calls for dramatic reforms to modernize the State's election processes. The report recommends that each local board of elections, in consultation with the State Board, develop a plan, due by June 30, 2003, to gradually transition to full accessible electronic voting equipment , with a goal of substantial implementation in time for the 2004 presidential election. According to the report, the plans should include strategies for maintaining existing equipment during the transition, comprehensive voter outreach, and education and training of election personnel. Over the next several years, modernizing the State's voting systems and election process is expected to require more than $200 million in new resources and will require a federal, State and local partnership. Under the federal legislation currently pending before Congress, New York may be eligible for more than $135 million over the next several years to replace its voting machines and modernize its elections process. The report recommends that  64 65  www.state.ny.us/governor/electionmodernization. www.state.ny.us/governor/electionmodernization/PDFS/nystaskforce.pdf.  97   the State create an Election Modernization Capital Fund to leverage anticipated federal assistance.66 The report also recommends amending State law to allow the use in New York State of voting technologies that do not use full -face ballots, that is, where a full ballot is displayed on a single surface. full -face ballot. 68 67  New York State is one of only two states to require a  C. Other Practical Considerations The staff conveyed to the Commission its understanding that, if nonpartisan elections were adopted for the City, resources to procure new voting machines would be made available for implementing such a change. In addition, the staff compiled statistics relating to various voting machine issues.  Draft Charter Provisions: This section contains a draft Charter chapter instituting nonpartisan elections for City elective offices. The draft is followed by a discussion of the provisions. 1. Draft Nonpartisan Elections Chapter  Section one. The New York city charter is amended by adding a new chapter three to read as follows:  66  The City's Board of Elections developed a plan for an electronic voting system more than a decade ago, and entered into a contract for that system's development and implementation in 1993. A dispute arose, however, with a subcontractor developing some of the necessary software. The dispute led to a lawsuit, which was settled in only in the past few years. No contract is currently in place for electronic voting machines or an electronic voting system. 67 See 9 N.Y.C.R.R.  6209.2. 68 Id. at pp. 18 -29.  98   CHAPTER 3 ELECTION TO CITY OFFICE  60.

The persons named in such certificates shall be the persons nominated for such offices, respectively.  67. Vacancies; nomination. Vacancies in nominations made at the  nonpartisan election primary caused by death or disqualification or by declination authorized by section sixty- three shall be filled by the candidate or candidates who received the next largest number of votes at the nonpartisan election primary and who file with the board of elections a written consent to be nominated, duly acknowledged, not later than ten days after such death or disqualification, or four days before the election, whichever is earlier. If such candidate fails to file such cons ent, or files a duly acknowledged declination, within such period, then the candidate receiving the next largest number of votes who files such written consent within the time specified in the preceding sentence will fill the nomination vacancy. No vacanc y in a nomination may be filled pursuant to this subdivision where prohibited by section 6-150 of the election law. In the event that a vacancy in the nomination is filled in accordance with this 103   section, the board of elections shall promptly prepare and file an appropriate certificate of nomination in its own office and with the city clerk.  68. Nonpartisan general election.

No candidate for an office elected pursuant to this chapter may appear more than once on a primary ballot or general election ballot. Such ballot shall conform to sections sixty-eight , sixty- nine, and seventy of this chapter. h. Subdivision three of section 8-100 shall be deemed to include nonpartisan  primary elections and non partisan general elections held pursuant to this chapter. i. Subdivision one of section 8-500 shall be deemed to include nonpartisan  primary elections and nonpartisan general elections, provided, however, that in the general election, the rights provided to independent bodies pursuant to such subdivision shall be applied to candidates nominated pursuant to this chapter. j. Section 9-122 shall apply, provi ded that all votes of qualified voters shall be  counted for nonpartisan primary and general elections held pursuant to this chapter. k. Section 14-114 shall apply except as specified in section seventy one of this chapter. 2. Discussion Thi s section contains general provisions regarding the scope of the  Section 60:  chapter and its relation to the State Election Law. The chapter covers elections for mayor, comptroller, public advocate, council members, and borough presidents. The general theory of the Chapter is that, except where the Chapter provides otherwise, the provisions of the Election Law used to govern partisan elections also will be used for nonpartisan elections. Section 60 recognizes, however, that the Election Law has many references to party members throughout its provisions. Rather than specifically  addressing each one, the section deems Election Law references to party members to refer to qualified voters in New York City, when read in connection with offices covered 108   by the Chapter. The section also enables sections of the Election Law referenced in the Chapter to be amended without requiring the Charter also to be amended. Section 61: This section sets forth the basic rules for becoming a candidate in a  nonpartisan election. Under sub division (a), in order to run in a nonpartisan primary election, a candidate must be designated by a petition, the ""nonpartisan designating petition,"" containing the signatures of registered voters of the political unit for which the designation is made. As indicated in subdivision (b), nonpartisan designating petitions are analogous to independent nominating petitions under the Election Law, although the y are named ""nonpartisan designating petitions"" because they will be filled out at the same time that p artisan designating petitions -- used for candidates to get on the primary ballot for a party in partisan elections --will be filled out. This similarity to independent nominating petitions would help the public and the Board of Elections more readily understa nd and implement the new system. Subdivision (b) references Election Law  6 -142 for the number of signatures needed to get on the ballot for the nonpartisan primary election. Consistent with the general approach of analogizing to the independent nominati ng petition system, Section 6-142 is the provision for the number of signatures needed on an independent nominating petition to get on the ballot for various offices. It should be noted that, unlike for any other New York City office, the number of signatures needed for an independent nominating petition to get on the ballot for a City Council position (2,700) differs from the number of signatures needed for the same office for a partisan designating petition (900). Compare Election Law  6 -142(2)(d -1) a nd 6 -136(2)(c -1). Subdivision (c) sets forth many of the timing requirements for nonpartisan designating petitions. 109   Section 62:  This section sets forth provisions governing the form of nonpartisan  designating petitions. Except for the first paragraph, the form set forth in Election Law  6-140 for independent nominating petitions is used. In addition, in light of the Second Circuit's opinion in Lerman v. Board of Elections , 232 F.3d 135 (2d Cir. 2000), cert. den. , 533 U.S. 915 (2001) (invalidating requirement of Election Law  6-132(2) that witnesses to designating petitions be residents of the political subdivision in question), the requirement of Section 6-140 that the witness reside in the political unit in question is excepted out of Charter  62. See Election Law  6-140(1)(b) and 6 -138(1). Section 63: This section deals with vacancies in the designation to run for the  nonpartisan primary election. It sets forth the manner in which a person designated as a candidate for nomination may decline the designation, and how vacancies on the nonpartisan primary ballot caused by such declination, or any other reason, shall be filled. Section 64: In section 6-164, the Election Law provides the opportunity to avoid  uncontested primaries through the ""opportunity to ballot."" Section 64 of the draft does the same thing for the nonpartisan primary. Under this section, qualified voters may file a petition with the Board of Elections requesting the opportunity to write in the name of a candidate, who need not be specified, for the office in question. The number of  signatures needed for this type of petition is the same as the number needed for the nonpartisan designating petition. Upon receipt of such a petition by the Board of  Elections, the office is deemed conte sted, and the contest is resolved in the nonpartisan primary. Section 65: This section sets forth the basic provision for the nonpartisan  primary election. It is held at the time of the fall primary under the Election Law, and is 110   held in any year when a candidate for the office of mayor, comptroller, public advocate, council member, or borough president is to be elected. Section 66: This section authorizes the Board of Elections to conduct the  canvass of votes after the nonpartisan primary election, and directs the Board on how to certify the results. Section 66 provides that the candidates receiving the largest and next largest number of votes shall be the persons nominated for the office in question. Section 67: This section provides for filling vacancies in a nomination, i.e., after  the nonpartisan primary election. Basically, the person who receives the next largest number of votes at the nonpartisan primary gets the chance to consent to be nominated. Consistent with Election Law  6-150, vacancies that occur shortly before the election may not be filled. Section 68: This section provides for the nonpartisan general election, at which  the persons whose names appear on the ballot for a given office will be the persons who were nominated at the nonpartisan primary election. Section 69: This is the section that makes the nonpartisan primary and general It prohibits the placement of any partisan, party, or  election ballots nonpartisan.  independent body identification, symbol, or emblem on the ballot or voting machine at any such elections for offices covered by the Chapter. Section 70: This section sets forth the order of names on ballots for nonpartisan  primary elections and nonpartisan general elections, and is necessary in light of Election Law  7-116, which takes party strength into account in determining the placement of names on the ballot. This section also sets forth the requirement that the nonpartisan elections should be separated on the ballot from partisan elections.  111   Section 71:  Subdivision (a) relates to the campaign finance provisions of the  Election Law. In general, this subdivision adopts the contribution and receipt limitations set forth in the Election Law, except that it makes them applicable to nonpartisan primaries and nonpartisan gene ral elections. The major difference from the Election Law is that this section deems references in Election Law  14-114(1)(b) to enrolled voters in the candidate's party in the relevant district to mean the number of registered voters in the district. S ubdivision (b) relates to the provisions in the Charter and It  Administrative Code relating to the City's voluntary campaign finance system.  generally makes the system applicable to nonpartisan elections, and directs the Campaign Finance Board to promulgate rules to make the system work for nonpartisan elections. Section 72: This section makes the nonpartisan election system applicable to  the succession rules in the event of vacancies in City elective offices. Section 73 and 74: These sections, which set forth the provisions of the Election Law that are inapplicable or modified for the purposes of nonpartisan elections under the Chapter, are provided to avoid the problem illustrated in Bareham v City of Rochester, 246 N.Y. 140 (1927). In Bareham, Rocheste r's failure to name the sections it was modifying or superseding led the Court of Appeals to strike down that city's nonpartisan election system, notwithstanding the fact that the Court thought such a system could legally be adopted by local law. Although the State's home rule provisions have been amended, since Bareham, to provide that the failure to specify the changed or superseded State law provisions ""shall not affect the validity of such local law,"" Municipal Home Rule Law  22(1), State law still requires the locality to specify the affected sections. Id. 112   PART V City Agency Submissions And Public Proposals Agency Submissions The Commission also considered proposals submitted by City agencies. The Commission staff made two oral presentations on those proposals it received prior to August 21, 2001 at public meetings of the Commission. The Commission considered both the written and oral testimony that it received on these issues. At a public meeting on August 23, 2002 the Commission determined that it would not submit the proposals submitted by City agencies or the public for referendum this year. As many of these proposals would make important changes to the Charter to enhance significantly the operations of City agencies, the Commission recommends that the following proposals be considered by a future Commission. The Commission further recommends that all other issues deferred by previous Commissions also be reviewed by a future Commission. DEPARTMENT OF BUILDINGS  Clarify DOB's Subpoena Power  Issue: Should the Charter be amended to clarify the Department of Building's (""DOB"") subpoena power so that it is not limited only to cases ""where the public safety is involved""? Relevant Charter Provision:  646. Discussion: Charter  646 provides that the Buildings Commissioner ""shall have the power and duty to conduct such inquiries as may assist him or her in the performance of  113   the functions of the department where the public safety is involved and for such purpose he shall have subpoena power to compel the attendance of witnesses, to administer oaths, examine witnesses and to compel the production of books, papers and documents."" The Department of Buildings has proposed removing the requirement that the subpoena power be available to the Commissioner only when performing the functions of the Department that involve public safety. Under the current Charter provision, subpoenaed parties have questioned DOB's authority to demand certain records which, on their face, do not appear to relate to public safety. For example, the Department's Investigations and Discipline Unit may seek to subpoena the telephone records of a contractor or professional in the course of an investigation. While this may not at first appear to be a public safety issue, where the underlying investigation concerns unsafe or illegal work, there may in fact be important public safety issues and concerns that exist. To address such concerns, DOB has proposed removing the public safety limitation to allow it to perform its investigations without unnecessary delay and without being subject to legal challenges concerning subpoena authority.  CONFLICTS OF INTEREST BOARD  Assured Funding  Issue: Should the Charter be amended to assure funding for COIB? Relevant Charter Provision:  2602. Discussion: The City's Conflicts of Interest Board (""COIB""), established in Charter Chapter 68, proposes that its independence be established explicitly in the Charter by providing for an assured source of funding. As an independent ethics agency, COIB has 114   no natural constituency and no source of revenue. This position is complicated by the fact that it regulates the very people who set its budget. Thus, it could be argued that COIB's continued survival requires a source of assured financing. There are several options to be considered that could provide assured funding. One possibility is making the agency self-funding, for example, by charging all of COIB's 12,000 financial disclosure form filers a filing fee or by requiring short form disclosure by all public servants, accompanied by a nominal filing fee. The Ohio Ethics Commission receives substantial funds in this manner, although most of the filing fees are paid by the filer's agency. Another possibility is a guaranteed minimum budget. Such a provision might read: ""The appropriations available to pay for the expenses of the board during each fiscal year shall not be less than six one thousandths of one percent of the net total expense budget of the city."" See the provisions for the Independent Budget Office (Charter  259(b)), whose budget must be at least 10% of the budget of the Office of Management and Budget. See also Mich. Const. Art. XI,  5 (requiring that the  legislature appropriate to the Michigan Civil Service Commission ""a sum not less than one percent of the aggregate payroll of the classified service for the preceding fiscal year""). Under this option, every billion-dollar decrease in the City's budget would decrease the Board's budget by $60,000; the City's Fiscal Year 2003 budget would provide COIB with a budget of about $2.5 million. Another form of an assured budget could provide a specific dollar amount, adjusted for inflation. Such a provision might read: ""The appropriations available to pay for the expenses of the conflicts of interest board during each fiscal year shall not be less than two million five hundred thousand dollars, which amount shall be adjusted 115   annually to reflect changes in the consumer price index for the metropolitan New York region published by the United States bureau of labor statistics."" The adjustment language in that alternative provision is taken from current Charter  2603(a) (adjustment to threshold for ""ownership interest""). See , e.g., Calif. Gov't Code  83122 (guaranteeing a budget of $1,000,000 for fiscal year 1975-1976, adjusted for cost-of-living changes during each fiscal year thereafter, for the California Fair Political Practices Commission). COIB argues that such an increase in its budget, prudently spent, could cover the additional responsibilities given to the Board under Charter amendments presently being considered by the Board. It should be emphasized that such a provision only would set a n assured minimum budget; the City could adopt a larger budget for the Board in any particular year. Likely, the most desirable option for COIB would be an option that provides for submission of the Board's proposed budget to the Council, without amendment by the administration. This proposal is identical to the budget scheme adopted for the Campaign Finance Board in Charter  1052(12)(c), with the addition of a provision governing midyear modifications to the Board's budget. The Board's proposed budget would be public and any reductions would require affirmative action, reducing the likelihood of ill-advised cuts, while preserving the budget authority established by Chapter 10 of the Charter.  The COIB Member Nomination Process Issue: Should the Charter be amended to give the City Council and the Mayor more parity in the nomination process for the members of the C onflicts of Interest Board? Relevant Charter Provision:  2602. Discussion: To further insure impartiality and independence COIB has addressed the issue that the City Council and the Mayor be given parity in the nomination process for 116   COIB members. Prese ntly the Mayor appoints the five members of the Board ""with the advice and consent of the council"" ( 2602 (a)). It should be noted that the former Council Speaker recommended that the Council make some of the appointments to the Board. However, split appointments  some by the mayor and some by the Council - present the danger of politicizing Board appointments and undermining accountability, a charge often leveled at the Board of Education prior to the recent amendments, largely as a result of its split appointment process. As an alternative, appointments could be made only upon the recommendation of an independent body, similar to a judicial screening committee. For example,  commissioners of the Hawaii State Ethics Commission are appointed by the gover nor from a panel of ten persons nominated by the judicial council, an advisory body appointed by the Hawaii Supreme Court. See Hawaii Revised Statutes  84-21(a) and 601-4. Such a screening committee could be established for appointments to the Board and to other similar non-mayoral boards and commissions; the members of such a body could be appointed by each citywide elected official (mayor, speaker, comptroller and public advocate), perhaps with two mayoral appointments, one of whom would be the chair.  COIB Clarifying Amendments  Issue: Should the Charter be amended to clarify that (1) a COIB member can act as lobbyist on his or her behalf before the City; and (2) the staff director should be known as the executive director instead of counsel? Relevant C harter Provision:  2602. Discussion: COIB proposes that the Charter  2602(b) be amended to clarify that a Board member cannot act as a paid lobbyist on behalf of someone else but may act as a lobbyist on his or her own behalf, but not before the Board i n violation of  2604(b)(6). 117   COIB also proposes that the term ""counsel,"" which was carried over to COIB from its predecessor, the Board of Ethics, be replaced with the term ""executive director,"" as the person who shall serve as the staff director. First, the amendment reflects that the size and mission of the Conflicts of Interest Board are larger than that of the Board of Ethics. Second, it gives the Board the freedom to hire a qualified non- lawyer for the position of executive director. DEPARTMENT OF F INANCE  Uniform Right to Appeal from Determinations of the Tax Appeals Tribunal  Issue: Should the Charter be amended to permit appeals from the Tax Appeals tribunal by both the taxpayers and the Commissioner of Finance? Relevant Charter Provision:  171. Discussion: Charter  168 provides for an independent Tax Appeals Tribunal within the Department of Finance. The Charter specifies that the ""powers, functions, duties and obligations of the tribunal shall be separate from and independent of the authority of the commissioner of finance."" The Charter establishes that the Tribunal has jurisdiction to hear and determine cases initiated by the filing of petitions protesting notices issued by the Finance Commissioner for which taxpayers have the right to a hearing, including ""any notice of determination of a tax due, a tax deficiency, or a denial of a refund or credit application"" that relate to excise taxes, vault charges and taxes other than taxes on real property such as the City's business taxes. Charter 171 provides that decisions of the Tribunal are final and specifies that such Tribunal decisions are subject to judicial review pursuant to Article 78 of the Civil Practice Law and Rules. However, this right to judicial review is inequitably afforded  118   only to the taxpayer and not to the Commissioner of Finance. Specifically, Charter 171(b) provides that ""each decision of the tribunal, shall finally and irrevocably decide all the issues raised in the proceedings before it, unless the petitioner who commenced the proceeding seeks judicial review of any such decision in the manner provided in article seventy-eight of the civil practice law and rules within four months after the giving of the notice of such decision."" (emphasis added). Because the Charter specifies that the opportunity to appeal is limited to the petitioner who commenced the proceeding, which in such proceedings is the taxpayer, the City is left without any opportunity to challenge decisions of the independent tribunal. As the Tribunal is an independent entity, and in order to ensure fairness, both parties should have the same right to appeal. The ability to appeal such decisions is necessary for the Department of Finance to fairly administer and properly implement the City's tax laws on behalf of all taxpayers. To remedy this inequity, the Department of Finance has proposed amending Charter  171 to provide that both the Commissioner of Finance as well as the petitioner may seek judicial review of determinations. It is important to note that when the voters originally approved the creation of the Tax Appeals Tribunal to hear City excise tax appeals in the 1988 referendum, Charter  171 as approved explicitly permitted both the Commissioner of Finance and the taxpayer to appeal tribunal decisions. In 1992, however, when the Tribunal's jurisdiction was expanded to include City business taxes, Charter  171 was legislatively amended to limit the right to appeal to the petitioner who commenced the proceeding, thus preventing the Commissioner of Finance from appealing Tribunal determinations (Ch. 808 L. 1992). The Commission's staff believes that there may be issues concerning  119   whether this proposed change would require State law.  When this proposal is  considered by a future Commission, the staff recomme nds reviewing that issue.  Administration and Enforcement of the Payment made by Non-Resident City Employees as a Condition of City Employment  Issue: Should the Charter be amended in relation to the administration and enforcement of the payment that nonresident City employees make as a condition of their employment? Relevant Charter Provision:  1127. Discussion: Charter  1127 provides in relevant part that ""every person seeking employment with the city of New York or any of its agencies regardless of civi l service classification or status shall sign an agreement as a condition precedent to such employment to the effect that if such person is or becomes a nonresident individual . . . during employment by the city, such person will pay to the city an amount by which a city personal income tax on residents computed and determined as if such person were a resident individual, as defined in such section, during such employment, exceeds the amount of any city earnings tax and city personal income tax imposed on such person for the same taxable period."" 70  This amount is not a tax but a contractual obligation  from which the City derived more than $60 million in revenue in 2001. Since the Department of Finance has administered the  1127 program, it has been the sub ject of much debate, confusion and litigation in a number of areas including its applicability to certain classes of public servants. Further study of whether a  clarification of this Charter provision is needed should be done by another Commission.  70  Added by Local Law No. 2 of 1973, employees hired prior to and continuously employed since January 4, 1973 are exempt from the requirement.  120     Require Delinquent Taxpayers to pay the City's Collection Costs  Issue: Should the Charter be amended to ensure that the City's collection costs for the enforcement of judgments and tax warrants are paid by the delinquent taxpayers, instead of by all taxpayers? Relevant Charter Provision:  1527. Discussion: Charter 1527(1) permits the ""[Finance] commissioner [to] enter into contracts with collection agencies for the collection of (i) any or all tax warrants and judgments for all city taxes subject to collection by the department, other than real property taxes, or (ii) city water and sewer charges, or both . . . ."". Such contracts are necessary to ensure that where there is an outstanding tax warrant or judgment against a delinquent taxpayer, the City is actually able to collect the amounts due. The Department of Finance has entered into such contracts, which have successfully enabled the City to recover amounts due from delinquent taxpayers. Charter 1527(3) specifies that ""[t] he consideration to be paid to such collection agency may be a percentage or percentages of the amount collected by such agency, or as otherwise provided in the contract, but shall be within the amount appropriated and available for such purpose."" The result is that all City taxpayers, rather than the delinquent taxpayer, pay these costs of collection. To ensure that the collection agency costs are paid by the responsible parties whose failure to pay the amounts due required the City to incur such additional collection costs, the Department of Finance proposes passing such costs on to the debtors. These additional collection costs would be collected in the same manner in which the underlying delinquent taxes are collected. The Department of Finance estimates that this would provide a savings of approximately $3 million per year. 121   This proposal also would place more fairly the cost for the City's collection efforts on the tax delinquents, and not on the many City taxpayers who fully and responsibly pay their taxes. Charging the taxpayer for the increased collection costs would serve as an incentive for the taxpayer to pay the Department of Finance, as it will cost the taxpayer more to wait and ultimately pay the collection agency. It should be noted that where the City sells tax liens on real property to enforce the payment of qualifying delinquent real property taxes and/or water and sewer charges and other related charges, Administrative Code 11-332 specifically permits the tax lien certificate holder ""to receive and retain a surcharge"" on the lien. The Code also specifies that the sold tax lien will include, in addition to unpaid charges ""the costs of any advertisements and notices given pursuant to this chapter [and] any surcharge pursuant to  11-332 . . ."" Therefore, with respect to delinquent real property taxes and related charges, the local law already provides that certain increased collection costs resulting from additional collection efforts incurred by the City will be charged to the delinquent taxpayer. This proposal would simila rly serve as an important incentive for delinquent taxpayers against whom tax warrants and judgments have been issued for unpaid taxes to pay the Department of Finance, rather than waiting and paying the collection agency.  DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND MENTAL HYGIENE  Issue: Establish a Consistent Uniform Maximum Penalty for the Enforcement of Violations of the Various Public Health Laws Should the Charter be amended to establish uniform maximum penalties for  violations of the various public health laws and regulations by increasing from $1,000 to  122   $2,000 the maximum penalty that may be imposed by the Commissioner of Health and Mental Hygiene for the violation of any provision of Chapter 22 of the Charter or any notice, order or regulation issued pursuant such provision? Relevant Charter Provision:  555(b)(2). Discussion: There does not currently exist a uniform maximum penalty applicable to  the various provisions of law enforced by the Commissioner of Health and Mental Hygiene. Pursuant to  12(1) of the New York State Public Health Law, violations of the New York State Sanitary Code, much of which is enforced in the City by the Commissioner of Health and Mental Hygiene, may be penalized by fines up to a maximum amount of $2,000. Pursuant to Section 3.12(a) of the New York City Health Code, as amended by a resolution of the Board of Health on April 26, 1994, violations thereunder may also be penalized by fines up to a maximum amount of $2,000. However, Charter 555(b)(2) provides that the regulations promulgated by the Commissioner of Health and Mental Hygiene to implement requirements found in the Charter and the New York City Administrative Code may only be enforced by penalties of up to $1,000. The regulations of the Commissioner of Health and Mental Hygiene, which currently number more than twenty, are set forth in Title 24 of the Rules of the City of New York and relate to subjects as varied as window guard enforcement, enforcement of the Smoke Free Air Act and mobile food vendors. To create uniform maximum penalties applicable to the various laws and regulations enforced by the Commissioner of Health and Mental Hygiene, the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene has proposed amending Charter  555(b)(2) to increase from $1,000 to $2,000 the maximum amount which may be imposed for the violation of regulations promulgated by the Commissioner to implement requirements of the Charter and the 123   New York City Administrative Code. The $1,000 maximum has been in effect since 1977 (Local Law 25 of 1977).  DEPAR TMENT OF HOUSING PRESERVATION AND DEVELOPMENT  Deputy Commissioners  Issue: Should the Charter be amended to provide HPD the authority to appoint deputy commissioners as needed? Relevant Charter Provision:  1801. Discussion: Charter  1801 limits to five the number of deputy commissioners that may be appointed at HPD. HPD proposes that the language be made less limiting to reflect the flexibility needed to operate a large agency with many discrete functions. HPD would like to appoint deputy commissione rs ""as may be necessary.""  Jurisdiction  Issue: Should the Charter be amended to clarify HPD's jurisdiction? Relevant Charter Provision:  1802. Discussion: Charter  1802(3) gives HPD ""all powers, rights and duties as provided by any federal, state or lo cal law or resolution, relating to slum clearance . . . urban renewal . . . (and) public housing."" HPD proposes that its Charter language be clarified by  cross-referencing specifically General Municipal Law Article 16 which authorizes HPD to sell property, make loans and grant tax exemptions. HPD also requests clarification concerning its authority to administer tax exemption and abatement programs. Presently, Charter  1802 (6)(b) authorizes HPD to administer these programs pursuant to the following language:  124   administer laws authorizing tax exemption or tax abatement or both, including but not limited to, section 11-243 of the administrative code of the city of New York and section four hundred twenty one of the real property tax law [RPTL], which are in aid of construction, rehabilitation, alteration or improvement of residential buildings and structures . . . HPD would like the specific references to RPTL  421 and Administrative Code  11-243, in this section removed because they no longer reflect accurately HPD's authority and obligations regarding tax incentive programs. First, the reference to RPTL  421 is erroneous because that section is now blank. Second, HPD's authority to administer tax programs has expanded beyond  Administrative Code  11-243; HPD now administers tax programs set forth in Administrative Code  11-241 through 11 -245. HPD would like to replace the  inaccurate and outdated references with broad, open-ended, language regarding its mandate to administer tax programs generally that would permit HPD to create and administer new tax incentive programs as needed. Additionally, HPD proposes that Charter 1802 state specifically that HPD may administer loan programs.  Reducing Approval Requirements for Small Emergency Purchases  Issue: Should the Charter be amended to exempt small purchases, which are also emergency purchases, from approval by the Corporation Counsel and the Comptroller? Relevant Charter Provision:  315. Discussion: Charter Chapter 13 governs procurement. Section 315 provides for  ""[e]mergency procurement"" and requires approval for emergency purchases from the Comptroller and Corporation Counsel regardless of the dollar amount at stake. HPD  proposes to eliminate the requirement for approval by the Comptroller and the Corporation Counsel in situations involving small dollar amounts. The dollar amount threshold for small  125   purchases is established by the Procurement Policy Board (""PPB"") pursuant to Charter  314. The current small purchase limit is $25,000 for goods, $50,000 for services and $100,000 for construction and construction-related services and information technology. Presently, the Charter requires approval from the Corporation Counsel and the Comptroller for all emergency purchases. HPD's proposal would authorize PPB to  establish small emergency purchase rules eliminating the current approval requirement and making them apply only in specific circumstances, such as for purchases that do not exceed the small purchase limits.  Issue: 71  Clarifying that the Requirement to Obtain an Appraisal for the Disposition of Real Property is Limited in its Scope Should the Charter be amended to clarify specifically when appraisals are  required as a predicate to disposition of city property? Relevant Charter Provision:  384. Discussion: Presently, Charter Chapter 15, entitled ""Property of the City"" sets forth  384 as follows: Disposal of the property of the City. a. No real property of the city may be sold, leased, exchanged or otherwise disposed of except with the approva l of the mayor and as may be provided by law unless such power is expressly vested by law in another agency. b. Except as otherwise specifically provided by law: . . . 3. Real property of the city may be sold only after appraisal made within six months prior to the authorization of the sale and after a review of such appraisal by the department of citywide services within thirty days prior to the authorization of the sale, provided that advertisement for the public auction for such sale shall be commenced wi thin sixty days of such authorization. 71  HPD submitted the text of what it states is a former PPB rule: Section 3-08(i) once provided that ""[e]mergency purchases shall be made in accordance with Section 3-06 of these Rules, except that the approval of the Comptroller and the Corporation Counsel is not required for emergency purchases which are less than or equal to the small purchase limits."" This rule was repealed by current Charter  315. HPD contends that the rule worked well and should be readopted.  126   HPD finds the provision ambiguous because the final clause of subsection ""3,"" quoted above, appears to limit the provision to auction sales. However, the provision may be read as a general requirement. HPD seeks language that would eliminate the ambiguity. HPD presents a proposed amendment to  384 which clarifies that the provision does not create a general requirement for an appraisal. The new language makes clear that only in instances where the property is disposed of by auction, pursuant to the provision itself, is an appraisal required. HPD no longer disposes of property pursuant to Charter  384. The proposed change would make clear that HPD is not required to obtain a prior appraisal, which can often be very costly for the City, in all circumstances .  Updating Provisions Relating to the Prohibition of Certain City Employees from Participating in Public Auctions, Sealed Bids, and Negotiated Sales of City-Owned Real Property  Issue: Should the Charter be amended to (1) make clarifying amendments reflecting accurately the administrative structure of HPD; and (2) prohibit employees of another division of HPD from participating in negotiated sales of City-owned residential buildings containing six or less dwelling units if such employees participated in decisions affecting the property? Relevant Charter Provisions:  2604(c). Discussion: Charter  2604 is part of the Conflicts of Interest Law and imposes various restrictions on the activities of City employees . Section 2604(c)(7) prohibits certain City employees from bidding on and purchasing City-owned real property at a public auction or sealed bid sale, or purchasing any City-owned residential building  127   containing six or less dwelling units through a negotiated sale, if such employees participated in decisions affecting the property. HPD suggests a division of HPD, the Office of Development, be added to the groups of employees prohibited from participating in negotiated sales because that division handles such transactions. Furthermore, the reference to HPD's Office of  Property Management (""OPM"") relating to auctions or sealed bids in  2604(c)(7) is outdated and should be omitted because OPM no longer exists and the auction sales program it administered was d iscontinued a decade ago. HPD also recommends that the prohibition regarding negotiated sales be separated from the prohibition relating to buying City-owned property at a public auction or sealed bid sale in  2604(c)(7) and moved to its own separate section succeeding the public auction/sealed bid section.  Issue: Demolition of Buildings Pursuant to DOB Emergency Orders Should the Charter be amended to authorize the Department of Design and  Construction (""DDC"") to perform demolitions and related actions in response to Department of Buildings (""DOB"") emergency orders? Relevant Charter Provisions:  1202(a). Discussion: Currently, HPD or the Department of Citywide Administrative Services (""DCAS"") may demolish buildings pursuant to the precept process. In that process DOB notifies a landlord of the hazardous condition(s) on a property and a survey is conducted and presented at court. The court then determines the remedial action to be taken which may include demolition. DOB also can issue emergency orders to mandate the immediate demolition of a building. Although there are currently no provisions that identify the agency responsible for such demolition in an emergency situation, HPD has 128   effectively taken the sole responsibility for such demolitions despite their complicated nature. DDC, however, which is responsible for street, sewer, water main and most non- housing building construction, funded by the capital budget, has more architectural expertise and technical skills to demolish buildings on an emergency basis, particularly with regard to buildings with complex structures. Because DDC has greater expertise than HPD in this area, HPD contends it would be more efficient for DDC to be authorized to handle these demolitions. In order to recoup the costs of this demolition, HPD recommends that the DDC Commissioner be permitted to impose and collect charges for the work, and file liens for these costs.  DEPARTMENT OF INVESTIGATION (""DOI"") Issue: Should the Charter be amended to incorporate and expand the provisions of the City's Whistleblower Law to protect all City employees, including employees of quasimunicipal agencies? Relevant Charter Provision: Chapter 49. Discussion: The City's Whistleblower Law is codified at Administrative Code  12 -113 and prohibits certain City agencies from taking an adverse retaliatory personnel action against an officer or employee who reports information to DOI concerning conduct which he or she knows or reasonably believes to involve corrupt or criminal activity or a conflict of interest. The law is limited in its applicability to officers or employees of ""an agency of the city, the head or members of which are appointed by the mayor."" Thus, employees of the Comptroller, the Borough Presidents, the City Council, the Public Advocate or any quasi-City agency such as the Economic Development Corporation (""EDC""), the 129   Housing Development Corporation (""HDC""), Off -Track Betting Corporation (""OTB""), and Business Improvement Districts (""BIDs""), are not afforded whistleblower protection under City law. However, all City employees play an essential role in providing  information about fraud, corruption and mismanagement, including those who work in the offices of elected officials, as well as those who work in government-created entiti es that perform municipal functions. Accordingly, DOI proposes that the Commission  amend the current law and recodify it in the Charter. First, DOI proposes that the requirement that covered individuals be employed by an agency of the City, ""the head or members of which are appointed by the mayor,"" be deleted, and that the term ""agency"" be expanded to include not only mayoral agencies, but also the offices of elected officials and quasi-City agencies, including BIDs. Second, DOI proposes that the scope of the type of information that may be reported (e.g., criminal activity, etc.) by an individual that would enable him or her to claim whistleblower protection be expanded to include ""gross mismanagement"" and ""abuse of authority"" in order to conform the scope of whistleblower protections found in Executive Order 78 of 1984. Finally, DOI suggests that its proposals be recodified in Charter Chapter 49 because that chapter already includes several provisions relating to employee integrity. In particular, Charter  1116, inter alia, makes fraud by a council member, officer, or employee of the City a misdemeanor and bars anyone convicted from office or employment. Charter  1128 prohibits interference with any investigation pursuant to the Charter and demands full cooperation with DOI by every officer and employee of the City.  130   OFFICE OF ADMINISTRATIVE TRIALS AND HEARINGS The Office of Administrative Trials and Hearings (""OATH"") was established by Executive Order No. 32 in 1979, and was codified in Charter Chapter 45-A by the 1989 Charter revision. As stated in Mayor Koch's memorandum accompanying the executive order, administrative trials in the City had previously ""too often been characterized by procedural shortcomings and inconsistent, judicially reversible results."" The Mayor's goal, therefore, was to establish OATH as a centralized tribunal, in order ""to reform the due process trial system."" As an alternative to litigation, administrative trials are  invaluable as a means of dispute resolution, because they provide, in comparison to litigation in court, a relatively quick and simple means of resolving disputes. See  generally ""Alternative Dispute Resolution: Panacea or Anathema?"" 99 Harv. L. Rev. 668 (1986). The keys to OATH's structure are its impartiality and independence. In Executive Order No. 32, Mayor Koch mandated that all of OATH's administrative law judges (""ALJs"") ""maintain the standard of, and preside over administrative trials and hearings in accordance with the Canons of the Code of Judicial Conduc t of the American Bar Association."" OATH was made a Charter agency pursuant to the 1989 Charter revision. Part of that Charter Revision Commission's goal was to establish OATH as ""an independent adjudicative body that [could] be a resource to agencies conducting their adjudications, while at the same time establishing an independent structure outside of the agency to provide an unbiased assessment of the matters to be adjudicated."" Report of the Charter Revision Commission, Vol. 2 at p. 103 (April 1989). Since that time, OATH has become an integral part of City government. It hears over 2,000 cases per year, on behalf of numerous mayoral and non- mayoral agencies. 131   In most cases, OATH prepares findings of fact plus a recommendation as to the proper determination of the case. The agency involved in the adjudication then determines whether to accept, reject, or modify the recommendation. The agency's determination is subject to challenge in court under Article 78 of the Civil Procedure Law and Rules. In addition to the obvious value that OATH's role plays in City government, perhaps one measure of its success is that many agencies have chosen to hold their administrative trials and hearings at OATH. Despite its success, OATH's experience has shown that its current Charter provisions may not give it the administrative flexibility it requires to best serve the needs of the City's agencies and employees. Therefore, OATH has proposed changes to Chapter 45 -A that would enable this flexibility.  Issue: Should the Charter be amended to provide OATH with administrative flexibility to allow it to best serve the needs of the City? Relevant Charter Provisions: Chapter 45-A. Discussion: Under Charter 1049(1), each OATH ALJ must be an attorney admitted to practice in New York State for at least five years. In addition, each ALJ is appointed for a term of five years, and is removable only for cause after notice and an opportunity to be heard. These provisions help ensure the quality and independence of the ALJs. The f - year term, in particular, helps ensure independence, because it shields the ive ALJs from immediate retribution for unpopular findings or recommendations. However, the five - year term also has limited the administration of OATH, perhaps in unnecessary ways .  132   OATH has submitted two major proposals regarding the five - year term. The first is to allow the Chief ALJ to appoint temporary ALJs (who would not have the fixed term), in addition to the staff of full- time ALJs. In addition to the Chief and the Deputy Chief, OATH currently has eight ALJs hearing cases. Because this is not a large corps of ALJs, any temporary drop in staffing (e.g. sick leave or maternity leave) results in an assignment of new cases and redistribution of older cases that has a relatively large impact on the remaining ALJs. These temporary problems could be efficiently dealt with if the Chief ALJ had the ability to appoint temporary ALJs to handle these uncovered cases. Furthermore, the ability to appoint temporary ALJs would allow OATH to more efficiently handle unexpected or seasonal influxes of cases. For example, the City, State, and Board of Education are currently considering whether OATH should hear certain Board cases involving special education. Should OATH be designated to hear these cases, its caseload would more than double and there would be a particularly difficult seasonal spike in the late spring and summer. Considering the importance of these cases and the need to resolve them within a short period of time, the ability to hire temporary ALJs is crucial. OATH's other proposal regarding the five - year term involves creating a one - year term to which a newly appointed ALJ would be appointed, followed by an appointment to the five - year term. While an ALJ, in either type of te rm, would be removable only for cause, creation of an initial one - year term would allow OATH to determine, based on actual experience with the work of the new ALJ, whether his or her work was of sufficiently high caliber to merit reappointment. This process of an initial one - year term,  133   with subsequent longer terms, is presently used by the New Jersey Office of Administrative Law, New Jersey's central administrative hearings office. 72  When OATH was established, Executive Order No. 32 required that its Admini strative Law Judges comply with the Canons of Judicial Conduct. While OATH's judges adhere currently to the highest levels of ethical judicial conduct, OATH requests that that requirement be codified symbolically in the Charter. Finally, OATH requests that the Charter provision which establishes its adjudicatory standard be more clearly stated. Presently the provision governing its adjudicatory standards (Chapter 45-A,  1049 (2)) references OATH's adjudicatory standard as that contained in Chapter 45 of the Charter. That Chapter contains the entire City Administrative Procedures Act (""CAPA""). Section 1146 therein governs  adjudication standards. OATH requests that the specific section regarding adjudication be the reference rather than all of CAPA.  DEPARTMENT OF PARKS AND RECREATION  Retention of Funds Generated by Fees, Permits, Environmental Control Board (""ECB"") Penalties, and Litigation Regarding Tree Damage  Issue: Should the Charter be amended to permit the Parks Department (""Parks"") to deposit into a Parks account rather than the City's General Fund the following: 1) concession fees and special events payments; and 2) money collected from penalties resulting from ECB summonses for violations of Parks rules and affirmative litigation awards regarding tree damage or similar cases? Relevant Charter Provision:  109.  72  See New Jersey Permanent Statutes, Title 52, Section 52:14F- 4.  134   Discussion: The operation of concession services and special events requires a significant amount of management. In addition, the operation of special events  ultimately contributes to the deterioration of Parks property. In order to provide Parks the incentive to increase concessions revenue and to effectively prevent special events from causing long - term damage to Parks property, such concession fees and special events payments could be specifically earmarked to pay for the enhanced maintenance and upkeep of Parks property, such as re-sodding grass and replacing plantings. In addition, the money collected from summonses and litigation relating to damage to City trees could be expressly given to Parks for forestry related expenses, such as replanting trees and maintenance of City trees. Such an amendment would provide greater incentives for Parks to generate revenue and would enable Parks to more immediately see the financial impact of enforcement efforts (i.e. tree damage cases). If this exception to 109 is viewed as too broad, then Parks proposes that a certain percentage of the above revenue be retained by Parks. Moreover, Parks could dedicate all or a portion of these dedicated funds to specific Mayoral priorities, including developing waterfront parks or extending the service hours at playgrounds. Registration of Concession Agreements Issue: Should the Charter be amended to exempt Parks concession agreements from the City contrac t registration process? Relevant Charter Provision:  375. Discussion: Parks contends that its revenue and administrative functions would be made more efficient if all concession agreements, or at least concessions which earn less than $100,000 in revenue for the City, were exempt from the registration process. Registering concession agreements, where the City receives money, does not present 135   the same oversight concerns as those present in contracts where the City expends money. Moreover, the administrative expense and aggravation involved in registering every pushcart or other small concession far exceeds any benefit from the Comptroller's oversight of this large volume of concessions through the registration process. For  example, Parks managed approximately 188 small concession agreements, 90 temporary use concession agreements, and 170 special event vending permits in 2001. For many of these contracts, the City gets as little as $50-$1,000 in fees. The Comptroller's Office requires such concession agreements to be submitted 30 days before the implementation of the agreement. However, the registration process is extremely time-consuming because it requires the input of a large amount of data. Required strict compliance with the registration process wi ll likely delay the City's receipt of this revenue source. This proposed amendment would purportedly lower administrative and bureaucratic costs only with a slight concomitant decrease in financial oversight. Further, Parks is already charged with reporti ng regularly the revenue earned by such concession agreements to the Comptroller's Office, and therefore the Comptroller's Office would retain its ability to monitor these contracts. In addition, the Comptroller's Office would also still be able to conduc t audits of such contracts. In the alternative, Parks proposes that such concession agreements be subject to self- registration, whereby Parks inputs the relevant information to register a contract into the Comptroller's Office database, and the contract is deemed to be automatically registered. Although inputting such data would usually take about an hour, self-  registration still would stream -line the current 30 day registration process and eliminate unproductive delays. 136     Use of Board of Education Property When Property is not in Use  Issue: Should the Charter be amended to give Parks jurisdiction to maintain and program activities on playgrounds and playing fields that are currently under the control of the Board of Education at those times when school programs are not taking place (i.e., weekends and school vacation periods)? Relevant Charter Provisions:  521, 533. Discussion: The demand for Parks to provide youth athletic programs and playing fields is extremely high, particularly during the summer. However, many of the playgrounds and playfields of the Board of Education are not in use in the summer, and Parks' use of this property would expand its ability to provide youth athletic programs and playing fields for permitted activities throughout the City.  Issue: Authority to Value and Sell Parks Memorabilia and/or Artifacts Should the Charter be amended to authorize the Department of Citywide  Administrative Services' (""DCAS"") to issue waivers regarding the salvage process to other City agencies? Relevant Charter Provision:  811. Discussion: Currently, DCAS is responsible for receiving unwanted equipment from other agencies and for determining whether the equipment should be auctioned, reassigned or destroyed. However, Parks has the expertise necessary to assign the appropriate value for a variety of memorabilia or artifacts that are not otherwise easy to value under the DCAS salvage process, such as old stadium seats, signs, and statutes, etc. Such objects have value for collectors and often can ge nerate a much higher  revenue than what the City receives through the DCAS salvage process. Therefore, in order to ease the significant burden the salvage responsibility imposes on DCAS and to 137   generate more revenue for the City by capitalizing on Parks' expertise of specialty items, DCAS should be provided with the authority to issue waivers of its responsibility to salvage equipment to other City agencies.73 In this way, other agencies, such as Parks, with specialized expertise in specific items, would be able to value and sell the objects at a more competitive rate. Under these proposals, all revenue generated by the sale of such specialty items would be placed in the City's General Fund.  Issue: Adding the Parks Commissioner to the Environmental Control Board Should the Charter be amended to add the Parks Commissioner to the  Environmental Control Board (""ECB"")? Relevant Charter Provisions:  1404. Discussion: The ECB has the authority to issue rules and regulations regarding many environmental topics, i ncluding air and water pollution, hazardous materials, defacement of City property. It also serves as an administrative tribunal for various environmental violations. Parks plays an important role in enforcing and helping to promulgate rules and regulati ons answerable through ECB summonses 74, and therefore Parks contends that it is logical for the Parks Commissioner to be included with the Commissioners of Environmental Protection, Sanitation, Buildings, Health, Police, Fire, and Consumer Affairs on the Board. Further, it would be useful to have the Parks Commissioner on the board since the ECB has the authority to adopt and amend regulations relating to the use and regulation of all property subject to Parks' jurisdiction.  73  With this revision, Parks is not suggesting that it be given the authority to sell non -unique items. For example, Parks would not seek authority to sell old office furniture, computer equipment, vehicles, etc. 74 For example, Parks employs Parks Enforcement Police officers to issue ECB summons for the violation of Parks rules and requires these officers to be present at the hearings of these violations.  138   LAW DEPARTMENT  Bankruptcy Court Decisions Not Precedential for the Tax Appeals Tribunal  Issue: Should the Charter be amended to provide that the Tax Appeals tribunal is not required to follow as precedential decisions rendered by the United States Bankruptcy Court. Relevant Section: 170(d) Discussion: Charter section 170(d) presently requires the Tax Appeals Tribunal to follow as precedent the prior precedential decisions of the State Tax Appeals Tribunal, or of any federal or New York State Court or the U.S. Supreme Court. Where a  taxpayer is in bankruptcy, the debtor/ trustee may move the bankruptcy court for an order determining that taxpayer's liability for New York City taxes. 11 U.S.C.  505. While the City can move, pursuant to 28 U.S.C.  1334, for the bankruptcy court to abstain from hearing such local tax questions and permit them to proceed before the City Tax Appeals Tribunal, the decision of whether or not to abstain is within the court's discretion, and there is no assurance that the motion will be granted in a particula r case. Bankruptcy courts are courts of equity, and the objectives of the Bankruptcy Code, e.g., to effectuate a viable plan of reorganization and balance the competing interests of the various classes of creditors of the debtor's estate, are not necessari ly consistent with the fair adjudication, from a precedential standpoint, of sensitive local tax issues. See, e.g., Matter of Avien, Inc , 532 F.2d 273 (2nd Cir. 1976) (affirming a  decision of the bankruptcy court holding that the amount of the net operating loss that can be carried back to earlier tax years for purposes of the City's general corporation tax was not, as provided in the City statute, limited to the amount of the federal tax  139   loss). But see Matter of Royal Indemnity Company v. Tax Appeals Tri bunal, 75 NY2d 75 (1989) (where the Court of Appeals refused to follow Avien). Under the present Charter  170(d), there is a possibility that the Tax Appeals Tribunal would be bound by such decisions of the federal courts (including the U.S. Supreme Cour t) in bankruptcy cases. To remedy this, it is proposed that Charter  170(d) be amended as follows: The tribunal shall follow as precedent the prior precedential decisions of the tribunal (but not of its small claims presiding officers), the New York State Tax Appeals Tribunal or of any federal or New York state court or the U.S. Supreme Court (except for determinations rendered by any court pursuant to 11 U.S.C.  505(a) in cases under title 11 of the United States Code) insofar as those decisions pertain to any substantive legal issues currently before the tribunal.  DEPARTMENT OF CONSUMER AFFAIRS  Revocable consent approval for sidewalk cafes  Issue: Should the Charter be amended to streamline the process for approving a petition for a revocable consent to operate an unenclosed sidewalk caf? Relevant Charter Sections: Chapter 14. Discussion: The Department of Consumer Affairs (""DCA"") now processes such petitions for revocable consent to operate an unenclosed sidewalk cafe through the approval process set forth in the City Charter . Under current law, DCA issues a license to operate a sidewalk caf after the petition for a revocable consent is approved by DOT which occurs after review by various agencies and the City Council. DCA proposes amending the City Charter to streamline this process by authorizing the Department of Transportation to issue a temporary approval for a petitioner to operate an unenclosed sidewalk caf after the petitioner has certified to 140   DCA that the plans for a caf comply with all siting requirements and the Community Board has been given an opportunity to comment on the petition, but before the remaining steps in the formal approval process are completed. Conforming  amendments to the sidewalk caf licensing law would then need to be enacted to authorize DCA to issue a temporary license to operate a sidewalk caf. The temporary authorization would automatically lapse and become void on a date certain that is keyed to the maximum time provided for completing the approval process. The temporary authorization to operate should be made contingent on the applicant submitting to DCA a complete truthful application for a license and a revocable consent and a complete truthful certification of compliance with applicable siting requirements.  PROCUREMENT Issue: Should the Charter be amended in relation to procurement? Relevant Charter Provision: Chapter 13.

Yes, school uniforms would help create a positive learning environment. No, students should be able to wear what they want as a form of expression. No, school uniforms would create even more dislike for education.  ?

O kay, so the Green Party is official in Iowa. What does that mean? It means the Green Party must take on some new responsibilities. As a political party in Iowa the Green Party must:     Nominate candidates for primary elections. Hold precinct caucuses to select county convention delegates and hold district and state conventions. File copies of county party constitutions and bylaws with County Auditor and Secretary of State. File state party consititutions and bylaws with the Secretary of State.  We are proud to announce ISPAC has 2235 members from 223 schools. The 2001 Membership Drive begins January 1, 2001. This year we encourage you to help your friends sign-up online at www.sos.state.ia.us and introduce an opportunity for your school to become an ISPAC Charter School. For more information about ISPAC Charter Schools visit our web page at www.sos.state.ia.us.  Ask the Secretary A new addition to the ISPAC Newsletter, ""Ask the Secretary"" is an opportunity for you to correspond directly with Secretary Culver . If you have a question for Chet you can write, e-mail, or call our office. Dear Chester J. Culver, I want to start off by saying I am a member of ISPAC and think it is a good program. I have a few questions though. With the lack of results from last month's elections, there has been a lot of doubt in my mind that the electing process still works. It is my opinion that the Electoral College was originally intended to help rural areas get representation. In today's world of computers and television, the general population is better informed than it was 200 years ago. I think it is time to abolish the Electoral College and let each individual vote count toward the election. Do you feel the same way? Respectfully, R.K. W. Dear Robert, The Electoral College is good for small states because it gives them a say and allows them to play an important role in a national election. This year is a perfect example. Iowa has just seven electoral college votes but it was a real battleground state with Gov. Bush and V.P. Gore spending a significant amount of time and money here. However, I think there will be a great deal of debate about the future of the electoral college because for the first time in 112 years we had one candidate for President (V.P. Gore) win the popular vote by nearly 300,000 votes and another candidate (Gov. Bush) win the electoral college vote by 4 votes. Many Americans may feel this was unfair and might be interested in changing the way we select our president.  The Green Party will also take advantage of the benefits of becoming an official party in Iowa. The Green Party name will be on voter registration forms and statistics. At primary and general elections, the Green Party may have up to 3 pollwatchers per precinct if they are accredited by their county chair or central committee. The Green Party may also have observers while the special precinct board counts absentee ballots during the hours the polls are open and while considering the qualifications of voters who cast special ballots. In order for the Green Party to retain political party status, the candidate for president or governor must recieve at least 2% of the votes cast for those offices. That means that the Green Party candidate for governor in the 2002 election must recieve 2% of the vote,  For more information on how political groups in Iowa become recognized political groups visit our webpage at www.sos.state.ia.us, click ISPAC, then Iowa Code 43.2  Thank you for your question. Sincerely, Chet Culver Secretary of State   --------A Thank You from the S.O.S. Office... A special thank you to all the students, teachers, and schools who helped make the ISPAC Mock Election program such a success. Your enthusiasm and participation will help ensure that the future of our democracy in Iowa is in good hands. Our thanks also to the National Student/Mock Election organization, the Iowa State Bar Association, and Votehere.net for their support for our voter education program.  A Word from Chet... We have been witness to a truly historical event. The closest presidential election in the history of the United States. Election 2000 illustrates that every vote really does count. In Iowa the race for president was decided by just over 4,000 votes out of more than 1.3 million votes cast. Nowhere in the nation was the picture painted more clearly than in Cedar County, Iowa. The unofficial tally of votes showed a tie (4,025 each) between V.P. Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush. Cedar County was the only county in the nation where a tie occurred. When the official votes were canvassed Vice President Al Gore received 4,033 votes and governor George W. Bush receive 4,031 votes, two votes represents 0.02% of the total votes cast. In the presidential election on November 7, 2000, nearly 102 million Americans went to the polls to vote for President of the United States. This election was decided by less than 4 Electoral Votes nationally. I hope you now realize how one person, one voice, one vote really can make a difference. Sometimes you may feel you cannot make a difference and that you are the only person who feels strongly about an issue. Your involvement in the political process can be the start of something great. Chances are there are other people who agree with you and will want to help. With persistence you can accomplish anything. Remember, always vote, encourage your friends to vote, and initiate the change you want.  A Special Thanks  to the ISPAC members who volunteered at the Mississippi Valley Fair and Iowa State Fair: Travis Shepherd, Alyssa Petersen, Megan Petersen, Brad Petersen, Jessica Molyneaux, Haley Swedlund, Evan Yeats, Carol Reeves, and Samuel Borbono. And to all the volunteers who helped during Voter Registration Day. -------  YOUTH GET OUT & VOTE! ""Young adults, ages 18-29, were 17% of those voting in the 2000 election.
