GX040-07-2295085	"A Successful Public/Private Partnership      to Remedy Homelessness in Fairfax County            Project HOMES is a joint venture of the Department of Family Services, the    Department of Housing and Community Development, and local faith groups, community    organizations and businesses.           Our Mission               To assist families and adults in finding homes; to offer friendship        to the discouraged; to bring hope of future independence; and to prevent        homelessness from being repeated.                       These are the services that faith    groups, community organizations and businesses involved in Project HOMES have    provided and continue to provide. A valuable partnership between government    and its citizens, Project HOMES contributes to the well-being of our entire    community.   How It Works    Through Project HOMES (Housing Organizations Making Efforts to Serve), faith    groups, community non-profit organizations and businesses ""adopt""    homeless families and individuals in the county's Emergency Housing and Shelter    Program who have lost housing through no fault of their own. They act as sponsors    and may also assist financially.    The role of Fairfax County Department of Family Services, which administers    Project HOMES, is to identify appropriate families and adults, match them with    a specific group, support the volunteers who work with them, and follow each    match to completion.       Since its inception in 1988, Project HOMES has worked with over 75 faith groups and community organizations.   More than 500 homeless families and single adults have located housing through      this program.       Why Homelessness?  While lack of affordable housing is the primary cause of homelessness in Fairfax  County, other reasons people have lost their housing include:                        Abandonment        Divorce and loss of support       Domestic violence (spouse and/or child abuse)        Eviction      Family crisis                      Low wages and layoff        Mental health crisis         Prolonged illness        Unemployment               The trauma of being homeless often worsens personal and family problems. It    is harder for homeless persons to maintain steady employment. Their credit ratings    are adversely affected, and the high cost of rent and deposits makes it difficult    for them to find affordable housing.     About Homelessness   No longer regarded simply as an urban phenomenon, homelessness is a major national    concern. In recent years, homelessness in Fairfax County has mirrored state    and national trends: families and children are the fastest growing subpopulation    of the homeless. Another significant trend is that even though many homeless    persons are working, they cannot find housing because of a lack of affordable    housing.

GX076-87-11966531	"Rep. Tiahrt Votes to Repeal Social Security Earnings        Penalty for Working Seniors           Senior Citizens Freedom to Work Act, H.R. 5, Passes        House 422-0         (Washington) Rep. Todd Tiahrt joined today in a bi-partisan        effort to repeal the Social Security earnings penalty that penalizes        senior citizens by reducing their Social Security benefits if they choose        to work. H.R. 5 repeals the Social Security ""earnings limit"" that affects        approximately 800,000 Social Security recipients between the full        retirement age (currently age 65) and age 70. This current law policy        reduces, and in some cases eliminates, seniors' Social Security benefits        if they work and earn more than annual income limits (which amount to        $17,000 in 2000). The measure affects income earned after December 31,        1999 (i.e., beginning this year, seniors age 65 and older may work and        earn unlimited income without losing any Social Security benefits).         A CBO estimate indicates that enactment will cost $22.7        billion over the next 10 years. However, actuaries from the Social        Security Administration have indicated that the cost of the measure over        the long term is negligible.          Rep. Tiahrt said, ""I am pleased with the passage of this        important legislation in a bi-partisan manner. Yet another plank in the        Contract with America, the repeal of this earnings limit, will become law.        It is time the tax code stops penalizing seniors who choose to        work.""                   Case Study:             Ida is 66 years old. Her Social Security benefit is          $417/monthly (approx. $5,000 annually). This year she takes a part time          job as a cashier at a grocery store, earning $18,500. This is how the          earnings test will affect her:            Ida's earnings in 2000-- $18,500           Earnings limit in 2000 -- $17,000            Ida's earnings in excess of limit -- $ 1,  500           Benefit reduction in 2000 = 1/3 of excess -- $          500            Ida will lose $500 of her Social Security benefits this          year because of the earnings penalty. This means she will lose her          entire benefit in one month ($417) and part of her benefit in a second          month ($83).

GX089-36-9032591	"For Immediate Release   March 22, 2000    Contact: Donna Boyer   (202) 225-3026             Work Incentives for Blind and Disabled Social Security Beneficiaries Focus of Hearing Tomorrow   Social Security Recipients, Deputy Commissioner, GAO to Testify   Hearing Tomorrow, March 23rd, at 10 a.m. in 1100 LHOB    Washington, D.C. – The Ways and Means Social Security Subcommittee will hold a hearing tomorrow to examine various work incentives available to the blind and disabled on Social Security.  The Subcommittee will also examine potential costs and the positive work experiences of individual beneficiaries.  The hearing will take place tomorrow, March 23rd, in room 1100 Longworth HOB beginning at 10:00 a.m.    ""We should do all we can so every disabled worker has opportunities and incentives to stay in the workforce.  Everyone wants that.  That is what the Ticket to Work legislation passed last year was all about.  But we need to do more.  This hearing will help to show us the way,""  said Social Security Subcommittee Chairman Clay Shaw (R-FL).  BACKGROUND:   Social Security provides benefits for individuals who are blind or disabled and unable to work because of their medical conditions.  To qualify for benefits, an individual must be unable to perform work for pay due to any medically determinable physical or mental impairment.  A person is considered able to work or engage in substantial gainful activity (SGA) if earning at or above a certain dollar level (known as the SGA level).  The SGA test applies to both determining initial and continuing eligibility for benefits.   Prior to 1977, all disability beneficiaries, as well as blind beneficiaries, were subject to the same SGA limit, established in regulation by the Social Security Administration.  The Social Security Amendments of 1977 increased the amount of the SGA limit for blind beneficiaries to the same amount as the age 65 earnings limit, but did not change the SGA limit for all other disabled beneficiaries.  The Contract with America Advancement Act of 1996 increased the age 65 earnings limit, but did not change current law with respect to the blind.   In 2000, the SGA limit for blind beneficiaries is $1,170 per month and this amount is indexed annually for wage growth.  The limit for non-blind disability beneficiaries was increased from $500 to $700 per month in July 1999, after remaining at the same level for the past 10 years.    -###-  Home  |  About Rep.

The U.S. Conference of Mayors' survey found that ""overall demand for both emergency food and shelter grew during 1997 for most of the surveyed cities.  Demand for food increased at a higher rate, and in more cities, than has been reported in recent years, and demand for shelter increased at a lower rate, and in fewer cities, than in past years -- although more of the shelter demand remained unmet, and shelters in more cities have had to turn people away.""  Among the findings, cities report:  HUNGER  **  an average increase of 16% in the number of requests for emergency food assistance (86% of cities registering an increase). **  19% of all requests for emergency food assistance go unmet. **  emergency food assistance facilities may have to turn away people in need due to lack of resources (71% of cities). **  emergency food assistance facilities have had to decrease the number of bags of food provided and/or the number of times that people can receive food (76% of cities). **  causes of hunger include low-paying jobs, unemployment, food stamp cuts, high housing costs, poverty or lack of income, and low benefits in public assistance programs.  HOMELESSNESS  **  3% increase in the number of requests for emergency shelter (59% of cities). **  an average of 27% of the requests for emergency shelter by homeless people overall and 32 percent of the requests by homeless families alone are estimated to have gone unmet during the last year. **  causes of homelessness include substance abuse and lack of needed services, lack of affordable housing, mental illness, low paying jobs, domestic violence, and changes and cuts in public assistance.  HOUSING  **  an increase in requests for assisted housing by low income families and individuals(75% of cities). **  applicants must wait an average of 19 months for public housing in the survey cities. **  elimination of Section 8 incremental certificates will mean a longer wait for assisted housing, more overcrowding and increased homelessness.  IMPLEMENTING WELFARE REFORM IN AMERICA'S CITIES reports on a 34-city survey regarding the impact that the new welfare law is having, and is expected to have, on metropolitan areas.  The Task Force on Welfare Reform Implementation of the U.S. Conference of Mayors, found cities' welfare concerns include:  JOBS  **  of the cities able to provide jobs data, 92% anticipate an inability to meet the welfare law's work participation requirements due to an insufficient number of low-skill jobs. **  transportation was cited as a major problem in getting TANF and Food Stamp recipients to work (84%); however, 74% of cities report plans to provide transportation to work for recipients.  CHILD CARE  **  state reimbursement inadequately covers the cost of full day center-based child care (71%) and home based child care (62%). **  29% of cities anticipate that children who are not receiving child care subsidies would be displaced from child care.  LEGAL IMMIGRANTS  **  the average waiting time to become a naturalized citizen has lengthened, now averaging 13.5 months (92%); however, 64% of cities report the implementation of programs to assist in naturalization efforts.

GX013-18-7076345	EXECUTIVE ORDER            EO 91-01         ESTABLISHING A STATE ADVISORY COUNCIL ON HOMELESSNESS              An  increasing and unacceptable number of Washington citizens are becoming homeless. The reasons for homelessness are many and complex. They include a lack of affordable housing, wages and transfer payments which do not keep up with the rising cost of housing, domestic violence, shortage of special housing with support services for persons with mental illnesses, the problems of alcoholism and substance abuse, and the growing number of troubled youth.         Private businesses, charitable organizations, cities, counties, the federal government, and the State of Washington have started to invest substantial resources in assisting the homeless and have begun to address the root causes of homelessness. Because homelessness is a multifaceted problem, its solution requires a coordinated blend of resources and efforts from the private sector and all levels of government.         NOW, THEREFORE,  in recognition of the nature of the problem, the need for coordination, and to put into action the first recommendation of the Governor's Task Force on Homelessness in its report to me, I, Booth Gardner, Governor of the State of Washington, do hereby establish a State Advisory Council on Homelessness, as follows:         1.           The Council shall consist of up to 15 members selected by the Governor to represent private businesses, non-profit organizations that provide services to the homeless, public housing authorities, cities, counties, and the federal government. In addition, the Council shall consist of the Directors of the Department of Community Development, Department of Social and Health Services, Employment Security Department, Department of Health, Department of General Administration, Department of Veterans Affairs, Department of Corrections, and the Office of the Superintendent of Public Instruction or their designees.         2.           The Director of the Department of Community Development shall chair the Council, with a vice chair selected from among the members who do not represent state agencies. The members shall serve without compensation except for reimbursement for travel expenses to and from meetings. Staffing to the council shall be provided by the Department of Community Development with the assistance of other member state agencies.         3.           Each state department shall cooperate with the Council, and furnish it with such information as necessary to accomplish the purposes of this order.         4.           The Council shall meet at least quarterly in locations agreed upon by the members.         5.           The Council shall carry out the following responsibilities:         a.           Review actions recommended by the Governor's Task Force on Homelessness and advise the Governor on what measures can be taken to coordinate state efforts on behalf of people who are homeless.         b.           Make annual policy recommendations to the Governor on ways to enhance the state's ability to respond to the needs of people who are homeless.         c.           Provide a forum for representatives of private businesses, service providers, and local, federal, and state government to address issues and coordinate programs relating to homelessness across the state.         d.           Increase the awareness of homeless Issues at state and local government agencies and local organizations that provide services to people who are homeless, and promote training for employees to better serve people who are homeless and those at risk of becoming homeless.         e.           Promote interagency cooperation in distributing public information, both to educate the general public about the needs of the homeless and to provide homeless people and service providers with current information about available resources.         6. This order shall take effect immediately.    IN WITNESS WHEREOF,  I have hereunto    set my hand and caused the seal of the State    of Washington to be affixed at Olympia    this 23rd day of February A.D., Nineteen hundred and ninety-one.              BOOTH GARDNER    Governor of Washington                   BY THE GOVERNOR:              _________________________________    Secretary of State      Back to  Executive Orders Archive

This fiscal note contains 7 pages.    FISCAL ANALYSIS        ASSUMPTION      Officials from the  Office of Prosecution Services, Department of Health,  and  Department of Public Safety - Missouri Highway Patrol  have assumed for similar proposals from this session that this proposal will not fiscally affect their agencies.        Officials from the  Office of State Courts Administrator (OSCA)  stated there may be some increase in the number of cases filed, but the OSCA would not anticipate a significant impact on the workload of the judiciary.      Officials from the  Office of State Public Defender (SPD)   have responded to similar proposals from this session and  stated that in FY 99, the SPD provided representation in 507 cases of endangering the welfare of a child for indigent clients.  If just 20 % of these cases could be filed as child assault cases, then approximately 100 cases would move from a D felony to an A or B felony.  As the severity of a case escalates, the amount of attorney time required to provide representation also escalates.  The SPD assumes they will need one-half of an  FTE for an Assistant Public Defender ($33,360) and one-quarter of an FTE for a Paralegal ($23,112).  The new FTE would require the necessary expense and equipment items as well.      Oversight  assumes that the SPD could hire one additional Assistant Public Defender to handle the increased workload resulting from enactment of this proposal.  Oversight has removed the rental costs from the fiscal estimate provided by the Office of State Public Defender.      Officials from the  Department of Social Services - Division of Legal Services (DLS)  assume this proposal requires the local child fatality review panel to review all deaths of children that meet guidelines set by the Department of Social Services.  Local child fatality review panels currently have guidelines as to which deaths to review and are trained to use the guidelines.  Additionally, the panel has discretion to review any child death reported to it by the medical examiner or coroner.  Some local child fatality review panels currently review all deaths in their county.      The DLS stated the proposal differentiates, in child fatality cases, whether a medical examiner/coroner or the child's personal physician shall notify the Division of Family Services within 24 hours.  The DFS is currently taking information on child fatalities.  The proposal modifies the time frame as to when the Division of Family Services is contacted.  The proposal also add reports of child pornography to be investigated, along with other reports alleging criminal violations on a child.  The Division of Family Services already investigates reports of     child pornography.          ASSUMPTION  (continued)      The proposal modifies expungement criteria and time frame in reports where Division of Family Services finds insufficient evidence.  The Division of Family Services is to maintain reports concluded with insufficient evidence for 10 years form the date of the report or date of last report if there were subsequent reports.  The electronic storage of data will be addressed by the Department of Social Services - Division of Data Processing.      The proposal includes child physical abuse, neglect, exploitation and fatalities along with child sexual abuse, within the purview of the State Technical Assistance Team (STAT).  The proposal requires the STAT investigators to have proper training for peace officers.  STAT investigators currently meet this training requirement and receive continuing education.      The DLS stated there is no programmatic or fiscal impact to the DLS contained in the proposal.  Current resources will continued to be utilized to meet the statutory requirements.      Officials from the  Department of Social Services - Division of Family Services (DFS)  stated    there is no programmatic or fiscal impact to the DFS contained in this proposal.  Current resources will continue to be utilized to meet the statutory requirements.      Officials from the  Department of Social Services - Division of Data Processing (DDP)  the DDP stated the child abuse system currently uses 2,300 cylinders for record retention.  The DDP estimates the provisions of this legislation would require an additional 9,200 cylinders of disk storage (8 gigabytes) for 10 year retention.  Costs were estimated at $3,445, $4,258, and $4,386 for FY 01, FY 02, and FY 03, respectively for the additional computer storage space.  The costs were charged to the General Revenue Fund.      Officials from the  Department of Elementary and Secondary Education  (DESE)   assume this proposal will not fiscally affect their agency.   The DESE went on to state that local multi-disciplinary teams  conducting investigations are now to include a liaison of the local public school district.  It is assumed that most school districts will be able to accommodate this provision with existing staff.      However, the proposal will affect the local school districts by an unknown amount expected to exceed $100,000 annually for Internet filtering software.   The DESE estimates that there are 140,286 computers around Missouri school districts with Internet connectivity.  Forty-two (42%) percent of districts report using filtering software on 85% of their computers.  The distribution of these computers across the districts is not known.  Filtering software ranges in cost from $0 to $25.  Additionally, software prices and capabilities vary according to the target age level.                ASSUMPTION  (continued)      Given this information, DESE believes the cost of this proposal would be significant, and in excess of $100,000.  The DESE does not believe there is enough information available to construct a specific cost estimate.   Oversight  will reflect unknown costs exceeding $100,000 annually for local school district funds.        Oversight  will also reflect unknown costs (not expected to exceed $100,000 annually) to the local library districts if they should choose to buy Internet filtering software.  The proposal gives the local public libraries the option to buy the software or to set policy regarding Internet access.  Oversight will also include the possibility of costs to local city and county governments, which operate public libraries, should the libraries choose to install Internet filtering software.      Officials from the  Department of Corrections (DOC)  have responded to similar proposals from this session that they could not predict the number of new commitments which could result from the creation of the offense(s) outlined in this proposal.  An increase in commitments would depend on the utilization by prosecutors and the actual sentences imposed by the court. If additional persons were sentenced to the custody of the DOC due to the provisions of this legislation, the DOC would incur a corresponding increase in operational costs either through incarceration (at least $35.00 per inmate, per day) or through supervision provided by the Board of Probation and Parole (at least $3.00 per offender, per day).        Due to the wide variance of newly created crimes and punishments, the fiscal impact as it relates to the DOC is unknown.      The DOC anticipates that new beds might have to be constructed to accommodate the number of offenders receiving longer sentences due to this proposal.  At this time, the DOC is unable to     determine the number of people that would be convicted under the provisions of this proposal to estimate the fiscal impact for additional capital improvements.        Estimated construction cost for one new maximum security inmate bed is $48,800.      Oversight  assumes the proposal could result in more offenders being incarcerated or placed on probation.  Additional costs for supervision and care by the DOC, although unknown, would     likely exceed $100,000 annually.                      ASSUMPTION  (continued)      Oversight  notes the proposal requires the local Child Fatality Review Panels to investigate all deaths, which meet the DOSS guidelines for review, of children under the age of 18.  The Department of Health - Bureau of Vital Statistics reports that during 1998, there were 1,035 deaths of persons under the age of 18 in the state.  The breakdown of deaths of persons under the age of 18 is as follows:      0 to 1 years old     - 573 deaths    1 to 4 years old     - 112    5 to 9 years old     -   77    10 to 14 years old - 101    15 to 17 years old -  172      Total deaths       1,035      Oversight cannot predict the number of deaths of persons under the age of 18 the local child fatality review teams will choose to investigate.  However, it would be reasonable to assume some deaths of children will now be reviewed that would not have been reviewed prior to enactment of this proposal.  The requirements of this proposal should not cause the local officials involved in the child fatality review boards to hire additional personnel, however, miscellaneous costs could increase.  These local government costs are unknown, but not expected to exceed $100,000 annually.        FISCAL IMPACT - State Government   FY 2001    (10 Mo.)

This fiscal note contains 11 pages.    FISCAL ANALYSIS        ASSUMPTION      Officials from the  Office of Prosecution Services, Department of Health,  and  Department of Public Safety - Missouri Highway Patrol  have assumed for similar proposals from this session that this proposal will not fiscally affect their agencies.        Officials from the  Office of State Courts Administrator (OSCA)  stated there may be some increase in the number of cases filed, but the OSCA would not anticipate a significant impact on the workload of the judiciary.      Officials from the  Office of State Public Defender (SPD)   have responded to similar proposals from this session and  stated that in FY 99, the SPD provided representation in 507 cases of endangering the welfare of a child for indigent clients.  If just 20 % of these cases could be filed as child assault cases, then approximately 100 cases would move from a D felony to an A or B felony.  As the severity of a case escalates, the amount of attorney time required to provide representation also escalates.  The SPD assumes they will need one-half of an  FTE for an Assistant Public Defender ($33,360) and one-quarter of an FTE for a Paralegal ($23,112).  The new FTE would require the necessary expense and equipment items as well.      Oversight  assumes that the SPD could hire one additional Assistant Public Defender to handle the increased workload resulting from enactment of this proposal.  Oversight has removed the rental costs from the fiscal estimate provided by the Office of State Public Defender.      Officials from the  Department of Social Services - Division of Legal Services (DLS)  assume this proposal requires the local child fatality review panel to review all deaths of children that meet guidelines set by the Department of Social Services.  Local child fatality review panels currently have guidelines as to which deaths to review and are trained to use the guidelines.  Additionally, the panel has discretion to review any child death reported to it by the medical examiner or coroner.  Some local child fatality review panels currently review all deaths in their county.      The DLS stated the proposal differentiates, in child fatality cases, whether a medical examiner/coroner or the child's personal physician shall notify the Division of Family Services within 24 hours.  The DFS is currently taking information on child fatalities.  The proposal modifies the time frame as to when the Division of Family Services is contacted.  The proposal also add reports of child pornography to be investigated, along with other reports alleging criminal violations on a child.  The Division of Family Services already investigates reports of     child pornography.          ASSUMPTION  (continued)      The proposal modifies expungement criteria and time frame in reports where Division of Family Services finds insufficient evidence.  The Division of Family Services is to maintain reports concluded with insufficient evidence for 10 years form the date of the report or date of last report if there were subsequent reports.  The electronic storage of data will be addressed by the Department of Social Services - Division of Data Processing.      The proposal includes child physical abuse, neglect, exploitation and fatalities along with child sexual abuse, within the purview of the State Technical Assistance Team (STAT).  The proposal requires the STAT investigators to have proper training for peace officers.  STAT investigators currently meet this training requirement and receive continuing education.      The DLS stated there is no programmatic or fiscal impact to the DLS contained in the proposal.  Current resources will continued to be utilized to meet the statutory requirements.      Officials from the  Department of Social Services - Division of Family Services (DFS)  stated    there is no programmatic or fiscal impact to the DFS contained in this proposal.  Current resources will continue to be utilized to meet the statutory requirements.

The DESE does not believe there is enough information available to construct a specific cost estimate.   Oversight  will reflect unknown costs exceeding $100,000 annually for local school district funds.

The requirements of this proposal should not cause the local officials involved in the child fatality review boards to hire additional personnel, however, miscellaneous costs could increase.  These local government costs are unknown, but not expected to exceed $100,000 annually.      Jackson County Child Abuse and Neglect Response Team      Officials from the  Department of Social Services - Division of Family Services (DFS)  stated    there is no programmatic or fiscal impact to the DFS contained in this proposal.  Current resources will continue to be utilized to meet the statutory requirements.      Oversight  assumes significant costs will be incurred at the local level to conduct hotline evaluations, investigations, and assessment within Jackson County; report quarterly to the director of the division of family services; conduct an annual review of the community standards, procedures and protocols established by the response team; and produce an annual report.  These unknown costs will likely exceed $100,000; however, the statutory authority for the response team will cease on December 31, 2005.      Public School and Library Internet Access      Officials from the  Office of State Courts Administrator  assume the proposal would result in no fiscal impact to the agency.             ASSUMPTION  (continued)      Officials from the  Missouri River Regional Library  assume they would need one FTE Network Assistant ($46,000) and one FTE Library Assistant ($21,804).  They would need equipment costing approximately $30,000 annually.  They also estimate needing web site registrations, database licensing and filtering software costing approximately $125,000 annually.        Officials from the  Daniel Boone Regional Library  assume the proposal would result in personnel costs of approximately $150,000 annually; capital improvements of approximately $72,000 in FY 2001; and computer software and supplies of $43,000 in FY 2001 and approximately $9,000 annually in subsequent fiscal years.      Officials from the  Secretary of State's Office (SOS)  state Section 181.020(4), RSMo, directs the Missouri State Library to ""furnish information and counsel as to the best means of establishing and maintaining libraries, selection of materials, cataloging, and other details of library management.""  To that end, the State Library employs staff within the Library Development Division to carry out this function.  Library Development staff provide assistance     through one on one consultation and training sessions.  It is estimated that questions from public library directors, trustees, and those maintaining the software on library computers would require the services of the equivalent of .5 FTE.  Personnel costs for .5 FTE ($18,240) Library Consultant are based on budget rate for the position.  Salary increases are projected at 4%.  Expense and Equipment calculations are $3,352 per each new .5 FTE.  The  Oversight Division  used salaries increases of 2.5% in the fiscal impact.      SOS officials state it would not be possible to project a total cost of public libraries to install filtering software.  Costs for filtering software vary widely by vendor and type, number of computer stations, and whether the software is installed on each ""client"" computer workstation or on a central server.  The web pages of a sampling of filtering software vendors indicate approximate annual costs in the following ranges: $150 for a site with 5 computers; $500 to $800 for 25 computers; and up to $2,500 or more for a site with 125 computers.  Several large library systems with many branches would have 100 or more computer stations requiring filtering software.  Libraries choosing to install the filtering software on a server could also need to purchase suitable equipment for the installation.  SOS officials also assume public libraries could have additional staff costs due to the legislation.  Staff time required for installation and maintenance of filtering software could be significant.  If all terminals have filtering software,     requests from adults for access to unfiltered sites might require assistance from library staff.  Requests to have sites unblocked would be processed individually, and could require individual adjustments of the software.  Library staff would also have to monitor the use of the computer workstation, to ensure the filtering software is active when the workstation is used by minors.  Library technical services staff would also need to spend considerable amounts of time, at least initially, checking to see that the filtering software did not block access to sites the library did not wish to block.          ASSUMPTION  (continued)      The proposal would require the SOS to establish rules and regulations for enforcement.  The estimated cost of a page in the Missouri Register is $22.50.  The estimated cost of a page in the Code of State Regulations is $26.50.  The actual costs could be more or less than the number given.  The impact of this legislation in future years is unknown and depends upon the frequency and length of rules, filed, amended, rescinded or withdrawn.        Officials from the  Department of Elementary and Secondary Education (DESE)  assume the proposal would result in no direct fiscal impact to DESE.  At the local school district level, DESE assumes the following:      1)  140,286 computers in Missouri school districts with internet connectivity.     2)  42% of districts report using filtering software on 85% of their computers.      3)  The distribution of these computers across districts is not known.      4)  Filtering software ranges in cost from $0 to $25.  Additionally, software prices and capabilities vary according to the target age level.        Given this information, DESE believes the cost of this legislation would be significant, i.e., in excess of $100,000; however, DESE does not feel there is enough information available to construct a specific estimate.      Jefferson County Child Assessment Center      Officials from the  Department of Social Services - Division of Family Services - Children's Services Section  stated this proposal would have a fiscal impact to the Department in that an additional $250,000 would be required to bring the proposed Child Assessment Center (CAC) to the level of the CAC's currently receiving funding through the Department.  The costs were charged to the General Revenue Fund.        FISCAL IMPACT - State Government   FY 2001    (10 Mo.)

Public School and Library Internet Access              The proposal would require public schools and public libraries which provide a public access computer to equip the computers with software that seeks to prevent minors from gaining access to material that is harmful to minors or purchase Internet connectivity from an Internet service provider that provides filter services to limit access to material harmful to minors.        Public libraries would be required to develop and implement by January 1, 2001, a policy that establishes measures to restrict minors from gaining computer access to material that is harmful to minors.        The Secretary of State would be required to establish rules and regulations for the enforcement of the requirements.       This legislation is not federally mandated, would not duplicate any other program and would not require additional capital improvements or rental space.      Jefferson County Child Assessment Center      This proposal adds the Jefferson County Child Assessment Center to the list of child assessment centers eligible to receive funding from the Department of Social Services - Division of Family Services.      This legislation is not federally mandated, would not duplicate any other program and would not require additional capital improvements or rental space.      Jackson County Child Abuse and Neglect Response Team      Section 1 of the proposal would create a pilot project to be known as the ""Jackson County Child Abuse and Neglect Response Team"".      This legislation is not federally mandated, would not duplicate any other program and would not require additional capital improvements or rental space.

GX243-74-5364296	Electronic Access Policy     Tuscarawas County Public Library  New Philadelphia OH    In support of its mission to provide access to informational, educational and recreational materials,  the Tuscarawas County Public Library provides on-line information resources, through the Ohio Public Library Information Network (OPLIN), to its patrons and staff.  The library provides this access in an atmosphere that encourages information sharing and a rich array of informational resources.     Neither the library nor OPLIN guarantee the truth or accuracy of information that may be found on the Internet.  We do not have the ability to select, monitor or control the content of the millions of Internet sites available.  Some resources may contain material that some people find offensive, and some sites are inappropriate for children.    We have chosen to offer Internet access, despite its drawbacks, because there are many valuable resources available only through this venue.  The library encourages parents to supervise their children's use of electronic access.  The library staff does not act in the place of a parent to restrict what a child may access.    Public Library access to the Internet is a privilege, not a right, and it requires that its users act responsibly.  See the Guidelines for the Use of the OPLIN Computers at each computer. Violators will be denied use of these facilities.

A household paying more than 30 percent of their total income towards their    rent or mortgage is considered to be cost burdened. A household paying more    than 50 percent of their income towards their rent or mortgage is considered    to be severely cost burdened.    The following discussion analyzes the housing problems and assistance needs    of households by various income groupings. For purposes of the discussion below,    a household with a housing problem is described as:        Occupying a housing unit that meets the U.S. Census definition of having      a physical defect ( lacking complete kitchen or bathroom);      Overcrowded (more than one person per room living in a unit); and/or,      Cost burdened.      Low Income   The ""low income"" designation applies to those households whose incomes are    at or below 50 percent of the adjusted family median income ( incomes are adjusted    for family size). It is estimated by the Maricopa Association of Governments    (MAG) year 2000 planning update that 79,267 households or 80% of the 98,654    low income households in Phoenix had a housing problem. Of the 79,267 households,    41,110 low income renters and 38,157 low income homeowners were paying more    than 30 percent of their income for housing costs. Cost burdened low income    households can be further identified by household type: elderly, small family,    large family, and all others. Of the 41,110 cost burdened low income renters    5,168 were elderly households, 15,683 were small families, 6,465 were large    families and the remaining 13,794 households in the ""other"" category.    The data derived from the 1990 census and projected to the year 2000 by MAG,    the Maricopa Association of Governments, allows for analysis of the housing    problems of households earning below 30 percent of the adjusted family median    income. Of the 79,267 low income occupied households in Phoenix:       43%, or 34,085 households, earned less than 30% of median.      Of the 34,085 households 78%, or 26,586 households, had one or more housing      problem.      77%, or 26,245 households, were estimated to be cost burdened.      While 65%, or 22,155 households, were severely cost burdened.       Of the 26,245 households considered to be cost burdened rental or owner occupied    households, 80 %, or 20,996 households, were estimated to be actually paying    greater than 50% of their income on rent and utilities for the year 2000.   Overcrowding    The degree of overcrowding among low income renter households is 19.4 percent    within the 0 to 30 percent of median income group and 16.9 percent among the    31 to 50 percent of median income group. Of large family renters in the 0 to    30 percent income group, 79.3 percent live in overcrowded conditions and 71.5    percent of the large family renters in the 31 to 50 percent income group live    in overcrowded conditions.     Overcrowding among low income owner households in Phoenix is not as high as    with low income renter households. At the time of the 1990 census, only 6.1    percent of all owners earning 0 to 30 percent of adjusted median income were    considered overcrowded. A total of 7.6 percent of owners earning 31 to 50 percent    of adjusted median income were overcrowded. However, if low income elderly homeowners    were not counted as part of the calculation, the number of overcrowded owner    households would increase to 12.3 percent and 14.7 percent for the respective    income categories.   Disproportionate Need    Disproportionate need is defined as one racial or ethnic group displaying    a noticeably greater need for housing assistance than the population has a whole.    For purposes of the CP, a difference of 10 percent in housing needs data between    the population as a whole and minority population is an indicator of disproportionate    need.    Based on the 1990 census data and available year 2000 projections, there were    no instances of assistance needs being disproportionately greater for minority    populations among the low income group. The year 2000 projection does indicate    an overall increase in the Hispanic population by 28% making this the largest    single ethnic group growth. The greatest disparities were:        Minority owners within the 31 to 50 percent median income bracket had 70      percent of housing problems compared to 63 percent for the population as a      whole ( Hispanic owner households at 71 percent have the greatest incidents      of housing problems); and,           Black elderly owners within the 31 to 50 percent median income bracket had      65 percent of housing problems compared to 59 percent for the population as      a whole.       Notably there were several areas where minorities had lesser incidents of    housing problems than the population as a whole.    It should be noted that housing conditions are not being adequately accounted    for in the Census data and therefore, not represented statistically to the degree    of actual housing problems that are faced by the minority population in Phoenix.    It is known that a relatively greater proportion of the minority population    resides in the older sections of Phoenix and for that reason, undoubtedly faced    a greater incidence of substandard housing. The 1994 City of Phoenix Housing    Condition Evaluation projected that of the 426,307 housing units evaluated;    122,540 dwelling units needed minor repairs; 9,013 units needed major repairs;    and 2,575 units were not feasible to repair.    Moderate Income    The ""moderate income"" designation applies to those households whose incomes    are greater than 50 percent but less than or equal to 80 percent of the adjusted    family median income. It is estimated through MAG year 2000 projections that    40,927 households, or 50 percent, of the 81,822 moderate income households in    Phoenix had some sort of housing problem. It is estimated that16,472 moderate    income renters and 17,881 moderate income homeowners were paying more than 30    percent of their income towards their rent (cost burdened). Of the 16,472 cost    burdened moderate income renters, 2,249 were elderly households, 6,275 were    small families, 1,225 large families and the remaining 7,723 were in the ""Other""    category. Only 4 percent of moderate income renter households and 7 percent    of moderate income owner households were considered severely cost burdened.    There continues to be a significant difference when compared to low income households    as noted previously.   Overcrowding    The degree of overcrowding among the renter households is 12.5 percent within    the 51 to 80 percent of median income group. Of large family renters in the    51 to 80 percent income group, 61.9 percent are overcrowded. Overcrowding among    moderate income owner households is 6.3%. These figures, according to the 1990    census are still within year 2000 projections. Overcrowding among moderate income    owner households (6.3%) is on par with other Arizona cities.    Disproportionate Need    There were no instances of assistance needs being disproportionately greater    for minority populations among the moderate income group. The following are    the most disparate incidents in this income group:        Minority owners within the 51 to 80 percent median income bracket had a      55 percent incident of housing problems compared to 50 percent for the population      as a whole (black owner households had a 57 percent incidents of housing problems);      and,               Hispanic renter households within the 51 to 80 percent median income bracket      had a 63 percent incident of housing problems compared to 50 percent for the      population as a whole.      Middle Income    The ""middle income"" designation applies to those house holds whose incomes    are greater than 80 percent but less than or equal to 95 percent of the adjusted    family median income. Year 2000 projections indicate 9,975 households, or 27    percent, of the 36,591 middle income households had some sort of housing problem.    Of this number, 1,903 middle income renters and 7,049 middle income homeowners    were paying more than 30 percent of their income towards their rent (cost burdened).    Of the 1,903 cost burdened middle income renters, 260 are estimated to be elderly    households, 925 small families, 103 large families and the remaining 615 were    in the ""Other"" category. The incidence of severely cost burdened middle income    households is still projected to be negligible in the year 2000 as it was in    the 1990 Census. There was insufficient data available to discuss overcrowding    and disproportionate need within the middle income category.   Trends    An indicator of housing need can be derived from the waiting lists for assisted    housing in Phoenix. The public housing and Section 8 waiting lists are continuously    open. As of February 2000, there were a total of 15,321 households on waiting    lists for assisted housing. There were 1,490 households on the waiting lists    for public housing, 767 for elderly housing, 262 for the scattered sites homeownership    program and 12,802 for the Section 8 rental voucher program.     The City's public and Section 8 housing inventories consist of:       1,776 conventional public housing units with an annual 32% turnover rate         636 elderly housing units with an annual 13% turnover rate      456 scattered site single family homes with an annual 24% turnover rate         4,191 Section 8 vouchers with an annual 6% turnover rate       Based on the competition for the City's assisted housing units, a household    may be on a waiting list from a few months to several years depending on the    type of housing and program desired. The City has established local preferences    for public and Section 8 housing. The local preferences are given to families    that:        Are working and to those unable to work because of age or disability      Residents who live and/or work in the jurisdiction      Families displaced through City of Phoenix action or are referred from the      Maricopa County Attorney Victim Witness Program       The table below illustrates the number of households on the waiting list for    public housing and Section 8 vouchers as of February, 2000 in need of assisted    housing by number of bedrooms required:                                                                                         Bedroom Size                                              Households                                                                       1                                              4,963                                                                       2                                              10,745                                                                       3                                              8,575                                                                       4                                              2,553                                                                       5                                              194                                                                                The assisted housing waiting lists indicate that there is a greater need of    housing for small families (2 to 4 persons). Approximately 5% (767) of the total    households on the lists are elderly or disabled households.     Affordability of single family housing is an increasing issue within the housing    market. According to the Arizona State University's Real Estate Center a household    would have to make over $45,000 to afford the median priced home in 1999 ($129,900).    When half of Arizona households make less than $35,000, the increasing affordability    problem becomes clear.

This data table is used only as a guide to demonstrate housing    needs. The data developed in the Consolidated Plan is generally more current    than 1990 Census information.    Current Estimates and Five-Year Projections    The Maricopa Association of Governments (MAG) population and housing projections    were utilized to update the 1990 Census data as well as the 1995 special Census.    From this, a current estimate of rental subsidy need was made. It was also used    to project rental estimates and projections. The ratios between rental households    in need, by household type, to total households derived from the 1990 Census    were assumed to remain the same in estimating the current need and the five    year projected need. Through this process it was projected that the total rental    subsidy need for low income households will increase by 5,703 households over    the next five years.

The low and moderate income populations          in Phoenix increases at about a rate of 2% per year based on this ten          year overview.      Homeless Population   Homelessness    The Nature and Extent of Homelessness    Homeless people in Phoenix reflect the diversity, complex characteristics,    and special needs of all homeless people in the United States. Despite their    diversity, almost all homeless people are extremely poor. Regardless of their    other difficulties, the lack of basic needs (housing, food, clothing, medical    care) are common to all homeless people. Some homeless people require limited    assistance in order to regain permanent housing and self-sufficiency. Others,    especially people with physical or mental disabilities, require extensive and    long-term support.    The definition of ""homelessness"" used in this Consolidated Plan is derived    from the Stewart B. McKinney Homeless Assistance Act. According to this definition,    a person is considered homeless who:        Lacks a fixed, regular, and adequate night-time residence; or,      Has a primary night-time residency that is a:      Supervised publicly or privately operated shelter designed to provide temporary      living accommodations;     An institution that provides temporary residence for individuals intended      to be institutionalized; or,      A public or private place not designed for, or ordinarily used as, a regular      sleeping accommodation for human beings.       The term ""homeless individual"" does not include any individual imprisoned    or otherwise detained pursuant to an Act of Congress or a state law.    The State Homeless Coordination Office estimates, on any given night, there    are as many as 12,000 people living on the streets or in emergency or transitional    shelters in Maricopa County. The State Homeless Coordination Office conducted    a statewide point-in-time survey of emergency and transitional shelters in July    1998. On the night of the survey, 3,454 homeless people were counted in Maricopa    County shelters. Of this number 1,610 were individuals and 1,844 indicated they    were members of a family. The State Homeless Coordination Office reports approximately    6,000 individuals and 2,000 persons in families remain unsheltered in Maricopa    County each night.    Based on findings from outreach worker estimates, shelters, transitional housing    programs and service providers in Phoenix and supported by national studies,    the subcommittee working on updating the Maricopa Association of Governments    Homeless Plan has estimates the homeless population in Maricopa County is comprised    of the following subpopulations:     Thirty-three percent of the homeless population consists of    people in families with children with the following characteristics:       One-third are homeless because of poverty issues only;      Thirty percent have substance abuse issues;      Thirty percent are experiencing domestic violence;      Three percent have an adult family member with a serious mental illness;         Three percent have an adult with a dual diagnosis of substance abuse and      serious mental illness:      One percent has a member who has HIV/AIDS.       In January 1998, seven emergency shelters and transitional housing programs    in Phoenix participated in a national survey of family homelessness coordinated    by Homes for the Homeless and The Institute for Children and Poverty in New    York City. The final report, ""HOMELESS IN AMERICA: A CHILDREN'S STORY"" was published    in 1999. It contained data obtained by over 200 organizations in twenty cities    in the United States. The results of the survey includes the following national    data and data obtained in Phoenix:                                                                                          AGE/ETHNICITY                                               PHOENIX                                               NATIONALLY                                                                        < 5 Years                                              41%                                              49%                                                                        5 to 17 Years                                              59%                                              52%                                                                        African American                                              27%                                              63%                                                                        Asian                                              0%                                              1%                                                                        Latino                                              23%                                              13%                                                                        Native American                                              10%                                              2%                                                                        White                                              38%                                              16%                                                                                                                                     Times Homeless:                                                        FREQUENCY                                         PHOENIX                                         NATIONALLY                                                              Once                                        58%                                        73%                                                              Twice or More                                        42%                                        27%                                                              Witnessed DV                                        51%                                        40%                                                              Witnessed Com.

The average rental rates in Phoenix are: $472 for a one-bedroom apartment, $503    for a two-bedroom apartment, and $894 for a three-bedroom apartment. The HUD    standard for determining appropriate rents is that no more than 30% of a household's    income should be spent on housing costs (including utilities). The household,    which earns $1,120 (based on $7/hour full-time employment), should be paying    $336/month for rent and utilities.      Poverty    The Maricopa County Association of Governments has estimated at least one-third    of the families with children in Maricopa County live at or below the Federal    Poverty Level. The Children's Defense Fund has estimated that, on a national    basis, one in five families in our country live in poverty. A single female    heads most homeless families in Maricopa County. Of these families, the 1990    Census found thirty-three percent live in poverty. The 1990 Census also determined    that 51% of single female parent families with children under five years of    age live in poverty.      Inadequate Community Support for People with Disabilities   1. People with Addictions to Alcohol and/or Other Substances      The abuse and/or addiction to alcohol or other substances typically leads    to major impairment of the ability to function on a day-to-day basis, including    maintaining employment, acceptable family and social interaction. If the abuser    cannot attain or maintain abstinence, family, social, and employment supports    are usually withdrawn at some point. In many cases, one of the results is loss    of housing. The nature of recovery from addictions has been found to likely    include relapses. Most homeless shelters do not allow residents to actively    use alcohol or other substances and therefore many people remain unhoused. When    a person in a shelter relapses, they are evicted and return to living on the    streets.    The most prevalent population includes people who abuse various types of substances.    In responses to survey questions in ""A Snapshot of Homeless People in Phoenix,""    a 1996 survey of homeless people in Phoenix (Morrison Institute for Public Policy,    Arizona State University), 36 percent of the respondents reported abusing alcohol    or other drugs during the previous twelve months. Outreach workers for the regional    behavioral health system estimate between 75 and 80 percent of all unsheltered    single people are suffering from substance abuse. Based on the State Homeless    Coordination Office's July 1998 survey of homeless shelter providers, over 36    percent of homeless adults in families were dealing with substance abuse problems    on the survey night. It is estimated that approximately 5,900 homeless persons    in Maricopa County have substance abuse problems.   2. People with a Serious Mental Illness    Without adequate support, people with serious mental illnesses often stop    taking medication needed to remain stable. When decompensation occurs, and support    is not available, many people with a serious mental illness leave housing, on    their own or through eviction. People with serious mental illnesses are usually    afraid to enter large mass shelters. Most shelters do not have adequate staff    to offer special assistance needed by the seriously mentally ill population.    If in a shelter, people with a serious mental illness that are not taking their    medication, often have difficulty following shelter rules and are evicted.    According to a 1992 National Institute of Mental Health report, an estimated    30 percent of all single homeless adults are seriously mentally ill. The Arizona    Department of Health Services estimates approximately 15 percent of homeless    persons are dually diagnosed as seriously mentally ill and substance abusing.    When these percentages are applied to the homeless population in Maricopa County,    potentially 1,094 homeless individuals are afflicted with a serious mental illness    only. Another 1,137 homeless people could be dually diagnosed with a mental    illness and substance abuse problem. During the State Homeless Coordination    Office's survey of shelters in Maricopa County in July 1998, of the estimated    12,000 homeless 6% or 720 persons could be dually diagnosed and 7% or 840 persons    could be diagnosed having a serious mental illness.     3. People with HIV/AIDS    The Arizona Department of Health Services (ADHS) has concluded, by the year    2000, Maricopa County will have 6,000 reported cases of AIDS. Estimates indicate    4,000 deaths will have occurred and 15,400 persons in Maricopa County will be    living with HIV or AIDS. ADHS also reports persons living with AIDS, in the    future, will be more likely to be people of color and less likely to be homosexual    men. Instead, they will more likely have some histories of Intravenous Drug    Use (IDU) and be women. According to a 1992 National Commission on AIDS report,    approximately 15 percent of homeless single people are HIV/AIDS-infected. A    1995 HIV Consumer Survey conducted by the Arizona AIDS Foundation found 16 percent    of persons in Maricopa County with HIV/AIDS were living on the streets, in a    shelter, or in a treatment center.      People Experiencing the Effects of Trauma    It is estimated that at least half of the women experiencing homelessness    are, or have been, victims of abuse, either as an adult or as a child. In many    cases, homeless youth leave home to escape problems such as physical and sexual    abuse, drug abuse by parents, and severe family conflict. The effects of domestic    violence and other trauma result in severe anxiety and depression, poor health    and nutrition, and low self-esteem.    1. People Who are Victims of Domestic Violence    According to the 1998 State Homeless Coordination Office's point-in-time survey    of shelters, approximately 19 percent of the sheltered family population were    in shelters because they were victims of domestic violence. In addition, the     1997 Arizona Uniform Family Violence Program Report  indicated over 14,397 requests    for service were turned down from domestic violence shelters because of lack    of space. The eight domestic violence shelters in Maricopa County reported providing    50,561 bed nights of shelter last year to about 2,721 women and their children.    During intake, 543 victims reported they had called the police for assistance    during the most recent incidence of domestic violence. It was also reported    95 percent of the perpetrators were arrested for a domestic violence incident.    Service providers and advocates estimate 50 percent of all homeless women have    left their households because of domestic violence.     2. Homeless Youth     Nowhere To Go, A Report on Runaway and Homeless Youth in Arizona  estimates    the total number of runaway and homeless youth in Arizona to be 5,000 each year.    Youth advocates estimate that up to 58 percent, or 2,900 of these youth, reside    in Maricopa County during the course of a year and up to 670 at any point in    time. The Children's Action Alliance estimates that shelters in Arizona turned    away about 4,300 requests for shelter by homeless youth in 1998. There are only    69 emergency beds available throughout Arizona for youth on their own, eight    of which are in Maricopa County. In 1996, 7,831 youth were arrested in Arizona    for running away from home. This number represents a 51% increase in arrests    from 1990.    According to the National Network for Youth and the National Coalition for    the Homeless, an estimated 46% of homeless youth have been physically abused,    and 17% have experienced unwanted sexual activity by a family or household member.    An estimated 66% report having an alcoholic parent. These sources also indicate    youth may become homeless when their families suffer financial crises resulting    from lack of affordable housing, limited employment opportunities, insufficient    wages, no medical insurance, or inadequate welfare benefits. These youth become    homeless with their families, but are late separated from them by shelter, transitional    housing, or child welfare policies. A very high percentage of homeless youth    have had previous institutional placements, as much as twenty percent of youth    arriving at federally funded shelters were previously placed in the last year.     Barriers to Ending Homelessness in Phoenix     Housing is not affordable to people with low incomes . The U.S. Department    of Housing and Urban Development has reported that between 1995 and 1997, rents    increased faster than income for the 20% of people with the lowest incomes in    the nation. The waiting time for subsidized housing in Phoenix is about 56 months.     Low wages and changes in the welfare system have left many families living    in poverty and unable to afford housing . The dollar amount received from    current family welfare benefits (Temporary Assistance to Needy Families - TANF)    and Food Stamps combined give families income, which places them at the Federal    Poverty level. Welfare does not end poverty. Since November 1997, over 12,000    families in Arizona reached the two-year time limit for receiving TANF. Although    moving from ""welfare to work"", most families are earning minimum wage, they    are still living in poverty.    Because of low wages many families struggle to obtain childcare, medical care,    food, and housing. With little income for these necessities, families are in    imminent danger of becoming homeless. In 1998, the U.S. Department of Housing    and Urban Development reported that families with children represented 40% of    the households who are paying more than half of their income for housing or    live in substandard housing. In Fiscal Year 1998-99, the five City of Phoenix    Family Services Centers provided crisis assistance to over 25,000 low-income    families. Without this homeless prevention intervention, many of these families    would have lost their housing.     Homeless people, scattered throughout Maricopa County, have difficulty    learning about and accessing services . Although very visible, the downtown    homeless population represents only a small percentage of the homeless population    in Maricopa County. People in outlying areas aren't aware of assistance or lack    transportation to get assistance. Outreach teams must cover a 9,200 square mile    area in order to reach all of the homeless people in Maricopa County.     Because of funding source restrictions, emergency shelter in Arizona is    only provided to families for up to 3 months during a one-year period . This    means a family can usually stay in only one shelter during the year. If a family    ""does not make it"" at a shelter, they usually return to living on the streets.    Three months is not adequate time to stabilize crisis situations, especially    for chronically homeless families with substance abuse, mental health, life    skills, and employment problems. Many homeless families exiting emergency shelters    do not meet the requirements of transitional housing programs because of lack    of preparation and therefore return to living on the streets.     Safe, decent housing is not affordable for people recovering from homelessness .    Receipt of affordable housing is the single greatest predictor of formerly homeless    persons' ability to remain in housing (Practical Lessons, the 1998 National    Symposium on Homelessness Research, August 1999). People making minimum wages,    especially if they have children, cannot afford deposits and ongoing rental    fees for market rate housing. People living in emergency shelters and transitional    housing programs are required to save money. When they access permanent housing    that is not affordable for them , they are at great risk of recidivism to homelessness    when they run out of savings, experience a crisis, or make a bad decision.    Many homeless people have credit problems and/or criminal records. Most rental    housing will not accept people with a criminal or bad credit history. City of    Phoenix operated housing programs also uses this restriction. The results are    families live doubled up, live in substandard housing, or return to the streets.    Most rental properties require a $25 fee for a credit check. Most homeless people    don't have the money to comply with this requirement. These fees are non-refundable    and have to be paid at each property. Results are families live doubled up,    live in substandard housing, or return to the streets.      The behavioral health system in Maricopa County does not have enough funding    to provide adequate housing and services to the seriously mentally ill population    in Maricopa County . ComCare, the previous Regional Behavioral Health Authority    (RBHA) in Maricopa County estimated there are at least 1,000 homeless seriously    mentally ill people living without housing in the county. Value Options, the    new RBHA, says there are 12,000 people with a serious mental illness in Maricopa    County. They have about 1,000 Shelter + Care or Supportive Housing Program vouchers.       Alcohol and drug abuse treatment is almost nonexistent for homeless people .    Almost all treatment programs are only available to people who have private    insurance coverage, to those who are low income and can pay their portion of    treatment based on income, or who have Arizona Health Care Cost Containment    System (AHCCCS) coverage. Most homeless people have jobs that don't have insurance    as a benefit, or they have zero income, or on AHCCCS because of another disability.    AHCCCS pays for two weeks of treatment.      Monitoring     The Human Services Department performs financial and programmatic monitoring    of all City contracts directed toward assistance for the homeless. The monitoring    process is initiated through a financial desk audit. Each agency completes a    questionnaire regarding internal fiscal policies/procedures and submits back-up    documentation to support a randomly selected monthly expenditure request previously    submitted for reimbursement from the Human Services Department.    An on-site monitoring visit is then made to each agency. The purpose of the    visit is to verify that the Statement of Work for each contract is carried out    according to the contract's provisions. The verification includes interviews    with appropriate fiscal and programmatic agency staff, review of case records,    and inspection of other relevant agency documents. Technical assistance is provided    by the Human Services Department in regard to any findings from the monitoring    or other issues identified by the contractor.    A written report is made for each monitoring. The report includes applicable    findings of compliance and non-compliance with contract requirements. If non-compliance    is found, each incident is identified as a ""Corrective Action"" in the report.    A Corrective Action must be rectified within a specified time frame. Consequences    of not making a correction can include future contract payments to termination    of the contract. The report also identifies ""Recommendations"" for improving    procedures, policies, or activities related to administering or providing the    contracted services. Each monitoring report and correspondence about follow-up    activities are sent to HUD's Phoenix Community Planning and Development Office.       LEAD BASED PAINT     Lead poisoning affects children of every demographic group. Low income families,    however, are disproportionately affected. Housing that has not been adequately    maintained is potentially the most hazardous to young children because of the    likelihood of chipping, peeling or flaking paint. Much of the older housing    stock available to low income families is in this deteriorated condition.    Lead was banned from residential paint in 1978. Housing built before 1978,    therefore, may present a lead hazard if any coat of paint contains lead. It    is not the presence of lead that causes the hazard, however, but in exposure    to the lead through dust or paint chips. Young children most frequently become    exposed by inadvertently ingesting lead containing dust through the course of    normal hand-to-mouth activities. Additionally, children are exposed to these    hazards during the remodeling or the repair or of older homes.    In 1995, 325 cases of elevated blood lead levels were reported statewide.    In 1993 there were 315 cases reported. The 1993 data indicated a 573 percent    jump over previous years, and was largely due to new mandatory screening requirements    for Medicaid-eligible children and perfected screening processes. As can be    seen between the data reported for 1995 compared with1993 the increase is statistically    minor. Of the 325 cases reported in 1995 132 were from the City of Phoenix.    The 1995 data is considered consistent with current year (1999) data available    from the Arizona Department of Health Services with 289 cases reported statewide.    The estimate is that 103 cases were from the City of Phoenix.    The City of Phoenix is committed to providing housing rehabilitation assistance    in a lead safe manner. In that spirit the City is moving rapidly to implement    the new lead hazard control regulations which resulted form section 1012 and    1013 of the Residential Lead-Based Pain Hazard Reduction Act of 1992. In 1999,    the City received its third Lead-Based Paint Hazard Control Grant. The City    is integrating lead hazard control into all of its housing rehabilitation programs    and is working with local nonprofits to train their staff on how to do the same.    Local jurisdictions are being asked by HUD to estimate the number of housing    units within the jurisdiction that are occupied by low or moderate income families    that might contain lead based paint hazards. The information contained in this    document is based on estimates using 1990 Census and were possible augmented    by the 1995 Census update. The following HUD formula was used to extrapolate    the estimated percentage of low income housing with lead based paint.                      Estimated Units                 90 percent of low income housing built        pre-1940        8,300                 80 percent of low income housing built        1940 1959        53,000                 62 percent of low income housing built        1960  1979        72,000                Total       133300          As indicated by the numbers above, it is estimated that 76 percent of the    176,000 low income housing units built prior to 1980 may contain lead based    paint and, therefore, constitute a hazard under HUD guides. Because data is    unavailable to determine what percentage of these units were built prior to    1978 actually house families with young children, this assessment takes the    conservative approach that all households are risk.     The Arizona Department of Health Services (ADHS), in the summer of 1998, conducted    a randomized door to door screening of children less than 6 years old in two    central Phoenix neighborhoods, Garfield and University Park. Garfield is one    of the Neighborhood Initiative Areas (NIC) and University Park is in the Enterprise    Community (EC). The study found that 5.2 percent of children screened had elevated    blood lead levels and that approximately 10 percent of children between the    ages of 12 and 35 months had elevated blood lead levels.          ADHS maintains a statewide lead poisoning registry, which is based on          a passive surveillance system, whereby all elevated blood lead (ebl) levels          are required to be reported by both the physician and the laboratory.          Virtually all lead screening conducted in Arizona is performed by the          state's Medicaid program, the Arizona Health Care Cost Containment System          (AHCCCS). Consequently, rates of lead poisoning among non-AHCCCS eligible          children, including the many children who have no access to health care,          are statistically absent (other than for the study noted above). It is          unknown to what extent the registry rates reflect the rates of lead poisoning          among the total child population. AHCCCS does not release personal identifiers          for non-ebl children and thus ADHS is unable to determine if the number          of children screened is an accurate number. Childhood lead poisoning prevalence          rates, using AHCCCS data, have varied significantly from year to year.          In 1994 the statewide rate was 3.75 percent and the highest rate in Phoenix          was 14.97 percent in a zip code located within the EC. In 1996, the most          recent year for which denominator data is available, the statewide rate          is 1.3 percent and the highest rate in Phoenix was 4.1 percent in the          zip code that includes Garfield, one of the LHCP target areas.

What Is a Consolidated Plan?                                In                  developing a base reuse plan, the diversity of interests and the                  needs of the community must be balanced. Achieving this balance                  requires broad-based strategic planning that will lead to the                  integration of the military property into the local community.                  In many communities, the local needs are identified in the Consolidated                  Plan. By incorporating the planning, application, and reporting                  documents, the Consolidated Plan represents the community's application                  for HUD's four formula grant programs that provide formula funding                  to States and units of general local government. The formula programs                  are:  Community                  Development Block Grant (CDBG) ,  HOME                  Investment Partnerships Program (HOME) ,  Housing                  Opportunities for Persons with AIDS (HOPWA) , and  Emergency                  Shelter Grants (ESG) .                   In                  developing its Consolidated Plan, a community works in a collaborative                  process. It identifies its needs and resources and integrates                  them into a coordinated vision for community development action.                  This planning process acknowledges that local jurisdictions and                  citizens know what is best for their own communities. The Consolidated                  Plan does not represent HUD's plan for a community or former military                  installation. Instead, it is a strategy developed by community-based                  organizations, businesses, nonprofit organizations, religious                  organizations, local government, and interested regional agencies                  working together to effect change and enhance the quality of life                  in their communities.                  The                  Consolidated Plan, which is available on computer disk, is particularly                  useful in base reuse planning because it summarizes the needs                  of the community, the current inventory of services to address                  those needs, and the gaps that remain between the need and the                  current inventory (see  exhibit                  6 ). It consists of the following elements:                                                                     A                    thorough assessment of housing, community, homeless, and economic                    development needs and available resources.                                                  Mapping                    software that provides census data and Federal project files                    on neighborhoods.                                                  A                    3- to 5-year strategy to address priority needs and objectives                    with a timetable to achieve those objectives.                                                  An                    annual funding plan specifying projects and activities the jurisdiction                    will undertake with funds from the four HUD formula programs.                                                                                             How May the LRA Use the Consolidated Plan when Planning Reuse of the Installation?                                The                  Consolidated Plans of the community or communities that constitute                  the LRA are significant existing tools for base reuse planning.                  HUD encourages their use for:                                                                    An                    assessment of community development, economic development, affordable                    housing, and homeless needs.                                                  Current                    statements of community development policy.                                                  Statements                    of local priorities for projects serving individual neighborhoods                    or the community as a whole. The LRA can learn about projects                    and areas receiving or targeted to receive assistance, including                    projects in neighborhoods in the vicinity of the installation.                                                                     Surveys                    of the neighborhoods in the vicinity of the installation through                    use of the mapping software.                                                  An                    estimate of the number of homeless persons and families in the                    community.                                                  Identification                    of homeless assistance providers in the community in the vicinity                    of the installation.                                                  Gaps                    in the current homeless services system.                                                                          How Can the Mapping Software Be Used to Facilitate the Base Reuse Planning Process?                                With                  the mapping software package, staff from the LRA, community leaders,                  and other interested citizens can view maps of the installation                  and neighborhoods in the area. The maps can zoom in on specific                  blocks or neighborhoods, or can be expanded to view an entire                  community (see  exhibit                  7 ). Colored overlays illustrate 1990 census tract information,                  including ethnic concentrations, levels of employment, points                  of interest and local landmarks, and government-assisted projects,                  including street addresses (see  exhibit                  8 ).                   The                  software allows residents to map their own visions for the community.                  Staff from the LRA and other community leaders can use these maps                  to promote their ideas at meetings and public hearings.                  In                  addition, HUD has placed a home page on the Internet accompanied                  by an executive summary of each Consolidated Plan submitted to                  HUD by communities across the country. LRAs and other interested                  persons can use the Internet to learn how other communities are                  planning the reuse of their installations. This technology allows                  for the interchange of innovative ideas on reuse planning.                                             How Can LRAs Gain Access to the Consolidated Plan Mapping Software?                                LRAs                  that represent communities with Consolidated Plans have access                  to this software, usually through the local planning and/or housing                  and community development department(s). The data may be viewed                  with a model 386 personal computer, but a model 486 or more advanced                  personal computer with a color monitor and Windows are necessary                  to manipulate the data.                  Additional                  copies of the software can be purchased for $125.00. In addition                  to the mapping software, the package includes the census data                  and the Federal project files for neighborhoods on disk and CD-ROM.                  To order the software or obtain additional information, interested                  parties should call (800) 998–9999. Local HUD Field Offices                  can provide information on how to use the software (see appendix                  1 for contact information).                                             Are Other Local Plans Useful?                                HUD                  also encourages use of additional planning documents, such as:                                                                                     Strategic                    plans from  Empowerment                    Zones/ Enterprise Communities .                                                  Plans                    for economic development completed by State or local economic                    development authorities, councils of government, municipal or                    county government planning agencies, or chambers of commerce.                                                                     Plans                    for transportation, affordable housing, parks and recreation,                    and public works that have been developed by special purpose                    districts, selected State or local agencies, or nonprofit organizations.                                                                     Functional                    plans and specific proposals for shelter providers, homeless                    assistance coalitions, or religious organizations.                                              Although                  these plans often contain information relevant for preparing the                  redevelopment plan and the homeless assistance submission, HUD                  would be in a position to question information from a source that                  contradicts information in the Consolidated Plan.                                            How May Communities without Consolidated Plans Assess Their Homeless Needs?                                Jurisdictions                  should use other local planning documents, mentioned in the previous                  paragraph, to describe information about the current homeless                  services system and the need that currently is not being met.                  LRAs that represent these jurisdictions are not required to conduct                  surveys of the homeless population. The LRA may use the statements                  of need provided in the NOIs.                                            What Is a Continuum of Care?                                Secretary                  Cisneros designates addressing homelessness through permanent                  solutions as HUD's top priority. To that end, the Department has                  worked toward achieving this goal by encouraging a community-based                  process that provides a comprehensive response to the homeless                  population's different needs. This approach—a Continuum of                  Care—assesses needs, inventories resources, identifies gaps,                  and coordinates public and private resources to fill in the gaps                  and avoid duplication. Sections in the Consolidated Plan are devoted                  to the needs, inventory of resources, and gaps in the homeless                  Continuum of Care.                  A                  local Continuum of Care plan submitted to HUD typically includes                  the following components (see  exhibit 9 ):                                                                                      Outreach                    and assessment to identify an individual's or family's needs                    and make connections to facilities and services.                                                  Immediate                    shelter and safe, decent alternatives to the streets.                                                  Transitional                    housing and necessary social services to include job training                    and placement, substance abuse treatment, short-term mental                    health services, and independent living skills.                                                  Permanent                    housing or permanent supportive housing arrangements.                                              The                  Continuum of Care model is predicated on the concept that homelessness                  is not caused simply by a lack of shelter but rather is typically                  a symptom of a series of unmet needs—for example, serious                  mental illness, chronic substance abuse, unemployment, domestic                  violence, or illiteracy. To help a homeless individual or family                  move toward self-sufficiency, a comprehensive system of housing                  and supportive services is imperative. Because each homeless assistance                  provider's needs vary significantly, the homeless services system                  must address itself to that diversity.                  A                  functioning Continuum of Care system coordinates the resources                  of government agencies and nonprofit organizations, including                  veterans service organizations, housing developers and social                  service providers, neighborhood groups, and the business community                  to assist in providing the specific needs of each homeless subpopulation:                  the jobless, the mentally ill, victims of domestic violence, homeless                  veterans, persons suffering from substance abuse, runaway youth,                  and persons with HIV/AIDS.                  An                  individual who is homeless may need to access several components:                  from emergency shelter and emergency care to transitional housing                  with necessary services to permanent housing. Critical at all                  stages are supportive services, when needed, that allow homeless                  persons and families to move through a Continuum of Care toward                  independent living: case management, housing counseling, job training                  and placement, primary health care, mental health services, substance                  abuse treatment, child care, transportation, emergency food and                  clothing, family violence services, education services, relocation                  services, assistance in obtaining financial support, and referral                  to veterans and legal services.                  Such                  a Continuum of Care system provides multipoint access and linkages                  between settings and service providers. Although not all homeless                  individuals and families in a community will need access to all                  four components, all four components must be coordinated within                  a community to be successful. Also key to the success of a Continuum                  of Care is a strong homelessness prevention strategy. The functioning                  system is one that is interconnected and provides for an individual's                  specific needs, serves all homeless populations, and is coordinated,                  seamless, and balanced.                  To                  assist homeless individuals and families, HUD administers a variety                  of grant programs: Supportive Housing, Shelter Plus Care, Moderate                  Rehabilitation for Single Room Occupancy, and HOPWA (see  appendix                  2 ). To encourage localities to conduct comprehensive planning,                  HUD requires applicants to develop a Continuum of Care plan. To                  obtain information about applying for assistance under these programs,                  please call (800) 998–9999.                                             Why Is Continuum of Care Important to the Base Reuse Planning Process?                                A                  Continuum of Care plan contains extensive assessments of local                  homeless needs and summaries of available resources as well as                  unmet needs, that is, gaps in services or shelter. Therefore,                  the plan can serve as the information basis for understanding                  how a military installation might be used to meet some of the                  needs of homeless persons. This information can save the LRA much                  time and expense.                  The                  LRA should attempt to ensure that the reuse activities proposed                  by homeless assistance providers are coordinated with the existing                  Continuum of Care. In the hypothetical example of a Consolidated                  Plan (see  exhibit 10 ), the emergency                  shelter component of the Continuum of Care has a low priority                  in the community and the community intent is not to spend any                  additional funding to expand it.                   Presumably,                  the community has sufficient emergency shelter beds to address                  current needs and has decided to focus its attention on the other                  components of the Continuum of Care. Following this example, if                  the LRA received six NOIs during the outreach process—one                  for an emergency shelter, three for transitional housing, and                  two for permanent housing—it would be inconsistent with the                  Consolidated Plan and the Continuum of Care for the LRA to support                  the request for emergency shelter.                                                                                                                                                                                 Content updated October 29, 2001                                                                                                                                    Back to top                                                                                                                U.S. Department of   Housing and Urban Development               451 7th Street S.W.,   Washington, DC 20410               Telephone: (202) 708-1112     TTY: (202) 708-1455               Find the address of a HUD office near you                                                                           Privacy Policy                           Home

Menino Mayor, City of Boston    Table of Contents  Introduction Strategic Homeless Planning Group Background and Findings Recommendations Next Steps Acknowledgements  Page 1 Page 4 Page 6 Page 13 Page 30 Page 31  1   November 2000 Dear Friends: With our economy booming and our neighborhoods thriving, and unemployment and crime rates dropping to new record lows, it should come as no surprise to anyone that Boston is enjoying an economic and cultural Renaissance. However, in Boston, this economic upswing also has a downside. In spite of the great prosperity we are experiencing, low and middle income wage earners are struggling to find housing in our City because the housing market is becoming increasingly unaffordable. We are seeing more working people becoming homeless because of high rents and low vacancy rates. Last year, our homeless shelters were over capacity every month of the year for the first time in our city's history. Boston is recognized as a national leader in homeless services and housing. However, we still need more help. The federal government has reduced the amount of funding for homeless programs in Boston by 37% since 1995 and state funding for affordable housing has also decreased. Working together with the community of homeless providers, advocates and consumers, my administration is tackling the problems of homelessness head on with a new 5-year strategic plan. Our plan intends to end homelessness for thousands of individuals and families by expanding the supply and access to permanent affordable housing that is targeted to the homeless; expand the employment opportunities and economic services to assist homeless people to become more self-sufficient; prevent homelessness through improved discharge planning and on-going coordination among state and local criminal justice and social service agencies; maintain and strengthen the existing infrastructure and current capacity of Boston's homeless system; improve coordination and collaboration; and advocate with Federal, State and Local governments to increase public awareness and access to mainstream resources. I am proud of the City's commitment to improving the lives of homeless people. This plan will be implemented by many stakeholders, as listed in our document. As Mayor, I will continue to guarantee that there is a shelter bed for each person who needs one, and that my administration will continue to look at how mainstream resources can be utilized to end homelessness. Sincerely,  Thomas M. Menino, Mayor City of Boston 2   Introduction Over the course of the past 15 years, Boston has created a vast network to combat homelessness. These efforts have resulted in a homeless system that is comprehensive and accessible, guaranteeing a shelter bed and emergency services for each homeless person every night. Boston has served as a national model of innovation. Yet, despite the best efforts of Boston's dedicated homeless advocates, service providers and a City of Boston Homeless Census concerned City government, the incidence of homelessness is still rising. From 1989 to 1999, the number of homeless people counted in the City of Boston's annual 6000 Increase of 52% Homeless Census rose from 3,830 to 5000 5,820, a 52 percent increase. Number of Homeless People  There are a number of factors that have converged to create this critical situation. A 3000 booming economy has put high demands 3830 2000 on an already tight housing market. Real wages for the least skilled sector of the 1000 population have not risen with the cost of 0 living, sapping the resources of individuals 1989 and families struggling to get by. In addition, the impact of significant policy changes such as welfare reform and the statewide end of rent control has also brought pressure to bear on the housing market. To make matters worse, the amount of federal housing funds targeted to homeless individuals and families channeled into Boston has decreased significantly in recent years. In 1995, the City of Boston received $19.5 million in federal homeless McKinney funds.1 By 1999, that amount had decreased by 37 percent. During this same period, the amount of state funding dedicated to supporting affordable housing has also decreased. These reductions do not correspond to a decreasing need for shelter and services among homeless individuals and families. In fact, the reduction in funding has forced the City to make difficult decisions about whether or not to continue funding existing homeless programs that provide needed services or to develop new and innovative ones to meet emerging needs. In addition, existing State human services policies, especially those related to discharge planning for emergency medical services or long-term institutionalization, have resulted in Boston's shelter system becoming a ""safety net"" for various State agencies at a time when Boston's homeless services can ill afford an additional burden.  4000  5820  1999 Years  1  McKinney homeless funds are administered by the US Department of Housing and Urban and Development to support housing and services for homeless individuals and families.  3   Consequently, there has been a growing recognition among homeless advocates, service providers and City of Boston officials that it would not be possible to adequately address the problem of homelessness with homelesstargeted resources alone. With this recognition it became clear that a more comprehensive community-wide planning process was needed. This process would have to look beyond McKinney funds to mainstream resources and other funding opportunities, as well as policy and programmatic changes, such as solutions to homelessness. Recognizing that the crisis of affordable housing in Boston had an impact beyond the scope of the SHPG, Mayor Thomas M. Menino convened a Housing Advisory Panel of housing advocates, developers, academics and City officials to formulate a comprehensive housing strategy in the Spring of 2000. Their report, Leading The Way: A Housing Strategy For Boston, will serve as the functional blueprint for the City's housing efforts to increase production and preserve existing affordable housing over the next three years. In addition, Leading The Way calls on various City, State and Federal partners to increase their commitment to affordable housing production and preservation and to aid the City in creative problem-solving. The SHPG Report is a important part of the City's overall housing strategy, as it is a blueprint for directly addressing the needs of the population most vulnerable to the vicissitudes of the affordable housing crisis, homeless people. Many of the recommendations of the SHPG regarding permanent housing were incorporated into Leading The Way: A Housing Strategy For Boston. The six (6) major recommendations developed by the SHPG call for alterations in policy, reconfigurations of existing services, and creative public/private partnerships as part of a comprehensive effort to better meet the needs of Boston's homeless individuals and families. In summary, these recommendations are to:  From 1990 to 1997, the number of homeless families increased an estimated 100 percent and the number of homeless individuals increased by an estimated 70 percent.  From A Profile of Housing in Massachusetts, UMASS  1. Expand the supply of and access to permanent affordable housing; 2. Expand employment opportunities and economic services to assist homeless people in becoming self-sufficient; 3. Prevent homelessness through improved discharge planning and on-going coordination among State and local criminal justice and social service agencies; 4. Maintain and strengthen the existing infrastructure and current capacity of Boston's homeless system; 5. Improve coordination and collaboration among homeless providers to meet the needs of under-served populations; and 6. Advocate with Federal, State and local agencies to increase public awareness and access to mainstream resources. 4   The body of this report presents a plan designed to help Boston's homeless individuals and families negotiate their way through a system designed to move people to economic independence and self-sufficiency. It is the culmination of a sometimes difficult, but ultimately rewarding process in which diverse individuals and constituencies found common ground in pursuit of a common goal. The process of preparing this report has already yielded outcomes  including important changes in policies  that will have an impact on homeless individuals and families. The SHPG recognizes that traditional sources of revenue and resources alone cannot solve the problem of rising homelessness. This report calls for an authentic public/private partnership to be established. This partnership must focus the skills and resources of the business community on behalf of Boston's homeless men, women, and children. While the SHPG Report also recognizes that success in combating homelessness will not come without the continued dedicated efforts of those people and organizations already working on behalf of Boston's homeless individuals and families, it calls upon those who have not participated previously to join this critical effort. Homelessness has not been vanquished in the City of Boston; the economic good times that have been beneficial to so many have not translated into personal financial success for the most vulnerable of the citizenry. The time to take action is now, while the resources of a burgeoning economy are available for new applications that will benefit the homeless and the under-served.  5   Strategic Homeless Planning Group In 1998, representatives of City government, service providers, advocates, formerly homeless people, and other community stakeholders established the Strategic Homeless Planning Group (SHPG) to address growing concerns about rising homelessness in Boston. SHPG's mission has always been clear  to work collaboratively to move the city's planning efforts to the next level  one where larger issues of state and regional policy, as well as obstacles to the production and provision of housing and services for the homeless could more effectively be addressed. The charge of the SHPG was to:   ensure that Boston's overall homeless planning and policy decisions included meaningful input from a wide range of key entities; and identify innovative strategies, including the use of mainstream resources, to address homelessness in Boston.  -State Agencies -Local Government Agencies -Non-Profit Organizations -Foundations  Emergency Shelter Commission  Homeless Planning Committee Department of Neighborhood Development  STRATEGIC HOMELESS PLANNING GROUP  -Businesses -Banks -Neighborhood Groups -Educational/Health Institutions  Homeless Prevention Committee  Outreach, Emergency Shelter, and Transitional Programs Committee  Housing Search, Permanent Housing, and Stabilization Services Committee  Income, Employment, and Related Supports Committee  Health Care Committee  Consumer Involvement Committee  The City's Emergency Shelter Commission, Homeless Planning Committee and staff of the Department of Neighborhood Development (DND) coordinated the SHPG planning efforts by facilitating buy-in and legitimacy for the recommendations from community leaders and City officials. Over the course of the planning process, they have been in touch with key City of Boston officials, such as Boston Mayor Thomas M. Menino and Charlotte Golar Richie, Chief of Housing and DND's Director. Throughout the planning process, this level of informed discourse with and access to senior City officials allowed for a constant system of ""reality checking"" and streamlined the approval of this report by the City of Boston. 6   SHPG Planning Process The complexity of Boston's homeless service provider and advocacy system required that planning occur on many different organizational levels and within a variety of different structures. Given this level of complexity, the SHPG planning process relied heavily on committees2 composed of key stakeholders in a particular field for the majority of the important analysis and review. These committee members met often in their efforts to develop the recommendations contained in this report. The committees often consulted with key informants from the community with expertise in specific areas, such as workforce development. This approach maximized participation by a wider range of community players. In addition, it made the best use of each individual's talents, skills, and community standing  ensuring that the planning process was meaningful.  Guiding Principles of the SHPG Planning Process  Expand permanent housing and service resources to prevent and end homelessness among adults and children. Expand access to mainstream housing, employment, and service resources wherever possible for people who become, or are at risk of becoming, homeless while recognizing the continued need for targeted resources for individuals and families who become homeless. Promote strategies for long-term and permanent solutions to prevent and end homelessness while maintaining a commitment to meet peoples' basic needs of shelter, food, and clothing. Promote coordination of state and local policies and resources to comprehensively support people who become, or are at risk of becoming, homeless. Prioritize strategies that prevent adults and children from becoming homeless. Prioritize strategies that assist adults and children who have become, or are at risk of becoming, homeless to access and maintain safe, decent, and affordable housing. Increase public awareness of the tragedy of homelessness and combat the stigma often associated with homelessness. Emphasize performance and outcomes and build upon what works. Involve people who have become homeless, or are at risk of becoming homeless, in the decisions necessary to regain housing stability and basic quality of life, in particular by building upon people's assets and encouraging personal responsibility. Include people who have become homeless in on-going planning, implementation, and monitoring activities to achieve the goal of preventing and ending homelessness. Employ strategies that embrace regional solutions to prevent and end homelessness                   2  The six committees focused on discrete components of Boston's homeless system including: homeless prevention; outreach, emergency shelter, and transitional programs; permanent housing (including search and stabilization services and permanent supportive housing); income, employment, and related supports; integrated health care; and consumer involvement.  7   Background and Findings Boston's Homeless Individuals and Families Every winter, the City of Boston tries to gather a complete picture of who is homeless in Boston to determine barriers they face to achieving and maintaining permanent housing. On December 13 th, 1999, there were 3,665 individuals in the adult shelter system, and an additional 250 individuals not accessing shelters and living on the street. There were 1,905 men, women, and children in the family shelter system as well. Each homeless person is different and has become homeless due to a unique set of circumstances. Many people become homeless due to lack of income. According to a recent University of Massachusetts statewide survey, over one third of those homeless individuals surveyed had no source of income. For homeless families, the situation was similar with almost one third of these families lacking income and over half receiving only public assistance.  Characteristics of Homeless Individuals and Families* Homeless Individuals:               The majority (78%) of homeless individuals are men; The average age of an individual shelter consumer is 39. 12% are ages 24 or under and 8 percent are over 55; More than one-quarter are employed, either exclusively or in conjunction with public assistance. Men are more likely than women to be employed; youth are more likely to be working than adults or elders; Over 50% have no high school diploma or GED; Over one-third (32%) have no source of income; An additional 41% receive public assistance including SSI/SSDI and food stamps. The average age of the head of household is 32; 69% of homeless families are single or have never been married; Almost 30% of homeless families report having no source of income and an additional 50% receive TAFDC. 15% of homeless families report income from employment; Over 60% of family heads have not completed high school or received a GED; Almost two thirds of homeless families consist of a parent and 1-2 children. * According to a UMASS survey of 8,411 unduplicated individuals and 1,022 unduplicated families accessing over 140 homeless programs statewide.

Over the years, a broad network of shelter and service providers, housing organizations, state agencies, and advocacy and planning groups have worked in concert with city officials to develop a system of care that meets the varied and complex needs of homeless people. As a result, Boston's existing homeless system incorporates the full range of housing and services designed to address the needs of homeless individuals and families. Combined these services provide Boston's homeless individuals and families with access to a ""safety net"" of services and supports that ensures a shelter bed each night, support services, and the increased availability of employment and permanent housing opportunities.  Transitional  Hospital  Shelters  9   Boston's homeless services today include short-term emergency shelters, transitional housing (generally up to 24 month maximum length of stay), and permanent housing (including permanent supportive housing). Boston has also developed an array of supportive services enabling homeless individuals and families to make the transition from the street and shelters to permanent housing and from dependence on supportive services to selfsufficiency. These supportive services are the critical link in moving homeless persons along the continuum of services at a pace and scale appropriate to their individualized needs and circumstances. Services are funded through a variety of different mechanisms, including City, State, and Federal resources as well as foundation grants and in-kind donations.

Causes of Homelessness Unfortunately, these services and efforts have not completely offset the effects of an extremely tight housing market and recent social changes. Implementation of welfare reform, the statewide abolition of rent control, and changes in federal housing policies have converged at a time when an economic boom had already begun to have an effect on Boston's housing prices. The resulting affordable housing crisis has been most keenly felt by those already homeless and those individuals and families who were just managing to get by. According to the most recent data, there are 5,820 homeless people and 26,300 individuals and families at risk of homelessness in Boston. 10   Housing Market Over the past few years, Boston has seen unprecedented economic growth resulting in a significant decrease in the unemployment rate. This positive growth, however, has had a negative effect on the housing market. A recent report from the US Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) documented that the cost of new homes in Boston has increased 45 percent over the past five years  the highest increase in the country. The market is tight for renters as well. Currently, Boston has the nation's fourth highest market with a median rent of $1,465. Combined with the repeal of rent control, the booming market has led to intense competition for existing rental housing and a dramatic increase in the costs associated with buying a home. Recent data gathered by housing advocates documents that the vacancy rate is as low as 1 percent in some Boston neighborhoods. In the Fenway/Kenmore Square area, for example, the median rent for a one-bedroom apartment in 1999 was $1,350. Making matters worse is the number of owners of affordable housing developments that have decided not to renew contracts with HUD, thus allowing these owners to increase rents dramatically. As mentioned earlier, the reduction of federal funding directed to the city is another major barrier to maintaining affordable housing options. Between 1994 and 1997, federal funding for housing in Massachusetts was cut by 12 percent, or $28 million. The city has spent a considerable amount of resources dealing with the effects of these changes. For example, this past year the city committed over $2.5 million to preserve over 400 units of affordable housing. Even when housing is available and a household can afford the rent payment, there are barriers that make it difficult to obtain and maintain the housing. The move -in costs of first and last month's rent plus a security deposit are a formidable barrier to poor individuals and families that have difficulty making ends meet each month. Once in housing, any crisis, such as job loss, health emergency, or alcohol or drug relapse, can cause the household to begin the spiral back into homelessness.  ""Since 1991, the median advertised rent for a twobedroom Boston apartment has exploded by 77 percent..."" -From The Boston Globe, September 17, 2000.  The average worker in Boston needs to work 135 hours each week to be able to afford a modest twobedroom apartment priced at HUD's Fair Market Rent.  From National Low Income Housing Coalition  11   Policy Changes Another issue contributing to the problem is welfare reform, which was implemented in December of 1998 and has led to housing affordability problems for many of Boston's low-income families. The most recent UMASS study4 documents that 29 percent of homeless families have no income source. This is a dramatic increase from the past year's figure of 11 percent. National studies have also shown that a substantial number of these families are either at risk of, or living in poverty, and are facing hardships such as having trouble paying for food, utility bills, and rent. In addition, strict income limits at state-funded family shelters make it difficult for working homeless families to access shelter. Although these income limits were recently increased, many families are still in a ""no win"" situation, since they do not earn enough to pay rent, yet earn too much to be able to enter shelters. Finally, recent years have seen a dramatic increase in the number of individuals entering the shelter system from correctional facilities, hospitals, and mental health institutions. A 1997 survey documented that approximately 19 percent of emergency shelter residents had been incarcerated within the past 12 months,5 and homeless providers report that this percentage has increased significantly over the past few years. Much of this increase is due to inappropriate and inadequate discharge planning from state facilities. In sum, despite the efforts of dedicated service providers and the existence of many effective programs, Boston's homeless system is still not meeting the needs of all homeless individuals and families nor is it adequately funded. Within this climate, McKinney resources can no longer be expected to be the sole funding to support the homeless system. Instead, it is only through the coordination of all resources targeted toward homeless families and individuals with the addition of new mainstream resources that Boston can truly be effective in addressing this crisis with an eye toward moving people into stable housing.  A person with a disability receiving Supplemental Security Income (SSI) has to spend over 146 percent of their monthly income to be able to afford a modest one-bedroom apartment in Boston.

Boston's Recent Efforts to Address the Affordable Housing Crisis As mentioned earlier, the City recently released Leading the Way outlining Boston's housing strategy for the next three years. Under Mayor Menino's leadership, this three-year campaign will unify and focus all of the city's housing agencies around a comprehensive strategy to advance key objectives: produce new housing at all income levels and preserve as much of the city's affordable housing as possible. The key objectives included in Leading the Way strengthen and enhance those recommendations and action steps outlined by the SHPG.  ______________________________________________________________ 4  Meschede, et al, A Comparative Portrait of Individuals and Families Utilizing Massachusetts Emergency Shelter Programs, 1999.

McCormack Institute of Public Affairs at University at Massachuestts, Boston, MA.  12   Leading the Way and the work of the SHPG are just a few of the City of Boston's proactive efforts to address the growing number of homeless citizens. In 1999, Mayor Menino designated the newly appointed Director of the Department of Neighborhood Development to serve at the cabinet level as Chief of Housing. He had filled this position with Charlotte Golar Richie, a State Representative who had served as the Chair of the Joint Committee on Housing and Urban Development. In addition, he established a weekly forum for communication between key City agencies to discuss housing production, preservation and key development issues, including permitting. The Mayor also appointed a new Housing Advisory Committee made up of businesses, foundations, homeless providers, banks, realtors, and housing developers. Their recommendations became the basis of the strategy to increase permanent affordable housing options in Boston. Lastly, the Mayor has utilized innovative strategies to supplement the dwindling pipeline of State and Federal dollars. Not only has he proposed to raise the linkage fee, but he has also pledged to use the funds raised from the proceeds of the sale of the former police headquarters on Berkeley St. to create affordable housing. Boston's innovations in dealing with and focus on creating solutions for the housing crisis has not gone unnoted. The City has been recognized by the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) for many of its achievements in addressing the needs of homeless people. Some of these achievements include:  Boston Rental Assistance Fund: a flexible fund used to address a variety of the barriers that prevent homeless people from getting into permanent housing - such as first and last month's rent, security deposit, moving expenses, broker's fees,  as well as providing up to one year of limited rental assistance; Homeless Set-Aside Clearinghouse: a formal referral system that links homeless people to housing units that have been set aside specifically for this use; Connection, Service, and Partnership through Technology (CSP Tech): a management information system that tracks the homeless population in order to provide information to planners who are allocating programs and services to homeless households; and Emergency Shelter Security Deposit Funds : funds administered jointly by the Boston Housing Authority and the Emergency Shelter Commission to pay security deposits directly to landlords on behalf of homeless families.        Advocacy groups, such as the Massachusetts Housing and Shelter Alliance, the Massachusetts Coalition for the Homeless, and Homes for Families have also been key players in the fight to preserve and expand housing opportunities. They have been successful in advocating for changes at the state and federal level to address many of the causes of homelessness, such as inappropriate and inadequate discharge planning.  13   These efforts by advocacy groups and City officials are important and their impact on the availability of housing for homeless people is significant. However, more work needs to be done to address all the factors that affect homeless individuals and families  not just the supply of affordable housing  and the City of Boston can't do it alone. The recommendations included in this report provide an action plan for City and State officials, advocates, and non-profit housing and service providers to work collaboratively to end homelessness  Recommendations People who are poor and homeless face many obstacles that perpetuate their poverty and prevent them from achieving self-sufficiency. Limited access to affordable housing, employment opportunities, and health care  including substance abuse treatment, HIV/AIDS education, and mental health counseling  keep thousands of individuals and families dependent on shelters and supportive services. As part of their efforts, the SHPG developed a vision for Boston's ideal homeless system. The vision stated: The City of Boston is committed to assisting every adult and child who becomes homeless or is at risk of becoming homeless to regain housing stability and quality of life. Toward this end, Boston will continue to implement and expand a comprehensive homeless system to prevent and end the tragedy of homelessness among all individuals and families. This vision guided the development of the six major long-range recommendations presented in this report including:  1. Expand the supply of and access to permanent affordable housing; 2. Expand employment opportunities and economic services to assist homeless people in becoming self-sufficient; 3. Prevent homelessness through improved discharge planning and on-going coordination among State and local criminal justice and social service agencies; 4. Maintain and strengthen the existing infrastructure and current capacity of Boston's homeless system; 5. Improve coordination and collaboration among homeless providers to meet the needs of under-served populations; and 6. Work with Federal, State, and local agencies to increase public awareness and access to mainstream resources. 14   Major Recommendation  The availability of permanent affordable housing is one of the most critical gaps in the homeless system. Without an adequate supply of affordable housing, and the ability to access this housing, movement through the homeless shelter system is hindered. Low-income housing is in short supply throughout the city. As mentioned earlier, the amount of federal and state funding for affordable housing has decreased significantly in recent years. Making the situation even worse, Boston's recent economic boom has had a negative impact on the housing market by leading to intense competition for existing rental housing. Within this high cost housing market it is imperative that efforts are made to both preserve existing affordable housing  such as SROs targeted to lowincome individuals  as well as to develop new affordable housing and expand the availability of rental assistance programs. The development of low-income housing is a long-term process and fraught with difficulty on a number of levels. Aside from the difficulty of finding suitable and available land, and overcoming neighborhood barriers that often arise in the siting of these developments, a major obstacle has been the lack of commitment among experienced developers to create projects that serve very low and extremely low-income households. Without incentives  such as project based rental subsidies from funders (including the City, State, and private lenders)  these developers have little interest in developing affordable housing for homeless individuals and families. There is interest among non-profit homeless provider organizations in creating this type of affordable housing, but although they have passion and dedication, these organizations often lack the experience and skills necessary to develop housing for homeless individuals and families. Strengthening and building the capacity of non-profit organizations is critical to the success of future funding initiatives leading to the development of more permanent low-income housing. It has long been recognized that nonprofit organizations build some of the best low-income housing in Boston, but this is not an easy task since it requires highly skilled and dedicated people to achieve this goal. Building capacity means providing training in matters related to housing finance, land use law, architecture, construction, and public policy. It means developing the skills to work with individuals, neighborhood groups, and institutions that will be affected by future development. It also means securing the funding necessary to develop decent wage and benefit packages, and to access technical assistance and the support necessary to maximize efficiency and streamline the development process.  1  Expand Supply of and Access to Permanent Affordable Housing  15   Specific Action Steps 1. Produce New Rental/Low-Income Housing. After analyzing data on the utilization of existing programs, and reviewing the demand for permanent affordable housing, the SHPG recommends a production goal of 300 units of housing in the next year, and a total of 1,500 over the next five years. These units can be produced via these action steps:  Require the City to provide an annual commitment (dependent upon interest and capacity of developers) towards the production of permanent housing for homeless people and prioritize housing development projects that include housing for homeless people. Additional City resources set-aside for housing production should include funds earmarked for the development of homeless housing. Responsible Parties: Department of Neighborhood Development and Boston Housing Authority.  Require the Boston Housing Authority (BHA) to continue to set-aside annually 100 Section 8 project based subsidies and to implement a policy that designates homelessness as a Priority 1 category for the Section 8 tenant-based program. Responsible Party : Boston Housing Authority. 2. Build successful working partnerships with the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. The permanent housing crisis extends throughout the Greater Boston region and beyond. The burden and the responsibility to address its causes and find solutions lies within all area governments. While the City of Boston and other local governments often jointly fund permanent housing development projects with the state Department of Housing and Community Development (DHCD), this is usually on a ""hit or miss"" basis with little coordination. Given the magnitude of Boston's current affordable housing crisis, a more thoughtful, proactive, and coordinated effort is required to develop permanent housing specifically targeted to homeless individuals and families. This joint effort should include the development of a clear structural linkage between the city and DHCD with collaboration around funding strategies, funding set-asides, resources, and other pro-active attempts to increase the supply of permanent housing for homeless individuals and families. Efforts must be made to establish close working partnerships with DHCD to gain its active participation in the development of housing for homeless individuals and families. Specifically, the SHPG recommends:  16     Replicate successful City programs at the State level by: requiring DHCD to establish a 10 percent set-aside for homeless people in all DHCD-funded housing development projects; amend its Low Income Housing Tax Credit allocation plan to prioritize projects that serve homeless people; and allocate Section 8 project based subsidies targeted to homeless people. Responsible Parties: Massachusetts Housing and Shelter Alliance, Homes for Families, Massachusetts Coalition for the Homeless, Citizens Housing and Planning Association, AIDS Housing Corporation, with Department of Neighborhood Development.  3. Encourage Community Development Corporations (CDCs), non-profit organizations, and for-profit developers to develop housing for homeless people. The development of permanent housing for homeless individuals and families cannot be achieved without the active participation of the city's experienced Community Development Corporations and other non- and forprofit developers. Unfortunately, these key players have not been active in the development of housing for this population. The City of Boston must create incentives to encourage these agencies to actively pursue the development of permanent housing for homeless individuals and families. To this end, the City of Boston should engage the CDCs, non-profit organizations, and for-profit developers in a dialogue to create partnerships, address barriers to development, create appropriate incentives, and brainstorm around creative development strategies. Responsible Party : Department of Neighborhood Development. 4. Increase access to vacant units by homeless individuals and families. Even when a homeless person receives a Section 8 voucher or other form of rental assistance, the current housing market has made it virtually impossible to locate a vacant unit in which that voucher can be used. To address this dilemma, the SHPG recommends:  Develop a flexible security deposit and shallow rental subsidy program.  Responsible Parties: Massachusetts Housing and Shelter Alliance, Massachusetts Non-Profit Housing Association, Department of Housing and Community Development, Metropolitan Boston Housing Partnership, and Boston Housing Authority.  17     Provide outreach and education to owners of rental property and realtors regarding the benefits and misconceptions of the Section 8 program. Target those owners that have accessed home repair funds in an effort to expand the number of safe and decent units eligible for Section 8 tenant based subsidies. Responsible Parties: Metropolitan Boston Housing Partnership, Boston Housing Authority, Boston Rental Housing Resource Center, and Boston Office of Civil Rights.  5. Build successful working partnerships with the private sector. City and other public resources cannot alone meet the permanent housing need of Boston's residents. This can only be accomplished through an improved and expanded partnership with the private sector agencies and resources. Innovative partnerships need to be formed in order to increase the development of housing for homeless individuals and families either directly through the private sector or indirectly through resources raised by the private sector. Specifically, the SHPG recommends:  Create a pool of money to provide below-market loans and grants to allow the City to produce additional affordable housing by increasing the private contribution to affordable housing developments. Some of these units will be available and accessible to homeless individuals and families. Responsible Party : Private lenders and area institutions. 6. Create a siting policy committee composed of homeless advocates, non-profit housing developers, CDCs, City staff, and other appropriate persons in order to develop clear and concise siting policies for City-funded developments. Communities are often reluctant to accept the development of new permanent housing in their neighborhoods, especially housing for homeless or special needs populations. This reluctance is often the result of ignorance regarding a particular population or housing development; fear of declining property values; or overall discrimination. However, a recent HUD report found that supportive housing projects actually had a positive impact on the property values in the surrounding neighborhood. Leadership is needed to disseminate this type of information, educate citizens about the positive impact of high quality supportive housing, and to facilitate the creation of new housing by assisting developers with understanding the steps involved in siting a housing development. Leadership efforts would include education regarding various populations and information regarding the actual impact of these developments on property values. Fair Housing laws should be incorporated into the siting policy to guard against discrimination. Responsible Party : Department of Neighborhood Development.  18   Major Recommendation  Expand Employment Opportunities and Economic Services to Assist Homeless People to Become Self-Sufficient Incomes for most homeless people, and those at risk of homelessness, are usually woefully inadequate for meeting their basic needs, especially housing. Whether from work or public benefits, the income of poor people has not kept pace with the cost of living for the past two decades. As a result, the ability to remain housed for poor households has been significantly undermined. Ultimately, the major obstacle to decent, affordable housing is the reality that the majority of jobs in Boston accessible to homeless people do not pay a wage that enables them to afford housing. Reducing homelessness necessitates assisting those who are homeless or at risk of homelessness to gain access to jobs with wages that pay enough to cover real living costs. In order to compete in today's evolving job market, many homeless people need job training or re-training, followed by aggressive placement into ""living wage"" jobs. Moreover, due to their unique circumstances, training and placement for homeless people must also be matched by basic services such as appropriate clothing, literacy training, as well as more intensive services such as child care, ongoing job mentoring, counseling, and substance abuse treatment. Under the federal Workforce Investment Act (WIA), the climate is changing and workforce development policies are in transition. The decisions that are made under the WIA will have an enduring impact on the accessibility of ""living wage"" jobs for homeless people. Thus it is critical that the employment needs of the homeless population are represented when setting the policies and implementation strategies under the WIA.  2  Specific Action Steps The following action steps are designed to reduce barriers for homeless individuals and families in their effort to find and keep employment and housing. 1. Create a comprehensive assessment tool and process for homeless individuals and families seeking employment. Many people have multiple barriers to employment including: child care issues, physical limitations, mental health, domestic violence or substance abuse issues, developmental delays, or travel restrictions. In an effort to maximize a person's employment potential these issues should be uncovered and triaged to the appropriate sources as quickly as possible. Responsible Party : SHPG Income and Employment Committee.  19   2. Appoint representation to the City of Boston Workforce Investment Act Steering Committee who will advocate for the specific and unique needs of homeless people and increase access to mainstream employment resources. The Workforce Investment Act restructures the Job Training Partnership Act to incorporate a regional approach to workforce development. Soon after President Clinton signed the WIA into law, the Department of Labor and Workforce Development was designated as the lead agency responsible for the WIA implementation in MA. The City of Boston has been designated a ""workforce investment area"" and as such, has convened a City of Boston Workforce Investment Board under the WIA. Mayor Menino should appoint this representative. Responsible Party : Mayor Thomas Menino. 3. Engage the corporate world as partners in employment. Currently, the corporate world is not ""hire-ready"" for low skill population and they are facing a lack of labor because of this skill shortage. To engage them as partners in the employment of homeless individuals the issues must be redefined as labor shortage, labor recruitment, and retention. There are many ways to establish new partnerships with the corporate world including:  Provide technical assistance to employers interested in hiring lowincome people including advising businesses about the characteristics and needs of homeless people; strategizing about outreach to other businesses; and inviting employers to participate on advisory panels and boards of local job readiness programs. Responsible Parties: Private Industry Council, Jobs and Community Services, and homeless economic providers.  Link the WIA Steering Committee and the City's Homeless Planning Committee by conducting cross training and fostering joint strategic planning to ensure that homeless people have access to new restructured workforce development resources. Responsible Parties: Workforce Investment Act Steering Committee, Emergency Shelter Commission, and Homeless Planning Committee.  Raise visibility through an advertising campaign that highlights the long-term advantages of investment in the low-skill population. Encourage corporate participation through the establishment of a Mayoral Award for businesses that have demonstrated a commitment to employing homeless people. Responsible Parties: Jobs and Community Services ; Mayor Menino.  20     Create a handbook of helpful tips for interested employers on how to build a supportive workplace environment and infrastructure. Responsible Parties: Non-profit economic development providers.  3. Promote brokering services to ensure effective coordination. Employment services for homeless individuals are fragmented and often ineffective.  Advocate for the continued funding of collaborative support models  like PATH in New York City  and assess whether such model could work and be funded in Boston. Responsible Parties: Project Hope and Impact Employment Services.  Pressure state agencies to forge collaborations on behalf of homeless people. Employment services for homeless people are often fragmented underlining the need for holistic and integrated planning at the State level. Responsible Party: Massachusetts Housing and Shelter Alliance.  Recommendation  3  Prevent Homelessness through Improved Discharge Planning and On-Going Coordination among State and Local Criminal Justice and Social Service Agencies  For some of Boston's low-income individuals and families, the line between being housed and homeless is very thin. Without strong, prevention programs, Boston's homeless population would increase exponentially. Prevention is the most cost-effective and successful mechanism for ensuring that individuals and families never need access to the ""safety net"" of services comprising Boston's homeless system. Boston has developed numerous prevention programs ranging from rental arrearages and utility assistance to food banks. In aggregate, these programs work to address the many causes of homelessness in order to help individuals and families maintain their housing. However, as mentioned earlier, there are an estimated 26,300 people currently at-risk of becoming homeless. Combined with the recent social policy changes mentioned earlier, welfare reform and owners ""opting out"" of existing HUD contracts, there has been an increased demand for prevention services over the past few years. In addition, for some sub-populations, such as people with mental illness and youth, homelessness becomes a reality due to inappropriate and inadequate discharge planning on behalf of facilities managed by the state human services agencies (including substance abuse facilities, inpatient mental health institutions, correctional facilities, hospitals, and youth services).  Major  21   Specific Action Steps 1. Develop discharge policies and procedures including the development of step-down resources  for each state and local human service agency to ensure that people leaving their facilities receive appropriate and adequate discharge planning and placement in stable housing. Adequate and appropriate discharge planning from institutional settings (such as mental health facilities, hospitals, jails and other correctional facilities) is a vital part of any successful homeless prevention strategy. Agencies that should be targeted in this effort include: Department of Mental Health, Department of Public Health, Division of Medical Assistance, Massachusetts Behavioral Health Partnership, Department of Corrections, Department of Social Services, Department of Youth Services and the County Sheriffs Departments. Responsible Parties: Executive Office of Administration and Finance, Executive Office of Health and Human Services, and State Homeless Task Force. 2. Gather data to track discharge outcomes through Boston's annual homeless census and point-in-time needs survey, as well as the Massachusetts Housing and Shelter Alliance's annual research and emerging sub-populations survey of area shelters. Use this data to hold the state human services agencies accountable for those people leaving their facilities. Responsible Parties: Massachusetts Housing and Shelter Alliance, UMASS McCormack Institute, and Emergency Shelter Commission. 3. Advocate for the development of a Family Support Grant to provide flexible assistance to families at risk of homelessness. Because family needs are varied and not limited to conventional homeless prevention solutions (e.g., rental assistance), flexible grants and intensive case management would help these families avoid shelter and remain in their communities. This grant would support the emergency needs of families with direct financial assistance to be used for: rental assistance, food, medicine, transportation, child care and other needs as determined by the family in concert with a community service provider. Responsible Parties: Homes for Families, Massachusetts Coalition for the Homeless, and Massachusetts Non-Profit Housing Association.  22   Major Recommendation  As a result of an increasing number of people losing access to affordable housing each year and/or being discharged from other social service systems to the street, more individuals are forced to turn to the city's emergency shelters. This crisis should not be resolved solely through an expansion of the homeless system, but also through the preservation of existing effective infrastructure and maximization of homeless resources. This means that the current number of shelter beds, permanent housing units, residential treatment beds, and multi-service centers must be maintained. Creating new capacity will not result in a net increase if at the same time we are losing capacity elsewhere. This does not necessarily mean supporting all of the same providers to provide the exact same services in their current locations. Services that cannot meet minimum standards of care, should be replaced. Services may be able to be delivered in a more cost-effective, yet still effective, manner or may be better suited to a different location. What this recommendation does mean, however, is that as grant terms expire, funding is lost, or as other challenges arise, there is a commitment to preserving the ability of the city's homeless providers to respond to emerging and emergent needs.  4  Maintain and Strengthen the Existing Infrastructure and Current Capacity of Boston's Homeless System  Specific Action Steps 1. Advocate with federal, state, existing supply of affordable aggressively engaging owners expiring use, condominium or and local officials to preserve the housing units by proactively and in negotiations regarding issues of rooming house conversions, etc.  Responsible Parties: Mayor Menino, Massachusetts Housing and Shelter Alliance, Citizens Housing and Planning Association, Department of Neighborhood Development, and homeless provider and advocacy organizations. 2. Continuously monitor and evaluate existing homeless programs to determine if they are effective in assisting homeless individuals and families. By evaluating these existing programs, the homeless community can identify any weak links among components of care and strengthen existing bonds. Methods should be developed to test links throughout the homeless system, determine where gaps exist, and encourage dialogue on difficult issues that create tension within the system, such as competition between providers for funding sources. Responsible Parties: Department of Neighborhood Development, Emergency Shelter Commission, Homeless Planning Committee, Department of Housing and Community Development, and Executive Office of Health and Human Services.  23   3. Improve the level of consumer involvement in homeless programs. Providing mechanisms for incorporating the voices of those directly affected by policies is imperative to the successful delivery of homeless services. Experiences of persons who have been or are homeless are necessary to learn what works, what does not work, and what is missing in the homeless service system. Consumer involvement in homeless programs should be strengthened by:     providing training and technical assistance for providers and city staff around various models of consumer involvement; identifying financial resources to pay consumers to participate in planning activities; evaluating the quality of consumer involvement in homeless programs during site visits by City and State staff; and developing a Consumer Involvement Manual that identifies models for involving consumers in homeless programs.  Responsible Parties: Emergency Shelter Commission, Department of Neighborhood Development, and SHPG Consumer Involvement Committee. 4. Research and identify new and alternative funding resources to support existing homeless services and housing. Explore the effectiveness and availability of mainstream resources  including Community Development Block Grant, HOME, Housing Opportunities for People with AIDS, Department of Labor resources, Veterans Affairs resources  to fund existing programs. By diversifying funding resources, the homeless system will be able to maintain and strengthen the existing level of services while more effectively targeting limited McKinney funds. Responsible Parties: Homeless Planning Committee, Emergency Shelter Commission, and Department of Neighborhood Development. Improve Coordination and Collaboration Among Homeless Providers to Meet the Needs of Under-served Populations For the past few years, Boston's shelter system has struggled to meet the growing need for emergency services while attempting to address the unique needs of emerging subpopulations, such as homeless elders or youths. In general, the existing shelter system, including both City- and State-funded programs, has been inadequate in meeting the complex needs of the various homeless populations. This inadequacy is due in a large part to the lack of a systematic intergovernmental approach which links both City and State resources to meet the emergency needs of homeless individuals and families. While providers have created a diverse network of 24-hour residential programs and transitional services, there is still a need for a more coordinated strategy between existing City, State, and non-profit providers. 24  Major Recommendation  5   In particular, homeless people with disabilities  such as those who suffer from physical health, mental health, or alcohol and drug issues  face great obstacles to meeting their housing and service needs. According to a recent UMASS study, 66 percent of homeless individuals surveyed reported having a primary disability of substance use, mental illness, physical disabilities, etc. Furthermore, many homeless people are dually or triply diagnosed. 6 These problems should be recognized and treated holistically, but often are not because the systems that provide needed services operate autonomously. Obtaining all of these services from multiple, uncoordinated service systems is extremely difficult. As a result, homeless people typically access supportive services only when their needs become acute, requiring the most expensive intervention. In fact, in one study researchers found that homeless people cost an average of $2,414 more per hospital admission than other low-income patients. 7 Improving the methods of delivery of supportive services to homeless people will both reduce the numbers of people who continue to cycle through periods of homelessness and reduce the high cost of acute medical, inpatient substance abuse, and psychiatric treatment.  Specific Action Steps 1. Designate beds within emergency shelters and transitional programs for specific subpopulations matched with appropriate specialized services. These services should be integrated into the shelter system through the training of existing shelter staff and the creation of specialized support service staff to assist throughout the shelter network where necessary. Responsible Parties: Boston shelter providers. 2. Create a family respite facility for homeless families with extensive health problems similar to those that exist for homeless individuals. A large percentage of homeless families have their situations complicated by one or more family members suffering from a major medical condition. Current shelter services are not equipped to provide the level of health services that many families need.

Responsible Parties: Department of Public Health, Emergency Shelter Commission, AIDS Housing Corporation, and homeless advocacy organizations. 6. Analyze model programs being used throughout the city, state, and across the nation to identify best practices and explore potential for replication in Boston. Present these programs at a Best Practices Conference. Responsible Party : Massachusetts Housing and Shelter Alliance. 7. Develop a centralized care coordination system available 24-hours per day and staffed by nursing care coordinators. Despite a rich framework of health care providers and programs, many homeless individuals and families continue to fall through the cracks in the system due to a lack of coordinated services. The purpose of this system would be to act as a resource to individuals, families, hospitals, emergency departments, and others to assist with discharge planning/placement and to facilitate the development of discharge criteria for hospitals to utilize while caring for homeless persons. The system would also alert caregivers or provide direct intervention when an individual appears to be at risk. Responsible Party : Health Care for the Homeless.  26   Advocate with Federal, State, and Local Agencies to Increase Public Awareness and Access to Mainstream Resources Advocacy is a critical component of Boston's overall plan to combat homelessness. While this advocacy can take many forms, ranging from advocacy for new funding opportunities and policy changes to advocacy for increasing community understanding of homelessness and support of programs to assist homeless people. This work must be on-going and continue with vigor until Boston has achieved its vision of preventing and ending the tragedy of homelessness among all individuals and families. Specific Action Steps 1. Continue to advocate with the State Legislature to ensure that the supply of state-funded affordable housing (including public housing and rental assistance) and shelter beds are preserved and continue to be accessible to homeless individuals and families. Responsible Parties: Massachusetts Housing and Shelter Alliance, Homes for Families, Massachusetts Coalition for the Homeless, and the Citizens Housing and Planning Association. 2. Continue to meet with Federal elected officials to ensure that valuable Federal homeless targeted resources (such as McKinney funding) are maintained and that all Federal resources are available and accessible to homeless people. Responsible Parties: Emergency Shelter Commission, Massachusetts Housing and Shelter Alliance, and Department of Neighborhood Development. 3. Support advocacy organizations in securing local, State, and Federal funding to assist homeless individuals and families. Responsible Party : SHPG and Homeless Planning Committee.  6  Major Recommendation  Next Steps The recommendations and action steps presented in this report provide feasible steps to address a complex problem, but they are just the beginning. On-going discussions and collaborations must occur in order to continue to address the changing needs of homeless individuals and families in the face of new social reforms and changes in leadership. Without structures in place and people to carry out the work, these recommendations cannot be implemented. With this in mind, the SHPG will continue to meet quarterly to monitor the progress toward completing recommendations and to address any barriers or impediments that may arise. At the macro level, the City and community as a whole, need to commit to support these recommendations; to work together to coordinate and carry out the specific action steps; and to ensure that needs of homeless individuals and families are truly addressed. 27   Acknowledgements This report would not have been possible without the contributions of many people who provided their time and insight. We would like to acknowledge their unwavering dedication to improving the lives of thousands of men, women, and children who experience homelessness in Boston in any given year.

In addition to print and audiovisual materials,          customers    may          access the Internet and numerous software programs at Library branches.          While the Internet offers many positive, rewarding and informative experiences,          it also poses some risks. The             Library supports the right and responsibility of parents to determine          and monitor their own childrens use of Library             materials and levels of Internet access. Adults accompanying children          are encouraged to read              ""Child Safety on the   Information          Highway"" . It is with these concerns in mind that the Library             has purchased          software which permits customers to select the appropriate level          of Internet access for themselves and    for          their children.                    The Librarys          Policy is:                            Customers are solely            responsible for what they access on the Internet at Library owned computers.            For documents and information available on Library computers, the City            of Albuquerque does not warrant or    assume            any legal liability or responsibility for the accuracy, completeness,            or usefulness of such documents    or            information.                                         All computer use            requires a valid SmartCard. Levels of Internet access are selected            at the time the    SmartCard            is issued. A parent or legal guardian determines access for minors and            must be present to sign the    application            for children under 17 years of age.                                         There is no guarantee            of privacy while on a Library computer. Staff and other customers may            view what is    on            any computer screen.           Library staff are            available to assist with reference questions, but are unable to provide            complex technical support.                                         The Library does            not offer e-mail accounts. Customers may access their own web-based            Internet e-mail accounts    via            the World Wide Web.                                         Access to ""Chat""            and ""Instant Messaging"" is prohibited on Library computers.                                           Accessing pornographic            or obscene materials is prohibited on Library computers.                                         Customers must            comply with applicable copyright laws and licensing agreements.                                         All existing laws            and City policies apply to conduct when accessing the Internet on City            owned computers.  Unauthorized access to the Librarys computers,            databases, network, hardware or software settings is prohibited.             Damage to computer resources also is prohibited.                                         The Library and            the City of Albuquerque shall not be liable for any damages or costs            of any type arising out of or    in            any way connected with use of the Librarys public access computers.            Customers obtaining a SmartCard shall agree to hold the City harmless            for any damages arising out of the customer's use of library equipment.                         Failure          to comply with this policy may result in loss of computer or Library privileges          in addition to any         appropriate          legal action including criminal prosecution.                 This          policy was formulated with the cooperation of the City Attorneys Office.         Approved          by the Library Advisory Board April 4, 2002                                Rio          Grande Valley Library System           Rules For          Computer Use                  Effective          September, 2002                    1. Staff          are unable to make exceptions for customers who lose or forget to bring          the SmartCard to the              Library. The cards are non-transferable and are available for a one time          fee of $3.00. The $3.00 fee may be              waived for qualified low income children. Replacement cards cost $5.00.          Non-residents are eligible for a              SmartCard              costing $3.00, valid for three months.                 2. Customers          may use Library computers up to 3 hours, system-wide, per day, depending          upon availability.         3. Latecomers          forfeit their reservation if more than 10 minutes late.         4. Express          15 minute computers may be available at some libraries.                  5. A          maximum of two persons may sit or work together at any one computer. If          both customers are under 17,              they must have SmartCards providing the same level of Internet access.           6. Computers          are turned off 10 minutes prior to the Librarys closing time. Reservations          are not taken for the              last hour the Library is open.           7. Printing          costs 15 cents per page. SmartCards function as Library system print          debit cards. Customers are              responsible for determining that the card holds adequate funds. Value          must be added to SmartCards in              $1.00 increments. No refunds are given. Diskettes cost $1.00.           8. No          external devices may be attached to any Library computer. The Library          does not provide network              connections for customer owned equipment in library buildings.                 9. Only          paper provided by the Library can be used in the printers.         10. Staff          are not responsible for computer equipment malfunctions.                  11. Computer          users are expected to conduct themselves appropriately within a public          environment. Verbal or              physical abuse of staff, other Library and computer users, or computer          equipment will not be tolerated.           12.          Computer use may not interfere with others using the Library. Computer          customers are subject to the               Librarys Building Use Rules.                 Failure          to comply with these rules may result in loss of computer or Library privileges          in addition to         any appropriate          legal action including criminal prosecution.                             Last updated:  June 26, 2003                                Comments to:  Julia Clarke"

However, for most individuals                  who have already left the workforce, the single largest asset                  they have saved is the equity value of their home. For some individuals,                  the income received from Social Security and a pension is inadequate                  to meet their special needs. Conventional forms of converting                  to income home equity involve repayable loans secured as second                  mortgages or liens against ownership. Since 1989, the federal                  government has insured for adults age 62 and over a different                  type of mortgage that provides regular monthly without repayment                  or the threat of eviction, even if the owner outlives the declining                  equity. The links on this page lead to descriptions of different                  types of reverse mortgage policies, consumer advocacy issues associated                  with some types of programs, and emerging state and federal initiatives                  in extending protection and support.

Work/life programs are spreading across Government and making it easier for Federal employees to balance all aspects of their lives, including helping employees with the adoption process.    This Adoption Benefits Guide provides questions and answers on leave programs and health and tax benefits available to Federal employees who are prospective adoptive parents.    It also provides information on other Federal adoption assistance, State adoption subsidy programs, and national adoption resources.       Leave Programs    The Federal Government has an impressive and flexible array of work/life leave options which support employees' family responsibilities and enhance the productivity of the workforce. Key components of the Federal leave system include: annual leave; sick leave; family and medical leave; family-friendly leave; leave for bone marrow and organ donation; leave sharing; and leave banks.    Two laws which have specific provisions for adoptive parents are Sick Leave for Adoption and the Family and Medical Leave Act.       Sick Leave for Adoption    This law became effective on September 30, 1994, and allows Federal employees to use sick leave for absences relating to adopting a child.    Following are some questions and answers regarding sick leave for adoption.    What adoption-related activities are covered?   The purposes for which an adoptive parent may request sick leave include appointments with adoption agencies, social workers, and attorneys; court proceedings; required travel; and any other activities necessary to allow the adoption to proceed.    Can I use sick leave for the purpose of bonding with my adopted child?   There is no provision in the law or regulation to permit the use of sick leave by birth parents or adoptive parents who choose to be absent from work to bond with a birth or adopted child.   However, you may use sick leave if required by the court or adoption agency to take time off from work to care for the newly adopted child.    Is the amount of sick leave I may use for adoption-related purposes limited to 13 days as it is for other family care purposes?    No. The amount of sick leave taken for adoption-related activities is not limited to 13 days and does not count towards the annual 13-day limit under the Family-Friendly Leave Act.     At one time, Federal employees were given the opportunity to request that sick leave be substituted for annual leave used for adoption purposes between September 30, 1991, and September 30, 1994. Is that still in effect?   No. That opportunity ended on September 30, 1996.       Family and Medical Leave Act    To help balance the demands of the workplace with the needs of the family, the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) was signed into law on February 5, 1993 (Public Law 103-3) and became effective on August 5, 1993. This law ensures that family and medical leave is available on a gender-neutral basis and mandates job security for employees who take leave. In addition, it accomplishes these purposes in a manner that accommodates the legitimate interests of employers.    Title II of the Act, ""Leave for Civil Service Employees,"" provides eligible Federal employees an entitlement to a total of 12 administrative workweeks of unpaid leave during any 12-month period for certain family and medical needs.    For what purposes can leave be taken under the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA)?   FMLA provides eligible Federal employees with an entitlement to  12 workweeks of unpaid leave during any 12-month period for the following purposes :       birth of a son or daughter of the employee and care of the newborn;*     placement of a son or daughter with the employee for adoption or foster care;*     care of a spouse, son, daughter, or parent of the employee who has a serious health condition; and     a serious health condition of the employee that makes the employee unable to perform the essential functions of his or her position.        * Entitlement to 12 weeks of leave expires 12 months after the date of birth or placement for adoption or foster care. (Employees may begin this leave prior to the birth or placement.)    How much leave can I take each year under the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA)?   You are entitled to a total of up to 12 workweeks of unpaid leave during any 12-month period (not necessarily a calendar year or leave year). The 12-month period begins on the date you first take the leave and continues for 12 months. You are not entitled to 12 additional weeks of leave under FMLA until the previous 12-month period ends and an event or situation occurs that entitles you to another period of such leave. (This may include a continuation of a previous situation or circumstance, e.g., a serious health condition.)    What justification is required to use leave under the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA)?    You may be required to provide advance leave notice and medical certification. Ordinarily, you must provide 30 days advance notice when the need for leave is  foreseeable . If the need for leave is not foreseeable, e.g., because of a medical emergency, you must provide notice within a reasonable period of time appropriate to the circumstances involved. An agency may require medical certification to support a request for leave because of a serious health condition and may require second or third opinions (at the employer's expense).   If you cannot provide the required medical certification before FMLA leave is to begin, you must be provided  provisional  leave. Once this leave has commenced and you fail to provide the medical certification, the agency may charge you as absent without leave (AWOL) or may allow you to request that the provisional leave be charged as leave without pay or to your appropriate leave account.    What are the job benefits and protections provided under the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA)?    Upon return from this leave, you must be returned to the same position or to an equivalent position with equivalent benefits, pay, status, and other terms and conditions of employment. When you take FMLA leave, you are entitled to maintain health benefits coverage and may choose to pay the employee share of the premium on a current basis or pay upon return to work. The use of this leave cannot result in the loss of any employment benefit that accrued prior to the start of your leave.    Can I substitute paid leave for leave under the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA)?    You may elect, but  the agency may not require you , to substitute advanced, accrued or accumulated annual and/or sick leave for the unpaid leave in accordance with current law and regulations. You may  not  retroactively substitute paid time off for unpaid leave under FMLA. FMLA leave is  in addition to  other paid time off available to you.   Under certain conditions, this leave may be taken intermittently, or you may work under a work schedule that is reduced by the number of hours of leave taken as family and medical leave.       Additional Leave Benefits    Further information on additional leave benefits may be obtained from the Office of Personnel Management's (OPM) brochure, ""Family-Friendly Leave Policies for Federal Employees."" This publication is available on OPM ONLINE and can be ordered from the Government Printing Office (LEAVE-95-1, November 1995).    You may also contact your agency personnel office, or OPM's Compensation Administration Division at (202) 606-2858.       Health Benefits    Federal employees may cover a legally adopted child or a foster child under their Federal Employees Health Benefits (FEHB) family enroll-ment upon showing proof of the child's eligibility as a family member. The child must be single, under the age of 22, and financially dependent on the employee. Proof of adoption or foster child status must be provided by the employee.    Following are some questions and answers regarding health benefits.    Do adopted and foster children receive the same health coverage as the Federal employee?    The child receives the same health benefits coverage that is available to the Federal employee and all other family members. There are no exclusions or waiting periods because of preexisting medical conditions.   A child who meets the definition of ""member of family"" under the Federal Employees Health Benefits (FEHB) law receives coverage regardless of whether he or she has coverage under Medicaid.    Where do I apply for coverage for my adopted or foster child?    You must apply at your employing office. The employing office makes the determination whether the child meets the requirements for an adopted or foster child based on documents you provide.    What proof must I provide for an adopted child?    You must provide the final decree papers.    What are the requirements for covering foster children?    The child must be living with you, you must be raising the child as your own, and you must have assumed full parental responsibility and control of the child. There must be an expectation that you will continue to raise the child into adulthood. A child living with you under a pre-adoption agreement may qualify as a foster child.   Under the Federal Employees Health Benefits (FEHB) law, a foster child is an unmarried dependent child under 22 years of age who lives with you in a regular parent-child relationship; not a child who is temporarily living with you nor one who is placed in your home by a welfare or social service agency which retains control of the child and pays for maintenance.    Must I obtain a court order for custody in order to cover my foster child on my health benefits enrollment?    A court order for  permanent  custody is acceptable as proof of dependency, but is not necessarily required.   However, a court order for temporary custody or a Power of Attorney is not acceptable proof for health benefits enrollment. Other acceptable proof of foster child status are:     evidence that the child has been included as a dependent on your tax returns for previous years;    canceled checks, money orders, or receipts for periodic payments received from you for or on behalf of the child;    evidence of goods or services which show regular or substantial contributions of considerable value; and    sworn affidavits from people unrelated to you that the child lives in your home.       The employing office will ultimately make the final decision as to what proof is acceptable in an individual case.    When does health coverage for an adopted or a foster child begin?    Coverage for an adopted child begins the day the adoption decree is final.    Coverage for a foster child begins the first day of the pay period in which the employing office receives all properly completed documents necessary to establish eligibility of the child as a foster child.    I will be traveling overseas to pick up a child who I am adopting and will be staying three to four weeks to ensure the paperwork goes through. Since the child might qualify only as a foster child prior to final adoption, how will she meet the ""living with"" requirement when she is not at my home back in the States?    It is true a child is not considered adopted until the adoption is final. Nevertheless, the child would meet the foster child requirement even though the child is not technically residing with you at your permanent home. The effective date would be the first day of the pay period in which you begin living with the child overseas.    When does an adopted or foster child's health benefits coverage stop?    Health benefits stop when the child reaches the age of 22, marries, or is no longer dependent on the employee. Health benefits can continue after age 22 if the person is incapable of self-support because of a disability incurred before age 22. Contact your employing offical for information on how to continue coverage in such cases.    Would my adopted or foster child qualify for continued health benefits under the temporary continuation of coverage (TCC) provisions of the Federal Employees Health Benefits (FEHB) law?    The TCC provisions allow children who no longer qualify as a dependent child (e.g., child reaches age 22, marries before age 22, no longer lives with the employee) to continue their FEHB coverage for up to 36 months. The child is enrolled in his or her own right and pays both the employee and the Government's share of the premium, plus an additional 2% administrative cost. You should notify your employing office within 60 days after the child no longer qualifies for cover-age as a family member.    A child who loses FEHB coverage for any reason other than by cancellation has a 31-day temporary extension of coverage, at no cost, for the purpose of converting to a non-group contract with his or her current health benefits plan. To convert the child's coverage to a non-group plan, you or your child must apply directly to the health benefits plan within 31 days after the child's eligibility ends.    For further information on health benefits, contact your personnel office.       Tax Benefits for Adoption    Effective January 1, 1997, adoptive parents may be able to take a new tax credit for qualifying expenses paid to adopt an eligible child. The adoption credit is a non-refundable credit that you subtract from your tax liability.    Also, money or other benefits from a private sector employer for qualifying adoption expenses may be excluded from your gross income. (The Federal Government does not provide such benefits, but you might work part-time for a private sector employer or your spouse might be employed by a private sector employer.)    Following are some questions and answers regarding tax benefits.    What are qualifying expenses in the adoption process?    Qualifying expenses are reasonable and necessary adoption fees, court costs, attorney fees, and other expenses directly related to, and whose principal purpose is for, the legal adoption of an eligible child.    What are non-qualifying adoption expenses?    Non-qualifying adoption expenses include:     expenses that violate State and Federal law;    expenses for carrying out any surrogate parenting arrangement;    expenses for the adoption of your spouse's child;    expenses paid using funds received from any Federal, State, or local program; and    expenses allowed as a credit or deduction under any other Federal income tax rule.       What is the definition of eligible child?    An eligible child is:     Under 18 years old, or    Physically or mentally incapable of caring for himself or herself.       How long will the adoption credit be in effect?    It will be in effect until December 31, 2001. After 2001, the adoption credit will apply only to qualifying expenses for adopting an eligible child with special needs.    What is the definition of an eligible child with special needs?    An eligible child with special needs is a U.S. citizen or resident where a State (or the District of Columbia or a U.S. possession) determines that the child cannot or should not be returned to his or her parent's home and probably will not be adopted unless adoption assistance is provided to the adoptive parents.    Factors used to determine if a child has special needs could include:     the child's ethnic background;    the child's age;    whether the child is a member of a minority or sibling group; and    whether the child has a medical condition or physical, mental, or emotional disability.    A foreign child, who is not a U.S. citizen or resident, cannot be treated as a child with special needs.      When do I take the adoption tax credit for expenses paid for a child who is a U.S. citizen or resident?    If you adopt a child who is a U.S. citizen or resident (and the adoption is not final) you take the adoption credit, not in the year that you paid expenses to adopt, but in the following tax year. The tax credit for adoption expenses paid in the year when the adoption becomes final, is taken in that same year.    When do I take the adoption credit for expenses paid for a child who is not a U.S. citizen or resident?    If you adopt a child who is not a U.S. citizen or resident, you cannot take the adoption credit until the adoption becomes final. Credit can be taken only for the year the adoption becomes final. Adoption expenses paid earlier are treated as paid during the year the adoption becomes final.    How do I claim the credit or exclusion?    You must file Internal Revenue Service (IRS) Form 8839 with either Form 1040 or Form 1040A to claim the credit or exclusion. Your income tax package has specific instructions.   If you are married, you must file a joint return to take the adoption credit or qualify for the income exclusion. If you are legally separated from your spouse for the last six months of the tax year, you may be able to file a separate return and still take the credit or qualify for the exclusion.   You must identify, on the tax return for the year you claim the credit or exclusion, all eligible children for whom you paid expenses to adopt. You must give (if known) the child's name, age, and taxpayer identification number.   If you do not know the above information, you may be required to give other identifying information including the name of an agent who assisted with the adoption.    Are the credit and the exclusion for qualifying adoption expenses subject to a dollar limit and an income limit?    Yes. These limits apply separately.    What is the dollar limit?    The amount of expenses that you can claim as a credit or the amount of private employer-provided adoption assistance (if your spouse works for a private sector employer or if you work part-time for a private sector employer) that you can exclude from your income is limited to $5,000 for each effort to adopt an eligible child or $6,000 for each effort to adopt an eligible child with special needs. This is the maximum that can be claimed over all taxable years.   If more than one person is claiming expenses for a child, the limit applies to the total expenses paid for the child. That is, they are limited to $5,000 between them (or $6,000 if expenses are for a child with special needs). Anything over that limit cannot be claimed as credit in any year.    What is the income limit?    The income limit is based on modified adjusted gross income (AGI). If your modified AGI is $75,000 or less, you are not subject to any income limit. If your modified AGI is more than $75,000, but less than $115,000, the credit phases out. If your modified AGI is $115,000 or more, you cannot take the credit or exclusion.    What happens to unused credit?    The amount of your allowable adoption credit for a year cannot be more than your regular tax liability for that year, minus certain other credits.   If your credit is more than this limit, you can carry the unused credit to your next five tax years, or until used, whichever comes first.    Can both a credit and an exclusion be claimed for expenses of adopting an eligible child?    Yes. You may claim both a credit and an exclusion, but they cannot be claimed for the same expense.    For more information on tax benefits for adoption, contact the Internal Revenue Service at 1-(800) 829-1040.       Adoption Assistance Programs    Two adoption assistance programs that you should be aware of are the Federal Title IV-E Adoption Assistance and State Adoption Subsidy Programs. Eligibility criteria for State adoption subsidies vary. Check with your adoption agency and State adoption officials to find out what your State allows.     Federal Title IV-E Adoption Assistance    Under this assistance program, parents of an eligible child may receive a monthly subsidy for the ordinary needs of the child. These payments are not designated for a specific purpose such as medical expenses, living expenses or special services. The funds may be used for any identifiable needs of the child.    An eligible child is one who has been determined by the State to be a special needs child, i.e., free for adoption and considered hard to place because of a specific factor or condition (member of a sibling group, medically disabled, etc.). In some circumstances, the State must make an effort to place the child without adoption subsidy.    Adoptive parents do not have to meet any financial eligibility criteria to receive adoption assistance on behalf of their child. A child for whom Title IV-E adoption assistance is provided is automatically eligible for medical assistance under Title XIX (Medicaid) and may receive social services under Title XX.    In addition, non-recurring adoption expenses (legal fees, court costs) are available to adoptive parents. A non-recurring adoption expense is a one-time adoption fee that is necessary for the adoption of a special needs child, which is not incurred in violations of State and Federal law, and has not been reimbursed from other sources or other funds.     State Adoption Subsidy Programs    These programs provide assistance for children who are not eligible under the Federal Title IV-E program. Adoption subsidies take various forms in different States depending on the child's needs and State agency's program. Under State-funded pro-grams, there are generally three types of adoption subsidies: medical, maintenance, and special services. Medical subsidies cover some or all forthe costs related to a child's specific medical condition that are not covered by the family's health insurance. They may also cover the costs of related therapy, rehabilitation and special education. Some States provide medical assistance through Medicaid which also pays for health care needs not covered by the adoptive family's health insurance policy or other community resources. Maintenance or support subsidies are direct payments to the adoptive family to help cover the child's living expenses.    Special service subsidies are usually one-time payments to cover a child's emergency needs or other extra-ordinary needs; less often, they are repeated payments for services not covered by medical or maintenance subsidies. Each State determines what is an allowable cost.    Further information on adoption assistance can be obtained by calling the National Adoption Information Clearinghouse at (703) 352-3488; the National Adoption Center at (215) 735-9988; and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' Children's Bureau at (202) 205-8618.

While this guide is written from the perspective of an employment and training agency (e.g., a Private Industry Council (PIC) operating under the Job Training Partnership Act), much of the material presented is likely to be of interest to the wide variety of public and private organizations providing services to homeless families and individuals.  Among the major objectives of this guide are the following:        to enhance agencies' knowledge of homeless individuals;      to provide guidance on the types of homeless persons that are most (and least) likely to benefit from employment and training services;      to identify the full range of services likely to be needed by homeless individuals to be successful in completing training and securing and retaining employment, and how these services can be provided directly by employment and training agencies or arranged through linkages with public or private service providers;      to identify the specific planning and implementation steps needed by employment and training agencies to establish an effective service delivery system for recruiting and serving homeless individuals; and       to provide examples of successful strategies used by employment and training agencies, and homeless-serving agencies, in assisting homeless individuals to (re)enter the workforce.       Much of the material presented in this  Best Practices Guide  is based on the experiences of 63 organizations from across the United States who provided comprehensive services for homeless individuals and families under the Job Training for the Homeless Demonstration Program (JTHDP). (1)   JTHDP, authorized under Section 731 of the Stewart B. McKinney Homeless Assistance Act of 1987, was intended to ""provide information and direction for the future of job training for homeless Americans."" (2)    Under this legislation, the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) was authorized to plan, implement, and test the effectiveness of a comprehensive range of employment, training, and other support services to assist homeless individuals to find and retain employment. (3)       During the 86 months JTHDP operated (from September 1988 through November 1995), over 45,000 homeless individuals were served by a variety of program grantees, including Job Training Partnership Act (JTPA) Service Delivery Areas (SDAs) and PICs, community-based organizations, education organizations, and homeless shelters.  Exhibit 1-1 provides a listing of the 63 JTHDP grantees and their locations.  Appendix A provides additional background information about JTHDP. (4)        The remaining sections of this chapter provide:  (1) a brief overview of the problem of homelessness in the United States, (2) a discussion of the services needed by homeless individuals to break the cycle of homelessness, and (3) an overview of the remaining chapters of this guide.     A. THE PROBLEM OF HOMELESSNESS IN THE UNITED STATES       Since the early 1980s, the problem of homelessness in the United States, particularly within urban communities, has been the subject of increasing public attention.  This attention has been generated in part by the increased number of visible homeless, and by important changes in the socioeconomic and demographic composition of the homeless population to include more families, working poor, and individuals suffering from problems of chronic mental illness and chemical dependency.

(5)   Based on direct counts in shelters and soup kitchens, this study estimated that between 500,000 and 600,000 individuals were homeless in the United States during a seven-day period in March, 1987. Using this point-in-time estimate as a basis, the Urban Institute estimated that more than one million persons in the United States were homeless at some time during 1987. (6)       A number of factors appear to be contributing to changes in the size and characteristics of the homeless population in the United States.   Economic restructuring, corporate downsizing, and rapid technological change  have led to job loss for some workers, the need to re-locate, and changing skill requirements.  The  rising housing costs, demolition of lower-cost single room occupancy (SRO) hotels, and gentrification within urban areas  have made it difficult for some individuals (especially the unemployed and underemployed) to locate affordable housing for themselves and their families.  Finally, there are a host of other factors that, according to experts, seem to have exacerbated the problem of homelessness, including  more restrictive eligibility requirements for welfare and disability benefits,   reductions in the purchasing power of public benefits,  the  deinstitutionalization and lack of mental health care services for mentally ill persons, and growing problems of substance abuse.      In response to apparent increases in the size and changes in the composition of the homeless population in the United States, Congress enacted the Stewart B. McKinney Homeless Assistance Act (Public Law 100-77) in 1987.  At the time of its enactment, this Act represented the nation's most comprehensive piece of legislation for the homeless population and included nearly 20 provisions to meet the needs of homeless persons.  It provided for emergency shelter, food, health care, mental health care, housing, education, job training, and other community services.  This Act, probably more than any other piece of federal legislation, recognized the need to pull together the resources of a variety of government agencies to provide comprehensive services for homeless individuals and families.         B. A COMPREHENSIVE MODEL FOR PROVIDING SERVICES NEEDED TO BREAK THE CYCLE OF HOMELESSNESS      Homeless individuals can face a broad array of problems -- ranging from substance abuse, to basic skills deficiencies, to lack of transportation and appropriate clothing -- that need to be addressed before they are likely to secure and retain employment.  For each homeless individual, these problems come in different combinations and intensities, which means that individual circumstances need to be carefully assessed and the range of services provided need to be targeted on the needs of each individual served.     The experiences of the 63 grantees involved in the Job Training for the Homeless Demonstration Program, as well as the results of other important studies on homelessness, suggest that the following core services -- provided either by a sponsoring agency or through linkages with other local human service providers -- need to be made available to assist homeless individuals in securing and retaining employment:        Case management and counseling;  Assessment and employability development planning;  Job training services, including remedial education, basic skills training, literacy instruction, job search assistance, job counseling, vocational and occupational skills training, and on-the-job training;   Job development and placement services;    Post-placement follow-up and support services (e.g., additional job placement services, training after placement, self-help support groups, mentoring);    Housing services (e.g., emergency housing assistance, assessment of housing needs, referrals to appropriate housing alternatives); and      Other support services (e.g. child care; transportation; chemical dependency assessment, counseling, and referral to outpatient or inpatient treatment as appropriate; mental health assessment, counseling, and referral to treatment; other health care services; clothing; and life skills training);    Based on the experiences of JTHDP sites, Exhibit 1-2 provides an overview of a model for providing a comprehensive range of services to effectively assist homeless individuals and families to secure and retain employment.            The need for comprehensive provision of services points to the need for strong linkages and coordination arrangements with other local service providers.  Therefore, careful planning of the service delivery strategy is needed, including identifying the agencies within the network of local human service agencies able to provide the needed range of services.  JTHDP grantees were able to greatly expand the availability of services for their participants and to leverage funding for providing additional services to participants through extensive use of coordination.  For example, as shown in Exhibit 1-3, one JTHDP site (Knoxville-Knox County Community Action Committee) relied upon over 50 service providers within its locality to ensure each homeless individual received the specific services he or she needed.  Among some of the underlying themes that are emphasized throughout this  Best Practices Guide  are the following:       Establish Linkages with Homeless-serving Agencies.   Employment and training agencies need to establish linkages with homeless-serving agencies, such as shelters and transitional housing facilities, to help with outreach, recruitment, and screening of homeless individuals.  Homeless individuals need to be carefully pre-screened and assessed prior to acceptance in an employment and training program.  Homeless-serving agencies are well-positioned to help in this pre-screening process.       Stabilize Homeless Individuals Prior to Enrollment.   Homeless individuals need to be stable  prior  to enrollment in employment and training programs.  This generally means living in, at a minimum, transitional housing or an emergency shelter that allows the individual to have an extended stay.  This also means addressing problems such as a lack of financial resources, domestic violence, and other problems that can impact successful participation in employment and training activities, as well as screening out serious substance abusers and those who are mentally ill and unlikely to benefit from participation in your program.  Once again, homeless-serving agencies or other agencies referring individuals can be helpful.       Provide Thorough Assessment and Ongoing Case Management.   Participant assessment and case management are critical to tailoring services to meet the needs of each individual.  Barriers to employment are not always evident at the time of intake; as a result, both assessment and case management should be ongoing activities.

Consumer Credit Counseling         Arrange for Short-term Job Search Assistance.    Homeless individuals are often primarily interested in obtaining employment and improving their housing situation in the shortest time possible.  Hence, employment and training programs need to provide, either through in-house capabilities or linkages, job search assistance for those who are primarily interested in obtaining employment in the shortest time possible.        Provide Basic Skills and Work Readiness Skills Training.   Some homeless individuals need basic and/or work readiness skills training prior to entry into training and employment.  This training can be conducted in conjunction with other training or job search assistance.          Provide Follow-up and Support.   The problems that led to homelessness do not suddenly disappear upon entering a training program, finding a job, or securing permanent housing.  Ongoing assessment, case management, and follow-up   support are important ingredients for assisting homeless individuals in retaining employment.       Provide Staff Training on Serving Homeless Persons.   Employment and training agencies may need to provide training for their staff and service providers on the needs of and misperceptions about homeless people, the variety of referral agencies locally available to meet those needs, and the best practices for serving homeless participants.

Each chapter is organized around a discussion of a specific service or group of services that should be part of a comprehensive employment and training service delivery system for homeless individuals.  Each chapter begins with a discussion of the challenges that employment and training agencies may face in providing a particular service to homeless individuals.  The discussion then shifts to an assessment of effective strategies for providing each service.  Throughout each chapter, examples of effective strategies are illustrated with experiences drawn from JTHDP grantees.       Chapter 2 (Initial Services)  addresses the services employment and training agencies are likely to need to provide (or arrange for) in order to effectively recruit and assess homeless individuals.  These services include marketing job training services to homeless people, determining which homeless people can benefit from the services provided by each employment and training agency, developing case plans based on assessment, and using case management as the focal point for connecting participants with the range of services they need.      Chapter 3 (Education and Training Services)  discusses effective strategies for providing education and training services for homeless individuals to assist them in securing and retaining employment.  The services discussed include:  basic skills (i.e., remedial education, literacy training, and English-as-a-Second-Language training) and occupational skills training (including on-the-job training and work experience).      Chapter 4 (Placement and Post-placement Services)  examines various strategies for assisting homeless individuals to find and retain jobs over the long term.  This includes discussion of job search assistance, job development, placement, and post-placement services (such as regular contact with the participant and employer and re-placement services).      Chapter 5 (Housing and Support Services)  examines the critically important range of housing assistance and support services which may be needed by homeless individuals.  This chapter identifies the most commonly needed services for homeless people (beyond employment- related services) to be able to secure and retain employment, and illustrates some of the community linkages which have helped JTHDP grantees access those services.   CHAPTER 2      INITIAL SERVICES: RECRUITMENT,     INTAKE, ASSESSMENT, AND CASE MANAGEMENT                                       This chapter presents effective strategies for structuring and providing a range of services -- outreach, intake, assessment, and case management -- needed to recruit and prepare homeless individuals for participation in employment and training activities.  As discussed, some of these services will need to be provided directly by your agency, while others you will want to arrange for through linkages with other organizations -- particularly, homeless-serving agencies.      A. RECRUITMENT       1. Background and Challenges      Recruitment includes the ways agencies publicize the availability of their services and encourage individuals within the eligible population to participate.  There are a variety of methods typically used by agencies to make potentially eligible individuals within their service area aware of the range of employment, training, housing and other support services available through their programs.  Among the recruitment strategies employed by JTHDP sites were the following:           making regular presentations to administrators/staff at local human service agencies, to ensure that those agencies refer appropriate individuals;   distributing posters and brochures with information about the program to human service providers, libraries, schools, and other educational institutions;    promoting public service announcements on television and radio;    writing newspaper stories and advertisements; and    using word-of-mouth.         In the areas of outreach and participant recruitment, it is important for employment and training programs to concentrate their relatively limited staff time and administrative resources on methods that yield a pool of program applicants who: (1) are eligible for participation, (2) are motivated to participate in employment and training activities, (3) have a high probability of completing training and upgrading their basic and work-related skills, and (4) once trained, have a high probability of securing and retaining a job.  JTHDP experience demonstrated that it was possible to interest large segments of the homeless population in employment and training programs if outreach strategies were carefully designed.  JTHDP also demonstrated that if homeless individuals were carefully screened through the recruitment (and assessment) process, many could complete training and/or secure employment. (7)   When designing strategies for recruiting homeless individuals for employment and training programs, JTHDP experience suggests that it is important to consider the following points about homeless individuals:             Homeless individuals are by no means a homogenous group; careful assessment is needed to identify those who are likely to benefit from employment and training services.   Generally, with the exception of not having a fixed residence, homeless individuals are probably similar to other disadvantaged adults and youth your program is already serving.  Exhibit 2-1 provides an overview of some of the characteristics of homeless individuals served by JTHDP sites and several of the distinctive subpopulations of the homeless population served.  Exhibit 2-2 provides a comparison of selected characteristics of JTHDP participants with JTPA Title II-A participants. (8)   Despite similarities with other disadvantaged populations you may be serving, homeless individuals may face a larger number of barriers to employment than those typically served by your program.  For example, there are segments of the homeless population with serious mental illness or active substance abuse problems who are not likely to be appropriate for employment and training activities.      Homeless individuals can be a fairly transient group and may lack familiarity with the local service delivery system.   Some homeless individuals may have migrated from other localities and be unfamiliar with employment, training, housing, and support service programs available in your area.  Other homeless individuals may move from an emergency shelter to the street to the homes of friends or relatives, and so forth, making them a moving target for outreach efforts.

JTHDP figures are based on participant-level data maintained by sites for Phases 2 through 4.  Sample size for JTHDP participants is 28,617.           Some homeless individuals may have little interest in receiving job training.   The dire economic circumstances faced by most homeless individuals are likely to mean that they are (at least upon entry into the employment and training program) primarily interested in obtaining a job as rapidly as possible.  Many homeless individuals are likely to lack interest in pursuing job training, at least until it is determined they cannot obtain a job with their existing base of skills and work experience.  It is important to remember that many homeless individuals will have developed work-related skills and relevant experience over the years and may not need further training. (9)   It is also important to remember that some homeless (like other disadvantaged individuals) may have failed in the past in education or training settings and, therefore, are not anxious to return to a setting in which they have been unsuccessful.           2. Strategies      The recruitment strategies used for homeless individuals are likely to be quite similar to those your agency used to recruit other disadvantaged individuals, though homeless individuals are likely to require additional outreach efforts through homeless-serving agencies.  Two key lessons learned by JTHDP grantees relating to recruitment of homeless individuals for employment and training programs were the following:           do not recruit homeless individuals directly off the street; and       utilize homeless-serving and other agencies to assist with recruitment of homeless individuals.         Homeless-serving agencies have a track-record of working with this target population and, if well-instructed, can provide a reservoir of appropriate and well-screened homeless participants for your program.  Several strategies designed to help employment and training agencies identify and recruit appropriate homeless individuals are presented below.        a.  Outreach Strategy #1:  Identify the Types of Homeless Individuals You Can and Cannot Effectively Serve      Through past experiences, your agency has learned that not all individuals are appropriate for or likely to benefit from participation in employment and training activities.  It is essential to direct outreach efforts toward those homeless individuals who are highly motivated and have a strong likelihood of successfully utilizing the services you offer to obtain and retain employment (and eventually achieve long-term self sufficiency).  Some important considerations include the following:       Housing Status.   Individuals living on the street or tenuously in shelters are unlikely to be able to make a long-term commitment to training.  Outreach should be targeted on those homeless individuals who are in housing situations that allow for an extended stay (e.g., transitional facilities that allow for six months or a year stays, emergency shelters with open-ended stays).       Involvement with Drugs and Alcohol.   JTHDP grantees found that an active substance abuse problem was a barrier to completing training and obtaining employment, but that clients in recovery were often highly-motivated and successful program participants.        Means of Financial Support.   Those individuals without a means of financial support are generally less able to participate in long-term training.  Some JTHDP sites placed participants in part-time jobs and training concurrently, or found other means of financial support.       Preference for Training Versus a Job.   Because of their homeless situation and lack of financial support, many homeless individuals have a strong preference for working over training.  It is important during outreach to make clear what your program offers so that homeless individuals understand the nature of their commitment to the program.        b.  Outreach Strategy #2:  Identify Agencies That Can Help With Outreach and Recruitment      Depending on the types of homeless individuals your agency is able to serve, you will need to identify and establish linkages with other agencies in the community that are able to screen and refer homeless individuals to you.  In addition to the screening and referring function, homeless-serving agencies can help your participants secure appropriate housing and support services.  Below are some of the types of homeless-serving agencies with which you will want to consider developing linkages:         Shelters and transitional housing programs  should be your first stop.  These programs are likely to be able to provide a steady stream of homeless persons who are temporarily housed.  If you work closely with them, they can effectively screen and refer those individuals who are ready and can most benefit from job training.  They are also likely to be able to extend periods of stay at their facilities to assist those entering training or other employment services.  These agencies may also provide assessment and ongoing case management services that can be helpful in tailoring services to meet client needs and monitoring client progress toward self-sufficiency.       Community action agencies  offer a broad range of services to the homeless and non-homeless alike.  They may be able to provide on-going support and information and referral for an extensive array of needed services.       Public assistance agencies  may know when their clients are at risk of homelessness and can refer them to your program at the point when they are nearing or have recently become homeless, an easier point at which to serve them than after they have been homeless for several months.       Halfway houses  for individuals in recovery or for ex-offenders returning to the community provide support services that can help people maintain sobriety and stability while they are in a job training program and after job placement. They often provide transitional housing and on-going case management.       Soup kitchens  typically attract the most transient homeless persons, but they also serve increasing numbers of homeless families and individuals who may be motivated to work.  Many also provide a range of services beyond serving food.  These multi-service agencies, if provided with criteria for screening homeless individuals, can provide a steady source of appropriate referrals for an employment and training program.       Domestic violence programs  provide direct outreach services to battered and abused individuals, many of whom are in need of job training and employment services to become economically independent.  These programs typically provide temporary housing, case management, and a wide range of specialized support services.          The Tucson Indian Center (TIC) conducted an extensive outreach effort with several phases.  First, TIC mailed brochures to social service agencies in the area.  Second, it followed-up with phone calls to verify that the information was received and to set up face-to-face meetings.  Third, TIC staff held meetings with social service agencies in Tucson that worked with the homeless or American Indians.  TIC contacted agencies including: shelters, Indian tribes, substance abuse programs, city agencies, and churches.         c.  Outreach Strategy #3:  Develop Cooperative Agreements with Appropriate Referring Agencies        After identifying agencies that serve and could refer homeless persons potentially eligible for your services, meet with the directors and front-line staff of these agencies.  At this meeting:       Market the value of your agency's services.   An important point to emphasize is that job training and employment services hold the key to long-term and higher wage employment -- key ingredients in making self-sufficiency a reality.        Explain the specific elements of your agency's services (e.g., intensity of case management, available support services, and duration and types of training).   Be clear about the scope and limits of what your agency provides and about the requirements and expectations for participation in your program.       Obtain background information about these agencies, including the types of individuals served, how these individuals flow through the program, types of services provided, and the extent and duration of participation.     If the homeless-serving agency can serve as an effective referral source, negotiate a cooperative agreement.  This document should be specific in terms of the roles and responsibilities of both the partners, the anticipated number and types of homeless individuals to be referred, and the criteria used to screen individuals for referral.  Emphasize the importance of  quality and appropriate referrals  over quantity of referrals.  As part of the agreement, specify the types of on-going services both partners will provide for individuals referred to your program, including the types of assessments administered and case management responsibilities.        d.  Outreach Strategy #4: Be Sure Referring Agencies Conduct Thorough Initial Screenings to Determine Appropriateness of Clients for Your Program      Prior to referral to an employment and training program, the homeless-serving or other referring agencies should assess the individual's appropriateness for employment and training services.  JTHDP sites found that some of the problems that led to homelessness -- such as, mental illness, substance abuse problems, serious basic skills deficiencies, and inability to work cooperatively with others in the workplace -- were often not revealed (or apparent) at the time of intake.  However, over time, through observation and building of trust between the referring agency's case manager and client, a better understanding of the unique circumstances of each individual and potential problems that may stand in the way of successful job training and placement are likely to emerge.  The careful pre-screening of potential participants by the referring agency using criteria provided by the employment and training agency -- while not     ensuring success -- can greatly increase the odds that referred individuals will successfully complete training and enter employment.          Knoxville-Knox County Community Action Committee operated the Homeward Bound program for homeless individuals in the Knoxville area.  This program, co-located with the JTPA agency, screened homeless individuals for eventual participation in JTPA (and provided a range of other employment, support, and housing services).  In working closely with staff at the JTPA agency over a five-year period, Homeward Bound staff came to realize that about 20 to 25 percent of the homeless individuals they served were interested in and appropriate for referral to JTPA for training.  Homeward Bound case managers assessed and worked with homeless individuals typically a month or longer before determining whether they were suitable for referral to JTPA.  The Homeward Bound staff met regularly with JTPA staff to discuss referrals and make collaborative decisions on which Homeward Bound participants would be referred to JTPA for training.        e.  Outreach Strategy #5:  Provide Feedback to the Referring Agency on Appropriate and Inappropriate Referrals      It is very important to maintain an ongoing dialogue with the staff at the agencies making referrals to your program.  This is particularly important when the agency is just beginning to refer homeless individuals to your program.  Remember these two main points:           Start slowly with the referring agency.   The agency should send over only a few potential participants at first so that each agency can get a feel for the types of individuals appropriate for referral.                Share with the referring agency the specific reasons that each referred individual is suitable or unsuitable for your program.   Feedback is also needed as participants  proceed through your program so that the referring agency understands the types of individuals that seem to be most successful in completing training and finding/retaining a job.          Similar to referrals from other sources, there will be both successes and failures when working with homeless individuals.  The key over time is to refine (through discussions) the screening procedures used by the referring agency so an increasing proportion of those referred complete training, and successfully enter and retain employment.       B. INTAKE       1. Background and Challenges      The intake process serves two very important functions -- (1) documentation is obtained to determine applicant eligibility for program services and (2) information is obtained to preliminarily assess the suitability of the applicant for program services.  While homeless individuals are probably not all that different from many of the disadvantaged individuals your program is already serving, it is important to keep in mind some of the special circumstances that may arise with respect to intake of homeless individuals into your program:       The existence and validity of documentation needed during the intake/eligibility determination process can sometimes be a problem for homeless individuals.   For example, homeless individuals may have lost identification, such as their driver's license and other needed documents during their period of homelessness.  It can also be difficult for some homeless individuals to provide documented proof of their homelessness (especially if they are not staying in a homeless shelter or transitional facility).       Homeless individuals may be guarded (or suspicious) about sharing information and documentation with program staff.    Some homeless individuals have been shuttled from agency to agency, been ""accessed"" over and over, and perhaps had bad or humiliating experiences with human service agencies in the past.  For example, they may have been asked to leave emergency or transitional housing facilities because of active substance abuse issues; they may have been thrown out of employment and training programs in the past because of bad attendance or poor behavior.  As a result of these past experiences and fears that they may not be considered for program services, homeless participants may be guarded about their past and unwilling to share information during the intake process.  For example, until they develop a trusting relationship, homeless individuals may be very reluctant to share information about past job loss, basic skills deficiencies, alcohol or drug use, arrests, abusive family relationships, or mental and physical health problems.           Homeless individuals may find it very difficult to make long-term commitments to basic skills or job-related training .  Even those homeless individuals who express a strong preference for job training may find it very difficult to pursue training over the long-term without some form of financial assistance (e.g., a Pell grant or public assistance).  Because of their lack of resources, homeless participants may need more flexible training options (e.g., a combination of part-time work and part-time training, on-the-job training, or compressed training options).        2. Strategies      The intake process is important because it: (1) clarifies for the applicant the types of program services available through your program and the responsibilities of participants under the program and (2) provides an opportunity for the program to make an initial determination of whether the individual is appropriate for program services.  Below, several strategies relating to an effective intake process are offered based on JTHDP experiences.        a.  Intake Strategy #1: Request Background Information and Documentation From the Referring Agency        A key during the intake process is to learn as much as possible about the individuals who are to be served.  Collection of detailed information about each applicant makes it possible to determine those individuals who are appropriate or inappropriate for program services. This information can also be helpful in beginning to tailor employment, training, and other program services to meet the specific needs of each participant.  To the extent possible, your agency should gather background information on each homeless individual directly from the case manager at the referring agency.  Some important issues to discuss with the referring agency (and with the applicant during the intake process) include the following:           reasons the individual became homeless;       evidence of a history of substance abuse or mental illness;      behavioral problems such as displaying repeated disruptive behavior;      basic skills deficiencies;       other potential barriers to employment, e.g., lack of financial support, health issues; and        needs for support services -- especially housing, transportation, and child care.       As discussed above, determining eligibility can sometimes be delayed or complicated for homeless individuals because of difficulties in acquiring necessary documentation.  The referring agency may be able to provide this documentation, or other agencies in your area may be able to assist homeless individuals in gathering needed documentation.         Elgin Community College (ECC) in Illinois developed a linkage with Centro de Informacion, a local community-based organization serving the Hispanic population.  ECC served a large Hispanic population and found the need to link with an agency that was more familiar with some of the distinctive needs of that population.  In addition to providing ESL classes and advocacy, Centro de Informacion assisted ECC participants in securing documentation, such as birth certificates.  This service was an invaluable resource that enabled ECC to enroll its JTHDP clients in JTPA training.       b.  Intake Strategy #2:  Use the Intake Process to Clarify Program Objectives, Services, and Expectations      Intake and the suitability determination process represent an opportunity not only to gather information about potential participants, but also to explain program objectives, services, and expectations.  As with any program participant, clearly explain the specific types of services provided through your program, including their duration and timing.  Make sure to delineate the time involved in training (both the number of hours per week and the number of weeks/months an individual may be involved in training) and the responsibilities of training participants if they undertake long-term training.  Also, make sure to indicate limits on the cost of tuition and the types of institutions that may be attended.  You will want to assess, with input from the referring agency, the degree to which applicants are committed and motivated to participate in job training and eventual employment, and that their expectations for employment are realistic.  You may want to conduct skills and interest assessments during the intake process to help guide your discussions with the applicant.        At Project WORTH, a JTHDP project sponsored by the Jefferson County Public Schools in Louisville, Kentucky, intake was a multi-step process beginning with a group orientation that provided a program overview.  The overview helped applicants determine whether the program goals and structure were compatible with their personal goals.  Those who were interested were then interviewed privately.  If they met the eligibility criteria, they took a basic reading skills test.  Only if their reading level met the program's minimum standard was an appointment made to begin the official intake process.        c.  Intake Strategy #3:  Assess the Types of Resources Available to Maintain Participation During Involvement in Employment and Training Activities       Because of their lack of resources and possible limitations on stays at emergency or transitional facilities, homeless individuals may be reluctant to commit to long-term training or may need to attend such programs part-time (while working).  It is important to accurately assess their situation prior to enrollment in employment and training activities.   Some applicants will come to the program with public assistance they can rely on during their period of training -- perhaps AFDC, food stamps, Supplemental Security Income (SSI), general assistance (GA) or emergency assistance (EA).  Some may be eligible for cash assistance or food stamps but are unaware of their eligibility and need to be referred to the appropriate agency.  Others may come to the program with part-time or even full-time (but low-wage) employment.  Still others (especially single, homeless males) may have exhausted their benefits (e.g., unemployment compensation or general assistance) and may not be eligible to receive any public assistance beyond food stamps.      One of the distinctive characteristics of homeless applicants, as compared to other applicants to your program, is their lack of stable housing.  It is important to understand their current housing situation, and to verify that situation with the referring agency.  An emergency shelter may be willing to guarantee a bed or a transitional housing facility may be flexible with the curfew, as long as the individual is participating in your program.  Hence, during the intake process, some important questions to ask are:            What is your housing situation, and how long can you remain in that housing?      What resources do you have available to sustain yourself during a prolonged period of training?      Are you willing to work full- or part-time while in training?       How will you take care of dependent children while in training?     What type of transportation do you have available so you can attend training?              d.  Intake Strategy #4:  Have a Well-coordinated Plan for Referring Ineligible or Inappropriate Applicants to Other Needed Services      Even if homeless individuals are well-screened by the referring agency, it is likely some of those referred will find that your program is not for them (e.g., they would rather get a job first and then consider training) or you may find that the individual is not yet ready or appropriate for training.  Hence, it is important for your program to have a well-coordinated plan for referring those who are inappropriate to other services.  JTHDP experience suggests that in working with homeless individuals strong linkages will be needed with the following types of organizations:      the Employment Service and other programs providing job search services;            public assistance agencies (e.g., departments of social services, community action organizations);        housing programs, both public and private;       in-patient and out-patient substance abuse programs and support groups (such as Alcoholics and Narcotics Anonymous);      programs for veterans (e.g., Veterans Administration hospitals and support centers);      vocational rehabilitation programs; and      mental health and other health care providers, including dentists and opticians.        In working with homeless individuals -- many of whom have been referred back and forth between agencies in the past -- the way in which referrals are made can make an critical difference in whether the individual follows up on the referral.  In addition to a resource directory of available service providers, your agency should have an established contact at other agencies and formal procedures for making referrals.  These procedures should include some type of feedback to the referring agency about the results of the referral.  By having an established relationship with service providers, you can better understand the other agencies' eligibility requirements and increase the likelihood that individuals you refer for services at other agencies are eligible and receive the services.  (See Chapter 5 for more information on linkages with agencies providing housing and other support services.)        The Seattle/King County Private Industry Council, a JTHDP grantee, used its intake process as the beginning of a comprehensive assessment that determined which applicants were appropriate for job training services and identified the range of services applicants needed to increase their chances of achieving self-sufficiency.  Once screened, participants were enrolled in employment and training activities or referred to services at other agencies, if necessary. For example, if there was evidence of chemical dependency, the individual was referred to a drug/alcohol recovery center for treatment prior to enrolling in training.  The PIC had cooperative agreements with a number of substance abuse programs, which enabled applicants to be served quickly and increased their chances of returning to the PIC for employment and training services.      C. ASSESSMENT AND CASE MANAGEMENT           1. Background and Challenges      Assessment and case management are closely related activities.  The client assessment process identifies client aptitudes, skills, obstacles to employment (and self-sufficiency), and needed services.  This process results in the development of a case plan identifying client objectives and specific steps and services required to meet each specific objective.  Case management involves the assignment of an agency staff member (i.e., case manager) to each participant to regularly monitor participant progress toward achieving case plan objectives and to make adjustments in the plan, as needed.  The case manager also serves as a resource to participants for troubleshooting problems and access to other services needed to achieve case plan objectives.  Assessment and case management are essential for tailoring services to the specific needs and employment barriers faced by each participant.     Organizations referring homeless individuals to employment and training programs will likely have assessed the individual prior to referral.  Your agency should work closely with these referring organizations to understand the assessments that have already been conducted, and, if possible, to obtain the results of relevant assessments.  The use of assessments conducted by other agencies will reduce the burden of additional assessment for participants and also save resources.          Seattle's homeless project used a comprehensive assessment process.  Assessment covered six areas:  basic skills, work skills, pre-employment/work maturity skills, life skills, housing needs, and support services.  The case manager and/or the assessment specialist were responsible for conducting the assessment and preparing an Individual Training and Housing Plan together with the participant, which they adjusted based on ongoing assessment and case management throughout the client's participation in the program.     Challenges you might encounter in assessing and case managing homeless participants include:       There is a fine line between over- and under-assessment.   A thorough assessment is necessary to determine participant goals and to tailor services to the specific needs of participants.  A lengthy and unnecessary assessment, however, may discourage participation and take away from time that individuals (and staff) could be devoting to employment and training activities.             With multiple agencies involved, there can be overlap and confusion in the area of case management .  Homeless persons, particularly those living in a structured housing setting or participating in substance abuse treatment programs, may already be working with case managers from other agencies.  Your agency will want to coordinate efforts with these case managers to avoid duplication of services and confusion for both staff and participants.  For example, where multiple case managers are involved, one case manager could be suggesting one solution to a problem, while another is suggesting a different solution.  It is preferable, when multiple agencies are involved with one client, to identify a single lead case manager who takes responsibility for the client.        The Home Builders Institute's HEART program addressed case management overlap by establishing a formal agreement with a local case management organization.  The agreement spelled out linkages between the HEART program, the case management organization, the JTPA provider, and shelters.  Case management for HEART participants was based on the case plan which was developed jointly by the case manager, the HEART training coordinator, and a JTPA representative.                Homeless individuals may be guarded about providing needed information .  As discussed earlier, until you are able to develop rapport with homeless individuals, it is possible that they will be reluctant to share information about themselves that may be important in developing a case plan.  For example, they may be reluctant to discuss the problems that led to their homelessness, such as basic skill deficiencies, substance abuse problems, incarceration, or an abusive family situation.        .      2. Strategies             a.  Assessment and Case Management Strategy #1: When Possible, Use Other Agencies to Help with Assessment and Case Management      As we discussed in the section on intake, if a homeless client has been referred from another agency, it is important to obtain as much input and information from that agency as possible.  In the case of homeless individuals referred by other agencies, there is a strong likelihood they have already had some form of assessment.  In addition to receiving help in the assessment process, your agency may be able to secure case management services (or some part of the case management function) through linkages with other organizations.  For example, many participants referred from homeless-serving agencies will have case managers (e.g., individuals living in transitional housing facilities).       If you rely upon case managers (outside of your organization) for information and tracking client progress, meet regularly with these case managers to coordinate case activities.    Any staff working with the participant -- whether they are in your job training agency or in a partner agency -- should be familiar with the goals and objectives of the participant's case plan.        Project WORTH in Louisville, Kentucky developed a client programming flow chart that identified which specific staff at each agency were responsible for every step of the case plan.  Job development, for example, was identified as a shared responsibility between the case manager, the Project WORTH job developer, and the client's vocational teacher.  The case manager shared responsibility for housing follow-up with Project WORTH's housing liaison and job developer, along with the Section 8 coordinator for the county housing agency.       b.  Assessment and Case Management Strategy #2:  Help Establish Realistic Training and Job Expectations for Participants      Not unlike other disadvantaged individuals coming to employment and training programs, some homeless individuals may arrive with ""pie in the sky"" expectations about the types of jobs for which they might be able to train.  For example, an individual may come to the program with substantial basic skills deficiencies expressing a desire to become a registered nurse (which requires graduation from a college nursing program).  While attempting not to diminish motivational levels of the individual, it is important during the assessment process and case management meetings to convey to the participant:           what your program can and cannot do (e.g., there are constraints on how long the individual can be assisted and the types of institutions that can be attended);      the basic skills and educational prerequisites for entering training (and eventually for the preferred occupations);        limits on the tuition charges for training; and       the likely time involved and financial commitment on the part of the participant.          JTHDP sites reported that when properly and thoroughly discussed -- together with supporting objective test results from educational and occupational interest tests -- most individuals came around to realistic views of the types of training they should undertake.        c.  Assessment and Case Management Strategy #3:  Assess Housing and Support Service Needs and Document Referrals in the Case Plan      JTHDP grantees found that homeless participants were substantially more likely to complete training programs and enter employment if, during the assessment process, housing and support service needs were carefully identified and subsequently addressed.  Housing assistance and support services must be carefully tailored to both the needs and preferences of the individual.  For example, while transitional housing located far from a bus stop might not be a problem for a person with a car, it would present problems for homeless individuals dependent on public transportation to get to a training site or to work.  As with any plan for service delivery, housing assistance and support services should have clear goals and resources that will be used to reach the goals.  The goals and resources should be clear to both the case manager and the participant.     If the individual is referred from other agencies with an expertise in the area of providing housing assistance (e.g., a homeless-serving agency such as an emergency shelter), it is possible that the homeless-serving or other referring agencies will have already conducted a thorough assessment and established a plan for improving an individual's housing situation.  Ask these referral agencies to share their information about the participant and steps the individual should be taking to improve his or her housing situation.  If a housing assessment has not been completed or is not available from the referring agency, some important questions to ask are:           How long has the individual been homeless?     Where does the individual reside (e.g., on the street, in emergency shelters, with friends or family, or in supported or transitional housing)?     What are the individual's preferences for short-term and long-term living arrangements (e.g., rent, location, sharing of an apartment or living alone, willingness to live in emergency shelters or transitional facilities)?     What potential resources are available (including friends and relatives) and what are the barriers to securing and upgrading housing?     Does the applicant have special needs or requirements (e.g., a physical or mental disability, a history of substance abuse, or a history of serious mental illness)?         Any referrals your agency does make for housing or other support services should always be documented in the case plan.  Tracking each referral and its outcome helps to assure that homeless participants (and other participants) receive the services they need and enables administrative staff to renegotiate referral agreements when documentation shows that they are not working smoothly.          d.  Assessment and Case Management Strategy #4:  Continue Assessment and Case Management Throughout a Participant's Involvement in Your Program      Because of reluctance on the part of participants to discuss some sensitive issues at the time of intake  and  because circumstances can change over time (e.g., need for transportation or housing assistance), questions relating to the individual's circumstances and service needs should be asked periodically and the case plan updated accordingly.  The frequency of meetings between clients and case managers varied across JTHDP sites, but generally were more frequent (e.g., once a week) during the early weeks of a client's participation and at points of crisis or transition.  These meetings were typically in-person and focused on monitoring the progress participants were making toward achieving their case plan goals.  In some JTHDP sites, case managers met regularly as a group with a supervisor to share progress and seek group advice on individual clients.      Finally, it is important to keep case manager/client ratios low enough so that the case managers have time to get to know and maintain regular contact with each client and have the flexibility to devote additional time to clients should unforeseen problems arise.  JTHDP sites tried to keep case management caseloads typically under 25 participants per case manager (at any point in time).   CHAPTER 3       THE ROAD TO SELF-SUPPORTING EMPLOYMENT:      EDUCATION AND TRAINING SERVICES         This chapter describes education and training services needed by homeless individuals to secure and retain employment.  These services --  basic skills , including remedial education, literacy training, and English-as-a-Second-Language instruction, and  occupational skills training , including classroom training, on-the-job training, and work experience -- do not vary from the services needed by most employment and training program participants, but the need for flexibility in service delivery may be greater for homeless participants.  What follows is a discussion of the special challenges in providing education and training services to homeless individuals and effective strategies for overcoming those challenges.  Many of the strategies identified as effective in delivering basic skills training are relevant to the delivery of effective occupational skills training (and vice versa).         A. BASIC SKILLS TRAINING       1. Background and Challenges      Employment and training programs are likely to find that basic education deficiencies need to be addressed for as many as a quarter of homeless individuals referred for occupational training.  For example, about one-fourth (23 percent) of JTHDP participants received remedial or basic skills training, and 22 percent were school dropouts. (10)   In some instances, the referring agency may be able to provide or arrange for basic skills training before the participant is served by your agency; but in other cases, it will be necessary to arrange such services before the participant can enroll or concurrent with enrollment in occupational training.  While the basic skills deficiencies and the ways they are addressed are similar for homeless individuals and other disadvantaged individuals, there are some potential barriers to providing basic skills training for homeless individuals, including the following:       Urgency to obtain employment.   Although participant assessment may indicate a need for educational remediation, the participant's circumstances may rule out this type of instruction unless some arrangement is made for income and housing support while the individual is involved in basic skills instruction.       Past failures in educational settings.   Some individuals may have failed in previous efforts to address basic skills deficiencies (e.g., dropped out of high school or failed to complete a literacy program).  As a result, they may enter programs with low self-esteem and lack confidence in their ability to succeed within an educational setting.        Resistance to structure and requirements.   As with many adults, the structure and requirements of classroom training may be something homeless individuals thought they had left behind long ago.  For homeless individuals, this feeling may be heightened because of the lack of structure during their period of homelessness. (11)         2. Strategies       a.  Basic Skills Strategy #1:  Develop a Step-by-Step Plan for Upgrading Basic Skills in Line with Job Training and Employment Objectives      Tests of basic skills conducted during the assessment process (and perhaps by the referring agency) should provide your case manager with a detailed picture of the participant's basic skills deficiencies.  Test results and their implications for future training and employment should be discussed with each participant.  During these discussions, it will be important to gather information from the participant needed to plan the type and duration of basic skills training.  Among the issues to be discussed are:      Has the individual received basic skills training in the past?  If so, when, from whom, for what deficiencies, and was the training completed?  If the training was not completed, why was this the case?  It is important at this point to determine whether the individual has some probability of completing basic skills training, and past performance is an indication of this.      What length of time is the participant willing to commit to basic skills training, and what goals would the individual like to achieve?  Is the proposed length and type of basic skills training sufficient for the individual to qualify for and succeed in subsequent occupational training?      When can the individual attend training?  Does the individual plan to work while attending training?  Is the individual constrained in the hours he or she can attend training because of child care?  Does the residence where the individual is temporarily staying place any restriction on activities or the hours in which the individual can participate in outside activities?      Does the individual face transportation constraints, which may limit where the individual can attend training?       Based on these discussions, a realistic plan for addressing basic skills deficiencies should be developed.  The plan should be tailored to the individual, clearly setting forth the objectives of the remediation effort, the time frame and intensity of the training, and the steps the individual is expected to undertake to reach his or her goals.        One participant enrolled in the Hennepin County JTHDP program worked a full-time job and attended basic skills classes in the evening.  He welcomed the grueling schedule for three reasons:  it provided him with enough income to get by while pursuing skills training that would lead to a better job, he didn't have the time to associate with other residents where he was living who would likely have been a negative influence, and it kept him too busy to even consider revisiting his own history of substance abuse.       b.  Basic Skills Strategy #2:  Provide for a Wide Variety of Settings, Methods, and Timing in Arranging for Basic Skills Training           Whether your program provides basic skills training in-house or through referral, there should be considerable flexibility in the delivery of this basic skills training to your homeless participants.  In selecting basic skills providers, consider the following:       Access open entry/exit programs.   Because a person does not necessarily become homeless at the beginning of a semester and a homeless person needs to move quickly toward employment, it is important to be able to access basic skills training rapidly (i.e., without having to wait for a new class to form in the fall or spring semester).       Provide for flexible training hours.   Because homeless participants may have time-specific obligations at their housing facility, or need to work while enrolled in training, basic skills training should be available during the day and in the evening.       Incorporate individually-paced instruction.   Because individuals, homeless or otherwise, do not learn at the same rate, basic skills training needs to be individually-paced.       Tailor methods to the individual.   Some individuals work best using pen and paper; others progress more quickly using a computer.  Assure through your coordination arrangements and/or through in-house capabilities that participants will be able to utilize the methods best suited to their learning style.  Generally, a blend of computer and teacher-assisted instruction seems to work best.        At Elgin Community College (ECC), all participants who did not graduate from high school or who graduated but felt deficient in basic skills were referred to the ECC Adult Basic Education Center.  An immediate assessment (the Test of Adult Basic Education) was administered, and since the program was open entry/open exit, the participant could begin classes the next day.  Both morning and evening classes were available, instruction was individually-paced using computers or work books, and child care was provided.  This service was available to all in the community.        When establishing coordination agreements with providers for basic skills training, keep in mind that community colleges and vocational schools sometimes precede their occupational skills training with several weeks of remediation.  Other facilities will provide tutoring and self-help laboratories for students to address specific basic skills deficiencies while they are in occupational skills training.         c.  Basic Skills Strategy #3:  Regularly Monitor How the Individual Is Progressing          It is important for case managers to regularly monitor participants' progress toward achieving basic skills goals.  First, they may be less likely to have had successful experiences in similar types of programs in the past, and without support may not complete the training.  As a result, they may require additional support.  Second, the lack of structure in some homeless individuals' lives may make the transition to classroom training more difficult.  Regular attention from a case manager and flexibility in the delivery of basic skills may make the difference in whether a participant completes or fails to complete basic skills instruction.  Third, those homeless participants who have not used their basic skills regularly, may need only a ""refresher"" course in basic skills.  Staying attuned to the individual may enable the participant to move more quickly through basic skills training.        At the Greater Washington Boys and Girls Club, all participants received, at a minimum, monthly progress reports from the Education Specialist.  These reports were discussed with the participants and their case managers.  The reports described participants' progress in meeting their basic skills goals and in GED preparation.  The Specialist also provided direction and guidance to the vocational instructors and provided input for curriculum and training development.               d.  Basic Skills Strategy #4:  Assure That Basic Skills Training Is Contextual       There are many training programs that teach basic skills in a ""real world"" context (e.g., learning multiplication through calculating sales tax as opposed to rote memorization of the multiplication tables).  This type of learning has proven to be effective with students of all ages.  It is particularly important for adults, who need to relearn basic skills which are frequently geared to younger students.          The Homeless Initiatives Pilot Project (HIPP) of the Seattle-King County PIC found that homeless persons with low basic skills were unable to get hired or retain jobs that provided livable wages. Basic skills deficiencies also deprived homeless persons of opportunities to enter vocational training.  As a result, all participants scoring below the employable range on the basic skills competency tests were required to take basic skills as part of their program.  Basic skills training was offered concurrently with other training or work development activities.  HIPP found that basic skills were acquired more rapidly and with greater retention if the learning was contextual and closely tied to real work or life tasks.            e.  Basic Skills Strategy #5:  Include Life Skills Training as Part of Any Occupational or Basic Skills Training Program for Homeless Individuals        Individuals fall into homelessness, in part, because they have difficulty managing their lives.  No matter how successful you may be in providing them with education and training, they are likely to become homeless again unless they improve their ability to handle the responsibilities of day-to-day living.  Life skills training can incorporate a broad range of topics and is often integrated into job search/pre-employment training, occupational skills training, or basic skills training.  Life skills training can be provided directly by your agency, through referral, or by agencies with which your participants are already linked. Some of the topics typically covered in life skills courses include:           communication skills,     anger management,     self-esteem development,     motivation skills,     personal budgeting,      goal setting, and     consumer awareness.        There are several topics that are of particular benefit to homeless participants:       Self-esteem training  can counter the psychological effects of homelessness.  This can be particularly important for individuals who have escaped from an abusive relationship or who have been battered or otherwise abused since they became homeless.        Some of the abused women interviewed during site visits identified self-esteem as their most critical employability issue.  The Kentucky Domestic Violence Association (KDVA) used resume writing to foster self-esteem; by identifying and highlighting skills, the agency found that participants enhanced their self-esteem.  KDVA allowed two full days for resume-writing during its pre-employment skills workshop to gain the full self-esteem benefit that can result from resume preparation.      Building  participant motivation  through small group training and support groups, and reinforcing motivation through the case management relationship can help identify and recognize even small successes and keep participants progressing toward their goals.        Project Decisions in Saint Paul successfully added three half-days of motivational training for some participants to lower the dropout rates that peaked after assessment.  Other participants entered motivational training later, after they began job search when discouragement can set in.  Offered by a charismatic and skilled Goodwill Industries consultant, the motivational training focused on planning and goal-setting in four areas: personal, job, family, and community.  One Project Decisions staff member described the motivational training as ""validating your inner vision of what you think you can be.""      Project WORTH staff made a great effort to acknowledge and regularly reward even small accomplishments, such as a participant who had good attendance in training or raised his/her reading level.  Awards included gift certificates for restaurant dinners and for shopping at area department stores.      Many of the circumstances that contribute to homelessness relate to  money management .  Some homeless people lived beyond their means for too long; others did not understand which debts could be negotiated and which were inflexible.  Money management training can help participants to better manage their finances in the future.  It can also help participants make appropriate training choices by increasing their understanding of the implications for long-term self-sufficiency of taking an immediate job opening paying minimum wage versus enrolling in training that will lead to a higher-paying job.        Housing management  instructs individuals about the rights and responsibilities of renters and landlords.  For example, homeless individuals who have been living in a shelter or transitional housing for a prolonged period may need to be reintroduced to the concept of living on their own.  They may not understand the relationship between delinquent rent payments or destruction of property and eviction.  Additionally, don't assume that people you advise to ""find a roommate"" necessarily know how to find an appropriate roommate or are able to live in an accommodating way with a roommate.           Greater Washington Boys and Girls Clubs' Project Uplift hired a housing coordinator to teach home management skills classes once a week for 10 weeks.  Each week was devoted to a different topic, and students were allowed to begin the 10-week cycle at any time.  The District of Columbia's Rental Accommodations Board compiled the information for the home management skills curriculum; topics included budgeting, money management, finding housing, Section 8 and other subsidized housing, security deposits, leases, landlord/tenant responsibilities, dealing with the telephone company, maintaining a lease, rent control, and eviction.  To be eligible for Project Uplift's housing assistance services, participants had to have attended at least five classes.      B. OCCUPATIONAL SKILLS TRAINING      1. Background and Challenges      The goal of occupational skills training is to upgrade participants' skills so they can secure employment with wages enabling them to be self-sufficient.   Some of the distinctive challenges that employment and training agencies may face in providing occupational training for homeless individuals include the following:       Homeless individuals may have few resources to sustain themselves while in training.   While in training, the homeless individual needs to cope with the basic needs for shelter, food, and daily living expenses.  Transportation to and from training may be a problem.  They may also experience difficulties in arranging and paying for child care.  Because of the circumstances that led to their homelessness, some homeless individuals do not have existing relationships with family and friends to assist them in meeting these basic needs.        Homeless individuals may have a strong preference for employment over training. (12)   Because of their lack of resources and permanent housing, many homeless individuals are likely to have a preference for securing work in the shortest time possible.  Alternatively, they may seek short-term training or training opportunities that allow them to work concurrently.         Some homeless individuals may only need training to upgrade their skills.    The skills homeless individuals may have developed in previous training programs or on the job may be out-of-date or simply ""rusty.""  For example, homeless individuals who have been incarcerated may have many years of job-related experience, but dropped out of the labor market for several years.  Training programs focusing on refreshing skills may be able to move the homeless individuals quickly toward employment and, at the same time, save scarce training dollars.      2. Strategies        a.  Occupational Training Strategy #1: Tailor Occupational Training to the Interests and Needs of the Individual, as Well as the Local Demands of the Labor Market      The assessment process is intended to match the participant with the appropriate training option(s).  To meet the diverse needs of your homeless participants:            assist those participants seeking part-time employment to do so in conjunction with their skills training;       have available open-entry training programs;      offer training courses in the evening as well as during the day;      offer ""compressed"" training options, i.e., courses offered for more hours over a shorter period of time;      arrange for on-the-job training opportunities, which provide an opportunity to combine training and wages, a necessity for many homeless individuals;      make sure training is provided in an occupation in which there is local demand for workers; and      when possible, offer work experience which provides an opportunity for the most needy to gain valuable ""world of work"" experience.            The training programs offered to the JTHDP homeless participants of the Massachusetts Career Development Institute (MCDI) were determined as a result of an analysis of the demands of the local labor market and were certified to be in compliance with the local PIC's guidelines for occupational skills training programs.  All areas of study combined classroom and laboratory experiences to ensure comprehensive coverage of program content.  All programs stressed positive attendance and punctuality, adherence to safety standards, and positive attitudes.  All program clusters had active private sector advisory boards which met quarterly to review curricula, staff, equipment, and methodology.  Most programs were open entry/open exit with either full- or part-time schedules to allow flexibility and facilitate participation and retention.  These characteristics of occupational skills training, in large measure, accounted for MCDI's placement rate of 71 percent and average wage at placement of $7.27 for their participants.     It is important to keep the participant involved throughout the process of selecting the area for occupational skills training.  Pushing a participant into an occupational training area they are not interested in or qualified for does a disservice to both the participant and your agency.  After making the investment in training, the participant may not seek employment in the area, or retain the job after he or she obtains employment.  Work toward matching participant interest with real job possibilities.          Project WORTH offered several job training services with the goal of helping participants gain self-sufficiency.  The placement strategy emphasized interest, aptitude, and skills.  For some participants, there was a focus on short-term training that provided marketable skills within a three- to six-month period.  After researching the needs of the Louisville business community, Project WORTH found that the following training courses would allow participants to obtain employment on a timely basis, earning an adequate wage with benefits: basic computer skills, clerical, certified nursing assistant, licensed practical nurse, child care worker, emergency medical technician, and basic construction.        b.  Occupational Training Strategy #2:  Develop Coordination Agreements With a Wide Variety of Education and Training Providers        To accommodate the interests and needs of a participant, you will need to develop coordination agreements with a broad range of training providers.  In developing your linkages, look at the occupational areas in which your participants are likely to seek training, as well as the setting in which the training is delivered.  Offer as many and as flexible methods for pursuing education and training as you possibly can (e.g., literacy programs providing both group classroom instruction and self-paced computer training).        Elgin Community College (ECC), in coordination with their local PIC (and the vendors with whom the PIC contracted), was able to make available to participants a wide array of occupational training opportunities.  Participants, in conjunction with their case manager, could select between part-time and full-time, day or evening, and text book/computer-assisted training that lasted from two to 16 weeks.  The training areas included: certified nursing assistant, food sanitation, truck driving, paralegal, computer science, auto mechanics, plastics, data processing, keyboarding, accounting, maintenance, machine tool, and others.  These courses were offered at a number of locations, many with easy access to transportation.  ECC could also assist with child care and other needed support services.       Agreements between the employment and training agency and the service provider should clearly delineate all responsibilities. This is particularly true for OJTs and work experience (WEX) placements.  Some of the areas to be delineated include:           prerequisite skills for individuals to participate;     training responsibilities;     oversight responsibilities;     days, hours, and total duration of training; and     responsibility for funding (OJTs and WEX). (13)            In developing their WEX program, the Private Industry Council of Snohomish County increasingly delineated the responsibilities of all those involved -- participants, the PIC, and the WEX site.  For example, PIC staff were responsible for developing and monitoring according to program policies for host agency agreements, developing job descriptions and training objectives, performance review, time card/record keeping, payroll, and site monitoring.  In general, the PIC monitored WEX sites every two weeks to maintain regular contact with the participant, obtain a written supervisory evaluation, and to assess when the participant was ready for the next activity.        c.  Occupational Training Strategy #3:  Keep Homeless Participants Moving Toward Self-Sufficiency      Homeless individuals are anxious to proceed along the path toward self-sufficiency.  Find ways to get participants into a learning situation immediately.  ""Down time"" can be dangerous for a homeless person.  Once participants have been assessed and have developed a case plan, most JTHDP sites found they had a greater chance of success if they began some type of training or education at once.  Plus, getting them used to a schedule early helps acclimate them to the demands of working.  Open entry/exit training programs are ideal for homeless participants.  This structure allows homeless individuals to access training when they are ready so there is no down time.  Some JTHDP sites extended assessment while others offered job readiness or life skills classes until occupational training began.  As discussed earlier, homeless individuals oftentimes need to move toward their goals quickly and experience the sense of success that develops with pursuing one's goals.         d.  Occupational Training Strategy #4:  Offer Case Management During and After Training Activities to Trouble Shoot and Provide Support        The trust relationship developed between a participant and his/her case manager may enable the homeless individual to discuss difficulties he or she is having before the difficulties become obstacles to success.  A case manager may be able to identify potential problems before they interfere with a participant's progress in training.  For example, a case manager who becomes aware of a participant's car problem may be able to secure a voucher for repairs before it interferes with his or her ability to report to work on time.  Case managers can also help to resolve work-related conflicts before they escalate to the point where the participant loses his or her job.  For example, if the case manager is aware of an interpersonal problem the participant is having at work, he or she can role play the situation with the participant, enabling the individual to practice how to best resolve the situation.         e.  Occupational Training Strategy #5:  Make Sure the Homeless Participant Has All Necessary Supports in Place Prior to and Throughout Training      Homeless participants are likely to need a variety of support services prior to and during the training period.  Many of these services can be arranged for and provided by homeless-serving and other agencies in your community.  Through the assessment process, these services and the appropriate provider should be identified.  For example, support services may include provision of transportation vouchers or work clothes, or arrangements with an emergency shelter to save a bed until 8:00 p.m. (when your participant finishes training).      Do not assume that just because an individual is referred to another agency for services, he or she has successfully obtained the requested service.  There are many points at which the referral can breakdown both before the service is received and even after the participant begins receiving the service.   It is important to check on the success of the initial referral (both with the participant and the referral agency) and to regularly monitor that the participant continues to receive the service.         f.  Occupational Training Strategy #6:  Develop OJT Placements as an Option for Your Homeless Participants         On-the-Job Training (OJT) provides the opportunity for a participant to learn job-related skills, while at the same time receive wages. (14)   This strategy is particularly effective for homeless individuals in need of immediate income, but who may not have the job-related skills needed to obtain a permanent and well-paying job.  OJT has the added benefit of generally leading to permanent employment and providing trainees with the opportunity to learn through a more ""hands-on"" approach than may be typical within a classroom setting.  OJT can also be advantageous for employers.  In addition to receiving a partial subsidy to offset the added costs of providing skills training, the employer is able to test the trainee over a prolonged period within the work setting to determine if the individual is productive and works cooperatively with others.     A number of JTHDP sites found that OJT was both feasible and highly advantageous for their homeless adult participants. The flexibility of training under OJTs, as well as the ability of such arrangements to provide both skills upgrading and immediate wages, made OJT a particularly attractive alternative.        The Private Industry Council of Snohomish County viewed OJT as an essential part of their overall program strategy to assist participants in finding employment. During a 45-day period, participants worked with program staff to identify and develop an employer training site.  Development activities for this included both participant and staff cold calls to employers and contacts to the PIC's existing network of business partners and other employers.  This process was structured and required the participant to be in attendance, supervised, and assisted in his or her training site search.  OJT sites were developed in high demand occupations or areas that met the needs, interests, and abilities of the participant.             g.  Occupational Training Strategy #7: Use Work Experience for Individuals with Serious Barriers to Employment      JTHDP sites found that work experience was a particularly effective strategy for homeless individuals lacking workplace experience (e.g., displaced homemakers) and for those facing formidable barriers to employment (e.g., chronic mental illness, a long history of substance abuse, or individuals with serious basic skills deficiencies).  Work experience placements enabled JTHDP sites to place those who otherwise would have been uncompetitive within the labor market and to provide skills training that eventually served as a bridge to permanent, unsubsidized employment.     JTHDP sites indicated that it took considerable time and effort to work with employers to initially develop WEX slots.  However, once a position was developed -- and the initial individuals placed with the employer worked out successfully -- the employer was often willing to open up other slots.  A key was to be responsive to the employer and to provide assurances that each worker would be carefully screened for the position and receive support and regular oversight to ensure that the requirements of the employer were met.         Fountain House (FH) in New York City, serving homeless mentally ill individuals, was able to secure numerous work experience opportunities.  In structuring its work experience program, FH staff guaranteed that a specific number of workers would be at the job site each day, even if that meant that FH staff would perform the job.  The agency trained each new worker at the employer site on the specific tasks that they were to perform.  The worker was then observed by a case manager to make sure that they performed the tasks in a timely and effective manner.  The case manager also frequently checked with the employer to make certain that the individual was working out.  If there were problems, the JTHDP site worked with the individual and/or provided another placement for the employer.         JTHDP sites also found that WEX participants needed to have a clear understanding of their specific responsibilities at the work site, as well as the nature of work experience.  For example, it was important that participants understood that WEX placements were not intended to be permanent placements.  Participants also needed to understand that the purpose of WEX placements was to gain work experience and it was possible that this experience might not be in the vocational area of choice for the participant.    CHAPTER 4       GETTING AND KEEPING A JOB:       PLACEMENT AND POST-PLACEMENT SERVICES         The ultimate goal of most employment and training programs is for participants to secure and retain positions consistent with their training which provide wages that enable them to be self-sufficient.  This goal applies to homeless participants as well.  This chapter identifies those aspects of job search assistance, job development, placement, and post-placement services that require special consideration in assisting homeless people to secure lasting employment.      A. JOB SEARCH, DEVELOPMENT, AND PLACEMENT SERVICES      1. Background and Challenges      To be successful, job search, development, and placement activities (henceforth referred to as placement assistance or services) must focus on both the participant and conditions within the labor market.  From the participant's perspective, these activities involve providing encouragement, direction, and coaching to mobilize the active involvement of the participant in securing a job.  In terms of the labor market, placement assistance involves understanding the availability of job opportunities appropriate to each participant, as well as developing and maintaining relationships with employers.       Some of the challenges in assisting homeless individuals with placement activities include the following:      Some homeless persons are difficult candidates to present to employers.   Because homelessness and its causative factors can be so disruptive to maintenance of a ""normal life,"" some homeless people have what one JTHDP staffer described as ""strange work histories.""  Their resumes may have large gaps, they may have few or no references, and their physical appearance may pose a serious barrier to securing employment.  For example, a homeless individual may not have received dental care for many years, resulting in loss of teeth and decay.  Another barrier to employment some homeless individuals face is a criminal history, which limits the types of jobs for which they can be considered.       Some homeless participants may be constrained by the hours they are available for work.   Some homeless participants involved in residential programs (e.g., halfway houses for ex-offenders or substance abusers) may have requirements, such as a curfew or chores, that limit the hours available for employment.  Other participants may continue in training while they are working, thereby limiting which hours they can devote to either training or work.       Many homeless participants will express an urgency in securing employment.   Having received minimal income while in training, homeless participants are typically ready to enter the work force and bring home a pay check once training is completed.  Without appropriate job opportunities (e.g., those for which the participant was trained) readily available, the homeless participant is likely to pursue  any  available employment.          Transportation can be a serious barrier to employment.   Many homeless individuals do not own a car and may not have sufficient resources to ride public transportation.  In addition, public transportation may limit employment options (e.g., buses may not serve some areas where there are high paying jobs).       Homeless participants may not have an address or phone number at which employers can contact them.   JTHDP sites took creative steps to solve this problem, using strategies ranging from changing the way agency staff answered the phone to obtaining voice mail or post office boxes for their participants.          The Seattle program pioneered a voice mail option for its homeless participants through voice mailboxes donated by a business supporter.  The program had designated voice mailboxes for participants to use in their job and housing searches.  This resource enhanced the effectiveness of participants' job and housing searches by improving their ability to receive messages from potential employers and landlords.  Several other JTHDP sites adopted this approach.       Finally, there is the issue of the quality of the placement.  There were two schools of thought among the JTHDP sites.  Some sites felt that any job was better than no job: participants needed to develop work habits, build a resume, and earn enough income to begin to stabilize their lives; higher-quality jobs (with health insurance, advancement potential, and in-service training opportunities) could come later.  Other sites emphasized extended pre-employment services to attain job placements with health insurance and career paths, rather than placing participants in jobs that offered little more than they were able to receive through welfare and food stamps.        2. Strategies      JTHDP experience suggests that most homeless individuals participating in an employment and training program can find a job in a relatively short period.  In some sites, for example, the placement rates were more than 60 percent of those served.  What homeless individuals need, in particular, is to be shown effective techniques for finding job openings and be provided with other types of assistance (e.g., transportation vouchers, work clothing) that help in securing the job.  Some homeless individuals -- those facing more serious barriers to employment -- may need more specialized job development and placement assistance.         a.  Job Placement Strategy #1:  Gather Labor Market Information      There are a number of sources available that can provide information on what jobs are available, including minimum educational and competency requirements, hours, location, wages, and benefits.  These sources are the same sources used for your other participants, including the Employment Service, city/county/state government listings, job fairs, job hot lines, and private employment agencies which compile job openings in specific industries.  Of course, the newspaper and Yellow Pages still provide a laundry list of opportunities and possible employers to contact for job openings.  Your efforts should focus on those opportunities most appropriate for your participants.          The Seattle program (HIPP) developed a broad array of employment opportunities for their homeless participants which resulted in a 54 percent placement rate.  These resources included: (1) the Job Net System (the ES's computerized statewide job bank), (2) job requests from employers (HIPP received hundreds of requests from local employers because of their reputation as a reliable referral source), (3) YWCA Master Employer Contact List (from their relationship with the YWCA, HIPP participants had access to this list which covered a wide variety of employers), (4) Employer Panels (four times a year, a panel of six to seven employers were asked to talk with HIPP participants about ""What Employers Really Want,""  (5) YWCA Employer Advisory Group (the group consisted of employers, community volunteers and service providers who met regularly to assist in developing employment opportunities), and (6) the Return to Work Strategy (the PIC, in partnership with the Seattle Conservation Corps, received an award from HUD to fund a job development position and support services for homeless participants entering unsubsidized employment).         b.  Job Placement Strategy #2:  Identify How Your Homeless Participants Fit Into Your Existing Job Placement Strategy         Because of the special challenges your homeless participants present, your job development strategy may differ for your homeless participants.  One of the decisions your agency will need to make is whether your job placement approach for homeless participants is participant-directed or directed by the job developer.  It is likely that you will want to use a combination of the two approaches, depending upon the barriers to employment and the tightness of the job market faced by the participant.  JTHDP grantees adopted a variety of different approaches to placement activities.  Overall, JTHDP grantees found that many of their homeless participants, if provided with support and training in effective job search techniques, could search and find jobs for themselves.        Jobs for Homeless People (JHP), in Washington, D.C., implemented two processes to assist participants in securing employment.  The first was ""JHP job development"" in which JHP staff developed working relationships with particular employers and referred participants with appropriate skills and interests to fill job openings as they occurred.  JHP case managers targeted key industries which matched up well with the employment characteristics of JHP participants.  The second placement process was ""participant job development"" in which the participant directed his or her own job search with JHP training and technical back up.  Resources were put at the participants' disposal (voice mail, telephone, resume writing software, job listings, yellow pages, industry catalogues, etc.), and they used those resources -- with the help of case managers -- to discover and develop job opportunities.         c.  Job Placement Strategy #3:  Use a Variety of Strategies to Involve Participants in Their Own Search for a Job      Some important lessons JTHDP sites learned about ensuring participants' effective job search included the following:           Provide a job search workshop.   Probably the most important strategy is to provide participants with knowledge about how to effectively search for a job on their own.  The workshop should include the basics of uncovering and following-up on job leads, developing a resume, interview techniques, and dealing with the stresses inherent in job search.  The length of such workshops varied among JTHDP sites, with most lasting between three and 10 days.   Make sure that the job search workshop includes role playing and initial contacts with employers to help individuals get over the fear of making ""cold calls"" and to practice their techniques for approaching employers.  Some materials presented as part of one such workshop are included as Appendix B.            Friends of the Homeless (FOH) in Columbus, Ohio, developed a two-week orientation program for participants who chose direct job placement services.  The program included orientation, literacy assessment, and classroom training on self-esteem, decision-making, and conflict resolution in the first week.  In the second week, classes in job readiness (e.g., resume-writing, how to contact employers) and life skills were taught.  Following the classes, participants began self-directed job search with the aid of FOH's job developer.       Emphasize the ""hidden"" job market.   JTHDP sites found that, especially in working with individuals who faced serious barriers to employment, it was essential to tap into the ""hidden job market.""  This means looking beyond jobs advertised in newspapers and listed with private and public employment agencies.  For example, one JTHDP site recorded a 90 percent placement rate by having each participant contact firms (A through Z listed in the Yellow Pages) that employed workers in the specific field in which the individual was interested (e.g., plumbing).        Emphasize the need to contact those who have the authority to hire.   In searching for a job within the ""hidden"" job market, it is important for individuals to make direct contact with those within the firm who know about job openings and have the authority to hire.  This is typically not an individual within the firm's personnel department, but rather a manager within an operating department/division of the firm.       Provide a structure for those involved in self-directed job search.   Searching for a job should be considered by participants as a full-time job.  JTHDP sites found that it was important to provide a structure for those involved in self-directed job search.  Many JTHDP sites used job clubs which met regularly as an opportunity for participants to share job leads, practice their interviewing skills, and focus their job placement efforts.         The Jackson Employment Center (in Tucson, AZ) which focussed on self-directed job search for their program participants, required that individuals attend a one-week job search seminar.  After completing the seminar, participants joined a job search club that required them to search for a job Monday through Friday from 8:30 to 4:30.  As a group, individuals came to a phone bank each morning and called employers (using the Yellow Pages) until they obtained three quality leads.  They would then use the remaining time in the day to follow up on each of the leads.           Monitor participants' progress in their job search activities.   The employment and training agency should monitor the individual's job search progress on a daily basis to make sure the individual uses the most effective approaches.  For example, for those who are ineffective in turning up job leads, it may be useful to monitor calls made to employers to see if the individual is contacting individuals with the authority to hire and effectively presenting their experience and skills.  In monitoring, the agency needs to provide emotional support and encouragement for participants because job search can be a frustrating process (involving frequent rejections).            d.  Job Placement Strategy #4:  Establish and Maintain Relationships with Employers      The key to successful job development is to establish relationships with a broad range of employers.  These relationships are particularly important when working with homeless participants because of their often spotty work histories and other barriers to employment.  One key question in working with homeless participants is whether job developers should appeal to employers' sense of corporate social responsibility by marketing their participants as ""recently homeless"" or whether they should conceal their participants' homeless status.       JTHDP programs differed in their handling of this issue.  Those JTHDP sites who disclosed the homeless status of their participants found they needed to educate employers about the myths and realities of the homeless and build strong relationships with employers.  Peer-to-peer marketing was particularly effective:  an employer who had successfully hired and retained homeless job seekers was the best spokesperson to sell the program to other employers.  Other sites had better luck keeping employers from knowing about their applicants' homelessness.  Some JTHDP sites made the decision on an employer-by-employer basis.  Each employment and training agency will need to gauge the level of community support for homeless issues and then adjust their policy choice based on their own local program experience.     The first step job developers will need to take is to develop a listing of those employers likely to need employees with the types of skills your participants typically acquire.  These employers should represent the broad range of occupations your participants hope to enter, as well as cover the geographic area from which your participants are drawn.  Particular emphasis should be placed on developing relationships with employers who are close to public transportation.  In addition, relationships are needed with a range of employers providing part-time and full-time opportunities, as well as shift work, and temporary and permanent opportunities.  Don't forget the homeless-serving agencies you have developed contacts with -- their board members and staff are likely to be familiar with employers willing to employ homeless individuals.       Finally, one of the best sources for job leads for your homeless and other participants are the organizations providing the training.  They often initiate the job development process weeks prior to the end of training, enabling the participant to move directly from training into employment.  Often these instructors have come from the private sector and maintained contacts with a range of employers.  Employers are more likely to hire those who have been trained and recommended by an instructor with whom they are familiar.     As an employment and training agency, you have several advantages you can use to promote your participants to employers:             There is no cost for your job placement services (unlike some employment agencies).      Your agency screens all individuals  prior  to referral to the employer.      Job applicants have been trained and have access to the support services necessary for them to retain employment.  If you offer follow-up support services, let the employer know of these services as well.        You have individuals who are ready to be placed  immediately .      If someone is placed and does not work out, you have other qualified trainees who you can refer.     To maintain relationships with employers, it is important to understand the requirements of employers for each specific position.  Your agency should only send candidates who meet the employment criteria and have addressed the issues that could interfere with a successful employment experience. You will also need to periodically contact employers to see how the placement is working out.  This will enable you to maintain the employer as a referral source (because they know you stand behind your placements) and also gives you the opportunity to inquire about new job openings.           e.  Job Placement Strategy #5: Job Developers Need to Work Closely With Case Managers      Job developers need to work closely with the case manager.  In addition, if possible, the job developer may want to contact other individuals who would be able to provide useful background information about the participant (e.g., staff at the participant's shelter facility or a case manager at the agency that referred the individual).  The job developer needs to understand not only the individual's training and job-related skills, but other issues related to the individual's motivation levels and behavioral issues.  For example, there may be behavior problems or personal issues (such as past substance abuse problems or inability to get along with others) that the participant may not readily share with the job developer, but which the individual was willing to share with the case manager once they had established rapport.  Simple up-front communication with the professionals who know the participant the best can go a long way toward assuring successful placement and retention.           f.  Job Placement Strategy #6: Begin Job Development Before Training Is Completed        Beginning job development and placement activities in the weeks leading up to the end of training can help ensure that participants have a job waiting for them when they complete training.  The job developer should meet with the participant at least several weeks before training is completed to discuss job search strategies.  Homeless individuals, in particular, are likely to want to find a job as quickly as possible after training is completed.  If a job is not waiting for them, they may settle for a position that does not use the job-related skills they developed or provide a wage that is adequate to promote long-term self-sufficiency.  Furthermore, the less time that elapses between the end of training and the start of employment, the less likely they will be to fall back into the problems that may have contributed to their homelessness.        The Jobs for Homeless Consortium (JFHC) in Berkeley, California, developed an automated Skills Bank that enabled them to match appropriate participant resumes to job vacancies stored in their automated Job Openings Bank (e.g., job opening information received from local employment service agencies, employers whom JFHC developed contacts, public job posting services, newspaper listings, and cold calls to employers).  The appropriate resumes could be quickly faxed or mailed to employers.  Automating and integrating these functions led to rapid response to job openings.  JFHC or the participant would make follow-up calls to employers.  JFHC would also conduct additional mass mailings and cold calls to employers in the area to inform them of JFHC's free services and to request job vacancy mailings.        g.  Job Placement Strategy #7:  Be Sure That All Necessary Support Services Are in Place to Assist Your Homeless Participants to Secure Employment        Be sure the participant is ready to begin and continue working; any barriers to regular work attendance should be taken care of prior to placement.  Some of the necessary support services include transportation vouchers, work clothes and equipment, and child care.  In addition, participants may need assistance improving their personal appearance and hygiene.  Without money for basic needs like shelter and food, many homeless people have disregarded personal appearance, such as teeth, eye glasses, and clothing.  No matter how well trained, without an appropriate personal appearance, your participant will be unlikely to secure a job.  Remember, there are many sources in your community that are able to provide these services at no or reduced cost to your agency.       Specific subpopulations, including ex-offenders, the chronically mentally ill, and women fleeing domestic violence, may need additional assistance in securing and retaining employment.  For example, in working with participants with a criminal history, your job development strategy should include knowing which of your participants have such a history and identifying employers who are more sympathetic, or at least less concerned with a criminal history.  Agencies in your community (perhaps the agencies referring homeless persons to your program) are experienced in working with issues surrounding these subpopulations -- use their expertise to develop targeted strategies.        B. POST-PLACEMENT SERVICES       1. Background and Challenges      Particularly for homeless people, initial job placement may only be a step toward eventual self-sufficiency.  The purpose of post-placement services is to ensure a smooth transition from training to employment and to provide needed supports to assure job retention.  Post-placement follow-up can be conducted with the participant, the employer, or both.  They can consist of telephone contact or in-person contact in your office, at the place of employment, or at the participant's residence.       These services are particularly important for homeless participants because sometimes the behaviors and circumstances that contributed to the participant's homelessness can recur once that participant moves out of the support system the program and case management relationship provide.  For example, of those placed in jobs, 60 percent of JTHDP participants receiving post-placement follow-up services were employed 13 weeks after placement as compared to 38 percent for those not receiving post-placement services.      Some special considerations when providing post-placement services to homeless participants include:        Lack of a permanent address.   Follow-up contact with some homeless participants can be more difficult because of their lack of a permanent address.  The address a participant gave at the time of placement may not be his or her address one month after placement; homeless individuals are continually trying to upgrade their housing situation.  You may need to contact them at their place of employment (which may have its own set of complications); although these contacts as well because homeless individuals often upgrade or change their employment.           Reluctance to seek or accept support.   Many homeless individuals, once employed want to put their period of homelessness behind them.  They may be unwilling to contact your agency for help and may even be reluctant to accept calls from your agency and/or additional help you may feel they need.           Behavior problems may emerge once the participant becomes employed.  Once the individual becomes employed and/or moves into unsubsidized housing, the problems that contributed to homelessness may re-emerge.  Some JTHDP sites found that the point at which the individual began to receive a pay check was a point when some participants let down their guard and reverted to behavior that led to homelessness (e.g., started to drink again).  Also, the stress of working, development of new relationships on the job, and poor communication skills may lead to problems and misunderstandings in the workplace.            2. Strategies         a.  Post-placement Strategy #1:  Offer a Broad Array of Post-placement Services to Meet the Diverse Needs of Your Placed Participants      Post-placement services should be tailored to the individual's needs and can include the following:           visits to participant's place of residence or in your office to provide job support, structure, and referrals for needed material services;       ongoing peer support groups for placed participants to identify problems they are experiencing that could affect their employment, and to develop solutions and identify resources to help resolve the problems;    re-placement services;        continuing life skills classes (e.g., sessions on adjustment to the workplace, handling work-related stress, and budgeting);       material assistance, such as transportation assistance, stipends to assist participants until they receive their first pay check, and replacement tools;     housing stabilization services;      contact with employers to discuss participants' work performance, attitude, attendance, and punctuality; and       program graduates as mentors for current participants in your training program.              In addition to providing basic post-placement support -- job support, housing stabilization, placement follow-up, and material support -- Jobs for Homeless Consortium further ensured job retention by providing an ""employment pack.""  The pack included transportation and food vouchers until the first pay check; on a case-by-case basis it also paid for job-related clothing, shoes, tools, union dues, and grooming.  Placed participants were eligible for housing subsidies that further ensured employment and housing stabilization.     You may not be able to provide a full range of post-placement support services to each placed participant.  Take the time to understand each participant's situation, including the services received in the past.  This may involve talking with the participant's employment and training case manager (if different from the post-placement case manager), the referring agency case manager, and possibly the employer.  Identify needed services, and then prioritize those most needed to assure employment retention.  JTHDP sites reported higher than average retention rates (the retention rate for all placed participants was 59 percent) for those participants receiving post-placement services. (15)   Agencies in your community will be able to provide a range of post-placement services to round out th   e ones your agency can provide.  The linkages you already have in place will help to expedite this process.         b.  Post-placement Strategy #2: Provide Emotional Support as Well as Material Support      ""Self-efficacy -- confidence in one's capability to perform specific, challenging behaviors -- is a valuable cognitive contributor to successful performance of such behaviors."" (16)   In other words, believing that you can accomplish what you set out to do will help you to do so.  The cited study found self-efficacy to be an important factor in successful job search among disadvantaged individuals.  Some homeless participants have no family supports, and the peer supports they do have are sometimes not good influences on maintaining employment.  The relationships they have made through their involvement with your agency may be a critical (and perhaps their only) source of support in their search for employment.     These relationships can be particularly important at the start of a new job, which is stressful for everyone and can be exacerbated for the homeless (who may have had unsuccessful experiences in the past or who are unaccustomed to the structure the job requires).  A case manager/job counselor can help instill a sense of confidence by providing ongoing support, being aware of the job expectations for the participant, assisting with problem solving, and assessing additional support needs.     Support groups can also be a source of emotional support, easing the transition into the work force by allowing individuals with similar strengths and deficiencies to share their problems and solutions with one another.  Group dynamics can play a significant role in assisting participants to deal effectively with a variety of personal and external barriers to employment.  JTHDP sites found that attendance improved when groups were held either before or after usual work hours and if food was provided.  (Many businesses are willing to donate food on a regular basis to a good cause.)  If your agency is unable to provide this type of support, seek it out through homeless-serving or other agencies.  It likely exists in your community.          The Kentucky Domestic Violence Association (KDVA) promoted a very thorough approach to post-placement services.  Once a participant began her employment, staff maintained contact in an effort to provide continuous support and encouragement and troubleshoot if necessary.  While participants were encouraged to work out difficulties with employers on their own, staff were available to intervene.  Staff served as mediators between employees and employers and provided additional training to participants who were having difficulty learning jobs.  Staff also provided ongoing case management services such as assisting with changes in child care, helping with legal problems, intervening with landlords, and locating rental assistance.  Since many of their participants were placed in entry-level jobs due to multiple employment barriers, KDVA continued to encourage participants to improve their job situations through promotions, job changes, or traditional training and education.  Finally, support groups, as well as individual counseling, were offered on an ongoing basis to all women who participated in the employment program.       c.  Post-placement Strategy #3: Be Creative and Persistent in Your Approach to Contact the Placed Participant      Some of your homeless participants may be difficult to contact or be reticent to respond to your contacts and available post-placement services.  You may need to access participants through their employers (discretely) or in the evening at their residences.  The contact should be frequent during the initial four weeks after placement and then can likely taper off.        The Jackson Employment Center, in Tucson, Arizona, began its post-placement support immediately upon placement.  Often the employment specialist and/or case manager visited participants in the evenings at their residences.  Regular visits were made twice a week, and participants who were experiencing difficulty may have been seen three or four times a week.  The number of visits tapered off over time, but for some participants, visits continued for a year or longer.  This approach permitted early intervention when participants were most likely to lose employment because of poor adjustment to the work environment or a re-emerging behavioral or health problem.        d.  Post-placement Strategy #4: Encourage Placed Participants to Pursue Additional Skills Training      As discussed earlier, many homeless individuals are anxious to secure employment because of their lack of financial support and stable housing.  As a result, they may not obtain needed skills training to secure a job which provides a living wage.  Through on-going post-placement contact, you may be able to encourage the placed participant to enroll in skills training concurrent with employment.  It is important to become aware of skills training needed to advance in the participant's current job or in the employment area identified through the objective assessment process, and of places to access the training which meet the participant's time constraints.   As stated earlier, JTHDP participants receiving post-placement training had among the highest retention rates.        e.  Post-placement Strategy #5: Be Prepared for Some of Your Homeless Participants to Need Placement Services Again -- Build This into Your Retention Strategy      Many homeless participants are anxious to enter employment, and their initial job placement may not be one in which they stay for long.  Some participants, once they secure employment and have a pay check coming in, may be willing to pursue more lasting employment or employment that builds more on the training they received.  Others may have difficulty in adjusting to their work environment and as a result may not retain their job.  With some additional support and problem solving, these individuals should be ready to pursue another placement.  The case manager/job counselor should be prepared to provide job placement services similar to those provided for the initial placement.   CHAPTER 5       THE FINAL INGREDIENTS:      HOUSING AND OTHER SUPPORT SERVICES         This chapter describes the types of housing assistance and other support services homeless persons are likely to need during their participation in your employment and training program.  Housing assistance is set forth in a separate section in this chapter because of its importance as a support service for homeless persons.  JTHDP experience suggests that the provision of a continuum of housing assistance is a critical element if homeless individuals are to be served effectively.  With the exception of those receiving emergency housing assistance, retention rates were higher than average (59 percent) for individuals receiving all other housing services.  Among those receiving permanent housing placements, the 13 week retention rate was 80 percent.  The retention rates for those receiving other types of housing assistance through JTHDP were also much higher than the average: 76 percent for those receiving security deposits/rental assistance, 75 percent for those receiving assistance with furnishings/moving, 67 percent for those receiving housing assistance counseling, and 66 percent for those receiving transitional housing placements.     In addition to housing assistance, this chapter discusses the range of support services likely to be needed by homeless persons participating in employment and training programs.  The underlying theme throughout this chapter is that employment and training programs can provide the support services needed to assist homeless individuals in securing and retaining employment through linkages with public and private housing and other support service providers.     A. HOUSING SERVICES      1. Background and Challenges      Any program planning to provide education and training services to homeless individuals needs to make a range of housing assistance services and resources available either directly or through referrals. (17)   Your program is unlikely to achieve success in training and placing homeless individuals in jobs unless they have a place to live.  For example, homeless individuals need a place where they can safely leave their possessions and where they can shower and dress for work or training.   While the need to incorporate housing strategies into the overall individualized service strategy may seem obvious, it is not necessarily one of the services with which employment and training programs are familiar.     Before we begin describing the challenges and strategies in providing housing assistance, it is important to understand the range of housing options and types of housing assistance.  The continuum of housing alternatives includes four major types:       Emergency shelters  typically provide a place to sleep. Shelters may be open 24 hours a day, or they may be what is called a ""turnout"" shelter, where residents arrive at a specified time (e.g., 7:00 p.m.) and must leave the next morning by a specified time (e.g., 7:00 a.m).  Generally, admission to shelters is open, but stays are either on a first come/first served basis or can be limited to a maximum number of days.  While these shelters primarily focus their efforts on providing temporary shelter, they may also provide some referral services (e.g., for clothing, health care, or transportation services) and may provide case management.       Transitional housing  provides housing for a time-limited period (generally ranging from six to 18 months) and is intended to serve as a bridge from emergency shelters to permanent housing.  Eligibility may be based on demonstrated need, or limited to specific target populations such as ex-offenders or individuals in recovery.  Although not always present, transitional housing may have case managers to assist with information and referral and case planning.  These facilities may also have requirements for individuals to work and save a portion of their income (in preparation for moving into permanent housing).         Subsidized permanent housing  provides publicly-funded housing assistance through programs, such as the Section 8 Existing Housing Program (under which qualified participants receive certificates to pay for a portion of their rent), the Single Room Occupancy (SRO) program, and locally-administered public housing programs.  These programs are either directly administered by a local housing authority or a local housing authority in conjunction with community-based organizations.  As long as eligibility requirements are met, there is no time limit on the length of stay in these subsidized units.       Unsubsidized permanent housing  includes the rental or purchase of housing units on the open market.  Individuals may remain in unsubsidized permanent housing as long as they meet the requirements of the rental or purchase agreement.     You may face a number of challenges directly providing or arranging for housing assistance for homeless participants.        Housing assistance can be costly, particularly when it involves partial or full payment of rental assistance over a prolonged period.   In some urban areas, for example, the cost of a studio or one-bedroom apartment can be $350 or more a month (which over a one-year training period would add up to over $4,000).        Employment and training agencies often are not knowledgeable or experienced in providing or arranging for housing assistance.   The range of available housing assistance and alternatives within a community is often complicated. There are a number of federally-subsidized housing programs, as well as other transitional and emergency housing programs funded by private and public sources.  Each program has different eligibility requirements and application procedures.  Some housing programs accept applications one day of the year; others may only accept applications for families of four or more.  An understanding -- either through in-house expertise or linkages with housing assistance providers -- of the specific housing opportunities available in your community is needed to effectively meet the housing needs of your homeless participants.             In many localities, the demand for housing (e.g., vacancies in emergency, transitional, and subsidized permanent housing units) far exceeds the supply.   For example, there may be few openings in transitional housing facilities for low-income or homeless individuals, except for those with special needs (e.g., ex-offenders, substance abusers in recovery, battered women, or mentally-ill individuals).  Waiting lists for subsidized housing, such as public housing or Section 8 Existing Housing, might be very long (a year or longer) and may not be a viable option for certain types of individuals, such as single males.         2. Strategies      JTHDP experience underscored the importance of understanding and effectively addressing each homeless individual's housing situation before he or she enters education, training, and employment.  Demonstration sites found that given the cost of providing housing assistance and the continuum of housing options to meet the varying needs of their participants, they needed to establish linkages with a variety of housing assistance providers in their locality.  What follows are more specific strategies for assisting your homeless participants to obtain needed housing assistance.         a.  Housing Strategy #1: Understand Your Local Housing Environment and the Needs of Your Participants; Develop a Plan Consistent with Both         Understanding your local housing environment should involve a careful assessment of: (1) the range of housing needs of your homeless participants and (2) the availability of housing and housing services through other service providers.  You need to first understand the range of housing needs and problems faced by homeless participants, which are likely to vary considerably by individual.  For example, some homeless individuals with past problems of substance abuse or mental illness may need a supportive housing situation, which provides regular case management and monitoring of their situation.  Other homeless individuals may need references and sufficient financial resources so they can rent an unsubsidized housing unit.  Still others may need referrals (and advocacy) so they can obtain transitional housing or Section 8 certificates or gain entry into public housing units.      Also of importance in working with homeless individuals is understanding the availability of housing and housing services, including:            the local housing market (e.g., the cost, availability, and location of unsubsidized rental units);       the range of emergency and transitional housing facilities within the community, including types of facilities, eligibility requirements, methods for referral, and availability of slots;      the types of subsidized rental assistance and units within the community (e.g., public housing, Section 8 Existing Housing, SRO units), including types of agencies providing assistance, eligibility requirements, methods of referral, and waiting lists/availability of slots; and        the range of other housing assistance available in the community, including rental assistance (e.g., first/last month's rent, security deposit), furniture, utility assistance, and roommate services.        While conducting an assessment of participants' needs and the availability of housing resources, employment and training programs should be careful not ""to re-invent the wheel.""  Much of the information needed is already available from other public and private sector agencies.  Local agencies that may be able to furnish you with helpful information include:  (1) the local housing authority; (2) homeless-serving agencies such as the Salvation Army, St. Vincent de Paul, Traveler's Aid, emergency/ transitional facilities, and (if it exists) a coalition on homelessness; (3) local public assistance agencies (e.g., state or local departments of human services or social services); and (4) nonprofit social service agencies, such as Goodwill Industries and Community Action Committees.      Once this information has been collected and reviewed, you will need a plan for providing or (more likely) arranging for homeless participants to receive the types of housing services/assistance they need to be successful in training or employment.  The housing assistance plan should cover the range of assistance services that will be provided to homeless individuals both directly through your program and through other local service providers, with particular emphasis on provision of:  (1) emergency shelter, (2) transitional housing, (3) subsidized housing and rental subsidies, (4) counseling on housing alternatives, and (5) security deposits.         b.  Housing Strategy #2:  Develop Coordination Agreement with Agencies in Your Community That Provide the Range of Housing Services Your Participants May Need      To access the housing assistance resources that your participants are likely to need, your program should establish either formal or informal agreements for the provision of services.  JTHDP experience suggests that it is probably best to establish formal, written agreements.  Formal agreements clearly set forth each agency's role and responsibilities, reducing confusion and structuring accountability.       In these agreements, you should clearly set forth the types of housing services to be provided, the availability of slots or services, methods for referral, and the duration of the agreement.  From your perspective, it is important to pin down the details of the arrangement, particularly relating to the number of participants who will be able to access specific types of assistance (e.g., ""during the fiscal year, at least 15 participants will be eligible to receive security deposits of up to $500, subject to the following conditions...."").       It is also important to clarify whether referrals will be subject to waiting lists and how long these waiting lists will be.  To the extent possible, it is best to negotiate that the linked service provider set aside a number of slots (in a transitional facility, for example) that will be reserved and immediately available.  An example of the linkages for housing assistance developed by one of the employment and training agencies participating in JTHDP is presented in Appendix C.          The City of Waterbury's JTHDP program staff worked with private landlords to secure priority access for their clients to low cost housing.  In return, program case managers agreed to inform landlords of any changes in program participants' status.  Landlords were willing to guarantee this access because of the increased stability clients had from participating in the program and the involvement of a case manager.            The director of Louisville's Project WORTH used the memorandum of understanding (MOU) between DOL and HUD as leverage to gain cooperation from the housing authority, enabling WORTH to access half of the housing authority's Section 8 certificates for homeless families.  One reason the housing authority honored the MOU is that WORTH worked hard to make the relationship work well:  WORTH staff worked directly with landlords to get them to accept Section 8 tenants and prepared clients in transitional housing for the different and greater responsibilities of Section 8 housing.     One way of developing the linkages you need to serve your homeless participants is to join your local coalition on homelessness, if one exists in your community.  Effective coalitions can introduce you to local providers of shelter and transitional housing, and provide the forum for negotiating interagency agreements with those providers.  Coalitions can provide introductions to landlords who can help -- perhaps by notifying your program when low-rent units become vacant or by giving your participants a break on security deposits and/or rent based on the fact that they have a case manager and a program behind them.    Coalitions are also often the starting point for efforts to develop new transitional housing -- something you will want to know about, even if your agency is not in a position to lead the way.  Your agency, by participating in the coalition, can heighten coalition members' awareness of employment and training options for their clients and clearly position your agency as an active member of the community working toward increased self-sufficiency for the disadvantaged.        c.  Housing Strategy #3: Carefully Assess the Housing Needs of Each Homeless Participant During Assessment and Tailor a Plan that Effectively Addresses His/Her Specific Needs      As part of the assessment process, it is important to carefully consider the housing situation and needs of homeless individuals.  JTHDP sites found that success in job training and job placement/retention was associated with stabilizing the housing condition of homeless participants (i.e., at a minimum, getting individuals off the street and into emergency shelters and preferably transitional facilities). (18)         d.  Housing Strategy #4:  Make Referrals Based on Housing Needs and Follow Up on Referrals             Once housing goals and resources have been identified, your employment and training program should make appropriate referrals to the collaborating agencies providing the housing assistance.  As with any support service, you need to make sure that participants follow up on the referral and that they obtain the requested services from the linked organization.  It also may be the case that while the individual follows up on the referral, the agency receiving the referral may not be willing to provide the service  (perhaps because of past problems with the individual) or may not have available space.  Hence, make sure to follow up on the referral with both the participant and the housing service providers to whom the participant is referred.       It is also important to follow up with the participant and the linked service provider periodically after the individual begins to receive the service.  Problems may arise (e.g., failure of the individual to get along with others in the housing facility, failure to make rent payments on a timely basis, or disruptive behavior) which need troubleshooting before they become bigger problems.          e.  Housing Strategy #5:  Consider Using Housing Upgrades to Reward Progress      You (or the housing assistance providers you work with) might want to consider using housing upgrades to reward participants for their progress toward self-sufficiency goals.  Some JTHDP demonstration sites found that they could encourage participants to work harder toward achieving their training and employment goals by using housing upgrades as a reward for reaching predetermined benchmarks.  The extent to which programs use housing as a reward depends, at least in part, on the range of housing over which they have control; obviously if no Section 8 vouchers are available, then Section 8 cannot be held out as an incentive to reward positive behavior.  For many programs though, especially if they have formal arrangements with housing-based service providers, tying housing to achievement is a practical approach.              Jackson Employment Center (JEC) used a ""carrot and stick"" philosophy.  Participants who progressed through the program were maintained within the shelter facilities and upgraded; those who failed to perform received counseling and warnings, then their housing vouchers were shifted from a weekly to a daily basis, and eventually they lost their access to shelter.  JEC structured its program with shelter as an inducement to prompt behavioral change and active program participation and gave priority for choice housing units to those who abided by JEC rules.     B. OTHER SUPPORT SERVICES      1. Background and Challenges      Support services, while not your agency's primary focus, are often crucial to success for homeless participants.  Transportation, child care, health care, and other needs can prevent a homeless participant from completing training or maintaining a good job placement.  JTHDP sites provided support services in a variety of ways, both directly and through referral.  Transportation, for example, was the most commonly provided support service throughout the JTHDP (76 percent of participants received transportation assistance).  Some sites operated vans and buses while others obtained public transportation passes or tokens for their participants.  Other support services commonly provided, either directly or through referral, included food/meals, self-esteem/motivation/attitude adjustment training, personal needs, and clothing/work equipment.       Some considerations related to providing support services to homeless participants follow.           For homeless participants, support service needs are often wider in scope and more pressing.   For example, rather than just needing some presentable work clothing, they may need virtually an entire wardrobe.   The intensity of need tends to vary depending upon how long an individual has been homeless, as well as how effectively he or she has been stabilized prior to enrolling in the job training program.     One of the challenges employment and training agencies must face in serving homeless people is to ensure that the homeless participant has some means of support during the training period.   Without some financial support (e.g., public assistance or a part-time job), it is difficult to complete occupational skills training.     The need for substance abuse and mental health treatment services is likely to be more prevalent among the homeless population.   Accessing these services in a timely manner, though, is often difficult.           2. Strategies        a.  Support Service Strategy #1:  Develop Coordination Agreements With Agencies in Your Community to Provide the Range of Needed Support Services      To ensure that support service needs do not interfere with successful completion of employment and training activities, your program should address these needs, either directly or through referrals to community agencies.  For those service needs your agency is unable to provide directly, develop interagency coordination and referral agreements with the appropriate community agencies.  Many case managers develop interpersonal relationships with other service providers, both within and beyond their own agencies, that help them access services for their clients.  More effective is a system of interagency agreements, so that the arrangements have support at the policymaker level and are not solely dependent on staff relationships.  (See Housing Strategy #2 above.)         The Southeast Tennessee Private Industry Council developed a coordination arrangement with the Chattanooga Community Kitchen, the area's only homeless day shelter and a site visited by 75 percent of the area's homeless persons on a regular basis.  The Community Kitchen became a leading agency in providing in-kind support to homeless individuals enrolled in the PIC's employment and training activities.  The Community Kitchen provided at no charge: three meals a day, seven days a week; a day shelter with shower and laundry facilities; a clothing program; a health clinic; benefits services (assistance in applying for food stamps, Social Security, veterans' benefits, etc.); and literacy and basic skills training.        b.  Support Service Strategy #2:  Assess Support Service Needs On An Ongoing Basis          An ongoing, client-centered assessment strategy, that begins at intake and continues throughout your involvement with the participant, can help assure successful outcomes by identifying new support service needs.  Use ongoing assessment to identify and access new support services as you learn more about the participants and as new needs arise. (19)         HELP (San Diego Private Industry Council's JTHDP program) case managers used information from the initial interview, intake and assessment forms, and information from the referral agency to identify reasons for homelessness (e.g., eviction, job loss/lack of training) and obstacles to employment (e.g., lack of transportation, substance abuse).  This information, once discussed with the participant, guided referral to an array of support services, which enabled clients to attend training and seek employment.  Case mangers periodically reviewed the list of needed support services to assess their continued relevance.  These discussions with the participant frequently led to the deletion of some service needs from the case plan and the identification and inclusion of other needs.           c.  Support Service Strategy #3:  Assist Participants in Accessing Support Services For Which They Are Eligible      Assisting participants to qualify for and enroll in whatever income support and health services programs are feasible and appropriate can make the difference between completing and not completing training.  This is a role for case managers, but they can only perform it well if they are trained and informed about the variety of federal, state, and local options. For example, many homeless participants are eligible for Medicaid, and many communities have special health clinics or other services specifically for the homeless.  Food stamps, AFDC for people with children, and (in many states) general assistance for the homeless and other poor who do not qualify for AFDC, are options for subsistence and income.  In addition to training your case managers on the variety of services available to the homeless, your agency might want to provide a brief reference manual with information on programs, social service organizations, contact names, and phone numbers.  Your agency could develop the manual or use one provided by the United Way or another organization serving the homeless.        Catholic Charities in Saint Paul, Minnesota served single adult participants and encouraged them to sign up for General Assistance as an interim source of income until they began earning wages.  As General Assistance recipients, they were also eligible for up to 30 days of county-paid shelter per quarter.            d.  Support Service Strategy #4:  Address Transportation Needs Either Directly or Through Referral      Plan to assist most participants with transportation, both during training and the initial period of employment.  Specific strategies will vary according to the quality of public transportation in your community, but do not ignore this very basic need.  Also, be realistic about the impact of transportation when identifying training, transitional housing, and employment options for participants; an overly long and difficult commute can sabotage the best training or employment placement.        e.  Support Service Strategy #5: Coordinate With Substance Abuse and Mental Health Treatment Programs        The need for substance abuse and mental health treatment is likely to be more prevalent among the homeless than among the general population.  A few JTHDP sites tried having their own substance abuse counselor in-house, but most sites found that they succeeded more readily if they referred applicants with substance abuse problems for treatment to agencies specializing in that service, and then waited to enroll people once they were solidly ""in recovery.""  For those individuals participating in outpatient treatment, many JTHDP sites linked participating in employment and training activities to continued involvement in outpatient treatment.     Many of the demonstration sites found that referrals for substance abuse and mental health treatment -- particularly residential treatment -- involved long waiting lists.  Several sites negotiated special arrangements for their applicants or participants.  One quid pro quo you can offer a treatment program that shortens the normal waiting time for your participants is to accept their participants on a priority basis once they have dealt with their substance abuse or mental health issues.        Project Uplift at the Greater Washington Boys and Girls Club, whose target population included a high percentage of drug-dependent individuals, developed a linkage with St. Vincent de Paul for both in- and out-patient drug treatment, in which Uplift referrals were placed at the top of the waiting list.  Depending on the severity of the problem, participants were enrolled concurrently or sequentially in drug treatment and in Project Uplift.     Project WORTH used its involvement in the metropolitan-wide coalition on homelessness to develop strong linkages with substance abuse and mental health providers.  If substance abuse or mental health showed up as an issue at intake or assessment, the participant was referred to a therapist who then advised Project WORTH when the participant was ready to enroll in training and employment services.          APPENDIX A:       OVERVIEW OF THE JOB TRAINING FOR       THE HOMELESS DEMONSTRATION PROGRAM               APPENDIX A:       OVERVIEW OF THE JOB TRAINING FOR       THE HOMELESS DEMONSTRATION PROGRAM        A. Authorizing Legislation and Guidelines      The Job Training for the Homeless Demonstration Program (JTHDP) was authorized under Section 731 of the Stewart B. McKinney Homeless Assistance Act of 1987.  Under this legislation, the Department of Labor (DOL) was authorized to plan, implement, and evaluate a job training demonstration program for homeless individuals.  The resulting JTHDP, administered by DOL's Employment and Training Administration (ETA), represented the first comprehensive federal program specifically designed to provide employment and training services (and a wide range of other supportive services) for homeless individuals and to assist them in securing employment.  Under the demonstration effort, the term ""homeless"" or ""homeless"" individual referred to one who:          Lacked a fixed, regular, and adequate nighttime residence; and     Had a primary nighttime residence that was:  (a)  a supervised publicly or privately operated shelter designed to provide temporary living accommodations (including welfare hotels, congregate shelters, halfway houses, and transitional housing for the mentally ill); (b) an institution that provides a temporary residence for individuals intended to be institutionalized; or (c) a public or private place not designed for, or ordinarily used as, a regular sleeping accommodation for human beings.        The demonstration effort was launched in September 1988 with a series of grants to 32 locally-operated demonstration sites across the nation.  JTHDP continued over slightly more than seven years (86 months) and several distinctive phases (discussed below), concluding in November 1995.     The overall purpose of the demonstration effort was to ""provide information and direction for the future of job training for homeless Americans.""  Two supporting goals of JTHDP were:      to gain information on how to provide effective employment and training services for homeless individuals; and      to learn how states, local public agencies, private nonprofit organizations, and private businesses can develop effective systems of coordination to address the causes of homelessness and meet the needs of the homeless. (20)      In initiating the demonstration effort, DOL/ETA was interested in testing innovative and replicable approaches to providing employment and training services for homeless individuals.  Demonstration sites were permitted to serve the full spectrum of the homeless population or emphasize assistance to subgroups within the general homeless population, such as mentally ill persons, chemically dependent individuals, families with children, single men, or single women.  In general, projects were given wide latitude in how to structure their service delivery, but were required to provide or arrange for the following services:           outreach and intake;      case management and counseling;      assessment and employability development planning;      alcohol and other substance abuse assessment and counseling, with referral as appropriate to outpatient and/or inpatient treatment;      other supportive services (e.g., child care, transportation, mental health assessment/counseling/referral to treatment, other health care services, motivational skills training, and life skills training);      job training services, including (a) remedial education and basic skills/literacy instruction, (b) job search assistance and job preparatory training, (c) job counseling, (d) vocational and occupational skills training, (e) work experience, and (f) on-the-job training;      job development and placement services;      post-placement follow-up and support services (e.g., additional job placement services, training after placement, self-help support groups, and mentoring); and      housing services (e.g., emergency housing assistance, assessment of housing needs, referrals to appropriate housing alternatives, and development of strategies to address gaps in the supply of housing for participants).          In implementing these activities, grantees were encouraged to collaborate with other federal, state, and local programs serving homeless individuals.  For example, a 1990 Memorandum of Understanding between the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and DOL stressed better coordination of jobs and housing for participants.  And in September 1994, at the beginning of the final round of grants issued under JTHDP, DOL/ETA issued new grant guidelines aimed at promoting the long-term viability of grantees' programs and encouraging referral of homeless individuals appropriate for training through local Job Training Partnership Act (JTPA) programs.     The McKinney Act mandated a strong emphasis on evaluation of JTHDP to support the development of ""knowledge for future policy decisions on job training for homeless individuals.""  The evaluation effort was conducted at two levels:  (a) individual project evaluations and (b) a national evaluation across all grantee projects.  The national evaluation was intended to address six key evaluation questions:           What are the characteristics of participants served by JTHDP projects?      What are the key program services?      What are the factors that affect program implementation?      What are the program linkages?      What are the key outcomes of JTHDP projects?      What are the most effective approaches to providing employment and training services to homeless individuals?        Individual projects, as a condition of participation in the demonstration, were required to make data available (on a quarterly basis) on a specific set of performance measures, as well as submit annual individual project evaluation reports.  To support cross-project comparisons, DOL/ETA provided grantees with technical assistance on all aspects of the evaluation and defined specific process and outcome measures on which each site was required to report (e.g., number of homeless individuals served, number of homeless individuals placed in jobs, number of homeless individuals placed in jobs who were working during the 13th week after placement, number of housing upgrades, and others).     B. Overview of Program Logic and Structure      From the outset, DOL realized that no two local projects would be alike.  However, in 1989 a generalized ""logic model"" addressing participant flow and services was developed to assist local project operators and those responsible for monitoring and evaluating project implementation and outcomes.  The key elements captured by this model are: (1) a ""traditional"" sequence of employment and training services -- outreach followed by intake/assessment, job training, job placement, and retention; (2) a wide range of supportive services, including housing, transportation, and child care; and (3) case management as the element that would assist the participant in securing employment, housing, and other needed services.     After some experience implementing the program, it became clear that a ""sequential"" service delivery model could not meet the needs of all participants seeking services.  Although some participants sought this broad range of services in sequence, many had the need and/or the skills to proceed directly from intake/assessment to job search and placement.  Others, such as those residing in halfway houses, already had a case manager assisting them to secure housing and support services and only needed JTHDP assistance primarily to secure employment and/or training services.  As a result, over time the service delivery models used by JTHDP sites evolved and became more individualized -- typically with increased reliance on the results of the intake/assessment process and the participants' expressed needs.      C.  JTHDP Implementation      JTHDP was implemented over four phases, each somewhat distinct, building upon the experiences of the previous phase.  Exhibit A-1 provides an overview of funding and levels of participation during each of JTHDP's four phases.  As shown in the exhibit, since its inception in September 1988, JTHDP served a total of 45,192 homeless persons.  Of those participating in the program, 77 percent (34,891 participants) received at least one of the following training services: remedial education and/or basic skills/literacy instruction, job search assistance/job preparation training, job counseling, work experience/transitional employment, on-the-job training (OJT), or vocational/occupational skills training.  The remaining 23 percent of participants did not receive training services, but did receive some other type of assistance through the JTHDP site, such as a support service (e.g., transportation, food/meals, clothing, work equipment, substance abuse counseling), housing services (e.g., referral to a transitional housing facility or housing counseling), and/or other information and referral services.     Of those participating in the program, 16,464 obtained jobs.  This represented 36 percent of those participating in the program and 47 percent of those receiving  training services.  Participants obtained jobs either through their own efforts or with the help of the JTHDP grantee (e.g., through job developers or placement services provided by their case managers).  Of the 16,464 participants obtaining jobs while participating in JTHDP, 50 percent (8,171 participants) were employed 13 weeks after initial job placement (with the same employer or another employer).  Finally, as shown in the exhibit, in addition to improving their employment situation, many participants (36 percent) were reported to have upgraded their housing situation.

In Phase 2, 20 of the Phase 2 sites were refunded (and the Tucson Indian Center was added in September 1991 (bringing the total number of JTHDP sites for Phase 2 to 21, and the total for JTHDP to 63).  During Phases 3 and 4, all Phase 2 sites were re-funded.  The percent of placed participants employed at 13 weeks is adjusted slightly because of missing data on placed participants for Phases 2 and Phase 5.

However, for most individuals                  who have already left the workforce, the single largest asset                  they have saved is the equity value of their home. For some individuals,                  the income received from Social Security and a pension is inadequate                  to meet their special needs. Conventional forms of converting                  to income home equity involve repayable loans secured as second                  mortgages or liens against ownership. Since 1989, the federal                  government has insured for adults age 62 and over a different                  type of mortgage that provides regular monthly without repayment                  or the threat of eviction, even if the owner outlives the declining                  equity. The links on this page lead to descriptions of different                  types of reverse mortgage policies, consumer advocacy issues associated                  with some types of programs, and emerging state and federal initiatives                  in extending protection and support.

How to Contact Us                             Search                                                    Legislation and Testimony Home                          Social Security Testimony Before Congress                                               Deputy Commissioner for Disability and Income Security        Programs, Martin Gerry’s Testimony Before The Ways And Means Subcommittee        On Social Security On The Social Security Definition Of Disability         Mr. Chairman and Members of the Subcommittee:         Thank you for inviting me today to discuss the definition of disability        used by the Social Security Administration (SSA) in evaluating applicants        for Social Security and Supplemental Security Income (SSI) disability        benefits. I will briefly describe the programs to which the definition        applies and will then elaborate some more on the definition in the Social        Security Act (the Act) and in SSA regulations.                 Social Security and SSI Disability Programs          The Act provides cash benefits to individuals with disabling physical        and mental disorders under two major programs: Social Security Disability        Insurance (SSDI) and Supplemental Security Income (SSI). Often, receipt of        disability benefits also provides access to health care.         SSDI comprises a number of disability benefits for workers and their        dependents and survivors. Entitlement is based on contributions to the        Social Security trust funds through Federal Insurance Contribution Act        (FICA) taxes. Individuals who qualify for SSDI benefits are entitled to        receive medical benefits from the federal Medicare program generally after        they have been entitled to benefits for 24 months. SSDI benefits include:                           Disability Insurance Benefits. This is a cash benefit paid to          workers who have not reached retirement age, who are disabled or blind          as defined in the Act, and who meet other requirements for entitlement          described below.                     Widow's and Widower's Insurance Benefits based on disability.          Disabled widows or widowers of workers may receive benefits if they are          at least 50 years old. In general, the disability must have started          before the worker died or within seven years after the worker's death.          Surviving divorced spouses with disabilities may also qualify for this          disability benefit.                     Child's Insurance Benefits based on disability. An unmarried,          disabled child of a worker who has died, retired, or is receiving          disability insurance benefits may receive this benefit. In general, the          individual must be unmarried and 18 years old or older to qualify. The          individual must have been continuously disabled since before attaining          age 22.          The same definition of disability applies to all these benefits.        Benefits can also be payable to non-disabled spouses and children of SSDI        recipients.         SSI is a means-tested program that provides a basic floor of income for        individuals with limited incomes and resources. SSI benefits are paid to        aged (age 65 and older), blind, and disabled individuals who have limited        means. Individuals under age 65, including children (individuals under age        18) must be blind or disabled to qualify for benefits. The same definition        of disability that applies for SSDI also applies for SSI benefits for        adults. Children under the age of 18 have a different definition of        disability for SSI which was enacted in 1996.         In addition to this basic floor of income, individuals eligible for SSI        can benefit from Medicaid health insurance coverage from the States.                 The Social Security Act         The Social Security Act broadly defines disability for adults as the        inability to engage in any substantial gainful activity (SGA) due to a        physical or mental impairment that has lasted or is expected to last at        least one year or to result in death. Neither shorter-term disability nor        partial disability is encompassed. The Act requires the Commissioner of        Social Security to prescribe rules for obtaining and evaluating evidence        and making disability decisions. The law further requires that initial        disability determinations be made by State agencies, called Disability        Determination Services (DDSs), following Federal rules and guidelines and        fully financed by Federal funds.                 Sequential Evaluation         As prescribed in SSA's regulations, disability in adults is evaluated        under a five-step ""sequential evaluation process."" The steps are followed        in order until a decision is made. The first step is to determine whether        the individual is engaging in SGA. Under current regulations, in the case        of blind individuals, the SGA earnings limit is set by statute, and is        currently $1,300 a month. For individuals with other disabilities, if a        person is earning more than $780 a month, he or she will be considered to        be engaging in SGA. However, SSA does not necessarily count all the        person's earnings. For example, we deduct impairment-related work expenses        when we determine the amount of earnings to count. Both amounts are        indexed annually to average wage growth.         If it is determined that the individual is engaging in SGA, a decision        is made at the first step that he or she is not disabled without        considering medical factors. If an individual is found not to be engaging        in SGA, the existence, severity and duration of the person's impairment        are explored. At this step, and throughout the remainder of the process,        we consider all of a person's physical and mental impairments, both singly        and in combination.         If the individual does not have a medical impairment, or the impairment        or combined impairments are determined to be ""not severe"" (i.e., they do        not significantly limit the individual's capacity to perform basic work        activities), the individual is found not disabled at the second step. If        the impairment is ""severe,"" we proceed to the third step, where a        determination is made as to whether the impairment ""meets"" or ""equals"" the        criteria of one of the medical listings published in regulations by SSA.                 Listing of Impairments          The Listing of Impairments describes, for each major function of the        body, impairments that are considered severe enough to prevent a person        from doing any gainful activity, as opposed to any substantial gainful        activity. The Listings are not required by statute, but SSA has been using        them in one form or another since it first started evaluating disability        claims, updating them as needed, to screen the most obviously disabled        applicants. Most of the listed impairments are permanent or expected to        result in death, or a specific statement of duration is made. For all        others, the evidence must show that the impairment has lasted or is        expected to last for a continuous period of at least 12 months.         At this third step, the presence of an impairment that meets the        criteria in the Listing of Impairments (or that is of equal severity) is        usually sufficient to establish that an individual who is not working is        disabled, without the need to consider the individual's age, education, or        work experience. However, the absence of a listing-level impairment does        not mean the individual is not disabled. Rather, it merely requires the        adjudicator to move on to the next step of the process.                 Medical-Vocational Decisions         If a ""severe"" impairment neither ""meets"" nor ""equals"" a listing (which        would result in a finding of disability), SSA assesses the individual's        residual functional capacity--what an individual can still do despite his        or her impairment--and uses that assessment in the last two steps of the        process. At step four, we consider whether the person has the residual        functional capacity to meet the physical and mental demands of past        relevant work. If the impairment does not prevent the individual from        meeting the demands of past relevant work, the person is found not        disabled.         Finally, if the impairment does prevent the individual from performing        past relevant work (or if the person did not have any past relevant work)        it must be determined whether the impairment prevents the person making an        adjustment to other work at step five. As the statutory definition states,        the individual must be ""not only unable to do his previous work but        cannot, considering his age, education, and work experience, engage in any        other kind of substantial gainful work which exists in the national        economy....""         The statutory standard is a method of judging disability. For example,        the law specifies that the work the person can do does not have to exist        in the immediate area in which he or she lives, and that a specific job        vacancy does not have to be available to him or her. Work in the national        economy is defined in statute as work which exists in significant numbers        either in the region where such individual lives or in several regions of        the country.         SSA has developed a vocational ""grid"" designed to minimize subjectivity        and promote consistency in applying the vocational factors. The grid        regulations relate age, education, and past work experience to the        individual's residual functional capacity to perform work-related physical        and mental activities. If the applicant has a particular level of exertion        work capability--characterized by the terms sedentary, light, and        medium--an automatic finding of ""disabled"" or ""not disabled"" may be        required when such capability is applied to various combinations of age,        education, and work experience. Otherwise, we use the rules as a framework        for decision making.                 Other Definitions of Disability         There are numerous other definitions of disability for different        purposes. Workers compensation, vocational rehabilitation, State Medicaid        programs, and private disability insurers each has its own definition of        disability for its own purpose.         One notable example is The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). Its        definition of disability is different from SSA's definition. The purpose        of the ADA is to: (1) provide a clear and comprehensive national        mandate for the elimination of discrimination against individuals with        disabilities;  (2) provide clear, strong, consistent, enforceable        standards addressing discrimination against individuals with disabilities;         (3) ensure that the Federal Government plays a central role in        enforcing the standards established in this Act on behalf of individuals        with disabilities; and  (4) invoke the sweep of congressional        authority, including the power to enforce the fourteenth amendment and to        regulate commerce, in order to address the major areas of discrimination        faced day-to-day by people with disabilities.         In 1999, the United States Supreme Court held in a 9-0 decision that        the pursuit, and receipt, of SSDI benefits does not automatically prevent        the recipient from pursuing an ADA claim. The court's decision further        noted that both ADA and SSDI claims ""can comfortably exist side by side""        and recognized that the two laws do not share a common definition of        disability.                 Disability Research         One of the most valuable services SSA can provide to policymakers is        the information they need for making sound decisions. SSA places a high        priority on policy analysis and research that will provide the information        necessary to evaluate and strengthen the nation's disability programs.         Many experts believe that providing intervention methods to disabled        individuals as close to the disability onset as possible significantly        improves their chance of starting or returning to work. We plan on testing        several models including such interventions as integrated service supports        and collaboration with employers. We also plan to study the extent to        which the listings are predictive of work ability.                 Conclusion         Finally, I thank you, Mr. Chairman, Mr. Matsui, and all the members of        the Subcommittee, for beginning the public process of exploring the        definition of disability for Social Security benefits. Obviously, any        potential changes would have to be considered in terms of the long-term        solvency of the combined trust funds. I stand with the Commissioner in her        pledge to work with the Administration, with the Congress, and with the        dedicated and experienced employees of the Social Security Administration        to find the best solutions for this and other issues facing the Agency.         Again, thank you for inviting me to be here today. I look forward to        working with you to improve Social Security's disability programs.

Work/life programs are spreading across Government and making it easier for Federal employees to balance all aspects of their lives, including helping employees with the adoption process.    This Adoption Benefits Guide provides questions and answers on leave programs and health and tax benefits available to Federal employees who are prospective adoptive parents.    It also provides information on other Federal adoption assistance, State adoption subsidy programs, and national adoption resources.       Leave Programs    The Federal Government has an impressive and flexible array of work/life leave options which support employees' family responsibilities and enhance the productivity of the workforce. Key components of the Federal leave system include: annual leave; sick leave; family and medical leave; family-friendly leave; leave for bone marrow and organ donation; leave sharing; and leave banks.    Two laws which have specific provisions for adoptive parents are Sick Leave for Adoption and the Family and Medical Leave Act.       Sick Leave for Adoption    This law became effective on September 30, 1994, and allows Federal employees to use sick leave for absences relating to adopting a child.    Following are some questions and answers regarding sick leave for adoption.    What adoption-related activities are covered?   The purposes for which an adoptive parent may request sick leave include appointments with adoption agencies, social workers, and attorneys; court proceedings; required travel; and any other activities necessary to allow the adoption to proceed.    Can I use sick leave for the purpose of bonding with my adopted child?   There is no provision in the law or regulation to permit the use of sick leave by birth parents or adoptive parents who choose to be absent from work to bond with a birth or adopted child.   However, you may use sick leave if required by the court or adoption agency to take time off from work to care for the newly adopted child.    Is the amount of sick leave I may use for adoption-related purposes limited to 13 days as it is for other family care purposes?    No. The amount of sick leave taken for adoption-related activities is not limited to 13 days and does not count towards the annual 13-day limit under the Family-Friendly Leave Act.     At one time, Federal employees were given the opportunity to request that sick leave be substituted for annual leave used for adoption purposes between September 30, 1991, and September 30, 1994. Is that still in effect?   No. That opportunity ended on September 30, 1996.       Family and Medical Leave Act    To help balance the demands of the workplace with the needs of the family, the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) was signed into law on February 5, 1993 (Public Law 103-3) and became effective on August 5, 1993. This law ensures that family and medical leave is available on a gender-neutral basis and mandates job security for employees who take leave. In addition, it accomplishes these purposes in a manner that accommodates the legitimate interests of employers.    Title II of the Act, ""Leave for Civil Service Employees,"" provides eligible Federal employees an entitlement to a total of 12 administrative workweeks of unpaid leave during any 12-month period for certain family and medical needs.    For what purposes can leave be taken under the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA)?   FMLA provides eligible Federal employees with an entitlement to  12 workweeks of unpaid leave during any 12-month period for the following purposes :       birth of a son or daughter of the employee and care of the newborn;*     placement of a son or daughter with the employee for adoption or foster care;*     care of a spouse, son, daughter, or parent of the employee who has a serious health condition; and     a serious health condition of the employee that makes the employee unable to perform the essential functions of his or her position.        * Entitlement to 12 weeks of leave expires 12 months after the date of birth or placement for adoption or foster care. (Employees may begin this leave prior to the birth or placement.)    How much leave can I take each year under the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA)?   You are entitled to a total of up to 12 workweeks of unpaid leave during any 12-month period (not necessarily a calendar year or leave year). The 12-month period begins on the date you first take the leave and continues for 12 months. You are not entitled to 12 additional weeks of leave under FMLA until the previous 12-month period ends and an event or situation occurs that entitles you to another period of such leave. (This may include a continuation of a previous situation or circumstance, e.g., a serious health condition.)    What justification is required to use leave under the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA)?    You may be required to provide advance leave notice and medical certification. Ordinarily, you must provide 30 days advance notice when the need for leave is  foreseeable . If the need for leave is not foreseeable, e.g., because of a medical emergency, you must provide notice within a reasonable period of time appropriate to the circumstances involved. An agency may require medical certification to support a request for leave because of a serious health condition and may require second or third opinions (at the employer's expense).   If you cannot provide the required medical certification before FMLA leave is to begin, you must be provided  provisional  leave. Once this leave has commenced and you fail to provide the medical certification, the agency may charge you as absent without leave (AWOL) or may allow you to request that the provisional leave be charged as leave without pay or to your appropriate leave account.    What are the job benefits and protections provided under the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA)?    Upon return from this leave, you must be returned to the same position or to an equivalent position with equivalent benefits, pay, status, and other terms and conditions of employment. When you take FMLA leave, you are entitled to maintain health benefits coverage and may choose to pay the employee share of the premium on a current basis or pay upon return to work. The use of this leave cannot result in the loss of any employment benefit that accrued prior to the start of your leave.    Can I substitute paid leave for leave under the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA)?    You may elect, but  the agency may not require you , to substitute advanced, accrued or accumulated annual and/or sick leave for the unpaid leave in accordance with current law and regulations. You may  not  retroactively substitute paid time off for unpaid leave under FMLA. FMLA leave is  in addition to  other paid time off available to you.   Under certain conditions, this leave may be taken intermittently, or you may work under a work schedule that is reduced by the number of hours of leave taken as family and medical leave.       Additional Leave Benefits    Further information on additional leave benefits may be obtained from the Office of Personnel Management's (OPM) brochure, ""Family-Friendly Leave Policies for Federal Employees."" This publication is available on OPM ONLINE and can be ordered from the Government Printing Office (LEAVE-95-1, November 1995).    You may also contact your agency personnel office, or OPM's Compensation Administration Division at (202) 606-2858.       Health Benefits    Federal employees may cover a legally adopted child or a foster child under their Federal Employees Health Benefits (FEHB) family enroll-ment upon showing proof of the child's eligibility as a family member. The child must be single, under the age of 22, and financially dependent on the employee. Proof of adoption or foster child status must be provided by the employee.    Following are some questions and answers regarding health benefits.    Do adopted and foster children receive the same health coverage as the Federal employee?    The child receives the same health benefits coverage that is available to the Federal employee and all other family members. There are no exclusions or waiting periods because of preexisting medical conditions.   A child who meets the definition of ""member of family"" under the Federal Employees Health Benefits (FEHB) law receives coverage regardless of whether he or she has coverage under Medicaid.    Where do I apply for coverage for my adopted or foster child?    You must apply at your employing office. The employing office makes the determination whether the child meets the requirements for an adopted or foster child based on documents you provide.    What proof must I provide for an adopted child?    You must provide the final decree papers.    What are the requirements for covering foster children?    The child must be living with you, you must be raising the child as your own, and you must have assumed full parental responsibility and control of the child. There must be an expectation that you will continue to raise the child into adulthood. A child living with you under a pre-adoption agreement may qualify as a foster child.   Under the Federal Employees Health Benefits (FEHB) law, a foster child is an unmarried dependent child under 22 years of age who lives with you in a regular parent-child relationship; not a child who is temporarily living with you nor one who is placed in your home by a welfare or social service agency which retains control of the child and pays for maintenance.    Must I obtain a court order for custody in order to cover my foster child on my health benefits enrollment?    A court order for  permanent  custody is acceptable as proof of dependency, but is not necessarily required.   However, a court order for temporary custody or a Power of Attorney is not acceptable proof for health benefits enrollment. Other acceptable proof of foster child status are:     evidence that the child has been included as a dependent on your tax returns for previous years;    canceled checks, money orders, or receipts for periodic payments received from you for or on behalf of the child;    evidence of goods or services which show regular or substantial contributions of considerable value; and    sworn affidavits from people unrelated to you that the child lives in your home.       The employing office will ultimately make the final decision as to what proof is acceptable in an individual case.    When does health coverage for an adopted or a foster child begin?    Coverage for an adopted child begins the day the adoption decree is final.    Coverage for a foster child begins the first day of the pay period in which the employing office receives all properly completed documents necessary to establish eligibility of the child as a foster child.    I will be traveling overseas to pick up a child who I am adopting and will be staying three to four weeks to ensure the paperwork goes through. Since the child might qualify only as a foster child prior to final adoption, how will she meet the ""living with"" requirement when she is not at my home back in the States?    It is true a child is not considered adopted until the adoption is final. Nevertheless, the child would meet the foster child requirement even though the child is not technically residing with you at your permanent home. The effective date would be the first day of the pay period in which you begin living with the child overseas.    When does an adopted or foster child's health benefits coverage stop?    Health benefits stop when the child reaches the age of 22, marries, or is no longer dependent on the employee. Health benefits can continue after age 22 if the person is incapable of self-support because of a disability incurred before age 22. Contact your employing offical for information on how to continue coverage in such cases.    Would my adopted or foster child qualify for continued health benefits under the temporary continuation of coverage (TCC) provisions of the Federal Employees Health Benefits (FEHB) law?    The TCC provisions allow children who no longer qualify as a dependent child (e.g., child reaches age 22, marries before age 22, no longer lives with the employee) to continue their FEHB coverage for up to 36 months. The child is enrolled in his or her own right and pays both the employee and the Government's share of the premium, plus an additional 2% administrative cost. You should notify your employing office within 60 days after the child no longer qualifies for cover-age as a family member.    A child who loses FEHB coverage for any reason other than by cancellation has a 31-day temporary extension of coverage, at no cost, for the purpose of converting to a non-group contract with his or her current health benefits plan. To convert the child's coverage to a non-group plan, you or your child must apply directly to the health benefits plan within 31 days after the child's eligibility ends.    For further information on health benefits, contact your personnel office.       Tax Benefits for Adoption    Effective January 1, 1997, adoptive parents may be able to take a new tax credit for qualifying expenses paid to adopt an eligible child. The adoption credit is a non-refundable credit that you subtract from your tax liability.    Also, money or other benefits from a private sector employer for qualifying adoption expenses may be excluded from your gross income. (The Federal Government does not provide such benefits, but you might work part-time for a private sector employer or your spouse might be employed by a private sector employer.)    Following are some questions and answers regarding tax benefits.    What are qualifying expenses in the adoption process?    Qualifying expenses are reasonable and necessary adoption fees, court costs, attorney fees, and other expenses directly related to, and whose principal purpose is for, the legal adoption of an eligible child.    What are non-qualifying adoption expenses?    Non-qualifying adoption expenses include:     expenses that violate State and Federal law;    expenses for carrying out any surrogate parenting arrangement;    expenses for the adoption of your spouse's child;    expenses paid using funds received from any Federal, State, or local program; and    expenses allowed as a credit or deduction under any other Federal income tax rule.       What is the definition of eligible child?    An eligible child is:     Under 18 years old, or    Physically or mentally incapable of caring for himself or herself.       How long will the adoption credit be in effect?    It will be in effect until December 31, 2001. After 2001, the adoption credit will apply only to qualifying expenses for adopting an eligible child with special needs.    What is the definition of an eligible child with special needs?    An eligible child with special needs is a U.S. citizen or resident where a State (or the District of Columbia or a U.S. possession) determines that the child cannot or should not be returned to his or her parent's home and probably will not be adopted unless adoption assistance is provided to the adoptive parents.    Factors used to determine if a child has special needs could include:     the child's ethnic background;    the child's age;    whether the child is a member of a minority or sibling group; and    whether the child has a medical condition or physical, mental, or emotional disability.    A foreign child, who is not a U.S. citizen or resident, cannot be treated as a child with special needs.      When do I take the adoption tax credit for expenses paid for a child who is a U.S. citizen or resident?    If you adopt a child who is a U.S. citizen or resident (and the adoption is not final) you take the adoption credit, not in the year that you paid expenses to adopt, but in the following tax year. The tax credit for adoption expenses paid in the year when the adoption becomes final, is taken in that same year.    When do I take the adoption credit for expenses paid for a child who is not a U.S. citizen or resident?    If you adopt a child who is not a U.S. citizen or resident, you cannot take the adoption credit until the adoption becomes final. Credit can be taken only for the year the adoption becomes final. Adoption expenses paid earlier are treated as paid during the year the adoption becomes final.    How do I claim the credit or exclusion?    You must file Internal Revenue Service (IRS) Form 8839 with either Form 1040 or Form 1040A to claim the credit or exclusion. Your income tax package has specific instructions.   If you are married, you must file a joint return to take the adoption credit or qualify for the income exclusion. If you are legally separated from your spouse for the last six months of the tax year, you may be able to file a separate return and still take the credit or qualify for the exclusion.   You must identify, on the tax return for the year you claim the credit or exclusion, all eligible children for whom you paid expenses to adopt. You must give (if known) the child's name, age, and taxpayer identification number.   If you do not know the above information, you may be required to give other identifying information including the name of an agent who assisted with the adoption.    Are the credit and the exclusion for qualifying adoption expenses subject to a dollar limit and an income limit?    Yes. These limits apply separately.    What is the dollar limit?    The amount of expenses that you can claim as a credit or the amount of private employer-provided adoption assistance (if your spouse works for a private sector employer or if you work part-time for a private sector employer) that you can exclude from your income is limited to $5,000 for each effort to adopt an eligible child or $6,000 for each effort to adopt an eligible child with special needs. This is the maximum that can be claimed over all taxable years.   If more than one person is claiming expenses for a child, the limit applies to the total expenses paid for the child. That is, they are limited to $5,000 between them (or $6,000 if expenses are for a child with special needs). Anything over that limit cannot be claimed as credit in any year.    What is the income limit?    The income limit is based on modified adjusted gross income (AGI). If your modified AGI is $75,000 or less, you are not subject to any income limit. If your modified AGI is more than $75,000, but less than $115,000, the credit phases out. If your modified AGI is $115,000 or more, you cannot take the credit or exclusion.    What happens to unused credit?    The amount of your allowable adoption credit for a year cannot be more than your regular tax liability for that year, minus certain other credits.   If your credit is more than this limit, you can carry the unused credit to your next five tax years, or until used, whichever comes first.    Can both a credit and an exclusion be claimed for expenses of adopting an eligible child?    Yes. You may claim both a credit and an exclusion, but they cannot be claimed for the same expense.    For more information on tax benefits for adoption, contact the Internal Revenue Service at 1-(800) 829-1040.       Adoption Assistance Programs    Two adoption assistance programs that you should be aware of are the Federal Title IV-E Adoption Assistance and State Adoption Subsidy Programs. Eligibility criteria for State adoption subsidies vary. Check with your adoption agency and State adoption officials to find out what your State allows.     Federal Title IV-E Adoption Assistance    Under this assistance program, parents of an eligible child may receive a monthly subsidy for the ordinary needs of the child. These payments are not designated for a specific purpose such as medical expenses, living expenses or special services. The funds may be used for any identifiable needs of the child.    An eligible child is one who has been determined by the State to be a special needs child, i.e., free for adoption and considered hard to place because of a specific factor or condition (member of a sibling group, medically disabled, etc.). In some circumstances, the State must make an effort to place the child without adoption subsidy.    Adoptive parents do not have to meet any financial eligibility criteria to receive adoption assistance on behalf of their child. A child for whom Title IV-E adoption assistance is provided is automatically eligible for medical assistance under Title XIX (Medicaid) and may receive social services under Title XX.    In addition, non-recurring adoption expenses (legal fees, court costs) are available to adoptive parents. A non-recurring adoption expense is a one-time adoption fee that is necessary for the adoption of a special needs child, which is not incurred in violations of State and Federal law, and has not been reimbursed from other sources or other funds.     State Adoption Subsidy Programs    These programs provide assistance for children who are not eligible under the Federal Title IV-E program. Adoption subsidies take various forms in different States depending on the child's needs and State agency's program. Under State-funded pro-grams, there are generally three types of adoption subsidies: medical, maintenance, and special services. Medical subsidies cover some or all forthe costs related to a child's specific medical condition that are not covered by the family's health insurance. They may also cover the costs of related therapy, rehabilitation and special education. Some States provide medical assistance through Medicaid which also pays for health care needs not covered by the adoptive family's health insurance policy or other community resources. Maintenance or support subsidies are direct payments to the adoptive family to help cover the child's living expenses.    Special service subsidies are usually one-time payments to cover a child's emergency needs or other extra-ordinary needs; less often, they are repeated payments for services not covered by medical or maintenance subsidies. Each State determines what is an allowable cost.    Further information on adoption assistance can be obtained by calling the National Adoption Information Clearinghouse at (703) 352-3488; the National Adoption Center at (215) 735-9988; and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' Children's Bureau at (202) 205-8618.       Office of Work/Life Programs    The Office of Personnel Management's (OPM) Office of Work/Life Programs is available to provide technical assistance and advice to agencies to help them develop or enhance work/life policies and programs, including adoption.

Section 17 of House      Bill No. 1012 directed a study of the feasibility and desirability of state      administration of child support, including the fiscal effect on counties and      the state. Senate Resolution No. 4014 directed a study of the adoption laws      of this state and other states. Senate Concurrent Resolution No. 4019 directed      a study of the medical and financial privacy laws in this state, including      the effectiveness of medical and financial privacy laws in other states, the      interaction of federal and state medical and financial privacy laws, and whether      current medical and financial privacy protections meet the reasonable expectations      of the citizens of North Dakota.      Committee members were Representatives John Mahoney (Chairman), Lois Delmore,      Mary Ekstrom, Roxanne Jensen, Jim Kasper, Lawrence R. Klemin, Carol A. Niemeier,      Dan Ruby, Sally M. Sandvig, and Dwight Wrangham and Senators Linda Christenson,      Dick Dever, Robert S. Erbele, Michael A. Every, RussellT. Thane, and Darlene      Watne.      The committee submitted this report to the Legislative Council at the biennial      meeting of the Council in November 2002. The Council accepted the report for      submission to the 58th Legislative Assembly.     ADMINISTRATION OF CHILD SUPPORT STUDY      During the 1999-2000 interim the State Auditor performed a performance audit      on aspects of the North Dakota child support enforcement program of the Department      of Human Services. The performance audit report dated September 14, 2000,      contained results of the audit and the results of a review performed by TMR-MAXIMUS,      an independent consulting firm that had since changed its name to MAXIMUS.      The portion of the report addressing ""Statizing and Placement of the      Agency"" included an analysis of the child support enforcement program's      state-supervised and county-administered organizational structure, including      an analysis of staffing levels, staff functions, and duties of the Child Support      Enforcement Division and the regional child support enforcement units. The      consulting firm recommended that the state's child support enforcement program      should be state-administered instead of county-administered. The consulting      firm reported that there is ""poor communication between the state child      support office and the regions."" In addition the recommendations in the      report include considering whether there is a need to realign and consolidate      the eight regional offices. In the report the purpose for considering consolidation      or realignment was to ""reach a level of peak efficiency that does not      overly-compromise geographic proximity to customers or courts.""     Background      2001 Legislation      House Bill No. 1012, the appropriations bill for the Department of Human      Services, in part, changed the reimbursement rate to counties for an affected      county's expenses for locally administered economic assistance programs from      100 percent to a percentage based on the level of legislative appropriations.      This portion of the bill conflicted with House Bill No. 1015, which was enacted      by the Legislative Assembly after House Bill No.1012; therefore, the provisions      of House Bill No.1015 went into effect instead of the provisions of House      Bill No. 1012.      House Bill No. 1015 changed the reimbursement rate to counties for an affected      county's expenses for locally administered economic assistance programs from      100percent to 90 percent.      Senate Bill No. 2160 exempted the child support enforcement program from      fees charged by the registers of deeds and the Secretary of State for searching      records, fees for filing documents in the central indexing system, and fees      for copying for cases involving the establishment of paternity or for the      establishment, modification, or enforcement of child support.     Previous Legislation      In 1999 House Bill No. 1121 designated the clerk of court as the public      official responsible for sending notices of child support arrearages and for      the administration of income-withholding for all cases other than Title IV-D      cases until January 16, 2001, at which time the Department of Human Services      took over these duties.      In 1999 Senate Bill No. 2012 required the Department of Human Services to      reimburse county social service boards for locally administered economic assistance      programs in counties in which more than 20percent of the caseload for these      programs consisted of people who reside on a federally recognized Indian reservation      or property tax-exempt tribal trust lands. The bill required a county to reimburse      the state for the county's share of one-fourth of the amount expended in the      state in excess of any federal payments on behalf of children in foster care      or subsidized adoption.      In 1997 House Bill No. 1041, known as the SWAP legislation, required counties      to assume the financial responsibility for the costs of administering certain      economic assistance programs and required the state to assume complete financial      responsibility for the grant costs of medical assistance and basic care and      contribute additional support of administrative costs for counties with Indian      land.      In 1997 House Bill No. 1226 provided for implementation of federal welfare      reform, authorized the Department of Human Services to administer the temporary      assistance for needy families (TANF) program, and provided that the county      social service boards administer that program. The bill provided for the establishment      of a statewide automated data processing system that contains records with      respect to each child support case in which services are being provided by      the state agency or a child support agency. The bill also addressed state      and county responsibilities for financing the costs of administering the TANF      program, child care assistance, and employment and training.     Previous Studies      During the 1999-2000 interim the Legislative Council's interim Judiciary      Committee studied the family law process in the state with a focus on the      review of existing statutes, the coordination of procedures, and the further      implementation of alternative dispute resolution methods. The committee performed      this study and did not recommend any bills related to the issue of administration      of child support.      During the 1999-2000 interim the Legislative Council's interim Legislative      Audit and Fiscal Review Committee received from the State Auditor a child      support enforcement performance audit. The State Auditor, in concert with      a private consultant, analyzed the child support enforcement program's state-supervised      and county-administered organizational structure, including an analysis of      staffing levels, staff functions, and duties of the Child Support Enforcement      Division and the regional units. The audit included an analysis of the child      support enforcement program's state-supervised and county-administered organizational      structure, including an analysis of staffing levels, staff functions, and      duties of the Child Support Enforcement Division and the regional units. The      consulting firm recommended that the state's child support enforcement program      should be state-administered instead of county-administered.       During the 1997-98 interim the Legislative Council's interim Child Support      Committee studied the provision of child support services and child care licensing      in the state. The committee did not recommend any bills related to the issue      of administration of child support.      During the 1995-96 interim the Legislative Council's interim Budget Committee      on Human Services studied the responsibilities of county social service agencies,      regional human service centers, and the Department of Human Services. The      committee cooperated with the Joint Social Service Committee, which was composed      of representatives of the North Dakota Association of County Social Services      Board Members Association, the Department of Human Services, and the North      Dakota Association of Counties, in studying statutes relative to county-based      social services, options for the provision of child support enforcement services,      the current and ideal structure for early childhood licensing, and the overall      structure and funding of children and family services. The committee recommended      House Bill No. 1041, which is discussed previously in this report.      During the 1995-96 interim the Legislative Council's interim Legislative      Audit and Fiscal Review Committee received from the State Auditor a child      support enforcement program performance audit report. The audit reviewed the      efficiency and effectiveness of the state's system of establishing and enforcing      child support orders, the potential for reducing costs through program fees      and interest on arrears, and the adequacy of policies and procedures surrounding      the collection of overpayments to custodial parents. This audit was conducted      as part of a joint performance audit initiated by the National State Auditors      Association.     Testimony      The committee received extensive testimony from a broad range of parties      interested in the administration of child support study, including representatives      of the State Auditor, the regional child support enforcement units, MAXIMUS,      the Department of Human Services, the county social services boards, the North      Dakota Association of Counties, and the Attorney General.      The study began with a review of the 2000 child support enforcement performance      audit as it pertained to administration of the child support enforcement program,      continued with the receipt of testimony regarding the pros and cons of different      administrative structures, and concluded with the receipt of testimony regarding      who should most appropriately fund the child support enforcement program and      regarding social service funding issues related to regions with Indian reservations      and Indian trust land.     State Auditor      A representative of the State Auditor's office presented the portion of      the 2000 child support enforcement performance audit that dealt with administration      of the child support enforcement system. The audit was the result of a risk      assessment of Department of Human Services programs, under which the child      support enforcement program was determined to be of high risk. The audit included      a survey of the child support enforcement programs of other states. Testimony      indicated the national trend is state administration of child support enforcement      programs.      Information gathered through the audit indicated there was poor communication      between the state and the regional child support enforcement units and that      changing to a state-administered program may improve this communication; the      child support enforcement services offered across the state were not uniform      and not consistent, and this resulted in extra time and money being spent;      and there were strained communications, administrative redundancies, contradictory      practices, and imperfect allocation of resources under the county-administered      system.      The testimony indicated possible benefits of changing to a state-administered      child support enforcement system may include:           Equalization of caseloads between the state's eight child support enforcement        regions;       Consistent employee salaries between the state's eight child support enforcement        regions;       Improved customer service;       Faster processing of child support payments;       Increased child support collections; and       The possibility that over time there may be an opportunity to decrease        the number of full-time child support enforcement employees.         Regional Child Support Enforcement Units      The committee received testimony regarding the structure and duties of the      regional child support enforcement units. Each of the eight regional child      support enforcement units has its own cooperative agreement with the state's      child support enforcement agency and with each county's social services board,      state's attorney, clerk of court, and sheriff's department. In the Minot,      Bismarck, and Fargo units, the county social service boards delegated the      duty to supervise the respective regional units to the state's attorney's      office in the host county. In the other five regional units supervision is      provided by the host county's social services department or a representative      board.      A representative of the regional child support enforcement unit administrators      testified that each unit operates somewhat differently, depending on the needs      of the region. The committee received testimony that some of the similarities      between units are that each regional unit operates out of an office in the      host county's courthouse or a private office building and that each unit has      an administrator who is responsible for:                 Managing the unit and supervising the staff;                 Primarily ensuring compliance with program policies        and procedures;                 Supervising and coordinating the work of all staff in        the unit and in the several counties in which the unit operates;                 Handling all personnel issues and interviews;                 Meeting with custodial and noncustodial parents, attorneys,        county officials, and legislators;                 Preparing for and attending monthly administrator meetings;                 Participating in the legislative process;                 Preparing state regional budgets;                 Conducting regular staff meetings;                 Participating in development and implementation of the        state's strategic plan; and                 Promoting public relations.               A representative of the regional child support enforcement unit administrators      acknowledged that the performance audit report was one of the catalysts for      the discussion of state administration of the system; however, since the audit      was performed during the conversion to the new automated system, the audit      is not a fair representation of how the eight units currently operate. If      a performance audit were conducted today, the testimony indicated the auditors      would see a much different picture. Regional office staff are proficient in      the use of the automated system, the regional offices have implemented more      administrative procedures, and the regions have made great strides in the      efficient operation of the units. Additionally, the committee received testimony      that the unit administrators were concerned that during the audit, four of      the eight units were not included and that the audit findings and conclusions      were not made available to the units in order to comment on the draft.      The committee received testimony that administrators had concerns that if      the child support enforcement program was state-administered:                 Recipients would not be provided the services they need        on the local level;                 The state would not have the staff and resources necessary        to adequately administer the program; and                 Administrative decisionmaking would not necessarily        include input from the local regions.               The committee received testimony that although there may be some efficiencies      that would be recognized by changing to a state-administered child support      enforcement program, there are some benefits to be gained from the current      structure due to its local proximity. Additionally, testimony was received      that most of the improved efficiencies that could be gained by going to a      state-administered program would be able to be recognized under the county-administered      program if sufficient funds were made available to the counties.     Audit Consultant      The committee received testimony from a representative of MAXIMUS, the consulting      firm that assisted in the 2000 child support enforcement performance audit      that dealt with administration of the child support enforcement system. The      committee received information regarding North Dakota's performance in key      child support enforcement categories compared to the nation and compared to      South Dakota, which is an example of a state that has a state-administered      child support enforcement program. The data indicated that North Dakota met      or exceeded the national performance; however, South Dakota significantly      exceeded North Dakota on almost all of these performance figures. The committee      received the following information:           In fiscal year 2000, 154 full-time employees were attributable to the        North Dakota child support enforcement program.       The central state child support enforcement office has 32 positions to        perform all of the federally mandated functions as well as some state-level        enforcement activities.       The counties in each of the eight regional child support enforcement units        pool their resources to pay for the regional child support enforcement staff.        The caseload per full-time employee in the regional units varies substantially        as do the results under the performance indicators. Performance of the units        with lower caseload-to-staff ratios is better than that of units with higher        ratios.       Under the 1997 SWAP legislation, the counties continue to provide child        support services under state direction, in a manner organized by the counties.       The regional pool of local matching dollars per child support case is        not consistent among the eight regions, meaning some units spend more to        provide child support enforcement services than others.       As a result of the 1997 SWAP legislation, there is a net cost to county        government to run the child support enforcement program locally.       Changes in federal requirements are requiring states to centralize an        increasing number of functions of child support enforcement.       The state's automated child support system gives child support caseworkers        the power to work any case in the state child support inventory from any        location via a computer terminal.         In performing the audit the consultant found that although the state conducts      some training at the state level to convey statewide policy and procedures,      the reality is that it is regional child support enforcement units that implement      this policy. Inconsistencies in policy and procedure may mean inconsistent      service levels and approaches to customers based on the region in which a      customer lives. This inconsistent approach can lead to complaints of unfair      or inequitable treatment.       The representative of the consulting firm testified that moving to a state-administered      program may produce economies of scale, a more level playing field, and a      more consistent policy that in turn could produce a more efficient operation.      A more efficient operation can serve more people with the same service delivery      level or serve the same number of people at a higher service delivery level.      Additionally, changing to a state-administered child support enforcement program      should not adversely affect delivery of services in rural areas. To the contrary      the change might lead to better service delivery in rural areas as the experts      who can be found in other portions of the state can assist rural caseworkers      who may be generalists and not experts in every facet of a fairly complicated      program.      The committee received the following financial estimates:                 The cost to the state of moving to a state-administered        program is about $140,000 in one-time costs and $25,500 per month in ongoing        costs. With the federal government paying 66percent, the state's share would        be $48,000 in one-time expenses and $8,500 per month in additional costs.        Additionally, there would likely be increased efficiencies and increased        federal incentive dollars as a result of moving to a state-administered        system, which would somewhat offset the added cost in the second year of        the state-administered program.                 If costs of the regional child support enforcement unit        budgets were taken over by the state, moving to a state-administered program        would cost $416,174 in one-time costs and $454,858 in new monthly costs.                 Under the county-administered program, the regional        units receive 75 percent of 99 percent of the federal incentives, which        would return to the state under a state-administered system. In 2000 that        amount of federal incentives would have been $630,000. Additionally, the        state's share of TANF recoupment would be solely retained by the state after        moving to a state-administered system because enforcement is done at the        state level.              Department of Human Services Division of Child Support Enforcement      A representative of the Department of Human Services Division of Child Support      Enforcement testified the department would not support state administration      of the child support enforcement program unless the change was budget-neutral.      Testimony was received that if the program were changed to a state-administered      program, but the 1997 SWAP legislation was not changed, the counties would      receive a $7.8 million windfall for the biennium.      A representative of the Department of Human Services Child Support Enforcement      Division testified that possible efficiencies that may be recognized under      a state-administered child support enforcement program include:                 Specialization for tribal cases;                 Specialization for interstate cases;                 The possibility of a statewide prosecutor to target        nonpayment and nonsufficient fund cases;                 Increased efficiency in locater services;                 Increased ease of servicing child support enforcement        cases as parties move within the state; and                 The possibility of consolidation of income withholding        orders.               The committee received testimony that under a state-administered child support      enforcement program, although there may be a state-administered customer service      unit, it would be unlikely any of the existing eight regional child support      enforcement units would close, because of the importance of balancing consolidation      of services and reasonable access to caseworkers at the local level.      There are approximately 38 full-time equivalent positions in the state child      support enforcement office and 120 full-time equivalent positions under cooperative      agreement at the eight regional unit offices. Five of the regional units are      already under the state employee classification system, and a review of the      other three regional units indicated all the staff were within the appropriate      salary ranges except for two individuals who appeared to be over the salary      range in the amount of $444 and $380 per month. Under a state-administered      system, the department's intent is that these individuals would stay at their      pay levels until the pay ranges caught up with the current amount being paid.      A representative of the Department of Human Services Division of Child Support      Enforcement testified that because the child support enforcement system at      the federal level was essentially designed as a recoupment mechanism for public      services, the federal government keeps raising the bar to make the child support      enforcement system more effective and uses funding as an incentive to reach      these higher benchmarks. Historically, child support enforcement expenses      have increased over time; however, if administrative costs increase, efficiencies      under a state-administered program may help avoid or delay these increases.      Without the efficiencies that would result from state administration, the      counties will likely have to spend more money on administration of the program      in future years.      The committee received testimony that a county-financed state administration      of the child support enforcement program would neither aggravate nor eliminate      the problems experienced by counties in which there is an Indian reservation.      Additionally, state administration would have little effect on the role of      county commissioners in the administration of the program.      Testimony was received that the child support enforcement interactions with      the state and the Indian tribes are in a state of flux. Federal regulations      that would govern how Indian tribes may provide child support enforcement      services and draw federal funds to cover these costs have been pending for      nearly two years. A representative of the Department of Human Services Division      of Child Support Enforcement testified that until these federal regulations      are finalized, much of what can or should be done at the state level cannot      be implemented. Testimony was received that the Department of Human Services      will not commit state resources to the provision of child support enforcement      services on the Indian reservations without first knowing the financial impact,      which in part depends upon finalization of the federal regulations.     County Social Services Boards      The committee received testimony regarding the 1997 SWAP legislation. Testimony      indicated that when the SWAP legislation was implemented in 1998, the regional      child support enforcement units became primarily funded by county property      tax, while the Department of Human Services retained the 66 percent available      federal match for every county dollar expended. Although counties still receive      75 percent of the federal incentive dollars, because of changing methods of      incentive reimbursement, the actual funds have been significantly reduced      and the counties support reevaluating the funding system established in the      1997 SWAP legislation. Representatives of the County Social Services Board      Members Association and the County Commissioners Association testified in      support of state administration, with full state funding of the program.      A representative of the county social services boards testified that advantages      to establishing a single structure for administration of the child support      enforcement program may include:                 Clear lines of responsibility and authority;                 Simplified program funding (decreased property taxes);                 Lower overall administrative costs; and                 Improved collection of child support on Indian reservations.               Potential risks to the establishment of the state-administered child support      enforcement program may include:                 The current structure allows for structured discussion        and disagreements of policy and administrative issues and concerns, including        a broader range of feedback from various players on legislative issues;        and                 The system could lose local responsiveness to clients.               The committee received significant testimony from representatives of county      social services boards. Concern was expressed that counties are faced with      insufficient tax revenues in part due to the amount of property that is Indian      reservation land or trust land; the change in taxable status as previously      taxable land becomes untaxable if an Indian tribe purchases the land and it      is put in trust; the declining population in non-Indian reservation land;      decreased tax value of flooded property; and the low tax value of taxable      property.      The committee received testimony that non-Indian counties subsidize social      service financial obligations of the counties in which an Indian reservation      is fully or partially located. There are plans for these non-Indian counties      to cease subsidizing these Indian counties. It is likely that county revenue      will continue to decline while social services costs continue to grow in proportion      to the economically stressed but growing Native American population. A representative      of the county social services boards testified in support of immediate 100percent      state funding of child support efforts on behalf of the eight Indian counties      and state administration of those eight counties only if 100 percent of funding      is provided by the state.     Association of Counties      Representatives of the North Dakota Association of Counties testified in      support of state administration of the child support enforcement program,      contingent on the state taking full financial responsibility of the program.      Testimony was received by the committee that transition to a state-administered      child support enforcement program would result in a reduction of county social      services costs of approximately $4 million per year, resulting in property      tax levies for social services purposes being reduced by three to four mills      in each county.      A representative of the North Dakota Association of Counties testified that      given that the federal government has been taking increased control over the      child support enforcement programs from the states and counties, North Dakota      counties have very little control over the program, and therefore, the counties      support state funding and state administration of the program.      The committee received testimony in opposition of a state-administered but      county-funded child support enforcement program. Testimony was received that      the proposal to change to a state-administered program came at a time when      the Department of Human Services was dealing with a deficit and facing even      greater fiscal issues in the 2003 legislative session. State administration      with county funding would take away the little control counties have with      no reduction in county fiscal responsibilities.     Attorney General      A representative of the Attorney General's office testified that from a      legal perspective there may be some efficiencies that would result from changing      to a state-administered child support enforcement program, including allowing      for certain employees to become specialists in areas such as tribal practice      and interstate practice. The Attorney General took a neutral position on the      study of changing to a state-administered child support enforcement program.     Interested Persons      The committee received testimony from a customer of the county-administered      child support enforcement program. The individual testified in support of      a state-administered program, based on the belief that moving to a state-administered      program would increase the education of caseworkers and increase accountability      of the regional units to the state.     Committee Considerations      The committee considered a bill draft that would have provided for a state-administered      child support enforcement program. The bill draft would have been budget-neutral,      in that it based county contributions to the state on year 2001 payment levels      for county funding of the program. The bill draft would have authorized the      Department of Human Services to employ special assistant attorneys general.     Recommendations      The committee recommends  House      Concurrent Resolution No. 3002  to provide for a Legislative Council study      of loss of tax revenues from flooded property and from previously taxable      property that is purchased by tax-exempt entities and of the impact of the      tax status on the ability of local communities to provide social services.      The committee recommends  House      Concurrent Resolution No. 3003  to provide for a Legislative Council study      of state and local funding obligations for social services.      ADOPTION LAW STUDY      Background      Generally, adoption is a creature of state law, and although all 50 states      have different ways of dealing with the issue of adoption, the overall adoption      scheme is similar in most states. Some of the similarities between states'      adoption laws include:                 All states allow the adoption of a child;                 All states allow the adoption of a foreign-born child;                 A single adult or a husband and wife together can adopt;                 A child may be placed with prospective adoptive parents        by the public agency responsible for adoptions or by a private agency;                 A person may not be paid for placing a child for adoption;        however, reasonable fees may be charged;                 All adoption hearings take place in state courts;                 All adoptions are based upon the consent of persons        or agencies legally empowered with the care or custody of the children being        adopted;                 An investigation and home study to determine the appropriateness        of particular adopting parents are required before an adoption can occur;                 All adoption proceedings are confidential and held in        a court that is closed to the public or in a judge's chambers and all documents        pertaining to an adoption are sealed and kept as permanent records of the        court in a locked file; and                 The adoptive parents or adult adoptee can receive limited        information that does not identify the biological parents.               Areas that differ from state to state include:                 Who is required to consent to an adoption--for example,        the mother, father, agency, and adoptee;                 When and how consent may be executed and revoked;                 Who may adopt, who may be adopted, and who may place        a child for adoption;                 Whether the state has a putative father registry, information        contained in the registry, revocation of information contained in the registry,        notice requirements of registered putative fathers, and who has access to        the registry;                 Whether and how the state regulates fees and expenses        such as birth parent expenses, agency fees and costs, intermediary fees,        payments for relinquishing a child, and state agency fees; and                 The specifics of how and to what extent the state recognizes        a foreign adoption.              2001 Legislation      Senate Bill No. 2252 increased from $1,000 to $1,750 the long-form income      tax deduction for adoption expenses and allowed the deduction to be carried      forward for up to five taxable years. The bill also allowed a deduction from      federal income tax liability on the short-form individual income tax return      in the amount of the taxpayer's federal qualified adoption expenses credit,      not exceeding $1,750.     Previous Legislation      In 1999 Senate Bill No. 2171 implemented the federal Adoption and Safe Families      Act of 1997 and amended the adoption procedures statute to require that the      reports and assessments of adoptive parents include a criminal history record      investigation. The federal law affected the adoption of foster children and      redefined ""reasonable efforts,"" ""case plans,"" and ""reviews""      for purposes of foster care adoptions; addressed termination of parental rights      for foster care children; provided who must be given notice of foster care      adoption proceedings; changed the timeframe for permanency planning hearings      for foster care children; and limited the time for reunification services      for foster care children.      In 1999 Senate Bill No. 2388 provided that under certain circumstances,      the court may waive the adoption investigation and report requirements for      an adopting party who is a grandparent, brother, sister, stepbrother, stepsister,      uncle, or aunt of an adoptee.      In 1993 House Bill No. 1107 updated the law pertaining to access to information      regarding genetic parents, siblings, and children.      In 1993 Senate Bill No. 2294 made changes to the notice requirements for      the adoption of an adult and provided the court with discretion to prevent      the parents of an adult adoptee from attending the adoption hearings and proceedings.     Testimony      The committee considered federal laws that directly impact adoption, including      the Intercountry Adoption Act of 2000, Child Citizenship Act of 2000, Adoption      and Safe Families Act of 1997, Multiethnic Placement Act of 1994, and the      Indian Child Welfare Act of 1978. As a result of the federal Adoption and      Safe Families Act of 1997, states were required to make substantial changes      in state law. In 1999 the North Dakota Legislative Assembly enacted Senate      Bill No. 2171 to implement the requirements of the Act. The committee received      testimony that although implementation of the federal Adoption and Safe Families      Act of 1997 was a substantial burden on the state as an unfunded mandate,      the Act has been very successful in improving appropriate and timely placement      of foster children.      The committee received information regarding adoption statistics for North      Dakota. There are six child-placing agencies in the state, all of which have      been licensed for many years. In fiscal year 2001 there were 181 agency-facilitated      adoptions, of which 113 were adoptions of children with special needs, 19      were adoptions of foreign-born children, and 49 were adoptions of healthy      infants, and there were an additional 155 stepchildren adopted by their stepparents.      In addition to the total number of agency-facilitated finalized adoptions      increasing, the number of finalized adoptions of children with special needs      has increased significantly--44 in 1998, 61 in 1999, 40 in 2000, and 113 in      2001. In calendar year 2000 the Turtle Mountain Tribe adjudicated 20 adoptions      through the tribe's affiliation with the AASK program.      A representative of the Department of Human Services Division of Child and      Family Services testified that North Dakota law is very restrictive in how      it treats the placement of a child with an adoptive family before the termination      of the biological parents' rights and is very restrictive in how it treats      the openness of adoption information.       The committee received testimony that recent legislative activities in other      states have included:                 Openness in adoption and the desire of adult adoptees        to open previously sealed records;                 Passive adoption search registries;                 Legal risk adoption practices;                 Adoption facilitation;                 Statutory limitations of fees;                 Putative father registries;                 Limitations on advertising; and                 Criminal background history investigations.               During the course of the study, the committee received proposed bill drafts      from an informal task force of licensed child-placing agency representatives      which discussed adoption laws. With the exception of the task force's proposed      bill draft regarding child-placing agencies, which was the final proposal      presented to the committee, the task force shared its work product with adopted      individuals, birth parents, and adoptive parents in order to receive feedback.      The task force initially made the following recommendations of areas in      need of being addressed:                 Openness of adoption records;                 Sealed birth certificates;                 Adoption search and disclosure;                 Father registries;                 Statutory limitations on fees paid to birth parents        and paid for adoption services;                 Statutory limitations on adoption facilitation and advertisement;                 Definition of special needs children;                 Child-placing agency licensure;                 Increasing statutory references to the Indian Child        Welfare Act; and                 Discrimination relating to employment benefits for adoptive        parents.               Ultimately the task force presented to the committee six proposed bill drafts      relating to the state's version of the Revised Uniform Adoption Act, child      relinquishment to identified adoptive parents, the state's version of the      Uniform Parentage Act, creation of a paternity registry, assistance for adopted      children with special needs, and licensure of child-placing agencies. In addition      to the six proposed bill drafts presented to the committee, the task force      recommended legislative action to align the provisions of the North Dakota      Century Code (NDCC) relating to relinquishment of parental rights.     Revised Uniform Adoption Act - NDCC Chapter14-15      The task force presented a bill draft amending NDCC Chapter 14-15, the Revised      Uniform Adoption Act. A member of the task force testified that the bill draft:                 Creates definitions for the terms ""abandonment,""        ""department,"" ""identifying information,"" ""investigation,""        and ""stepparent.""                 Provides that a petition for adoption and a report filed        by the petitioner must state that the petitioner's expenses were reasonable,        and gives guidance to what types of fees may be reasonable or unreasonable.                 Provides that a court shall make a finding as to the        reasonableness of fees paid by the petitioner.                 Clarifies the residency requirements as they apply to        various adoption situations.                 Provides that a reasonable fee may be charged for furnishing        nonidentifying information.                 Clarifies that identifying and nonidentifying information        may be shared between consenting parties to the adoption.                 Removes the search prohibition of birth parents and        birth siblings in the case of involuntary adoptions.                 Provides that an adult child of a deceased adopted individual        may initiate a search for identifying and nonidentifying information.                 Provides that a nonconsenting party may not stop the        disclosure of information between consenting individuals.                 Provides the Department of Human Services may share        adoption information with an Indian tribe to determine the eligibility of        the adopted individual for enrollment in an Indian tribe.                 Removes the ten-day withdrawal period for relinquishment        of a birth parent's parental rights.                The committee was informed the provisions in the bill draft which deal with      the reasonableness of expenses of a petitioner were very loosely patterned      on Minnesota's law. A member of the task force testified that although in      practice it may be difficult for a court to deal with unreasonable expenses      after the expenses were already paid, the court has discretion to deny unreasonable      expenses or take other appropriate action.      Current adoption law provides that if an adopted individual seeks identifying      information regarding birth parents, refusal of one birth parent to consent      to disclosure has the effect of prohibiting disclosure regardless of whether      the second birth parent consents to disclosure of identifying information.      Members of the task force testified that North Dakota's law regarding openness      of adoption information is very restrictive, and the bill draft makes North      Dakota's law more consistent with the trend of more openness in access to      adoption information.      The committee received testimony from an adopted individual, in support      of increasing the openness of adoption records. Information was presented      indicating that opening adoption records would not negatively affect adoption      rates and would not increase abortion, based on statistics from Alaska and      Kansas. Additionally, the committee received testimony from a birth mother      who placed her child for adoption, in support of increasing openness of adoption      records, stating that the state's laws are outdated. The committee reviewed      the adoption laws of North Dakota and other states regarding access to birth      certificates, identifying information, and nonidentifying information.      The committee received testimony from representatives of child-placing agencies      regarding the procedure followed, costs associated with, and services offered      by child-placing agencies in searching for identifying and for unidentifying      adoptive information. The representatives expressed the importance of providing      counseling and other services in assisting in searching for and disclosing      adoption information.     Child Relinquishment to Identified Adoptive Parents- NDCC Chapter 14-15.1      The task force presented a bill draft amending NDCC Chapter 14-15.1 relating      to child relinquishment to identified adoptive parents. A member of the task      force testified that the bill draft:                 Provides that a report filed by the petitioner may reflect        that reasonable fees were paid. This language is consistent with the language        in the bill draft amending Chapter 14-15.                 Provides that a court shall make a finding as to fees        paid.                 Extends the time for filing of a petition for adoption        from three months to six months, to be consistent with the residency requirements        of the bill draft amending Chapter 14-15.               Uniform Parentage Act - NDCC Chapter 14-17      The task force presented a bill draft amending NDCC Chapter 14-17, the Uniform      Parentage Act. The bill draft changes the terms ""natural mother,""      ""natural father,"" and ""natural parent"" to biological mother,      biological father, and biological parent. The change in terms is not intended      to be substantive.     Paternity Registry - NDCC Title 14      The task force presented a bill draft creating a new chapter to NDCC Title      14 creating a paternity registry. A member of the task force testified that      the bill draft:                 Provides that the State Department of Health Office        of Statistical Services shall establish and administer a paternity registry,        with which a man may claim that he may have fathered a child.                 Provides the purpose of the paternity registry is:              To expedite adoptions of children whose biological fathers        are unwilling to assume parental responsibility of their children by registering        with the registry or otherwise acknowledging their children; and         To protect the parental rights of biological fathers        who affirmatively assume responsibility for children they may have fathered.                       Provides that by registering with the paternity registry,        a putative father is entitled to notice of an action to terminate his parental        rights.                 Provides that a man is not required to register with        the paternity registry in order to assert paternity or receive notice of        a termination of parental rights action if he:              Is the presumed father under NDCC Chapter14-17;        Has been adjudicated to be the biological father of        a child; or        Has filed an acknowledgment of paternity under NDCC        Chapter 14-17 or 14-19.                       Provides that the paternity registry does not relieve        a mother of any obligation to identify the known father of her child.               A member of the task force testified that the paternity registry bill draft      was an attempt by the task force to use the best practices of other states      that have paternity registries. Approximately 21 states provide for some sort      of paternity registry. The committee received testimony that the registry      is not intended to remove the obligation of a child-placing agency to request      information regarding the identity and location of the biological father.     Assistance for Adopted Children With Special Needs- NDCC Section 50-09-02.2      The task force presented a bill draft amending NDCC Section 50-09-02.2 regarding      assistance for adopted children with special needs. A member of the task force      testified that the bill draft expands the definition of a child with special      needs to include a child who is at high risk for a physical, mental, or emotional      disability due to the circumstances of birth, deprivation in developmental      years, or the birth parent having a medical or social history. Current law      requires that a determination of handicap be made before the classification      as a special needs child. The effect of the bill draft is to expand the class      of children who could be classified as special needs.       The committee received testimony that the need for expanding the definition      of special needs children results in part from the fact that as children are      being placed in foster care more quickly and at a younger age, it is more      likely that a child who is less than five years old has a physical, an emotional,      or a mental handicap that has not been diagnosed or recognized. By expanding      the definition of special needs children, the at-risk children would not necessarily      be given the full package of benefits associated with being classified as      a special needs child, but the classification would allow the adoptive parents      to sign a form that would clarify that assistance will be made available if      the child does exhibit a handicap at a later date, thereby letting adoptive      parents know that special services will be made available if the adopted child      develops a need for these services. Additionally, the committee received testimony      that by being classified as a special needs child, an adoptive family would      be able to access federal funds, which in the long run would save the state      money.     Child-Placing Agencies - NDCC Chapter 50-12      The task force presented a bill draft regarding the state's child-placing      agency law. A member of the task force testified that the bill draft:                 Removes the current annual child-placing agency licensure        requirement to allow for a two-year license for those agencies that are        in good standing and that also have an established history in the state.                 Codifies the current practice of allowing a child-placing        agency to consider all criminal background information when making a recommendation        in a home study report.                 Makes the procedures used in foster care placements        consistent with procedures used in adoption placements.                 Codifies the current department requirement that fees        charged by a child-placing agency must be related to documented expenses        of the agency.                 Provides a child-placing agency license may be revoked        for violation of Chapter 50-12.                 Adds permanent guardianship to the class of guardianships        that require that the Department of Human Services be notified if the guardianship        involves bringing the child into the state for the guardianship.                 Provides that the child-placing agency licensure requirements        extend to facilitator agencies that maintain lists of prospective adoptive        parents and birth parents to make matches for a fee.              Recommendations      The committee recommends six bills based on the bill drafts proposed by      the informal task force of licensed child-placing agency representatives discussing      adoption laws.      The committee recommends  House      Bill No. 1035  to amend the state's version of the Revised Uniform Adoption      Act as proposed by the task force.      The committee recommends  House      Bill No. 1036  to amend the law relating to child relinquishment to identified      adoptive parents as proposed by the task force.      The committee recommends  Senate      Bill No. 2034  to update the state's version of the Uniform Parentage Act      as proposed by the task force.      The committee recommends  Senate      Bill No. 2035  to create a paternity registry as proposed by the task force.      The committee recommends  Senate      Bill No. 2036  to broaden the class of children eligible for certification      as a special needs adoption as proposed by the task force.      The committee recommends  House      Bill No. 1037  to amend the child-placing agency licensure laws as proposed      by the task force.      PRIVACY LAW STUDY      Senate Concurrent Resolution No. 4019 provided for a study of the medical      and financial privacy laws in the state; the effectiveness of medical and      financial privacy laws in other states; the interaction of federal and state      medical and financial privacy laws; and whether current medical and financial      privacy protections meet the reasonable expectations of the citizens of this      state.      The study resolution was adopted and prioritized before the referral petition      on 2001 Senate Bill No. 2191 was filed with the Secretary of State. As a result      of the pending June 2002 referral vote, the committee's focus on the financial      portion of the privacy study was information gathering on the impact of 2001      Senate Bill No.2191 on privacy and economic development; the possible privacy      and economic development impacts of approval or rejection of the referred      measure; and of the privacy provisions of the federal Financial Services Modernization      Act of 1999, which is also known as the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act. Additionally,      the committee reviewed an Attorney General's opinion dated May 22, 2002, addressing      certain elements of the state's financial privacy law.       The medical privacy aspect of the study focused on the impact of implementation      of the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accessibility Act (HIPAA).     Background      The 57th Legislative Assembly passed seven bills concerning access to personal      or financial information. House Bill No. 1082 provided that if the Commissioner      of Financial Institutions furnishes confidential information to a third party      authorized to receive that information, the information remains confidential      in the possession of the third party, and likewise, if the commissioner receives      confidential information, that information remains confidential in the possession      of the commissioner. The bill also expanded the persons to whom the commissioner      may furnish information and may enter sharing agreements to include the Insurance      Commissioner and the Securities Commissioner.      House Bill No. 1234 provided that a medical release is valid for three years      or the time specified in the release, whichever is less. The bill also allowed      for termination of the release at any time and allows a provider to share      medical information with another provider during the time necessary to complete      a course of treatment.      House Bill No. 1329 provided a financial institution may disclose customer      information for the purposes of reporting suspected exploitation of a disabled      adult or vulnerable elderly adult.      Senate Bill No. 2065 required a North Dakota federally chartered corporate      credit union to allow the Commissioner of Financial Institutions to access      records and sets a rate of reimbursement for the credit unions for searching      and processing records.      Senate Bill No. 2117 provided a definition of customer as it pertains to      the sharing of commercial or financial customer information by the Bank of      North Dakota.      Senate Bill No. 2127 provided that insurance companies, nonprofit health      service corporations, and health maintenance organizations are required to      comply with the privacy provisions of Title V of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act.      Additionally, the bill allows the Insurance Commissioner to adopt rules to      implement the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act if the rules are consistent with and      not more restrictive than the model regulation adopted by the National Association      of Insurance Commissioners.      Senate Bill No. 2191 provided that the state's statutory provisions relating      to the disclosure by financial institutions of customer information are not      applicable if a disclosure is subject to federal law and the financial institution      complies with the federal law. The bill also provided temporary disclosure      requirements applicable to agricultural and commercial customers of financial      institutions, effective through July 31, 2003. This bill became void, effective      June 11, 2002, as a result of the referral vote, referred to previously in      this report.     Financial Privacy Testimony      Before the June 2002 referral vote on 2001 Senate Bill No. 2191, the committee      reviewed recent financial privacy legislation across the country; reviewed      the privacy provisions of the federal Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act; considered the      legality and desirability of introducing financial privacy legislation during      the special session of the 57th Legislative Assembly held for the purpose      of redistricting; and received testimony from a wide variety of persons interested      in financial privacy.      In addition to addressing the impact on banks and credit unions of the privacy      provisions of the federal Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, the committee received testimony      from a representative of the State Bar Association of North Dakota regarding      the possible impact of the federal law on lawyers and from a representative      of the Insurance Commissioner regarding the commissioner's activities related      to compliance with the federal Act.      After the June 2002 referral vote, the committee focused on the interpretation      of the state's financial privacy law and the desirability of recommending      legislation to amend the state's financial privacy law. The committee did      not receive testimony advocating changing from opt-in authorization to opt-out      authorization for the sharing of customer information by financial institutions;      however, testimony received from representatives of the North Dakota Bankers      Association, the Commissioner of Financial Institutions, representatives of      the Independent Community Banks of North Dakota, a representative of Community      First Bankshares, and a representative of the North Dakota Credit Union League      testified in support of legislative changes ranging from clarification of      existing law to incorporating all of the exceptions of the federal Gramm-Leach-Bliley      Act. Additionally, the committee received testimony from representatives of      Protect Our Privacy, the sponsoring committee for the referral of Senate Bill      No. 2191, in support of amending the state's financial privacy law to prohibit      affiliate sharing of customer information by financial institutions; in support      of increasing medical privacy, insurance privacy, and securities privacy;      and in support of increasing limitations on government sharing of information.      In a financial privacy matter unrelated to the federal Gramm-Leach-Bliley      Act, the committee reviewed the laws of Washington and California regarding      limiting the information that may be included on an electronically printed      credit card receipt.     Insurance Privacy      The committee received an update from a representative of the Insurance      Commissioner regarding the status of the commissioner's financial privacy      administrative rules. The committee reviewed the proposed administrative rules      of the commissioner.      The Insurance Commissioner's rules went into effect December 1, 2001, and      were based on the National Association of Insurance Commissioners model regulations,      providing an opt-out provision for financial information and an opt-in provision      for health information. The referral of Senate Bill No. 2191 did not affect      the Insurance Department's administrative rules on privacy.      A representative of Protect Our Privacy testified in support of increasing      customer insurance privacy by requiring opt-in authorization for the sharing      of customer information by insurance companies.      Lawyer Privacy      A representative of the State Bar Association of North Dakota testified      regarding the possible applicability of the federal Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act      to lawyers. The committee was informed that the Federal Trade Commission had      taken the position that law firms and sole practitioners ""significantly      engaged in financial activities"" are considered financial institutions      and are therefore subject to the provisions of the Act. The American Bar Association      had requested the Federal Trade Commission to exempt the legal community from      the Act. On April 8, 2002, the Federal Trade Commission informed the American      Bar Association of the commission's determination not to grant the exemption      requested. On September 25, 2002, the American Bar Association filed suit      to end the imposition of the privacy provisions of the Act.     Banking and Credit Union Privacy      Following the June 2002 referral vote, the committee received extensive      testimony from persons interested in the financial privacy study. Testimony      focused on the scope and interpretation of the state's financial privacy law      and whether it was desirable to clarify or substantively change the state's      financial privacy law.      Representatives of Protect Our Privacy testified in opposition to making      any changes to the state's financial privacy law which would make it easier      for financial institutions to disclose a customer's information. Protect Our      Privacy supported treating all North Dakota-chartered financial institutions      identically, regardless of physical location, and treating all customers who      do business with North Dakota-chartered financial institutions identically,      regardless of the customer's state of residence.      The committee received testimony from representatives of financial institutions      regarding areas of the state's financial privacy law which would benefit from      clarification, including clarification of the definitions of financial institution,      customer, and agent. Clarification of the terms ""financial institution""      and ""customer"" would help to clarify the scope and reach of the      state's law. Additionally, testimony was received that the state's law may      not be clear regarding whether an agent of a financial institution has a duty      of maintaining the confidentiality of customer information.      The issue of clarification of definitions in large part focused on the scope      of the state's financial privacy law and whether the state's law was exported      to out-of-state financial institutions and out-of-state customers.      A representative of the North Dakota Bankers Association testified that      a definition of customer which included out-of-state customers and a definition      of financial institution which included those institutions that are physically      located outside the state would disadvantage North Dakota financial institutions      that have out-of-state facilities and may negatively affect North Dakota banks      such as Community First Bankshares and US Bank, which have a majority of their      customers out-of-state.      The committee received testimony from the Commissioner of Financial Institutions      regarding the Attorney General's opinion dated May 22, 2002, which addressed      some of the issues concerning how the state's financial privacy law will be      applied to financial institutions. The commissioner testified that the opinion      leaves some questions regarding the exportation of the state's law unanswered.      The following is how the Attorney General addressed financial privacy in      his May 22, 2002, opinion:                 What qualifies as an ""agent of a financial institution""        as that term is used in NDCC Section 6-08.1-02(1)?              An entity acting for a financial institution in providing        services to the financial institution's customers pursuant to a contract        is an agent of the financial institution, regardless of how the parties        characterize their relationship.                       If 2001 Senate Bill No. 2191 is rejected by the voters        pursuant to the pending referral, may a financial institution subject to        NDCC Chapter6-08.1 disclose customer information without a customer's express        consent as necessary in the course of providing the customer a service inherent        in the business of financial institutions either directly or through a third        party?              A financial institution is not required to obtain a        customer's affirmative consent to share information with the financial institution's        employees or agents in the course of providing services the customer requests,        including automated teller machine, credit card, and checking services,        regardless of whether Senate Bill No. 2191 is rejected.                       If Senate Bill No. 2191 is rejected, what financial        institutions will be subject to Chapter 6-08.1?              North Dakota Century Code Chapter 6-08.1 applies to        financial institutions physically located in North Dakota and how those        institutions treat the financial information of their customers located        in North Dakota. Chapter6-08.1 does not apply to financial institutions        located outside North Dakota and how those institutions treat the financial        information of their customers located outside North Dakota. Whether Chapter        6-08.1 applies to other transactions or relationships between financial        institutions and their customers depends on the resolution of a myriad of        factual circumstances.                       Which, if any, privacy provisions of the federal Gramm-Leach-Bliley        Act will apply to financial institutions subject to Chapter 6-08.1 if Senate        Bill No. 2191 is rejected?              If Senate Bill No. 2191 is rejected by voters, North        Dakota financial institutions will be required to comply with all of the        federal Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act provisions that are not specifically addressed        by Chapter 6-08.1. If a financial institution's customer has consented to        the financial institution's sharing of the customer's information, the financial        institution is required to comply with the federal Act's information protection        provisions in their entirety.               Extensive testimony was received regarding the uncertainty in the financial      industry over the circumstances in which a financial institution may share      customer information with a third party in the course of providing services      that a customer has requested or in the course of performing acts that are      perceived to be incidental powers necessary to carry on the business of a      credit union or bank. Suggestions received by the committee to deal with these      issues included:                 Taking no action, but relying on the May 22, 2002, Attorney        General opinion.                 Codifying the federal Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act exceptions        for marketing and servicing under Section 502(b)(2) of the Act and for general        operating under Section 502(e) of the Act; general operating under Section        502(e) of the Act; or limited general operating under Section 502(e)(1)        and (2).                The marketing and servicing exceptions under Section 502(b)(2) of the federal      Act allow financial institutions to disclose customer information to nonaffiliated      third parties to perform services on behalf of the financial institution.      The general operating exceptions under Section 502(e) allow financial institutions      to disclose customer information to nonaffiliated third parties if the disclosure      is necessary to effect, administer, or enforce a transaction requested or      authorized by the consumer in connection with servicing or processing a product,      service, or transaction requested or authorized by the consumer (502(e)(1));      is made with the consent or at the direction of the consumer (502(e)(2));      is made to protect against fraud; is made to a consumer-reporting agency;      is made in connection with a merger or sale of the financial institution;      is made to comply with a regulatory investigation; is made to lawyers and      auditors; and is made in other circumstances in which opt-out would not be      practical or expected to be provided.      Testimony received by the committee indicated that benefits of clarifying      the terminology and scope of the state's financial privacy law through legislation      may include decreased liability for financial institutions and the benefit      of having the Legislative Assembly make public policy decisions instead of      the State Banking Board, State Credit Union Board, Attorney General, or Supreme      Court.     Electronically Printed Credit Card Receipts      The committee reviewed the laws of Washington and California regarding limitations      on the information included on an electronically printed credit card receipt.      The laws of California and Washington are nearly identical and require that      electronically printed credit card receipts provided to a customer limit credit      card account information to no more than the last five digits of the credit      card number and do not include expiration information. Exceptions to these      laws include that the restrictions would not apply to transactions in which      the sole means of recording the customer's credit card number was by handwriting      or by an imprint copy of the credit card. The effective date of the laws varied      based on when the cash register was put into use in order to allow for an      appropriate transition period.     Financial Privacy Considerations      The committee considered a bill draft that would have incorporated all the      general operating exceptions under Section 502(e) of the federal Gramm-Leach-Bliley      Act. The bill draft also would have provided that a financial institution      that shared customer information with an affiliate or a nonaffiliated third      party would be required to enter a contract providing the affiliate or nonaffiliated      third party would keep the customer information confidential.      The committee considered a bill draft that would have limited the scope      of the state's financial privacy law to protection of customer information      of customers who reside or are domiciled in North Dakota.      Financial Privacy Recommendations      The committee recommends  House      Bill No. 1038  to provide that a customer is protected by the state's financial      privacy law, regardless of the state or residence or domicile and that the      state's financial privacy laws apply to financial institutions that are physically      located in the state. The bill also provides for incorporation into the state's      financial privacy law the federal Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act exception provisions      of Section 502(e)(1) and (2), allowing for sharing of customer information:                 As necessary to effect, administer, or enforce a transaction        that is requested or otherwise authorized by the customer;                 In connection with servicing or processing a financial        product or financial service that is requested or otherwise authorized by        the customer;                 In connection with maintaining or servicing the customer's        account with the financial institution;                 In connection with maintaining or servicing the customer's        account with another person as part of a private label credit card program        or as part of some other extension of credit on behalf of that other person;        or                  At the direction or with the consent of the customer.               The committee recommends  Senate      Bill No. 2037  to limit the credit card number information that may be      included on an electronically printed credit card receipt. The bill would      become operative on January 1, 2004, with respect to any cash register or      other machine or device that electronically prints receipts for credit card      transactions which is first put into use after December31, 2003, and would      become operative on January 1, 2007, with respect to any cash register or      other machine or device that electronically prints receipts for credit card      transactions which is first put into use before January 1, 2004.     Medical Privacy Testimony      The committee reviewed some of the extensive background and history of the      federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act and reviewed several      of the state laws pertaining to medical privacy. As in the federal Gramm-Leach-Bliley      Act, the privacy provisions are just one portion of the federal Health Insurance      Portability and Accountability Act.       The committee received testimony that the privacy provisions under the federal      Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act came about as the result      of administrative simplification that requires all health care insurers to      establish uniform billing and coding systems in order to simplify and reduce      the administrative costs of the health care system. Congress realized that      a uniform electronic billing system would greatly reduce the cost and increase      the capacity for accidental or intentional disclosure of individually identifiable      health information; therefore, Congress set a deadline for itself to enact      health care privacy legislation by August 1999. Congress also provided that      if that August 1999 deadline was not met, the Secretary of Health and Human      Services would be required to establish regulations to protect the privacy      and security of health information. Congress did not meet the 1999 deadline      and on December 28, 2000, the final rules on privacy of individually identifiable      health information were published. The compliance date for most organizations      is April 14, 2003; however, small insurers have an additional year to come      into compliance.      Under the Act, the privacy rules cover health plans, health care clearinghouses,      and those health care providers who conduct certain financial and administrative      transactions electronically. The privacy rules for the first time create national      standards to protect an individual's medical records and other personal health      information. The rules give patients more control over their health information;      set boundaries on the use and release of health records; establish appropriate      safeguards that health care providers and others must achieve to protect the      privacy of health information; hold violators accountable if they violate      patients' privacy rights; and strike a balance when public responsibility      requires disclosure of some forms of data.      A representative of the Attorney General's office reported that the federal      medical privacy rules require the average health care provider to:                 Provide information to patients about the patients'        privacy rights and how the patients' information may be used.                 Adopt clear privacy procedures for a provider, hospital,        or plan.                 Train employees so they understand privacy procedures.                 Designate an individual to be responsible for seeing        that the privacy procedures are adopted and followed.                 Secure patient records containing individual identifiable        health information so that they are not readily available to those who do        not need them.               The committee received testimony from a representative of the Department      of Human Services regarding the department's efforts to comply with the Act.      In addition to working with the Attorney General's office regarding compliance      with the Act, the Department of Human Services established a team of individuals      representing the payers, providers, and the Legal Services Division of the      department to analyze and complete the implementation of the privacy project.      The Department of Human Services privacy project was broken into the following      phases:                Review and understand the privacy rules and compare        these with current state and federal regulations to determine which apply.                Complete an inventory of areas within the department        which have protected health information and determine areas of information        sharing internally and externally.                Analyze this data to determine areas that will require        business associate agreements and determine the minimum amount required        to accomplish the intended purpose of the use or disclosure.                Analyze policies and procedures and modify those that        do not meet the privacy rule standards.                Analyze current practices concerning the use of protected        health information and provide training on the new privacy standards and        the rules and regulations regarding privacy to ensure future practice meets        the privacy standards.                Develop and execute business associate agreements with        entities with which the department shares information.                Implement a complaint process and ongoing monitoring.              Representatives of Blue Cross Blue Shield of North Dakota testified regarding      the undertaking of complying with the federal medical and financial privacy      laws. The committee was informed that the costs associated with complying      with the federal privacy requirements would be borne by the individual members      of Blue Cross Blue Shield of North Dakota. Because the costs would be added      to insurance premiums and because of the complexity and the resources required      to comply with the federal privacy laws, Blue Cross Blue Shield testified      in opposition to any new medical privacy legislation, especially until the      federal requirements are fully implemented.      A representative of the Attorney General's office reported that the Attorney      General's office, as part of an informal group known as the North Dakota HIPAA      Coalition, was comparing North Dakota law to the federal privacy laws under      the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act to determine whether      state law provides less privacy protection than the federal privacy law, the      same protection as the federal privacy law, or more privacy protection than      the federal privacy law. The nature of the Health Insurance Portability and      Accountability Act is that if a state law provides less privacy protection      than the federal privacy law, the state law is superseded by the federal privacy      law; if state law provides the same privacy protection as the federal privacy      law, then a covered entity can comply with both North Dakota law and the federal      privacy law; and if a state law provides greater privacy protection than the      federal privacy law, the parties must conform to the higher privacy provisions      under state law.       The membership of the North Dakota HIPAA Coalition includes representation      from government agencies, associations representing health care providers,      individual hospitals and clinics, and health insurers. A representative of      the Attorney General's office reported that based on the analysis of the results      once the evaluation of state medical privacy laws is completed, the Attorney      General would propose to the 58th Legislative Assembly any necessary bill      for the state to comply with the federal privacy law.      In addition to receiving testimony from interested persons regarding federal      privacy law implementation efforts and receiving updates on the status of      the North Dakota HIPAA Coalition's review of the state's medical privacy laws,      the committee received testimony regarding medical privacy issues that may      arise in the case of a pharmacy that maintains at the check-out counter a      customer log of prescriptions that have been picked up, and the committee      received testimony regarding medical privacy choice-of-law issues that could      arise based on the residency of a patient and the location of a medical provider.          The committee received testimony that questions of how the federal Health      Insurance Portability and Accountability Act and state privacy laws impact      the care of nonresident patients relate to conflicts-of-law matters or choice-of-law      matters. The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act regulations      regarding preemption of state law do not directly address the issue of which      state's law may apply. Some health care facilities follow the practice that      the privacy laws of the place in which the health care facility is located      determine the medical privacy rights of the patient; however, it is possible      that some health care providers may choose to protect the confidentiality      of medical information based on the law of the state in which the patient      resides. A representative of the Attorney General's office stated it would      be helpful to have federal clarification regarding which state's privacy laws      would apply in the case of a resident of one state receiving medical care      in a different state.     Medical Privacy Conclusion      The committee makes no recommendation with respect to the medical privacy      portion of its study of privacy.                «   Back         Top                                                                                             [  Frequently Asked Questions  ] [  Contact Us  ] [  Home  ] [  Disclaimer and Privacy Statement  ]"

The rights and obligations of the parties as to matters within the jurisdiction of this state shall be determined as though the decree or order were issued by a court of this state.    1-109.  TERMINATION OF ORDERS AND AGREEMENTS FOR                  VISITATION OR COMMUNICATION UPON ADOPTION    When a decree of adoption becomes final, except as provided in Article 4, any order or agreement for visitation or communication with the minor shall be unenforceable.    1-110.

(c)  If inquiry pursuant to subsection (b) identifies any man who is entitled to notice under section 3-401, the court shall require notice of the proceeding to be given to him pursuant to section 3-403.    (d)  If, in an inquiry pursuant to this section, the woman who gave birth to the minor adoptee fails to disclose the identity of a possible father or reveal his whereabouts, she shall be advised that the proceeding for adoption may be delayed or subject to challenge if a possible father is not given notice of the proceeding and thatthe lack of information about the father's medical and genetic history will be detrimental to the adoptee.    3-405.  WAIVER OF NOTICE    (a)  A person entitled to receive notice required under this part may waive the notice before the court or in a consent, relinquishment, or other written document signed by the person or on behalf of the person.    (b)  Except as provided in subsection (c), a person who has waived the requisite notice is not required to appear in the adoption proceeding.    (c)  A parent who has executed a consent or relinquishment containing a waiver of notice may appear in the adoption proceeding for the limited purpose of moving to set aside the consent or relinquishment on the ground that it was obtained by fraud or coercion or for purposes as the court may permit as necessary to determine whether or not to grant the petition.    3-406.

PART 5.  PETITION TO TERMINATE RELATIONSHIP   BETWEEN PARENT AND CHILD    3-501.  AUTHORIZATION    A petition to terminate the relationship between a parent or an alleged parent and a minor child may be filed in a proceeding for adoption under this title by:     (1)  a parent or a guardian who has selected a prospective adoptive parent for a minor and who intends to place, or has placed, the minor with that person;     (2)  a parent whose spouse has filed a petition under Article 4 to adopt the parent's minor child;     (3)  a prospective adoptive parent of the minor who has filed a petition to adopt under this article or Article 4; or     (4)  an agency that has selected a prospective adoptive parent for the minor andintends to place, or has placed, the minor with that person.    3-502.  TIME AND CONTENT OF PETITION    (a)  A petition under this part may be filed at any time before entry of a decree of adoption.    (b)  The petition shall be signed and verified by the petitioner, filed with the court, and state:     (1)  the name and address of the petitioner;     (2)  the name of the minor;     (3)  the name and last known address of the parent or alleged parent whose parental relationship the petitioner seeks to terminate;     (4)  the facts and circumstances forming the basis for the petition and the grounds on which termination of a parental relationship is sought;     (5)  if the petitioner is a prospective adoptive parent, that the petitioner intends to proceed with the petition to adopt the minor if the petition to terminate is granted; and     (6)  if the petitioner is a parent, a guardian, or an agency, that the petitioner has placed or intends to place the minor for adoption.    3-503.  SERVICE OF PETITION AND NOTICE    (a)  A petition to terminate under this part and a notice of hearing on the petition shall be served upon the respondent in the manner prescribed in section 3-403.    (b)  The notice of a hearing shall inform the respondent of the method for responding and that:     (1)  the respondent has a right to be represented by an attorney, and may be entitled to have an attorney appointed by the court; and     (2)  if the respondent fails to respond within 20 days after service and, in the case of an alleged father, fails to file a claim of paternity within 20 days after service unless a claim of paternity is pending, the respondent may not appear in or receive further notice of the proceeding for adoption or termination and that the failure to respond will result in termination of the relationship of parent and child between the respondent and the minor unless the proceeding for adoption is dismissed.    3-504.  GROUNDS FOR TERMINATING RELATIONSHIP OF PARENT                  AND CHILD    (a)  If a respondent answers or appears at the hearing and asserts parental rights, the court shall proceed with the hearing expeditiously.  If the court finds, upon clear and convincing evidence, that any one of the following grounds exists and that termination is in the best interest of the minor, the court shall order the termination of any parental relationship of the respondent to the minor:     (1)  In the case of a minor under the age of six months at the time the petition is filed, the respondent did not exercise parental responsibility once he or she knew or should have known of the minor's birth or expected birth.  In making a determination under this subdivision, the court shall consider all relevant factors, which may include the respondent’s failure to:      (A)  pay reasonable prenatal, natal, and postnatal expenses in accordance with his or her financial means;      (B)  make reasonable and consistent payments, in accordance with his or her financial means, for the support of the minor;      (C)  regularly communicate or visit with the minor; or      (D)  manifest an ability and willingness to assume legal and physical custody of the minor.     (2)  In the case of a minor over the age of six months at the time the petition is filed, the respondent did not exercise parental responsibility for a period of at least six months immediately preceding the filing of the petition.  In making a determination under this subdivision, the court shall consider all relevant factors, which may include the respondent’s failure to:      (A)  make reasonable and consistent payments, in accordance with his or her financial means, for the support of the minor, although legally obligated to do so;      (B)  regularly communicate or visit with the minor; or      (C)  during any time the minor was not in the physical custody of the other parent, to manifest an ability and willingness to assume legal and physical custody ofthe minor.     (3)  The respondent has been convicted of a crime of violence or has been found by a court of competent jurisdiction to have committed an act of violence which violated a restraining or protective order, and the facts of the crime or violation indicate that the respondent is unfit to maintain a relationship of parent and child with the minor.    (b)  If the respondent has proved by a preponderance of the evidence that he or she had good cause for not complying with subdivision (a)(1) or (2) or that, for compelling reasons, termination is not justified under subdivision (a)(3), the court may not terminate the respondent's parental rights to a minor except upon a finding by clear and convincing evidence that any one of the following grounds exists and that termination is in the best interest of the minor:     (1)  Once the respondent no longer had good cause for not complying with the requirements of subdivision (a)(1) or (2), he or she failed to assume parental responsibilities as promptly and fully as circumstances permitted.     (2)  The respondent, after being afforded a reasonable opportunity to do so, would not have the ability and disposition to:      (A)  provide the child with love, affection and guidance;      (B)  meet the child's present and future physical and emotional needs; or      (C)  provide the child with adequate food, clothing, medical care, other material needs, education, and a safe environment.     (3)  At the time of the hearing the respondent has a relationship with another person who would significantly and adversely affect the child.     (4)  Placing the minor in the respondent's legal or physical custody would pose a risk of substantial harm to the physical or psychological well-being of the minor because the circumstances of the minor's conception, or the respondent's behavior during the pregnancy or since the minor's birth indicates that he or she is unfit to maintain a relationship of parent and child with the minor.    (c)  At the time of the hearing under this section the court shall consider the bestinterests of the child in accordance with the following criteria:     (1)  the likelihood that the respondent will be able to assume or resume his or her parental duties within a reasonable period of time;     (2)  the child's adjustment to his or her home, school, and community;     (3)  the interaction and interrelationship of the child with his or her parents, siblings, and any other person who may significantly affect the child's best interests; and     (4)  whether the parent or alleged parent has played and continues to play a constructive role, including personal contact and demonstrated love and affection, in the child's welfare.    (d)  If the respondent does not answer or appear or, in the case of an alleged father, file a claim of paternity as provided in subdivision 3-503(b)(2), or cannot be notified because the person's identity or whereabouts is unknown, the court may order the termination of any parental relationship to the minor.    3-505.  EFFECT OF ORDER GRANTING PETITION    (a)  An order issued under this part granting the petition:     (1)  terminates the relationship of parent and child between the respondent and the minor;     (2)  extinguishes any right the respondent had to withhold consent to a proposed adoption of the minor or to further notice of a proceeding for adoption; and     (3)  is a final order for purposes of appeal.    (b)  An order issued under this part granting the petition shall not terminate an obligation for arrearages of child support.    3-506.  EFFECT OF ORDER DENYING PETITION    (a)  If the court fails to find a ground stated in section 3-504 for terminating a relationship of parent and child, the court shall deny the petition to terminate and enter an order as follows:     (1)  if the parent who was not the subject of the petition executed a consent or relinquishment contingent upon termination of the other parent's relationship of parentand child, the court shall set aside the consent or relinquishment, and make an order determining the temporary physical custody of the child pursuant to sections 2-408 and 2-409; or     (2)  if the parent's consent or relinquishment was not contingent, shall terminate the adoption proceeding and grant legal and physical custody of the minor to the parent who was the subject of the petition, unless the court finds by clear and convincing evidence that the prospective adoptive parent has been the primary care provider of the child for such a period of time that the harm to the child occasioned by a change in custody would likely be greater than the harm occasioned by not being parented by the parent who was the subject of the petition.  In making this determination, it shall be a rebuttable presumption that it is in the best interest of the minor to be parented by the parent.  Under such circumstances and notwithstanding any other provision of law, the court may make a visitation order as provided in section 4-112 of this title.    (b)  An order issued under this part denying a petition to terminate a relationship of parent and child is a final order for purposes of appeal.   PART 6.  EVALUATION OF ADOPTEE AND   PROSPECTIVE ADOPTIVE PARENT    3-601.  EVALUATION DURING PROCEEDING FOR ADOPTION    (a)  Not later than five days after a complete petition for adoption of a minor is filed, the court shall order that an evaluation be made by:     (1)  a qualified employee of the agency that placed the minor for adoption; or     (2)  in a direct placement adoption, the person who made the placement evaluation or another person qualified under section 2-202.    (b)  The court shall provide the evaluator with a copy of the petition for adoption and copies of relevant items filed with the petition.    3-602.  CONTENT OF POST PLACEMENT EVALUATION    (a)  An evaluation shall be based on a personal interview with the petitioner in the petitioner's residence and observation of the relationship between the minor adopteeand the petitioner.    (b)  An evaluation shall be in writing and contain:     (1)  an account of any change in the petitioner's marital status or family history, physical or mental health, home environment, property, income, or financial obligations since the filing of the preplacement evaluation;     (2)  all reasonably available information concerning the physical, mental, and emotional condition of the minor adoptee which is not included in any report on the minor's health, genetic, and social history filed in the proceeding for adoption;     (3)  copies of any court order, judgment, decree, or pending legal proceeding affecting the minor adoptee, the petitioner, or any child of the petitioner;     (4)  any behavior or characteristics of the petitioner which raise a concern, as described in section 2-204(a); and     (5)  a recommendation concerning the granting of the petition for adoption.    3-603.  TIME AND FILING OF EVALUATION    (a)  The evaluator shall complete a written evaluation and file it with the court within 60 days after receipt of the court's order for an evaluation, unless the court for good cause allows a later filing.    (b)  If an evaluation produces a concern, as described in section 2-204(a), the evaluation shall be filed immediately, and shall explain why the concern poses a risk of harm to the physical or psychological well-being of the minor.    (c)  An evaluator shall give the petitioner a copy of an evaluation when filed with the court and for two years shall retain a copy and a list of every source for each item of information in the evaluation.    (d)  A person who prepares an evaluation may charge a reasonable fee based on the time spent in conducting and writing the evaluation.    (e)  An evaluation fee is subject to review by the court.   PART 7.  DISPOSITIONAL HEARING; DECREE OF ADOPTION    3-701.  TIME FOR HEARING ON PETITION    The hearing on the petition shall take place no sooner than 180 days after the minorhas been placed in the home of the adopting parent.

The accounting shall include the date and amount of each payment or disbursement made, the name and address of each recipient, and the purpose of each payment or disbursement;     (2)  the attorney for a petitioner, parent or guardian shall file with the court an affidavit itemizing any fee, compensation, or other thing of value received by, or agreed to be paid to, the attorney incidental to the placement and adoption of the minor; and     (3)  if an agency or guardian placed the minor for adoption, the agency or guardian shall file with the court an affidavit itemizing any fee, compensation, or other thing of value received by the agency for, or incidental to, the placement and adoption of the minor.    3-703.  GRANTING PETITION FOR ADOPTION    (a)  The court shall grant a petition for adoption if it determines by a preponderance of the evidence that the adoption will be in the best interest of the minor, and that:     (1)  the adoptee has been in the physical custody of the petitioner for at least 180 days unless the court for good cause shown waives this requirement;     (2)  notice of the proceeding for adoption has been served or dispensed with as to any person entitled to receive notice under Part 4;     (3)  every necessary consent, relinquishment, waiver, disclaimer of paternal interest, judicial order terminating parental rights, including an order issued under Part 5, or other document has been obtained and filed with the court;     (4)  any evaluation required by this title has been filed with and considered by thecourt;     (5)  the petitioner is a suitable adoptive parent for the minor;     (6)  if applicable, any requirement of this title governing an interstate or intercountry placement for adoption has been met;     (7)  the Indian Child Welfare Act, 25 U.S.C.  1901 et seq., is not applicable to the proceeding or, if applicable, its requirements have been met;     (8)  an accounting and affidavit required by section 3-702 has been reviewed by the court, and the court has denied, modified, or ordered reimbursement of any payment or disbursement that is not authorized by Article 7 or is unreasonable or unnecessary when compared with the expenses customarily incurred in connection with an adoption; and     (9)  the petitioner has received each report required by section 2-105.

(b)  For good cause shown, a court may allow a person who does not meet the requirements of subdivisions (a)(1) through (4), but has the consent of the custodial parent of a minor to file a petition for adoption under this article.  A petition allowed under this subsection shall be treated as if the petitioner were a stepparent.    (c)  A petition for adoption by a stepparent may be joined with a petition under Article 3, Part 5, to terminate the relationship of parent and child between a minor adoptee and the adoptee's parent who is not the stepparent's spouse.    4-102.  LEGAL CONSEQUENCES OF ADOPTION OF STEPCHILD    (a)  Except as otherwise provided in subsections (b) and (c), the legal consequences of an adoption of a stepchild by a stepparent are the same as under sections 1-103 through 1-106.

(c)  Failure to comply with an agreement or order for visitation or communication is not a ground for challenging the validity of an adoption by a stepparent.    4-103.

(b)  In addition to the penalties provided in subsection (a), a person who is the subject of information contained in a record made confidential by this title may file an action fordamages or equitable relief against any person who obtains unauthorized information or who discloses unauthorized information, or is likely to do so.    7-103.  LAWFUL PAYMENTS RELATED TO ADOPTION    (a)  Subject to the requirements of sections 3-702 and 3-703 for an accounting and judicial approval of fees and charges related to an adoption, an adoptive parent, or a person acting on behalf of an adoptive parent, may pay the reasonable and actual fee or charge for:     (1)  the services of an agency in connection with an adoption;     (2)  medical, hospital, nursing, pharmaceutical, or other similar expenses incurred by a mother or her minor child in connection with prenatal care or the birth or any illness of the minor;     (3)  counseling services for a parent or a minor for a reasonable time before and after the minor's placement for adoption;     (4)  living expenses of a mother for a reasonable time before the birth of her child and for no more than six weeks after the birth;     (5)  expenses incurred in ascertaining the information required by section 2-105;     (6)  expenses incurred for legal services, court costs, and other administrative expenses connected with an adoption, including any legal services performed for a parent who consents to the adoption of a minor or relinquishes the minor to an agency;     (7)  transportation for services provided under subdivisions (2), (3) or (6) of this section;     (8)  expenses incurred in obtaining a preplacement evaluation and an evaluation during the proceeding for adoption; and     (9)  any other service or expense the court finds is reasonable and necessary.    (b)  A parent or a guardian, a person acting on the parent's or guardian's behalf, or a provider of a service listed in subsection (a), may receive or accept a payment authorized by subsection (a).  The payment may not be made contingent on the placement of a minor for adoption, relinquishment of the minor, or consent to the adoption.  If the adoption is not completed, a person who is authorized to make aspecific payment by subsection (a) is not liable for that payment unless the person has agreed in a signed writing with a provider of a service to make the payment regardless of the outcome of the proceeding for adoption.  If the adoption is not completed, an adoptive parent is liable only for agreed upon expenses which are permitted under this section and were incurred prior to the termination of the adoption process.    (c)  Except for the expenses authorized by (a)(4) and (a)(7), no payments as authorized in subsection (a) shall be paid directly to a parent without prior court approval, but instead will be paid to service providers or to an agency.    7-104.  CHARGES BY AGENCY    Subject to the requirements of sections 3-702 and 3-703 for an accounting and judicial approval of fees and charges related to an adoption, an agency may charge or accept a fee or other reasonable compensation from a prospective adoptive parent for expenses not paid by public assistance for:     (1)  medical, hospital, nursing, pharmaceutical, or other similar expenses incurred by a mother or her minor child in connection with prenatal care, the birth or any illness of the minor;     (2)  a percentage of the annual cost the agency incurs in locating and providing counseling services for minor adoptees, parents, and prospective parents;     (3)  living expenses of a mother for a reasonable time before the birth of a child and for no more than six weeks after the birth;     (4)  expenses incurred in ascertaining the information required by section 2-105;     (5)  legal services, and court costs, or other administrative expenses connected with an adoption, including the legal services performed for a parent who relinquishes a minor child to the agency;     (6)  preparation of a preplacement evaluation and an evaluation during the proceeding for adoption;     (7)  transportation for services provided under this section; and     (8)  any other service or expense the court finds is reasonable and necessary.    7-105.  PROHIBITED PAYMENTS RELATED TO ADOPTION    (a)  Except as otherwise provided in sections 7-103 and 7-104, a person may not pay or give or offer to pay or give to any other person, or request, receive, or accept any money or anything of value, directly or indirectly, for:     (1)  the placement of a minor for adoption;     (2)  the consent of a parent, a guardian, or an agency to the adoption of a minor;     (3)  the relinquishment of a minor to an agency for the purpose of adoption; or     (4)  the recruitment of nonresident pregnant women to locate in this state for the purpose of relinquishing the child for adoption.    (b)  A release from liability from past or future child support is not a violation of this section.   Sec. 2.  15 V.S.A.  293(a) is amended to read:   (a)  When parents of minor children, or parents and stepparents of minor children,  whether said parents are married or unmarried,  are living separately, on the complaint of either parent or stepparent or, if it is a party in interest, the department of social welfare, the *[ superior ]*  family  court may make such decree concerning *[ the care, custody, maintenance and education ]*  parental rights and responsibilities and parent-child contact (as defined in section 664 of this title), and the support  of the children, as in cases where *[ the husband ]*  either parent  deserts or without just cause fails to support. Thereafter on the motion of either of the parents, the stepparent or the department of social welfare ,  the court may annul, vary or modify the decrees.  Sec. 3.  15 V.S.A.  658(e) is amended to read:   (e)  *[ An order of adoption ]*  A consent to the adoption  of a child  or the relinquishment of a child, for the purpose of adoption,  covered by a child support order shall terminate an obligor's duty to provide future support for the adopted child without further order of the family court.  Unpaid support installments accrued prior to adoption are not discharged and are subject to the jurisdiction of the family court.  In a case involving a child covered by a Vermont child support order, the probate court shall file  the consent or relinquishment  with the family court that issued the support order and shall notify the office of child support of any order terminating parental rights and  of  the finaladoption decree.   Upon receipt of the consent or relinquishment the office of child support shall terminate the obligor’s duty to provide further support.   Sec. 4.  REPORT   For four years after this act becomes effective, the commissioner of the department of social and rehabilitation services and the court administrator shall submit a report to the General Assembly on or before January 15.  The probate judges shall cooperate with the court administrator and provide the information needed to enable the court administrator to prepare the report.  The report shall include the following information:     (1)  The actions taken by the department to notify the public about the disclosure provisions of this act as required by 15A V.S.A.  6-111.     (2)  The number of requests for identifying information made to the adoption registry, whether the person requesting the information was an adoptee, former parent or other person authorized to request such information, that person’s relation to the person being sought and the response of the registry to the request.     (3)  The number of consents and requests for nondisclosure filed with the adoption registry and whether the person requesting the information was an adoptee, former parent or other person.     (4)  The number of petitions for disclosure filed under 15A V.S.A.  6-112, whether the petitioner was an adoptee, former parent or other person, the results of any effort to contact the person being sought, and the disposition by the court.     (5)  Any other relevant information related to the implementation of this act.   Sec. 5.  APPLICABILITY   A proceeding for adoption commenced before the effective date of this act shall be completed under the law in effect at the time the proceeding was commenced, unless all parties agree that this act shall apply.   Sec. 6.  TRANSITIONAL PROVISION   Notwithstanding the provisions of Title 15A, relating to certification of adoption counselors, until July 1, 1997, the services to be provided by certified adoption counselors may be provided by qualified mental health professionals specificallydesignated to perform those services by the commissioner of the department of mental health and mental retardation.   Sec. 7.  REPEAL    Chapter 9 (Adoption) and chapter 10 (Disclosure) of Title 15 are repealed.   Approved:  May 15, 1996

However, for most individuals                  who have already left the workforce, the single largest asset                  they have saved is the equity value of their home. For some individuals,                  the income received from Social Security and a pension is inadequate                  to meet their special needs. Conventional forms of converting                  to income home equity involve repayable loans secured as second                  mortgages or liens against ownership. Since 1989, the federal                  government has insured for adults age 62 and over a different                  type of mortgage that provides regular monthly without repayment                  or the threat of eviction, even if the owner outlives the declining                  equity.

GX039-17-1689020	"Statement of Frank G. Atwater,  National President and Chief Executive Officer,  National Association of Retired Federal Employees,  and Member, Coalition to Assure Retirement Equity   Testimony Before the Subcommittee on Social Security  of the House Committee on Ways and Means   Hearing on Social Security Government Pension Offset   June 27, 2000  Mr. Chairman and members of the Subcommittee, I am Frank G. Atwater, the National President and CEO of the National Association of Retired Federal Employees (NARFE). I thank you for scheduling this hearing on the Social Security Government Pension Offset (GPO). I am grateful that you have afforded me the opportunity to testify on an issue of such great importance to our members.  I am wearing two hats today. I am testifying on behalf of my own organization, NARFE, which represents over 400,000 federal retirees, employees, spouses, and their survivors across the United States.   I am also speaking on behalf of the Coalition to Assure Retirement Equity (CARE), a coalition of 43 organizations representing millions of federal, state, and local government retirees and employees. In 1991, CARE was formed specifically to address the Social Security Government Pension Offset (GPO) which, as you are aware, was enacted as part of the Social Security Amendments of 1977.   In 1935, when the Social Security Act was originally enacted, it provided the same benefits to workers, with and without spouses, and no survivors' benefits. The amendments, of the Social Security Act, enacted in 1939, added spousal and survivor benefits to provide extra protection to workers with families.   The GPO Social Security Act amendment, originally enacted in 1977, went into effect in 1983, and since then, has affected over almost 285,000 federal, state, and local retirees. It reduces or eliminates the Social Security spousal benefit (wife, husband, widow, or widower) to which an affected retiree may be eligible. Two-thirds of the amount of the monthly government annuity that the retiree has earned, is used to offset whatever Social Security spousal or survivor benefit might be payable.   According to the Congressional Budget Office, ""about 145,000 retirees from federal, state, and local governments had their Social Security auxiliary benefits reduced or eliminated as a result of the GPO in December 1991.""   (1)  Since then, that figure has almost doubled.   The Social Security Administration   states that the number of social security beneficiaries affected by GPO as of December 1997 was 270,975 (2) . That number increased by December 1999 to 284,383 (3) .   Of the 284,383 affected beneficiaries, 229,941 or 80 percent are fully offset, which translates into no benefit. It is crucial for you to note that 104,137 or 38 percent of the total number of affected beneficiaries are widows or widowers and 71,175 or 68 percent of them are fully offset.   As noted below, in December 1997, ten states in this country represented 169,358 or 63 percent of the total number of affected individuals. California, Ohio and Texas had significantly higher numbers than the others, but Illinois and Florida follow close behind.   Top Ten States (in descending order) of beneficiaries affected by GPO as of December 1997                                                            1.

Georgia             7,036                        Total             169,358                  Mr. Chairman, I understand from our members, through correspondence with their congressional representatives, there are members of this committee who have concerns regarding ""means testing"". I am led to believe that these concerns specifically relate to H.R. 1217 and the provision of a $1200 per month threshold before GPO would be applied.   When Congress enacted GPO in 1983, it set a 'means test' precedent by introducing a means test provision into the Social Security program by denying the full application of spousal benefits to persons receiving government pensions. This application of denial is not applied to those persons who are the recipients of annuities or other retirement benefits from the private sector.   We, as federal annuitants, share you and your colleagues' concerns over the impropriety of ""means testing"" in Social Security and believe that Congressman Jefferson's bill H.R. 1217 is the most pragmatic approach to the modification of the GPO, in lieu of repealing it.   Public Law 106-182, introduced as H.R.5 by Congressman Sam Johnson, was passed in both houses of Congress and signed into law by the President on April 7, 2000. This law ""eliminates the earnings test for individuals who have attained retirement age"". The estimated cost of the earnings repeal is projected to be $8 billion in the first year and $22.7 billion over the next ten years. The projected estimate for H.R. 1217 is about $300 million in the first year and $4.4 billion over the next ten years.   These preliminary projections for H.R. 1217 are based on a threshold of $1200, and indexed by the Social Security COLA over ten years, retroactive to December 31, 1999. (4)  Social Security Administration actuaries have determined that, just as with the earnings test repeal, enactment of H.R.1217 would ""increase the OASDI long-range actuarial deficit by an amount that is estimated to be  negligible  (i.e., less than 0.005 percent of taxable payroll).""   (5)   Members of the committee, you were able to expeditiously change the Social Security Act to benefit older workers through Public Law 106-182. We are now asking you to expend that same effort to effect change through H.R. 1217 for government retirees.   In fact, since repeal of the earnings limit, government workers 65 and older can receive full social security benefits based on their own work or as spouses or survivors. However, as soon as they retire, their social security is cut or ceases altogether. Therefore, a benefit counted on for retirement is paid while one is working, only to disappear when needed most --- at retirement.   We urge you to support Congressman Jefferson's legislation, H.R.1217, a proposal to modify the Social Security Government Pension Offset, as supported by the millions of federal, state and local government employees and retirees across the United States, represented by CARE.   I would now like to introduce Mrs. Ruth Pickard, a member of NARFE and a constituent of the Chairman, Congressman Shaw.   [THE ATTACHMENTS ARE BEING RETAINED IN THE COMMITTEE FILES.]     1.

The conferees recommend that this effort include the collection and use of state-specific surveys, state and federal administration data, and data administratively linking the National Directory of New Hires, other child support enforcement data, TANF and Medicaid records together. These studies should focus on assessing the well-being of the low income population, developing and reporting reliable and comparable state-by-state measures of family hardship and well-being, the utilization of other support programs and the impact of child support enforcement efforts. These studies should continue to measure outcomes for a broad population of current, former and potential welfare recipients, as well as other special populations affected by state TANF policies. The conferees further expect these studies to analyze how the earnings of custodial and non-custodial parents who are, or have had children who are, current or former welfare recipients have changed over time and whether the pattern is significantly different among states. The conferees request a report on these topics to be submitted to the House and Senate Appropriations Committees by May 1, 2002."" (H. Rept. 107-342, pages 115-116)   The following report has been prepared by the Office of the Secretary, Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation (ASPE), in response to the requirement for a report. Unless otherwise noted, this report discusses only the welfare outcomes research agenda supported by the targeted funding. No attempt has been made to reflect the separately funded welfare research agenda of the Department's Administration for Children and Families (ACF)  (1)  or ASPE's or the Department's health research agenda, except to the extent that some projects were supported jointly by welfare outcomes funding and funds from other sources.   The Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act (PRWORA) of 1996 was a landmark event in our nation's welfare policy. The results of the reforms, based on a number of popular measures, have been dramatic. The number of families receiving Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program cash benefits has declined substantially, marking the first-ever rapid caseload decline during an expanding economy. Employment among current and former welfare recipients has increased significantly, with the number of working recipients reaching all-time highs in fiscal years 1999 and 2000. In addition, the majority of mothers leaving welfare are employed after leaving. Earnings for welfare recipients continuing to receive cash assistance, and earnings for female-headed households in general, also have increased significantly. In addition, the child poverty rate continued to decline between 1996 and 2000, falling to its lowest rate in over 20 years.   Despite these gains, there is much to be done as we move to the next phase of welfare reform. States have had mixed success in fully engaging welfare recipients in work activities. While all states have met the overall work participation rates required by law, in 2000, in an average month, only about one-third of all families with an adult participated in work activities that were countable toward the state's participation rate. Substantial progress has been made nationwide in reducing teen births, but the proportion of births occurring outside of marriage remains relatively stable. Child poverty rates for African American and Hispanic children have also fallen dramatically during the past six years, although their poverty rates are still more than three times the rate for white, non-Hispanic children.   In addition, much remains to be learned as we move to the next phase of welfare reform. As a direct result of the dedication of research funds to study the outcomes of welfare reform, ASPE has contributed significantly to the scope, volume, and diversity of welfare reform research within the Department. ""Welfare Outcomes"" funding has enabled ASPE to sponsor or conduct a great number of studies designed to document trends in the low-income population (including both adults and children) as well as in the welfare recipient population. Our research agenda has also supported efforts to build state data capacity and data comparability through our support of monitoring studies, such as studies of families leaving welfare. Nonetheless, in its final report, the Panel on Data and Methods for Measuring the Effects of Changes in Social Welfare Programs convened by the National Research Council's Committee on National Statistics has identified some important data gaps and offered some conclusions and recommendations designed to build up the ""science base"" of welfare reform research. These are discussed in more detail in the  Future Directions  section later in this chapter.   [ Go to  Contents  ]      General Strategies for Understanding the Outcomes of Welfare   Reform      The dedication of research funds to studying welfare outcomes has enabled the Department to create a research, evaluation and data strategy designed to document the implementation of welfare reform and its effects, and to add to and enhance the information about welfare reform outcomes that is available to the Congress and other interested parties. Overall, our focus has been on creating an integrated picture of the low-income population, especially low-income families with children, combined with broader analyses of the economic condition, health and well-being, socio-demographic characteristics, and the social service needs of low-income individuals, families, and children. We believe this is consistent with both the Conference Committee's directives and with the far-reaching recommendations of the Panel on Data and Methods for Measuring the Effects of Changes in Social Welfare Programs.   There is a broad array of research about welfare reform being funded by the Department and other public and private sources. To optimize the potential that the targeted funds will increase the Department's understanding of the outcomes of welfare reform, ASPE has created, often with other funding partners involved, a portfolio of studies and strategies. Careful attention has been paid to identifying on-going research, evaluation, and data activities which could be enhanced or modified, identifying activities being funded or planned by other entities that might provide joint-funding opportunities, to identifying knowledge gaps, and to avoiding unnecessary duplication. We have used the targeted research funds to fully fund some projects, to fund specific portions of some larger studies, and to co-fund with other public and private agencies yet other projects. As a result, our research, evaluation and data activities cover a wide spectrum of welfare outcomes policy interests.   In keeping with the recommendations of the conferees, our research agenda over the past four years has covered a broad array of topics and approaches that complement other public and private efforts to assess the outcomes of welfare reform. We have funded or co-funded projects to study economic supports for poor families, children and youth, family formation, special populations and local service delivery issues, and cross-cutting topics. We have funded or co-funded competitive grant programs; projects to improve state data collection, comparability or capacity-building and analytic projects on welfare-related topics. We have funded or are funding projects that measure outcomes for welfare leavers, examine diversion practices, study the characteristics of the TANF caseload (or ""stayers""), and measure family hardship and well-being including the utilization of other support programs. Projects also are in place to assess the effects of welfare reform on current, former and potential welfare recipients and other special populations (e.g., child-only cases, people with mental health and substance abuse problems and other disabilities, immigrant families) affected by state TANF policies. Our specific activities and plans in each of the areas recommended by the Conference Committee are summarized below.   Despite the breadth and scope of these efforts, from a research perspective our knowledge is still quite limited in many areas, and many factors can limit what research can accomplish. For example, there is wide variation in the design and application of policies across states, between local sites, and even from worker-to-worker. State policies and organizational structures continue to evolve and, in some cases, state responsibilities are further devolved. We know little about low-income families who do not become welfare recipients, and people who leave assistance can be difficult to track over time. Many variables other than welfare policies (such as the economy) affect the outcomes of welfare reform, and these variables often have confounding effects. Because of these factors, the ability of research, evaluation, and data to completely answer questions is always limited.   [ Go to  Contents  ]      Future Directions      ASPE's research plan for the targeted welfare outcomes funds for FY 2002 is designed to meet the overall objective of creating an integrated picture of the low-income population, especially low-income families with children, as we move to the next phase of welfare reform. We continue our focus on broader analyses of the economic conditions, health and well-being, socio-demographic characteristics, and the social service needs of low-income individuals, families, and children. Our interest is to cover a wide spectrum of policy interests focusing on welfare outcomes, poverty, working families, supports for low-income populations, the hard-to-serve and other special populations, and effects on children. We envision a research agenda that:            addresses a wide range of topics related to families and children, including     economic and other supports for poor families,         continues some of our earlier activities to promote, develop, and support     state and local capacity for data collection and monitoring studies, by     supporting state-level data collection efforts, administrative data linking,     and the creation of public-use and restricted-access data files, and         facilitates states' monitoring of outcomes for their own state and local     populations. These activities include projects to build state data collection     and research capacities, providing technical assistance to improve the quality     of research results, ensuring more uniformity and comparability across studies,     and synthesizing results across state and local level monitoring studies.     Implementing a broad-based research agenda that addresses this wide range of welfare outcomes research is one of ASPE's most important roles within the Department.   As in previous years, the welfare research, evaluation, and data projects planned for FY 2002 are designed to complement and enhance other efforts, both within and outside the federal government, to assess and monitor welfare outcomes without undue duplication. They include projects that address several of the Administration's priority themes, including encouraging work and self-sufficiency, promoting healthy marriage and strong families, improving child well-being, expanding state flexibility and accountability, expanding the use of faith-based and community-based organizations, and addressing the needs of special populations. Our planned projects also address the Conference Committee's research priorities for use of welfare outcomes funding. We are hopeful that these wide-ranging activities will not only increase our understanding of the outcomes of low-income families, but also contribute to the Department's ability to respond to questions about those outcomes. Specific projects planned for FY 2002 are described in  Chapter III .   More broadly, we also continue to evaluate National Academy of Sciences recommendations to enhance the quality of welfare outcomes research. Conference report language accompanying the Fiscal Year 1998 and 1999 appropriations for welfare outcomes research funding included the recommendation that the Department ""submit its research plan to the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) to provide further guidance on research design and recommend further research."" Accordingly, we provided a total of over $1 million to the NAS in Fiscal Years 1998, 1999, 2000 and 2001 to convene an expert panel to evaluate current and future welfare reform research.   The aforementioned Panel on Data and Methods for Measuring the Effects of Changes in Social Welfare Programs' released an interim report,  Evaluating Welfare Reform: A Framework and Review of Current Work, Interim Report , in September 1999. It provided a framework for conducting evaluations of welfare program changes, reviewed current Departmental efforts to evaluate these changes, and provided the Panel's initial conclusions and recommendations. The short-run recommendations for welfare evaluation strategies were consistent with the Department's approach to research on welfare reform, and many of the recommended steps were already being taken.   The Panel's final report,  Evaluating Welfare Reform in an Era of Transition  (2)  , released in April 2001, highlighted some additional factors that need to be considered as the future direction of welfare research is contemplated. The report identified some important data gaps and offered numerous conclusions and recommendations with respect to defining research questions and outcomes of interest for measuring the effects of welfare reform, as well as the appropriate methods for answering those questions and the data needed to carry out these evaluations. It discussed research designs and methods for the study of welfare reform outcomes, and needed areas and topics of research. The report also addressed alternative federal and state data sources, the limitations of currently available data, and appropriate evaluation design and methods for analysis. In short, while applauding the Department for its broad-based welfare reform research agenda, it highlighted the need for further improvements and expansions in data collection, development of research questions, and methodological work to build up the ""science base"" of welfare reform research.   The Department has taken, or is taking, steps to address several of the Panel's recommendations. For example, our efforts to build capacity for conducting high-quality program evaluations at the state level and for conducting household surveys of low-income and welfare populations continue. We have committed resources to help improve national household survey questions to better measure program participation and benefit receipt. A project to improve the usefulness of state-level administrative data is planned. Improvements in state data reporting are included in the Administration's welfare reform proposal, as are changes to broaden the definition of assistance. State-specific data sets produced by each of the grantees studying welfare leavers have been made available for secondary data analyses of welfare outcomes measures. In addition, we have published a synthesis report that includes administrative data findings from all 15 of the ASPE-funded leavers studies. Study and consideration of other Panel conclusions and recommendations will continue.   [ Go to  Contents  ]      Activities that Support Conferees' Recommendations      As we have noted, our overarching research objective in using targeted welfare outcomes funds has been and is to create an integrated picture of the low-income population, especially low-income families with children. We have devoted substantial resources to covering a wide spectrum of policy interests focusing on welfare outcomes, poverty, working families, supports for low-income populations, the hard-to-serve and other special populations, and effects on children. Welfare devolution and increased flexibility in the design and delivery of program benefits have created substantial new challenges for data collection and analysis to monitor welfare outcomes. To meet these challenges, new and better data are needed at the state and local level. Activities that support and enhance the collection, use, and linking of federal and state administrative data and state-specific surveys are critical to understanding the outcomes of welfare reform. Some examples of welfare outcomes-funded or proposed studies that support the research recommendations of the Conference Committee follow.              Focus broadly on the low-income population, including current, former     and potential welfare recipients, and other special populations affected     by state TANF policies      We have funded grants to states and large counties to gather a variety of information about individuals and their families who apply to TANF (including those who are formally or informally diverted) and the degree to which TANF applicants receive, or are aware of their potential eligibility for, Medicaid, food stamps, and other programs and services that are important in helping low-income families make a successful transition to work.  (3)  We are funding projects in six states to study the characteristics of their TANF caseloads, with particular attention to the personal, family and community factors that may present barriers to employment. Employment programs for low-income parents with barriers to work will be tested under the long-term, multi-site demonstration and evaluation of programs for hard-to-employ low-income parents in order to identify effective strategies for promoting employment and family well-being and to determine the effects of such programs on employment, earnings, income, welfare dependence, family functioning, and the well-being of children. We also are supporting a National Governors Association project to build state and local capacity to provide work supports which help low-income working parents sustain employment and advance in the labor market. A separate project is assessing the coping mechanisms used by low-income families, by examining factors that may help or hinder a family's efforts to be self-sufficient, including formal and informal support services, social support networks, and time and money management.   In addition, we are supporting a supplement to a broader study of the implications of welfare reform for low-income families in three cities that is examining how work participation requirements and time limits are affecting the service utilization, health and development, support networks, parenting and child care arrangements of adults and children with disabilities. We also are providing continuing support for an evaluation of the effectiveness of a substance abuse research demonstration project that includes coordinating screening, referral and treatment with employment and training or vocational services. Another project is examining trends in the demand for emergency assistance services, such as homeless shelters and food banks, from the mid-1990's to 2000. In recognition of the fact that the highest concentration of populations on TANF are living in neighborhoods where incarceration rates are also the highest, we funded a project that is investigating the effects of incarceration on low-income children, families, and communities.   Our researcher-initiated grants program spanning Fiscal Years 1999, 2000 and 2001 funded a variety of proposals looking broadly at low-income individuals (both adults and children) and their families. For example, one project is analyzing three groups of low-income populations - those who leave welfare for work, those who remain on welfare, and non-working welfare leavers - to examine the characteristics and circumstances of people who leave welfare and are not working and how welfare ""stayers"" are different from the ""leavers."" We also funded a proposal to examine the determinants of successful employment and wage outcomes among low-income workers. A separate project is looking at the employment rates, earnings, income and other measures of well-being among low-income families who have not applied for welfare or who have applied and been denied or diverted. Another project is examining how the lives of adolescents in single-mother, low-income families who received welfare during the early years of TANF are affected by their mothers' employment, and whether these changes in adolescents' lives are specific to families receiving welfare or common among single-mother, low-income families more generally. We also funded a project documenting the incidence of child disability among low-income and welfare-recipient, single-mother families and the impact that children with disabilities have on their families' ability to exit welfare and poverty. Yet another project is examining the conditions and capabilities of vulnerable mothers and fathers in the first few years following enactment of PRWORA to evaluate the impact of TANF and child support policies.   Our FY 2002 research plan includes several proposed projects that focus broadly on the low-income population. For example, one study would focus on families who exit and re-enter welfare, particularly those who return for multiple times, in an attempt to identify the demographic characteristics and employment outcomes of ""cyclers,"" whether their patterns of benefit receipt and cycling patterns have changed since PRWORA, and whether cyclers re-entering welfare for the third time are treated differently than other families by local offices. Another planned project would explore the coordination of TANF and one-stop employment centers and the unique challenges involved in serving welfare and ex-welfare clients, and the low-skilled in general, through one-stop centers designed to serve people at all income and skill levels. A separate planned project would attempt to better understand the different types of child-only cases, the service needs of these families, and how states are meeting those needs. These and other projects will help us achieve our goal of covering all important low-income population groups in our research programs, including current, former and potential welfare recipients.             Collect and use state-specific surveys, state and federal administrative     data and administratively-linked data to develop and report state-by-state     measures of family hardship and well-being and the utilization of other support     programs      ASPE has devoted substantial resources to supporting state-level data collection efforts and administrative data linking, making certain that national survey instruments are responsive to policy changes and needs, supporting and maintaining a wide range of Census Bureau data collection efforts, and supporting secondary analyses of state and national-level data to add to our understanding of the effects of welfare reform. We have also committed funds for several projects geared toward developing state-level data on hardship and/or program utilization.   One of our researcher-initiated grant projects is using state and county administrative data to study the demographics, welfare participation, employment retention, and post-exit earnings of five cohorts of welfare recipients in North Carolina, to examine welfare exits, employment stability, earnings mobility, recidivism, longer-term labor market outcomes, types of jobs recipients obtain and the range of wages for these jobs. Another is exploring the long-term utilization of food stamp and Medicaid benefits for two cohorts of welfare recipients who left cash assistance in Wisconsin. A separate study is examining the accuracy of self-reports of program participation in survey data by comparing self-reported program participation among Californians interviewed in the national Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) with California administrative files of program participation. The New Jersey Department of Human Services is examining the extent to which former welfare recipients who leave welfare for work are likely to be eligible for Unemployment Insurance (UI), using a set of administrative and survey data from an ongoing evaluation. A study in Washington is estimating the effects of state-level policies (using a database of policy indicators in 11 program areas, including some transfer, tax, in-kind, and work support policies, over six years) on families' resources, resource packages, and experience of hardship.   We have provided support for an on-going project designed to match Social Security earnings records with samples of adult welfare recipients and non-recipients from Census surveys to help assess employment and earnings patterns and outcomes on the basis of baseline characteristics.   Our support for the administration of a welfare participation question in the State and Local Area Integrated Telephone Survey (SLAITS) has contributed to the fielding of a survey data element that, when combined with other data available from the survey, will permit the development of state-level estimates of the incidence of special health care needs of children of current and former welfare recipients, plus the health insurance status (including Medicaid and the State Children's Health Insurance Program, SCHIP) of current and former recipients. We also have provided funds to support the longitudinal New Immigrant Survey which will collect data on program utilization, health and economic status, and other characteristics among newly arriving low-income immigrant families in different states. ASPE's contribution will help ensure that comprehensive and relevant data are collected and analyzed and that the study focuses on how children in these families are faring. In addition, we have funded a project to advance our understanding of the value and limitations of measures of material hardship as a component of family well-being.   We have funded several projects which are utilizing existing administrative and survey data. For example, we have contributed support to Project on Devolution and Urban Change, a multi-disciplinary study of the implementation and impacts of welfare reform and welfare-to-work programs on low-income individuals, families and communities in four large urban areas, using, among other data sources, longitudinal administrative data for all families receiving AFDC/TANF or food stamps dating back to 1992. Under a separate task order we are analyzing survey data on the personal characteristics, potential barriers to employment, strengths and resources and preparation for employment of current TANF recipients in Illinois to explore the relationships of various factors contributing to employment outcomes. We also are supporting a small grant program for young scholars to encourage secondary analyses of new HHS-sponsored administrative and survey data sets to explore aspects of welfare reform. Finally, the competitive grants we awarded to states and large counties to examine welfare leavers, individuals and their families who apply to TANF (including those who are formally or informally diverted), and the characteristics of TANF caseloads, used or are using various combinations of state and federal administrative and survey data to report on a variety of welfare reform outcomes.   A project building on past ASPE-funded studies of welfare leavers and welfare applicants is proposed for FY 2002. This study would focus on the subgroup of TANF families who exit and re-enter welfare, particularly those who return for multiple times. Another proposed project would utilize five federally administered databases to provide state-by-state estimates of important welfare outcomes. Projects such as these support the overall goal of ensuring that good data are available to create an integrated picture of the low income population, especially families with children, in the wake of welfare reform.             Include efforts to link the National Directory of New Hires, other child     support enforcement data, TANF and Medicaid records together to assess the     impact of child support enforcement efforts and analyze how the earnings     of custodial and non-custodial parents have changed over time and whether     the pattern is significantly different among states.      The Federal Parent Locator Service (FPLS), operated by ACF's Office of Child Support Enforcement (OCSE) is primarily a national system to help states locate non-custodial parents, alleged fathers, and custodial parents so they can establish and enforce child support obligations. The Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act (PRWORA) expanded the data available in this system to include information on child support cases and wage and employment data, including the National Directory of New Hires.   PRWORA also authorized HHS to retain samples of this data and use them for research purposes likely to contribute to achieving the purposes of titles IV-A (Temporary Assistance for Needy Families) or IV-D (Child Support Enforcement and Paternity Establishment). The Department has awarded a contract to implement an FPLS research database, in conjunction with TANF and Medicaid data, that will provide information about the effects of welfare reform on TANF, Medicaid and child support participants, and help identify the significance of program interactions in increasing self-sufficiency among low-income families. The analysis from the database also will assist federal and state program oversight, research, statistical reporting, and the policy and evaluation purposes related to the TANF and child support enforcement programs and the low-income populations they serve. Currently these databases are not linked. While some limited cross-sectional matches are currently possible between TANF and the child support enforcement databases, there is no mechanism for creating a longitudinal database that would permit analysis of client and program interactions over time.   ASPE is working with OCSE, ACF's Office of Planning, Research and Evaluation (OPRE), and the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services' Office of Strategic Planning to develop this project, which builds on a feasibility study undertaken by ASPE and ACF in FY 1998 to examine research needs and database design issues. Departmental privacy, legal, and technical staff will be consulted, as well as appropriate outside experts. Assuming all the legal and technical issues can be resolved, this phase of the database project is expected to be completed by the end of 2003.   In its current form the expanded FPLS comprises one of the most comprehensive sources of employment information available anywhere, but does not include key program participation and demographic variables. Combined with other administrative data, such as the Medicaid Statistical Information System (MSIS), State Medicaid Research File (SMRF) and the TANF databases, it offers the opportunity to answer questions about the programs and populations of interest that previously we have been unable to answer. Such data matching could allow us to compare the TANF and/or Medicaid populations with similarly situated non-TANF and/or non-Medicaid families, compare families within and outside the child support enforcement system, and examine interactions between the three programs.   Using these databases, cross-sectional analysis will provide very important point-in-time estimations of the current IV-D, IV-A, and Medicaid policy environments and a snap-shot of the characteristics of various populations of interest to HHS. As noted above, some point-in-time analysis can be done with relatively simple cross-matches between existing data files. For example, FPLS data have been matched to some of the ""welfare leavers"" studies to provide data on employment and earnings. However, the planned longitudinal database would allow us to better address policy questions such as:            What proportion of custodial parents and children are receiving benefits     from other public assistance programs (e.g., TANF, Medicaid) over time? What     is the relationship between IV-D enrollment and Medicaid and TANF receipt     over time?         Are TANF applicants and leavers enrolled in Medicaid over time? What are     the characteristics of those enrolled and not enrolled?         What proportion of TANF leavers are employed in the period immediately after     they are identified as a ""leaver?"" How many have periods of unemployment     and do they receive unemployment insurance? What are the characteristics     of TANF leavers who become unemployed? What are the characteristics of TANF     leavers who have frequent job changes?         Does receipt of Medicaid and child support decrease the proportion of TANF     leavers who return to TANF, or increase the length of time between TANF spells?         Do TANF and Medicaid applicants, recipients, and leavers have child support     orders? What are the characteristics of those with and without orders?         Does receipt of Medicaid and/or TANF affect the amount of time it takes to     move a IV-D case through the paternity and award establishment processes?         What are the earnings patterns of non-custodial parents? What are the earnings     patterns of custodial parents? How do these patterns affect program participation     and collection of support?         Are there different interactions across programs in individual states, and     how do these different interactions relate to state policies and characteristics?     In addition to the linked micro-level administrative data, state macro-level policy, program and economic variable files also will be developed for use in conjunction with the database. These variables would include such things as annual state TANF benefit levels, Medicaid service packages, unemployment and not-in-the-labor-force rates, population poverty levels, program investments, paternity establishment rates and utilization of child support enforcement techniques. Such variables will allow us to examine state-by-state policy effects.   Our FY 2002 proposed research agenda includes a joint ASPE-ACF-CMS project to support the FPLS, TANF and Medicaid data warehouse to meet the on-going information needs of all the participating agencies. Another proposed project will link several federally administered databases (including TANF closed cases, the NDNH and quarterly earnings database) to provide state-by-state estimates of welfare outcomes for former TANF recipients. We also plan a project to examine how child support status (i.e., paternity established, order established, receipt of child support) interacts with TANF exit or re-entry, and coordination between the TANF and child support agencies. We anticipate that some questions could be answered through state administrative data matching, and others through site visits to states that demonstrate promising practices.   The Department is committed to advancing its welfare outcomes research agenda. The research, evaluation and data projects funded by the targeted Policy Research funds are critical to understanding the outcomes of welfare reform, and crucial to the Department's ability to respond to questions about those outcomes. The projects funded in FYs 1998, 1999, 2000 and 2001 cover a broad array of topics. We continue to provide leadership in national-level survey work and are working to facilitate greater comparability in state and local level studies and increase state and local capacity for data collection efforts.

GX048-90-1426574	Statement of Martin Gerry, Deputy Commissioner, Disability and Income Security Programs,  Social Security Administration    Before the Subcommittee on Social Security,  House Committee on Ways and Means   Hearing on Social Security Disability Programs'  Challenges and Opportunities   July 11, 2002   Mr. Chairman and Members of the Subcommittee:   Thank you for inviting me today to discuss the definition of disability  used by the Social Security Administration (SSA) in evaluating applicants  for Social Security and Supplemental Security Income (SSI) disability  benefits.  I will briefly describe the programs to which the  definition applies and will then elaborate some more on the definition in  the Social Security Act (the Act) and in SSA regulations.   Social Security and SSI Disability Programs    The Act provides cash benefits to individuals with disabling physical  and mental disorders under two major programs: Social Security Disability  Insurance (SSDI) and Supplemental Security Income (SSI).  Often,  receipt of disability benefits also provides access to health care.   SSDI comprises a number of disability benefits for workers and their  dependents and survivors.  Entitlement is based on contributions to  the Social Security trust funds through Federal Insurance Contribution Act  (FICA) taxes.  Individuals who qualify for SSDI benefits are entitled  to receive medical benefits from the federal Medicare program generally  after they have been entitled to benefits for 24 months.  SSDI  benefits include:       Disability Insurance Benefits.   This is a cash benefit    paid to workers who have not reached retirement age, who are disabled or    blind as defined in the Act, and who meet other requirements for    entitlement described below.     Widow's and Widower's Insurance Benefits  based on disability.     Disabled widows or widowers of workers may receive benefits if they are    at least 50 years old.  In general, the disability must have started    before the worker died or within seven years after the worker's death.     Surviving divorced spouses with disabilities may also qualify for this    disability benefit.     Child's Insurance Benefits  based on disability.  An    unmarried, disabled child of a worker who has died, retired, or is    receiving disability insurance benefits may receive this benefit.     In general, the individual must be unmarried and 18 years old or older to    qualify.  The individual must have been continuously disabled since    before attaining age 22.     The same definition of disability applies to all these benefits.   Benefits can also be payable to non-disabled spouses and children of SSDI  recipients.     SSI is a means-tested program that provides a basic floor of income for  individuals with limited incomes and resources.  SSI benefits are paid  to aged (age 65 and older), blind, and disabled individuals who have  limited means.  Individuals under age 65, including children  (individuals under age 18) must be blind or disabled to qualify for  benefits.  The same definition of disability that applies for SSDI  also applies for SSI benefits for adults.  Children under the age of  18 have a different definition of disability for SSI which was enacted in  1996.     In addition to this basic floor of income, individuals eligible for SSI  can benefit from Medicaid health insurance coverage from the States.   The Social  Security Act   The Social Security Act broadly defines disability for adults as the  inability to engage in any substantial gainful activity (SGA) due to a  physical or mental impairment that has lasted or is expected to last at  least one year or to result in death.  Neither shorter-term disability  nor partial disability is encompassed.  The Act requires the  Commissioner of Social Security to prescribe rules for obtaining and  evaluating evidence and making disability decisions.  The law further  requires that initial disability determinations be made by State agencies,  called Disability Determination Services (DDSs), following Federal rules  and guidelines and fully financed by Federal funds.   Sequential  Evaluation   As prescribed in SSAs regulations, disability in adults is evaluated  under a five-step sequential evaluation process.  The steps are  followed in order until a decision is made.  The first step is to  determine whether the individual is engaging in SGA.  Under current  regulations, in the case of blind individuals, the SGA earnings limit is  set by statute, and is currently $1,300 a month.  For individuals with  other disabilities, if a person is earning more than $780 a month, he or  she will be considered to be engaging in SGA.  However, SSA does not  necessarily count all the persons earnings.  For example, we deduct  impairment-related work expenses when we determine the amount of earnings  to count. Both amounts are indexed annually to average wage growth.     If it is determined that the individual is engaging in SGA, a decision  is made at the first step that he or she is not disabled without  considering medical factors.  If an individual is found not to be  engaging in SGA, the existence, severity and duration of the persons  impairment are explored.  At this step, and throughout  the  remainder of the process, we consider all of a persons physical and mental  impairments, both singly and in combination.   If the individual does not have a medical impairment, or the impairment  or combined impairments are determined to be not severe (i.e., they do  not significantly limit the individual's capacity to perform basic work  activities), the individual is found not disabled at the second step.   If the impairment is severe, we proceed to the third step, where a  determination is made as to whether the impairment meets or equals the  criteria of one of the medical listings published in regulations by SSA.    Listing of Impairments    The Listing of Impairments describes, for each major function of the  body, impairments that are considered severe enough to prevent a person  from doing any gainful activity, as opposed to any substantial gainful  activity.  The Listings are not required by statute, but SSA has been  using them in one form or another since it first started evaluating  disability claims, updating them as needed, to screen the most obviously  disabled applicants.  Most of the listed impairments are permanent or  expected to result in death, or a specific statement of duration is made.   For all others, the evidence must show that the impairment has lasted or is  expected to last for a continuous period of at least 12 months.     At this third step, the presence of an impairment that meets the  criteria in the Listing of Impairments (or that is of equal severity) is  usually sufficient to establish that an individual who is not working is  disabled, without the need to consider the individuals age, education, or  work experience.  However, the absence of a listing-level impairment  does not mean the individual is not disabled.  Rather, it merely  requires the adjudicator to move on to the next step of the process.   Medical-Vocational Decisions   If a severe impairment neither meets nor equals a listing (which  would result in a finding of disability), SSA assesses the individual's  residual functional capacity--what an individual can still do despite his  or her impairment--and uses that assessment in the last two steps of the  process.  At step four, we consider whether the person has the  residual functional capacity to meet the physical and mental demands of  past relevant work.  If the impairment does not prevent the individual  from meeting the demands of past relevant work, the person is found not  disabled.     Finally, if the impairment does prevent the individual from performing  past relevant work (or if the person did not have any past relevant work)  it must be determined whether the impairment prevents the person making an  adjustment to other work at step five.  As the statutory definition  states, the individual must be not only unable to do his previous work but  cannot, considering his age, education, and work experience, engage in any  other kind of substantial gainful work which exists in the national  economy.     The statutory standard is a method of judging disability.  For  example, the law specifies that the work the person can do does not have to  exist in the immediate area in which he or she lives, and that a specific  job vacancy does not have to be available to him or her.  Work in the  national economy is defined in statute as work which exists in significant  numbers either in the region where such individual lives or in several  regions of the country.     SSA has developed a vocational grid designed to minimize subjectivity  and promote consistency in applying the vocational factors.  The grid  regulations relate age, education, and past work experience to the  individual's residual functional capacity to perform work-related physical  and mental activities.  If the applicant has a particular level of  exertion work capability--characterized by the terms sedentary, light, and  medium--an automatic finding of disabled or not disabled may be  required when such capability is applied to various combinations of age,  education, and work experience.  Otherwise, we use the rules as a  framework for decision making.      Other Definitions of Disability   There are numerous other definitions of disability for different  purposes.  Workers compensation, vocational rehabilitation, State  Medicaid programs, and private disability insurers each has its own  definition of disability for its own purpose.     One notable example is The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA).   Its definition of disability is different from SSAs definition.  The  purpose of the ADA is to:   (1) provide a clear and comprehensive national mandate for the  elimination of discrimination against individuals with disabilities;    (2) provide clear, strong, consistent, enforceable standards addressing  discrimination against individuals with disabilities;    (3) ensure that the Federal Government plays a central role in enforcing  the standards established in this Act on behalf of individuals with  disabilities; and    (4) invoke the sweep of congressional authority, including the power to  enforce the fourteenth amendment and to regulate commerce, in order to  address the major areas of discrimination faced day-to-day by people with  disabilities.   In 1999, the United States Supreme Court held in a 9-0 decision that the  pursuit, and receipt, of SSDI benefits does not automatically prevent the  recipient from pursuing an ADA claim.  The courts decision further  noted that both ADA and SSDI claims can comfortably exist side by side  and recognized that the two laws do not share a common definition of  disability.   Disability Research   One of the most valuable services SSA can provide to policymakers is the  information they need for making sound decisions.  SSA places a high  priority on policy analysis and research that will provide the information  necessary to evaluate and strengthen the nations disability programs.   Many experts believe that providing intervention methods to disabled  individuals as close to the disability onset as possible significantly  improves their chance of starting or returning to work.  We plan on  testing several models including such interventions as integrated service  supports and collaboration with employers.  We also plan to study the  extent to which the listings are predictive of work ability.    Conclusion   Finally, I thank you, Mr. Chairman, Mr. Matsui, and all the members of  the Subcommittee, for beginning the public process of exploring the  definition of disability for Social Security benefits.  Obviously, any  potential changes would have to be considered in terms of the long-term  solvency of the combined trust funds.  I stand with the Commissioner  in her pledge to work with the Administration, with the Congress, and with  the dedicated and experienced employees of the Social Security  Administration to find the best solutions for this and other issues facing  the Agency.   Again, thank you for inviting me to be here today.  I look forward  to working with you to improve Social Securitys disability programs.

In some cases the reasons are entirely beyond their control, for example destruction of their home by flooding, or sudden loss of income due to illness, but in many cases factors such as drug or alcohol abuse and mental illness have caused or contributed to the homelessness. Additionally, people who become homeless are susceptible to acquiring these disorders. Simply finding new accommodation is not enough; people who have experienced homelessness will generally become homeless again unless they can make major changes in areas such as life skills, job skills, or mental health. The planning and coordination of services for the homeless in Buncombe County is based on the model termed the ""Continuum of Care"", which defines and quantifies the needs of homeless people as they progress from the initial state of homelessness towards stability in housing, health, and financial means. The main elements of the Continuum of Care are: q  Homelessness Prevention  services to help people who are at risk of becoming homeless retain their existing accommodation and deal with the problems that put them at risk, e.g. rental counseling, job training, substance abuse treatment. Outreach  contacting people who are homeless or at-risk of homelessness and offering help that they can accept and trust. Emergency Shelter  meeting the most basic short term needs for food and overnight shelter, often in dormitories. Transitional Housing  subsidized apartment accommodation made available for up to two years. Permanent Supportive Housing  subsidized housing with on-site or off-site supervision and supportive services for people with chronic mental illness or other long-term disability. Supportive Services  a wide range of social services to help homeless people to overcome the problems that have caused their homelessness and succeed in independent living.  q  q  q  q  q  Introduction   Consolidated Plan 2000-2005  Homelessness  Page 3  A. NATURE AND EXTENT OF HOMELESSNESS Although advocates for the homeless in our area have successfully obtained the funding necessary to increase steadily the number of beds available to homeless individuals and families, homelessness remains a persistent problem. Point-in-time surveys of the homeless population, conducted one to three times a year, suggest that well over 500 people are homeless at any one time in the City of Asheville alone . The results of the point in time survey conducted in April 1999 are attached in the appendix to this Chapter. Factors contributing to the extent of homelessness in our area include:  The increasing cost of housing.  The scarcity of living wage jobs. Despite low unemployment, most new jobs are in the low-paying service and retail sectors and hourly wages are not significantly increasing.  Asheville's noted tolerance for unconventional lifestyles has attracted more individuals who find it difficult to conform to societal norms than would be expected in a mid-size southern city. For example, a large number of transient youth come through Asheville each year, and many have chosen to remain.  The area has seen a large increase in immigration of low-income families from Mexico and Central America. Anecdotal evidence suggests that many of these families experience homelessness for at least a period of time.  In addition, this area becomes home to numerous migrant farm workers for portions of the year, and advocates believe that many of them are either homeless during their stays or doubling up with other families in cramped living conditions.  Finally, the impact of Hurricane Floyd in the summer of 1999 on the eastern region of the state is expected to result in more people moving to this area who have lost homes and/or jobs and are searching for a new home. Advocates report that the two fastest growing subpopulations of homeless persons are families with children and unaccompanied youth. However, the subpopulations who appear to have the highest relative need for housing and supportive services are individuals who are chronic substance abusers, suffer from serious mental illness, or have both problems (""dual diagnosis""). These individuals tend to suffer chronic homelessness and have the greatest difficulty transitioning into more permanent housing. There is little quantitative data on homelessness outside Asheville. In Transylvania county, an October 1999 study completed for Sharing House found widespread contact with homeless people by churches, social service agencies and police departments during the past year. Thirty-six out of 42 respondents stated they had served homeless people in the previous 12 months. Shelter beds for runaway youth were singled out by the sheriff Extent of Homelessness   Consolidated Plan 2000-2005  Homelessness  Page 4  as a particular need. It is widely reported, though not quantified, that homeless people camp for extended periods on government forest land in the county. Rural homelessness is also reported anecdotally in Madison county. Madison County Housing Authority says it needs to have funding for emergency accommodations for homeless persons and families who present themselves to housing authorities periodically. Threatened Homelessness In addition to families and individuals who are homeless at any given time, large numbers of persons in the Consortium area are at a significant risk of homelessness. Most service providers do not keep detailed records on the non-homeless families who contact them, but based on inquiries to just two agencies, the Affordable Housing Coalition and Pisgah Legal Sevices, we estimate that each year over 1,000 low-income families are threatened with homelessness. Many of these families are threatened with eviction and would find it difficult to obtain alternative affordable housing. Others are living in substandard housing or are paying a very high rent relative to their income, thus risking eviction and homelessness.  Extent of Homelessness   Consolidated Plan 2000-2005  Homelessness  Page 5  B. INVENTORY OF HOUSING AND SUPPORTIVE SERVICES 1. Homelessness Prevention The primary, though not exclusive, providers of cash assistance for homelessness prevention in Buncombe County and the City of Asheville are Asheville Buncombe County Christian Ministry (""ABCCM""), the Affordable Housing Coalition, the Salvation Army , Hospitality House, and the Department of Social Services. In addition to direct financial assistance, the Affordable Housing Coalition provides intensive case management and social work for families facing eviction who would otherwise become homeless. Consumer Credit Counseling Services also provides financial counseling for individuals and families at risk of homelessness. Western North Carolina AIDS Project (""WNCAP"") provides similar services for people with AIDS. Pisgah Legal Services prevents homelessness by defending evictions and negotiating with landlords. In Henderson, Transylvania, and Madison Counties, Pisgah Legal Sevices also prevents homelessness by defending evictions and negotiating with landlords.  2. Outreach, Intake, and Assessment The primary, though not exclusive, points of entry into the continuum of shelter and services for homeless people living on the street in Buncombe County are the ABCCM Emergency Shelter, Helpmate (domestic violence shelter), Hospitality House and its A HOPE program, the Salvation Army, and the Western Carolina Rescue Mission. All provide outreach, intake, and assessment services, along with ongoing shelter and case management or social work services. Services are accessed by appearing at the door of any of these agencies, or by telephone referrals from United Way's First Call for Help and other agencies. A HOPE offers breakfast meetings twice a week and visits homeless the community. Recently, Hospitality House opened its Safe Haven, provision of services to some of the homeless people who are hardest with mental disabilities and persistent substance abuse problems who remaining in more mainstream programs. campsites around a site for the to serve -- those have had difficulty  The Shelter Plus Care program at Blue Ridge Center also targets outreach to people living on the street who are suffering from serious mental illness. Those who qualify receive long-term housing with supportive services on a relatively expedited basis. Additionally, Shelter Plus Care takes referrals from emergency shelters. Blue Ridge Center and Hospitality House have collaborated with an outreach worker employed by Blue Ridge and working closely with A HOPE.  Inventory of Services   Consolidated Plan 2000-2005  Homelessness  Page 6  The Asheville VA Medical Center began an outreach program to homeless veterans this year. Under this program, a student outreach volunteer from the VA Medical Center visits each of the largest emergency shelters for adults -- ABCCM, Hospitality House, Salvation Army, and Western Carolina Rescue Mission -- to provide referrals and information to homeless veterans. These initial access sites generally refer homeless people for secondary assessment depending on their initial evaluation. For example, the ABCCM Medical Clinic, the Buncombe County Health Department, and Western North Carolina Community Health Services (""WNCCHS"") provide medical assessment. Homeless veterans receive medical assessment and treatment at the VA Medical Center. Blue Ridge Center provides mental health and substance abuse assessment. Pisgah Legal Services provides legal assessment. The Buncombe County Department of Social Services provides public benefits assessment and assistance, and job search assistance for eligible applicants under its Work First program.  3. Emergency Shelter Asheville/Buncombe Our primary emergency shelters in the City of Asheville are ABCCM (men, women, and families with children), Helpmate (survivors of domestic violence and their children), Hospitality House (single men and women), Our Place (youth), the Salvation Army (single men and women), Trinity Place (runaway youth) and the Western Carolina Rescue Mission (single men). Hospitality House is developing a Safe Haven as a specialized shelter for hard-to-serve homeless people. Homeless people access emergency shelter by appearing at the door, or by referrals from United Way's First Call for Help and other agencies. Those contacted by the street outreach programs are often assisted in obtaining emergency shelter. In addition, our two largest shelters, ABCCM and Western Carolina Rescue Mission, have a collaborative referral system developed as part of the Continuum of Care. During the winter months, they communicate daily by phone about requests for weather related emergency beds and pallets. When one shelter fills, it issues a voucher to homeless men applying for shelter that they can use at the other. This system facilitates referrals and helps ensure that no one has to sleep outdoors in the coldest months. Outside Buncombe The only general emergency shelter in Henderson, Transylvania, or Madison Counties is Ministry Seven, an emergency shelter located in Henderson County. Sharing House in Transylvania County recently conducted a survey to assess the need for an emergency shelter in Transylvania County and concluded that such a need exists. However, each county does have a shelter for survivors of domestic violence. Mainstay in Hendersonville offers both emergency and transitional housing, while Helpmate in Madison and SAFE in Transylvania offer only emergency beds at present. Mainstay and Helpmate report adequate capacity to meet need.

Transitional Housing Transitional housing services are accessed by referral from emergency shelters and other agencies. They offer housing for periods of up to two years (typically 3  12 months), with a greater degree of privacy and independence than emergency shelters. All also provide help clients access other services in the community. As a general rule, clients develop a plan to work toward self-sufficiency and a return to permanent housing. The transitional housing providers offer intensive case management services and referrals to other services to assist their clients in that process. Asheville/Buncombe The primary transitional housing providers for homeless people in Buncombe County and the City of Asheville are Eliada Homes (families with children, homeless youth), Flynn Home (single men in recovery), Hospitality House (one house for single men, another for women with children), Interlace (survivors of domestic violence and their children), Life on Life's Terms (single men or women in recovery), Martha Home (women with children), Mary Benson House (pregnant women recovering from substance abuse), and Western Carolina Rescue Mission (single men). The Salvation Army will begin providing transitional housing for families soon. Transitional housing in Buncombe County is always filled to capacity. We have a significant need to maintain these existing resources and expand them over time in order to provide an alternative to emergency shelter for homeless people moving toward self Inventory of Services   Consolidated Plan 2000-2005  Homelessness  Page 8  sufficiency. However, Section 8 vouchers no longer offer preference to victims of domestic violence, making it more difficult for people to move to safe housing for the long term. Outside Buncombe Transitional housing in the other three counties is available only for survivors of domestic violence and their children. Mainstay in Hendersonville has adequate capacity for residents to remain for up to three months. Helpmate in Madison county also has sufficient capacity in its recently opened shelter for families to stay longer if necessary, though their beds are classified as emergency shelter. SAFE in Brevard reports a need for at least four transitional housing units.

Permanent Supportive Housing Permanent housing with supportive services for formerly homeless people with disabilities is provided by the Blue Ridge Center (people with severe and persistent mental illness), HOPWA vouchers (people with AIDS), and WNCCHS (single people with AIDS).  Inventory of Services   Consolidated Plan 2000-2005  Homelessness  Page 9  Homeless people with HIV/AIDS usually contact WNCAP or WNCCHS first. Both groups have extensive experience working with this subpopulation, as well as a broad knowledge of resources that are available in the community. WNCAP administers the HOPWA vouchers, and WNCCHS administers Hope House II, a Section 811 development for people with AIDS. A client residing in Hope House II or a home subsidized by a HOPWA voucher will also receive intensive case management services from one or both of those agencies, and will likely obtain medical care and medical case management from WNCCHS. Homeless people with severe and persistent mental illness, who are living on the street or in a shelter, can access the Shelter Plus Care program by contacting Blue Ridge Center directly or on referral from A HOPE or a shelter provider. In Shelter Plus Care, they receive a tenant-based rent subsidy, mental health services from Blue Ridge Center, and case management services to help with housing placement, landlord-tenant disputes, and obtaining other services. In addition to the Shelter Plus Care program, the Blue Ridge Center also provides permanent supportive housing at several other locations. We were unable to identify any permanent supportive housing outside Asheville.

Permanent Housing (Not Supportive) The largest provider of affordable permanent housing without supportive services for formerly homeless people is HACA with 1,512 units of public housing and 1,136 units of Section 8 certificates and vouchers. These subsidized units are difficult, if not impossible, for single adults who are not disabled to access. Formerly homeless people with mental health or substance abuse disabilities also have a difficult time retaining this permanent housing without supportive services from another source. Even with supportive services, those with histories of substance abuse have a hard time obtaining subsidized housing because of HUD and housing authority guidelines restricting admission. Outside Buncombe County, there are seven smaller public housing authorities which have similar restrictions on their capacity to assist the homeless. The Affordable Housing Coalition provides intensive case management to help people retain permanent housing. Blue Ridge Center provides case management for some people with severe mental illness. Pisgah Legal Services provides eviction defense and conflict resolution services to help formerly homeless people retain housing. Finally, Consumer Credit Counseling Services provides financial counseling both to homeless persons and to those at risk of homelessness.  7. Supportive Services Agencies providing supportive services focused primarily on homeless and formerly homeless people in Buncombe County are ABCCM (job referrals, emergency food, financial assistance, and medical treatment); Blue Ridge Center (mental health and substance abuse treatment); Helpmate (counseling and court advocacy for survivors of domestic violence); Hospitality House/A HOPE (outreach to people living on the street, case management for them to access emergency shelter, transitional housing, and other services); Interlace (comprehensive self-sufficiency services for survivors of domestic violence); Salvation Army (social work assistance to access other services); Trinity Place (counseling for runaway teenagers); Western Carolina Rescue Mission (substance abuse treatment groups and referrals to other supportive services agencies); WNCAP (case management and advocacy for people with HIV/AIDS); and WNCCHS (medical treatment for people with AIDS and others). These services are accessed by residents of the shelters and transitional homes, and by referral from Homeless Coalition agencies and others. Many clients receive services as part of a self-sufficiency plan developed with the staff of an emergency shelter or transitional home. Services coordinated through such a plan tend to be more effective in helping clients access and remain in permanent housing. Others receive services on an ad hoc basis by applying directly to the provider. The Blue Ridge Center / Hospitality House outreach project is helping people who live on the streets to get supportive services. In many cases those services, particularly Inventory of Services   Consolidated Plan 2000-2005  Homelessness  Page 11  substance abuse treatment services, are a prerequisite for obtaining shelter, transitional housing, or permanent housing. Clients are contacted directly by the outreach worker when they come to an A HOPE breakfast, or when the outreach worker talks with them at a campsite. In addition to utilizing its outreach person, Hospitality House has expanded the network of services offered at A HOPE. Specifically, the Affordable Housing Coalition provides services directly to homeless persons at A HOPE twice a week, and Pisgah Legal Services provides services at A HOPE regularly. Research on Supportive Services was limited to Buncombe County. Supportive Services Service Provider ABCCM AHC Eliada Homes Flynn Home Helpmate Hope House Hospitality Hse.

NEEDS OF THE HOMELESS A quantitative estimate of needs has been attempted for Asheville/Buncombe County only  the area covered by the existing Continuum of Care plan. The results are set out in the format prescribed by HUD as ""Table 1A"" on the next page. We estimated need based on point-in-time data, agency capacity surveys, and numerous focus groups conducted with residents and volunteers of a representative sampling of homeless shelters and service providers. We adjusted our estimates to take into account (1) that the surveys and data are based primarily on persons currently in the homeless service provider system and do not fully reflect the need; (2) approximately one-third of the persons currently in emergency shelter would be ready to move to transitional housing if an adequate supply were available; and (3) approximately one-third of the persons currently in emergency shelter and transitional housing are disabled and would need permanent supportive housing if supplies were adequate. The current inventory of beds and supportive services slots is based on services provided directly by primary homeless service providers. To determine the gaps, we subtracted the current inventory from the estimated need. Priorities were set mainly from the magnitude of the gaps. Youth received a higher priority than its numbers might suggest because of information we have from the Asheville Police Department indicating that the homeless youth population is higher than our past surveys have indicated. The ""medium"" priority assigned to emergency shelter reflects the adequate number of current shelter beds under most conditions. However, the shortage of transitional housing means that people who are ready for transitional living are remaining in emergency shelters for weeks or months, causing a shortage of free beds. Additionally in extremely cold weather all shelter beds fill up and people spend the night sleeping on shelter floors and chairs. There is a high need for additional emergency overflow capacity for the 1030 nights a year when temperatures and wind chill factors are dangerously low. In addition to the gaps and needs noted on Table 1A, both service providers and persons who are currently homeless stated a significant need for greater access to medical and dental care, prescription medicines, and enhanced services to improve their quality of life, such as better transportation, access to public restrooms, and a shelter that is open twenty-four hours. While these needs do not fit easily within the HUD-prescribed table, the community feels they are high priority needs.

INSTITUTIONAL STRUCTURE Asheville and Buncombe County are fortunate to have a large number of effective nonprofit providers of services to the homeless who work together through the Homeless Coalition, an informal, unincorporated group which meets monthly and has successfully developed the Continuum of Care for the County. As well as the non-profits, the City of Asheville and other governmental entities such as the Veterans Administration, and the Buncombe County Social Services Department participate actively in the Coalition. Though the Coalition has no staff, its member agencies have been generous in contributing their staff time, and the City has assisted through its annual CDBG grant to Pisgah Legal Services for resource development. This grant pays part of the salary of a PLS staff attorney to work principally, though not entirely, on Homeless Coalition issues. Member agencies of the Homeless Coalition have worked together in many different collaborative groups to implement specific projects, for example linking the expertise of a housing development agency like Mountain Housing Opportunities with a service provider like the Blue Ridge Center. One of the most successful collaborative efforts to date has been the creation of the Interlace program to provide transitional housing for victims of domestic abuse, as recognized at the 1999 HUD Best Practices Symposium. In fact, as the next section illustrates, collaborative efforts have now become the rule rather than the exception. A few small agencies have preferred to remain outside the Coalition and do not play an active part in the development of the Continuum of Care and other collaborative activities. However, their facilities and services are included in the inventory on the preceding pages.  Institutional Structure   Consolidated Plan 2000-2005  Homelessness  Page 15  E. STRATEGIES FOR THE NEXT FIVE YEARS 1. Short - Medium Term Strategies Some of the collaborative efforts that are under way now and should reach fruition in 2000/2001 are:  Mountain Housing Opportunities, WNC Housing, Inc., Blue Ridge Center, and the City of Asheville are planning to renovate six apartments to be used as permanent supportive housing for eight to ten persons with disabilities. WNCCHS and HACA are rehabilitating nine units of a housing development for families with at least one member who has HIV or AIDS. The Asheville VA Medical Center, ABCCM , Hospitality House, Salvation Army , and the Western Carolina Rescue Mission are collaborating in an effort to reach more homeless veterans. Consumer Credit Counseling Services, Inc. and the Affordable Housing Coalition have teamed up to educate renters at risk of becoming homeless. The Affordable Housing Coalition, the City of Asheville , HACA, Hospitality House, Buncombe County, Buncombe County Department of Social Services, Eliada Homes, Consumer Credit Counseling Services, Pisgah Legal Sevices , and Neighborhood Housing Services collaborated successfully to obtain state TANF funding for a rental assistance and counseling program for families with children who are at risk of homelessness. WNC Housing, Inc., the City of Asheville , and HACA are collaborating to develop eight new units of permanent supportive housing for disabled persons. Residents will receive rental assistance and a comprehensive array of supportive services. The Salvation Army and the North Carolina Bureau of Prisons are collaborating in an effort to implement a G.E.D. and vocational training program for persons leaving correctional institutions who do not have a stable home to which they can return. Hospitality House, the Affordable Housing Coalition, Consumer Credit Counseling Services, and Pisgah Legal Sevices are collaborating to provide housing, financial, and legal counseling to homeless persons at the new Hospitality House Safe Haven and Outreach Center.              Strategies   Consolidated Plan 2000-2005  Homelessness  Page 16  Future collaborations that are in the planning stage now include:  A ""stand-down"" for homeless veterans at the Asheville VA Medical Center, where agencies, physicians, and dentists will provide on-site assistance to homeless veterans. Mountain Area Perinatal Substance Abuse Program, Interlace , the YWCA, Women at Risk, and Eliada Homes plan to collaborate on establishing a transitional housing program for homeless teenage mothers who are suffering from substance abuse. Interlace , Mountain Housing Opportunities, and Neighborhood Housing Services hope to collaborate on the construction or rehabilitation of housing for survivors of domestic violence who are homeless, providing a more secure home for the Interlace program in the future. The Church of the Advocate , United Way's First Call for Help, and the Homeless Coalition hope to collaborate with the Asheville Merchants Association and the Asheville Downtown Association to identify jobs available for persons who are homeless.        2. Longer Term Strategies In addition to the specific collaborative efforts already underway, we propose the following broader strategies to be pursued over the next five years. In developing these strategies we recognize the need for deep and continuing subsidies to help people overcome the trauma of homelessness and find stable housing and jobs. Our homeless residents and the agencies that serve them can make little or no use of loans that must be repaid. A significant number of people with mental and physical disabilities will not be able to maintain stable housing without permanent financial and other support services. The HUD supportive housing program has been a valuable tool in developing successful new programs, but we are now at the stage where the renewal of funding for those programs will use up all or most of that funding source. The development of new funding sources is therefore critical to our ability to make further service improvements.  By the funding cycle for the fiscal year 2004-2005, a minimum of 30% of CDBG funding should be used to benefit people who are homeless or at risk of homelessness, defined as households below 30% of median income. If we are successful in creating a local Housing Trust Fund, as proposed in the Affordable Housing Section, then the proportion of both CDBG and HOME funds that are used to benefit the homeless or those at risk of homelessness should be further increased. We encourage the Housing Authority of the City of Asheville (HACA) to retain preferences for individuals and families who are homeless, involuntarily Strategies       Consolidated Plan 2000-2005  Homelessness  Page 17  displaced, living in substandard housing conditions, paying more than 50% of their income in rent, or are victims of domestic violence.  Agencies should continue to join in collaborative efforts to develop new programs to serve the homeless or to prevent homelessness and to take advantage of all existing and new funding sources. Agencies should improve their ability to share information, for example by developing a common intake form, and should seek to obtain a reliable unduplicated annual count of people experiencing homelessness in Buncombe County. (However, such information should not be used to exclude people from obtaining needed services from more than one agency). The City of Asheville should make available public restrooms at strategic locations in and around downtown The City of Asheville should examine possible ways of enhancing the availability of transportation for those who are homeless.       F. PERFORMANCE TARGETS The following measurable objectives are proposed for the period 2000-2005. Their achievement will depend crucially on the availability of funding in addition to CDBG and HOME.   Provide an additional 150 units of shelter/housing for individuals (30 per year) and 100 for families (20 per year). Achieve an accurate unduplicated annual count of persons experiencing homelessness in Buncombe County.

GX041-13-12953727	"Statement of Ruth Pickard, Member,  National Association of Retired Federal Employees   Testimony Before the Subcommittee on Social Security  of the House Committee on Ways and Means   Hearing on Social Security Government Pension Offset   June 27, 2000  Mr. Chairman and members of the Committee, I am Ruth Pickard, a 73 year old working woman from Palm Beach Gardens, Florida. I greatly appreciate the opportunity to personally ask you to give early and serious consideration to ways and means of alleviating the dire financial consequences of the Government Pension Offset provision (GPO) of the Social Security Act.  The GPO has drastically curtailed my retirement income and that of thousands of others. We are being denied social security benefits not because we have never worked, but because we spent all or some of our working years in public service. Now we find that our government work has eroded the retirement income we had counted on from years of Social Security taxes we and our spouses paid over a lifetime.   I went to work in 1943 at age 16 and left the workforce in 1957 to stay home with two young children for 7 years. All of my early years of employment were in the private sector.   In 1963 I went back to work, this time for the U. S. Postal Service where I paid into Social Security until 1967, when I became covered by the Civil Service Retirement System. In the late 1960's, I developed high blood pressure, and then in 1986 I suffered a brain aneurysm. Fortunately, I had more than enough sick and annual leave to cover about 5 months of recuperation. Despite health problems, I returned to work for the Post Office until I retired in November 1990 at age 63.   When I applied for Social Security based on my own work, I found my benefits reduced considerably, to $112, because of the Windfall Elimination Provision of the Social Security Act. And although I was then divorced after more than 20 years of marriage, and was entitled to an additional $248 in wife's benefits, I was informed by Social Security that ""we cannot pay you"" because two-thirds of my federal annuity was more than the wife's benefits I might otherwise have had. That was the Government Pension Offset. That was the second time my government service reduced my social security.   I soon realized that I could not make ends meet on my federal annuity and my small social security check, so six and a half years ago I went back to work part time. I am still working, and I still have social security taxes withheld from each paycheck.   Today, after 46 years of work--22 years under Social Security and 24 years of Civil Service--I have a monthly retirement income of $1245--$1071 of government annuity and $171 of social security. And, I am paying about $50 a month in social security payroll taxes, with little hope of my benefits increasing in the future unless the Government Pension Offset is radically reformed or repealed.   Mr. Chairman, as one of your own constituents, I greatly appreciate you scheduling this hearing to consider the purpose and impact of the GPO, along with ways to modify it.   I hope you will give serious consideration to Congressman Jefferson's bill, which has been found worthy of support by more than half your colleagues in the House of Representatives. But I particularly hope that you and all of your colleagues will remember that the GPO is not just another confusing concept of the Social Security Act. Nor is it simply a safeguard against individuals getting more than ""their fair share"" from social security.   The GPO is a provision of the Social Security law, which has denied benefits to hundreds of hard-working elderly constituents in each of your states and districts. Unless you and your fellow members of Congress change this law, retirement security will be difficult, if not impossible for many women like me. I commend you all for voting to repeal the Social Security earnings test so that seniors can afford to work. I ask you now to give equal consideration to the GPO, so that others of us can afford to retire.   Thank you again for the opportunity to appear before you today."
GX044-65-13180196	"Statement of Leon Friedberg, Assistant Professor,   University of California, San Diego, and Faculty Research Fellow,   National Bureau of Economic Research    Testimony Before the Subcommittee on Social Security  of the House Committee on Ways and Means    Hearing on Improving Social Security Work Incentives    February 15, 2000    SUMMARY.  The Social Security earnings test produces some of the highest tax rates in the economy. A beneficiary aged 62-64 loses $1 in benefits for every $2 in earnings above an earnings limit of $10,800 this year, in effect a 50% marginal tax rate. A beneficiary aged 65-69 faces a 33% marginal tax rate for earnings above $17,000. The tighter rules for younger beneficiaries will apply for longer as the normal retirement age is gradually raised from 65 to 67, beginning this year. Many beneficiaries appear unresponsive to the additional provision that lost current benefits are returned as a small percentage increase in benefits forever after they retire. If beneficiaries are unaware of this provision, even as many economists and journalists reporting on Social Security have been, then we have a perverse policy that distorts people's choices as if they were taxed yet raises virtually no revenue.    I have been invited here to summarize my research findings. In my research I have analyzed how beneficiaries changed their hours of work in response to past changes in the earnings test. I use this past evidence to develop predictions if the earnings test were removed today. These predictions directly pertain to a particular subset of beneficiaries - men aged 65-69 who are already working a fair amount. For technical reasons, this is the group for which I can make the most precise predictions. This is also the group losing the most benefits to the earnings test.     In my research I use large data files collected by the Bureau of Labor Statistics in which people report their earnings and hours of work during the previous year. Many workers in these surveys responded noticeably to past changes in the earnings test.        ·  For example, in 1983 the earnings test was eliminated for   people aged 70-71. Before that, many of them kept their earnings just at the earnings   limit. Afterwards, their earnings smoothed out, so we can conclude that they had been   changing their work hours because of the earnings test.      ·  In 1978, the earnings limit was raised from $3000 to   $4000 for people aged 65-71. In the data, we can see the cluster of workers with earnings   just below the earnings limit move their earnings up to the new higher limit.       Based on these past responses, I have developed predictions if the earnings test is changed today. These predictions focus on the hours of work  among people who are already working . There are three important subgroups to consider.         ·   Low earners , people who keep their earnings just   at or below the earnings limit. This group is reacting most visibly to the earnings test   and will be the most responsive to a change; compared to their actual hours of work in   1995, they would be predicted to work 50% more on average, if the earnings test is   eliminated.      ·   Medium earners , people working a little more   initially, losing some but not all of their benefits to the earnings test. In theory we do   not know if this group would work more or less when the earnings test is eliminated - they   might work more because the marginal tax rate declines, or they might work less because   they have extra income. The evidence from past changes is that this group would work 18%   more on average.      ·   High earners , people working so much that they   lose all of their benefits. This group will not work more, because they get extra income   but face no actual change in their marginal tax rate. Responses in the past suggest that   they would work 4%  less  on average. An important caveat for this group: it   consists mostly of full-time workers who may have less flexibility to change their work   hours, compared to the part-time workers who are already showing a flexible response to   the earnings test. The high earners may not be able to reduce their work hours a little,   so their work hours may not change at all, and the prediction for this group is less   certain.      This is also an important consideration for retirement. I have not addressed the question of whether the earnings test causes some people to retire completely, and thus whether eliminating the earnings test will lead them to postpone retirement. If jobs are not perfectly flexible, and people cannot find part-time work that lets them keep their earnings below the limit and avoid the earnings test, then it might cause them to retire. This is an important point, but it is difficult to analyze because it depends on the structure of jobs, not just on their observable work hours. Indirect evidence supports the notion that jobs are not perfectly flexible, so we might expect that eliminating the earnings test would cause some people to delay retirement. But, I have not found direct evidence of this.    To sum up, all of the men aged 65-69 who were earning at least up to the earnings limit in 1995 would be predicted to work 5% more, in total. The lower earners would work 50% more, the medium earners would work 18% more, and the high earners would work 4% less.     The same type of analysis yields predictions about how people would respond to the gradual increase to a $30,000 earnings limit for people aged 65-69, legislated in 1996. In comparison, people will not increase their work hours as much or will reduce their work hours more. The low earners would work 34% more, not 50% more. The middle earners would work 7% more, not 18% more. The high earners would work 10% less, not 5% less. The differences arise because the tax rate is not eliminated, but gets pushed up onto higher earners.     While the short-run costs of relaxing or eliminating the earnings test will be substantial, the long-run costs approach zero, since future benefits will not be raised as they are today to make up for current benefits lost to the earnings test.     Now I will briefly discuss what we might expect with other groups if the earnings test is changed.         ·   Working women  respond to the earnings test   similarly to men, suggesting a similar change in work hours if the earnings test is   eliminated. A significantly smaller proportion of women work at these ages, however.     ·   People aged 62-64 , and eventually aged 65-66 as   well, face much more restrictive earnings test rules, almost unchanged since the early   1970s. How do younger workers respond to the earnings test? Some also hold their earnings   down, just below the limit, but more continue to work full-time. Therefore, more workers   in this age range may reduce their hours, relative to the number who increase their hours.   However, for this age group in particular, the ""retirement effect"" of the   earnings test, which I discussed earlier, could be substantial. In other words, people in   this age range may choose to postpone retirement if the earnings test is eliminated.      I will be happy to answer questions about my research on the expected response of workers aged 65-69 to changing the earnings test, and about the potential responses of other groups, for example younger workers who continue to face more restrictive earnings test rules.    BACKGROUND TEXT.  Introduction .   When Social Security was established during the Great Depression, one motive was to encourage older workers to leave the labor force and make way for younger workers. Thus, the system was designed not simply to give benefits to older workers, but also to condition benefits on retirement.     In the decades since, the typical retirement age of older workers has plummeted. The proportion of men aged 65 and over working or looking for work fell from 46% in 1950 to 17% last year. With life expectancy continuing to rise, the work force shrinking, and savings rates at an all-time low, the increasing length of retirement has come to be viewed as unsustainable.     To ease the penalty against working, the earnings test was gradually liberalized beginning in the 1950s, principally for people aged 65 and over. In 2000 a beneficiary aged 65-69 earning more than a limit of $17,000 loses $1 in benefits for every $3 in additional earnings - which functions as a 33% tax on wages. March 1996 legislation will raise the exempt amount to $30,000 by 2002. Beneficiaries aged 62-64 face a 50% tax rate for earnings above $10,800. Beginning in 2000, the tighter earnings test rules for people aged 62-64 will be extended to ages 65 and 66 as the normal retirement age gradually rises.     Moreover, beneficiaries do not appear to respond to the provision that they will be compensated later, in the form of a small percentage increase in benefits forever after they retire. If beneficiaries are indeed unaware of this provision, as suggested by some evidence, then the earnings test has the perverse effect of distorting people's choices as if they were taxed, yet raising virtually no revenue.    Some researchers have concluded that gradual liberalization of the earnings test rules means that the earnings test no longer ""bites"". They suggest that the earnings test no longer leads people to retire and has little effect on their hours of work. Two major problems arise with past studies. No one has analyzed data from after the 1970s, so previous results may be outdated. Also, no major changes in the earnings test rules occurred during the period studied in earlier research.     My strategy is to investigate several recent changes in the earnings test rules. It is easy to understand how people are influenced by the earnings test by observing how they respond when it is altered; otherwise it can be more difficult, since work decisions are shaped by many factors which we cannot observe and which change over time. The data I use show a strong response among workers to past changes in the earnings test, suggesting similar reactions if the earnings test were eliminated today. While the short-run costs of relaxing the earnings test would be substantial, the long-run costs are close to zero, since future benefits will not be raised as they are today to make up for current benefits lost to the earnings test.    The impact of the earnings test on hours of work.  In my research, I studied the response of workers to the earnings test by analyzing data on how much people work and earn, and how their behavior changed when the earnings test rules changed. (1) , (2)  Three important changes have occurred in the last twenty-five years. In 1978, the earnings limit was raised from $3,000 to $4,000 for workers aged 65-71, while it did not change for workers aged 62-64. In 1983, the earnings test was eliminated for workers aged 70-71, while it remained in place for workers aged 62-69. Lastly, in 1990 the earnings test tax rate was lowered from 50% to 33% for workers aged 65-69, but not for workers aged 62-64. The structure of each of these rule changes, affecting people of some ages and not other similar ages, is extremely useful. It allows us to control for other potential shifts in work hours by comparing earnings and hours of the affected and the unaffected age groups over the period when the rules changed.    The earnings data show that a significant proportion of workers respond to the earnings test and that they shifted their earnings when the rules changed. Figure 1 begins by showing earnings distributions  relative to the earnings limit  before and after the limit was raised for 65-71 year olds in 1978. The graphs compare the earnings of affected 67-69 year old men and of unaffected 63-64 year old men. Figure 1-A shows, before 1978, the number of older and younger workers with earnings in each $1000 interval above and below the earnings limit, as a proportion of the total number of people in the age group.    Figure 1-A demonstrates a strong response to earnings test before any change in the rules. Many people in both age groups were clustered just at or below the limit - over 20% of 67-69 year old workers have earnings within $1000 below the limit, along with almost 10% of 63-64 year old workers. Roughly the same number of people appeared in each increment for several intervals, followed by a big drop from the interval just below to just above the limit.     After 1978, the clustered 67-69 year olds moved up to the new earnings limit. First, Figure 1-B shows earnings of both age groups in relation to the  unchanged  earnings limit of the younger group. The 63-64 year olds kept their earnings at the same point, but the 67-69 year olds clearly shifted their earnings higher. Figure 1-C shows them clustered at their new higher limit. These changes were large and statistically significant.           Figure 2 makes the same comparisons around the earnings limit before and after 1983, when the earnings test was eliminated for 70-71 year olds. Figures 2-A illustrates earnings patterns before 1983 of the affected age group. (3)  They are juxtaposed with 73-75 year olds who do not face the earnings test and whose earnings decline smoothly over the same range. Figure 2-B shows the same comparisons after 1983. Now, the earnings of the affected 71-72 year olds decline smoothly over the range of the earnings limit, resembling the older group.       There was no noticeable reaction to the 1990 reduction in the earnings test tax rate. This is not inconsistent with the other strong reactions, however, because the 1990 change was smaller. The tax rate declined 17 percentage points from 50% to 33%, rather than falling to zero as it effectively did earlier. Predictions based on those earlier response suggest a small, ambiguous change in earnings when the tax rate declines.       The data above show one particular reaction to the earnings test, among people keeping their earnings just at the earnings limit. Others working more and losing some or all their benefits to the earnings test will also react, but that reaction is more ambiguous and is thus difficult to observe above. The reasons are as follows.    The earnings test alters the incentive to work in two different ways. It changes the net wage and also the total income of beneficiaries, depending on how much a beneficiary works. Although intuition suggests the earnings test causes beneficiaries to work less, this is not unambiguously true. Facing a higher marginal tax rate will cause people to work less, but reducing income may cause people to work more. Similarly, eliminating the earnings test will not lead all beneficiaries to work more. There are three different subgroups we have to consider, depending on how much someone is working when the earnings test is in place.         ·  The first group is the one discussed above, consisting of   people who hold their earnings just at or below the earnings limit. They will   unambiguously work more when the earnings limit is raised, the earnings test tax rate   lowered, or the earnings test eliminated.      ·  The second group consists of people earning somewhat more   than the limit and losing some but not all their benefits. In theory, we cannot   unambiguously predict whether they will work more or less if the earnings test is relaxed   or eliminated. They may work more because their marginal tax rate falls or less because   they have extra income. My research shows that on average people in this group will work   more.      ·  The third group consists of people earning considerably   more than the limit and losing all their benefits. Their marginal tax rate will not change   when the earnings test is eliminated, but their income will rise. This will induce them to   work less, if they can adjust their hours of work.       What about the increase in benefits later on?  Just as people are rewarded with higher benefits in the future if they delay claiming benefits today, beneficiaries also receive an increase in all future benefits for current benefits lost to the earnings test. Someone under age 65 gets a 6 2/3% increase in future benefits for each year's worth of benefits foregone. Someone aged 65-69 gets an adjustment that is gradually approaching 8%. These credits establish a tradeoff, actuarially fair for a person with average life expectancy, between a year's worth of benefits at present and a percentage increase in all future benefits.     However, there is no evidence that the credits are taken into account with regards to the earnings test. In all likelihood, many fewer people would respond to the earnings test and restrict their earnings, as we observe them doing in Figures 1 and 2. (4)  Furthermore, descriptions of the earnings test in the popular press generally fail to mention the adjustment. When both  Money  (Simon 1996) and the  Los Angeles Times  (Kristof 1997) have described how the earnings test works, neither mentioned that higher future benefits compensate for lost benefits today. The perverse result is that people respond to the earnings test as if it were a tax, yet it raises virtually no revenue over the long-run.    The predicted impact of eliminating the earnings test.  I used the information implicit in the response of workers to past changes in the earnings test to develop predictions about changes today, such as eliminating the earnings test or raising the earnings limit to $30,000.    Low earners, who keep their earnings just at or below the earnings limit are reacting most visibly to the earnings test and will be the most responsive to a change. Compared to their actual hours of work in 1995, they would be predicted to work 50% more on average, if the earnings test is eliminated. In comparison, medium earners would be predicted to work 18% more on average. As discussed earlier, they may work either more or less in theory because their marginal tax rate falls but their income rises. Thus, the evidence from past changes suggests that the tax rate effect dominates. Lastly, high earners would be predicted to work 4% less on average, because they have more income and their marginal tax rate does not change. In total, men aged 65-69 who were earning at least up to the earnings limit in 1995 would be predicted to work 5% more.    At this point, it is important to mention a caveat affecting high earners the most. These predictions have assumed that everyone can adjust their work hours flexibly. However, while those at the earnings limit do appear to have a lot of control over their hours, others who work full-time and earn more may have less flexibility. Thus, it is somewhat less likely that the group of high earners will actually change their hours, even though they are predicted to, compared to the low earners. This issue will also determine whether the earnings test affects retirement, as I discuss later.    It is interesting to compare the predictions of work hours if the earnings test is eliminated to the predictions when the earnings limit is raised to $30,000. Because this change is not as dramatic, people will not increase their work hours as much or will reduce their work hours more. The low earners would be predicted to work 34% more and the middle earners 7% more, while the high earners would be predicted to work 10% less. The differences arise because the tax rate gets pushed up onto higher earners. Raising the earnings limit removes the burden of the earnings test for many low earners but makes it bind more strongly for high earners.    One argument made against changing the earnings test is the fiscal cost. However, while the initial cost is relatively high, the long-run cost is declining towards zero, because benefits will not be lost today to the earnings test and thus future benefits will not be raised. (5)  As these adjustments are approximately actuarially fair on average, the fiscal cost of eliminating the earnings test today will be virtually canceled out within a number of years.    Another possible argument against relaxing the earnings test is that it would primarily benefit high income beneficiaries. It is true that total income would rise more for high earners, but the data show that most of the distortions to behavior are observed among low and medium earners. Their work hours would rise the most if the earnings test were lifted.    Other potential effects.  My research pertains directly to men aged 65-69 who are already working. Several other groups may be affected as well. I cannot offer as precise conclusions in their regard, but I will discuss some important considerations.        ·  It is essential to consider whether the earnings test   induces people to retire. If jobs are perfectly flexible, then someone who wants to work   but not lose benefits can limit their hours to keep their earnings below the limit. In   that case, the earnings test will not cause anyone to retire completely. However, if jobs   are not perfectly flexible, or if a part-time job involves a substantial cut in the hourly   wage, then it may not be feasible to earn less than the limit, and retirement may be   preferred to facing the earnings test. It is difficult to analyze the potential magnitude   of such effects which depend on unobserved conditions of jobs, rather than on their   observable work hours. Indirect evidence supports the notion that jobs are not perfectly   flexible, so we might expect that eliminating the earnings test would cause some people to   delay retirement.     ·  While my research focused on men, older women react   similarly to the earnings test. Thus, we can expect a similar change in work hours if the   earnings test is eliminated. A significantly smaller proportion of women work at these   ages, though, so a smaller number will be affected.     ·  People aged 62-64, and eventually 65-66 as well, face   much more restrictive earnings test rules, almost unchanged since the early 1970s. How do   these younger workers respond? The data show that some hold their earnings just below the   limit, as do older workers, while a greater proportion continue to work full-time.   Therefore, more workers at these ages might reduce their hours, relative to older workers,   if the earnings test is eliminated. However, it is among this group that the   ""retirement effect"" of the earnings test is crucial. If the earnings test causes   some 62-64 year olds to retire, eliminating it would have an extra punch because they are   likely to continue working longer than 65-69 year olds.      Conclusions.  The earnings test has been the subject of a great deal of popular attention, but less academic interest in recent years. I have used a new empirical strategy, analyzing the reactions to past changes in the earnings test rules, to arrive at several conclusions.     The data reveal a significant number of workers clustered just at the earnings limit. The clustering demonstrates that the earnings test leads some beneficiaries to hold down their hours of work. The clustering moved when the earnings limit moved and disappeared when the earnings test was eliminated for some ages. Thus, many beneficiaries react promptly and flexibly to changes in the earnings test.    The past reactions indicate how people might respond if the earnings test is changed today. According to my estimates, men aged 65-69 who were earning at least up to the earnings limit in 1995 would be predicted to work 5% more, in total. Low earners, just at or below the earnings limit, would work 50% more, medium earners would work 18% more, and high earners would work 4% less. In comparison, people would be predicted to increase their work hours less or reduce them more when the earnings limit is raised to $30,000. These differences arise because the tax rate is not eliminated, but gets pushed up onto higher earners. Lastly, it is important to recognize that the long-run cost of eliminating the earnings test is virtually zero.    References    Bondar, Joseph. 1993.

In 1989 the Social Security Administration estimated that almost one million retired-worker beneficiaries lost some or all of their benefits to the earnings test, accounting for over one-third of people aged 65-69. In addition, about a couple hundred thousand beneficiaries kept their earnings just at or below the earnings limit. See Leonesio (1990) and Bondar (1993).     2.  The analysis is based on large data files collected by the Bureau of Labor Statistics in its Current Population Survey (CPS). People surveyed in the March CPS report their earnings and hours of work during the previous year. The data and methods are described in detail in Friedberg (2000).     3.  Figures 2-A and 2-B actually show 71-72 year olds, since they were 70-71 when the reported earnings were earned.     4.  We would still expect a reaction among people with less than average life expectancy and people who are more impatient than average. Other evidence shows that more people claim benefits at age 62 than either of these factors predict, however, suggesting that people either do not know or do not care about the future adjustments.     5.  Leonesio (1993) reported Social Security Administration forecasts that eliminating the earnings test for ages 65-69 would raise payouts by $4.3 billion in the first year. Income, payroll and benefits taxes due to higher earnings would offset 14.8% of the cost. That forecast was based on a very small predicted change in work hours. My research results suggest a larger offset through taxes paid as people work more."
GX044-12-4729265	"Statement of Jane Baumgarten, Member, Board of Directors,  American Association of Retired Persons    Testimony Before the Subcommittee on Social Security  of the House Committee on Ways and Means    Hearing on Improving Social Security Work Incentives    February 15, 2000    AARP appreciates this opportunity to present its views on the Social Security earnings limit or ""retirement test."" The Association has long supported increasing the earnings limit and has been pleased to have worked with this committee and other Members of Congress to allow beneficiaries ages 65 through 69 to earn more without losing any earned Social Security benefits. AARP supported the legislation enacted in 1996 that phases in an increase in the earnings limit. That change will enable beneficiaries ages 65 to 69 to earn up to $30,000 in 2002 before their Social Security is reduced. The legislation not only helps older Americans who work in order to supplement their Social Security, but it also maintains the financial integrity of the Social Security trust funds.    The earnings limit discourages older people from remaining in the work force and contributing to the country's economic growth. Given the increased longevity and generally improved health of many retirees, the prospect of an aging society, and a slower-growing work force, it is critical that we find ways to better tap the valuable and still underutilized skills of older workers. It is equally important that we enable more beneficiaries to supplement their income without a penalty, just as many do with employer provided pensions and other  non-wage  income.    I. THE EARNINGS LIMIT IN PRACTICE    The earnings limit reduces the Social Security benefits of working beneficiaries up to age 70 whose earnings exceed an annually adjusted threshold. The retirement test is different for beneficiaries under age 65 than for those ages 65 through 69, and no longer applies when a beneficiary reaches age 70. In 2000, beneficiaries ages 62 through 64 lose $1 in benefits for every $2 in earnings above $10,080. Those ages 65 through 69 lose $1 in benefits for every $3 in earnings above the $17,000 limit in 2000. The earnings limit not only restricts the amount a beneficiary can earn from employment without losing any Social Security retirement benefits, but it also can affect spousal and dependent benefits.    Although Social Security has always had a retirement test, it has been modified over time by narrowing its applicability. For example, the age at which the test no longer applies was reduced to 75 in 1950, then to 72 in 1954, and in 1977 was lowered to age 70. The test was changed from measuring only monthly wages to one that measures monthly and yearly earnings. In 1960, the penalty for earnings above the threshold was altered from a total loss of monthly benefits to a reduction in benefits. Since 1972, the law has provided for an automatic, annual updating of the threshold in accordance with changes in average annual wages. The 1983 Social Security Amendments further eased the penalty for those ages 65 through 69 to a $1 benefit reduction for every $3 of excess earnings. In 1996, an increase was enacted that gradually raises the earnings threshold for beneficiaries ages 65 through 69 to $30,000 in 2002.    AARP believes we should continue to modify the retirement test to accommodate the aging of our population, evolving retirement patterns, and the needs of our labor market and our economy.    II. REASONS FOR CHANGE    Members of Congress and the Administration have proposed additional improvements in the earnings limit. Changes currently being considered include increasing or repealing the threshold for working beneficiaries ages 65 through 69 as well as adjusting the limit for those ages 62 through 64. Interest in additional improvements reflects a legitimate concern about the effect of current law on working beneficiaries, the administrative burdens imposed on the Social Security Administration (SSA), and the overall economic and societal benefits of encouraging older Americans to continue working.     AARP supports further liberalization, including repeal, of the earnings limit for those beneficiaries who continue working beyond the Normal Retirement Age. We recognize that there is a short-term cost to the trust funds and urge that the impact be minimized. However, the long-term financial impact on the program is negligible.     A. Effect on Beneficiaries    Most Social Security beneficiaries are not in the paid labor force and will not be affected by changing the earnings limit. Last year, Social Security Commissioner Apfel testified that during 1999, nearly 1.1 million beneficiaries had some or all of their benefits withheld because of work at or after age 62. (Statement before the Senate Democratic Task Force on Social Security, September 13, 1999) About 690,000 beneficiaries ages 65 through 69 lost some or all of their benefits because of excess earnings. In addition, 103,000 dependent and spousal beneficiaries were affected. Among beneficiaries ages 62-64, about 221,000 lost some or all of their Social Security because they worked, and 38,000 dependent and spousal beneficiaries were also affected.    In addition to those who lose benefits, many others who deliberately hold their earnings  below  the threshold in order to preserve their full benefit and maximize their retirement income are adversely affected by the earnings limit. Many in this group rely heavily on Social Security and are likely to have less in savings and/or pension income. For those who are capable and have the desire to earn more than the current earnings limit, the additional income from raising the limit can make a difference. Continued or increased employment may be the only option many working beneficiaries have to meet current expenses, repay debts, or set aside some income for a time when they will no longer be able to work.    Many affected older workers are perplexed by a penalty on earnings because non-working beneficiaries with the same or even larger incomes generated from other sources, such as pensions or capital gains, do not have to forego any benefits. They feel punished for their work initiative. The argument that Social Security was designed as a partial replacement for income lost due to retirement, and that the earnings limit is designed to measure whether a worker is retired, often does not resonate with beneficiaries who need income today and must work to augment their Social Security.    B. Administrative Problems    The retirement test creates administrative problems for the Social Security Administration. It spends $100 - $150 million annually to monitor excess earnings and update workers' wage records. The agency estimates that sixty-eight percent of its overpayments are due to the earnings limit. Changing the limit would ease Social Security's administrative burdens.    A substantially higher or repealed earnings limit also would mean less frustration and inconvenience for working beneficiaries. Misunderstanding about the earnings limit creates financial and emotional hardships when overpayments are recouped, especially from beneficiaries who depend on their earnings to supplement their Social Security. Beneficiaries who overestimate earnings will have more benefits withheld than necessary. These lost benefits may be restored, but a temporary reduction in income could have immediate economic consequences. In addition, some beneficiaries forfeit a month of benefits for failing to file a report of estimated earnings in a timely manner. They may be unaware of this annual filing requirement, especially if they return to the labor force some time after having filed for benefits. (Generally, beneficiaries receive information about filing an annual earnings estimate when they apply for Social Security.)    C. Effect on the Economy    While Social Security is intended as a partial replacement for income lost due to retirement, disability, or death of the worker, the definition of retirement has evolved to accommodate changing work patterns, labor shortages, and increased longevity. Some older individuals choose to gradually ease out of the work force rather than drop out entirely, and many continue working full-time or part-time because they need additional income. As our society continues to age and the pool of knowledgeable and willing workers lags behind demand, older workers will be needed in the work force more than ever.    If older Americans can earn more without penalty, there could be a greater incentive for them to work. Working beneficiaries will have additional money to contribute to the economy and will pay additional tax dollars into the federal treasury. Moreover, employed older people tend to remain healthy longer, suggesting the prospects for lower costs for the Medicare program.    D. Additional Costs    Working beneficiaries ages 65-69 who exceed the limit resent having to return 33 1/3 cents of their benefits to the government for each dollar earned. When the returned benefits are combined with payroll taxes, federal income taxes, state taxes, and income taxes on up to 85 percent of benefits, the cost of working can be quite high and acts as a strong disincentive to work. Those ages 65 through 69 who lose some of their benefits will receive a delayed retirement credit (DRC) that partially compensates for lost benefits. They are not made whole, however, because the current 6 percent DRC is not actuarially equivalent to the lost income. (The credit is being increased to the actuarially fair level of 8 percent by the year 2008, on a phased-in basis.)    III. CONCERNS ABOUT CHANGING THE EARNINGS LIMIT    While many policymakers and analysts recognize the value in changing the earnings limit for those who work past the Normal Retirement Age, some concerns remain. The most widely mentioned are the impact on the trust funds and the economic status of those who would benefit from the change.    A. The Cost Concern    Some oppose changing current law because it creates a modest cost to the trust funds over the short term. While this is true, SSA actuaries estimate that the long-term cost to the trust funds is negligible since the value of the total benefits paid to the individual over a lifetime does not change significantly. This results from the fact that those whose post-65 earnings cause a benefit loss will receive a delayed retirement credit, which currently does not fully compensate for the lost Social Security. With further liberalization (or elimination), the individual can earn more and receive a benefit now instead of getting a larger benefit later that includes a DRC. Once the DRC reaches 8 percent, the trust funds pay the individual roughly the same amount of lifetime total benefits; it is simply that the payout schedule differs.    The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) suggests that the overall costs associated with raising the limit may be overstated because the revenue generated by additional work is often disregarded. (SSA estimates the additional revenue would offset between 10 and 15 percent of the cost of repeal.) While the revenue gained from increased work force participation may be difficult to project because of uncertainties about the number of retirees who will increase their work effort and their earnings level, it is clear that some additional federal revenues will be collected. The primary revenue sources are the income tax, the payroll tax, and increased taxation of Social Security benefits.    B. Benefit Distribution Concern    Raising the earnings limit will have little impact on low and moderate income older Americans since many of them do not work or have earnings below current law thresholds. Middle income working beneficiaries, however, may be trying to cope with a smaller income, modest assets, and the prospect of increased longevity. Should we penalize beneficiaries who work to supplement their Social Security while other beneficiaries with the same or even higher incomes from pensions and non-wage income do not have a benefit reduction? What other options do these working beneficiaries have to increase their income and prepare for a time when ill health and/or advanced age may force them out of the work force?    Some oppose further improvements because they believe that only those with higher incomes would benefit. If the earnings limit is changed,  many  older Americans will benefit, including those with higher incomes. Higher income beneficiaries, however, will pay additional income and payroll taxes, as well as higher income taxes on their Social Security benefits. In any event,  all  beneficiaries age 70 and over regardless of earnings receive their full Social Security benefit without penalty.    IV. Changing the Earnings Limit for Beneficiaries Age 62 Through 64    There is widespread agreement on raising, if not eliminating, the earnings test for those ages 65 through 69, but there is no consensus about what changes should be made for the age 62-64 group.     Supporters of liberalization (or elimination) note that beneficiaries ages 62 through 64 may continue working or increase their work effort and thus continue to contribute to our economy. Some policy analysts observe that the earnings test for the younger group is a greater deterrent than many realize. They believe that if older workers withdraw from the labor force at age 62 because of the earnings test, they would be less inclined to enter the workforce at age 65 even if, at that age, there are no earnings restrictions.    Those who oppose eliminating the test for beneficiaries ages 62 through 64 cite the added short-term costs to the trust funds and the potential impact on the long-term economic well-being of those who would start collecting Social Security at 62 instead of waiting. The adverse impact will be greatest for the survivors of poor and modest income older beneficiaries who have less income from other sources to augment their Social Security. Workers who currently file for benefits at age 62 experience a twenty percent actuarial reduction because they begin receiving benefits before the Normal Retirement Age. As the age for collecting full benefits moves to age 67, future beneficiaries who collect benefits at 62 will face a thirty percent reduction. The effect of these substantially reduced benefits will not be apparent immediately while earnings supplement the Social Security benefit. The impact of a permanently reduced benefit, however, could be more pronounced later in life as older beneficiaries, particularly their survivors, become more reliant on Social Security income. Older beneficiaries have a greater chance of being poor, of having consumed their other assets, and of not being able to supplement their Social Security.     Opponents of repeal argue that if the earnings test remains in place, more people will continue to work and not collect benefits. As a result, upon retirement they and their survivors will receive a larger benefit.    AARP believes that because of the added trade-offs, further evaluation of the impact of any change for the age 62-64 group is necessary. While we should remove disincentives to continued work where possible, we must also ensure the long-term adequacy of Social Security benefits.    V. Conclusion    AARP is pleased that Congress and the Administration are revisiting the earnings limit. We strongly support removing penalties that discourage workers ages 65 through 69 from remaining in the workforce and contributing to the economy. This is good public policy. We look forward to working with this committee on a bipartisan basis to achieve this goal."

Work/life programs are spreading across Government and making it easier for Federal employees to balance all aspects of their lives, including helping employees with the adoption process.    This Adoption Benefits Guide provides questions and answers on leave programs and health and tax benefits available to Federal employees who are prospective adoptive parents.    It also provides information on other Federal adoption assistance, State adoption subsidy programs, and national adoption resources.       Leave Programs    The Federal Government has an impressive and flexible array of work/life leave options which support employees' family responsibilities and enhance the productivity of the workforce. Key components of the Federal leave system include: annual leave; sick leave; family and medical leave; family-friendly leave; leave for bone marrow and organ donation; leave sharing; and leave banks.    Two laws which have specific provisions for adoptive parents are Sick Leave for Adoption and the Family and Medical Leave Act.       Sick Leave for Adoption    This law became effective on September 30, 1994, and allows Federal employees to use sick leave for absences relating to adopting a child.    Following are some questions and answers regarding sick leave for adoption.    What adoption-related activities are covered?   The purposes for which an adoptive parent may request sick leave include appointments with adoption agencies, social workers, and attorneys; court proceedings; required travel; and any other activities necessary to allow the adoption to proceed.    Can I use sick leave for the purpose of bonding with my adopted child?   There is no provision in the law or regulation to permit the use of sick leave by birth parents or adoptive parents who choose to be absent from work to bond with a birth or adopted child.   However, you may use sick leave if required by the court or adoption agency to take time off from work to care for the newly adopted child.    Is the amount of sick leave I may use for adoption-related purposes limited to 13 days as it is for other family care purposes?    No. The amount of sick leave taken for adoption-related activities is not limited to 13 days and does not count towards the annual 13-day limit under the Family-Friendly Leave Act.     At one time, Federal employees were given the opportunity to request that sick leave be substituted for annual leave used for adoption purposes between September 30, 1991, and September 30, 1994. Is that still in effect?   No. That opportunity ended on September 30, 1996.       Family and Medical Leave Act    To help balance the demands of the workplace with the needs of the family, the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) was signed into law on February 5, 1993 (Public Law 103-3) and became effective on August 5, 1993. This law ensures that family and medical leave is available on a gender-neutral basis and mandates job security for employees who take leave. In addition, it accomplishes these purposes in a manner that accommodates the legitimate interests of employers.    Title II of the Act, ""Leave for Civil Service Employees,"" provides eligible Federal employees an entitlement to a total of 12 administrative workweeks of unpaid leave during any 12-month period for certain family and medical needs.    For what purposes can leave be taken under the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA)?   FMLA provides eligible Federal employees with an entitlement to  12 workweeks of unpaid leave during any 12-month period for the following purposes :       birth of a son or daughter of the employee and care of the newborn;*     placement of a son or daughter with the employee for adoption or foster care;*     care of a spouse, son, daughter, or parent of the employee who has a serious health condition; and     a serious health condition of the employee that makes the employee unable to perform the essential functions of his or her position.        * Entitlement to 12 weeks of leave expires 12 months after the date of birth or placement for adoption or foster care. (Employees may begin this leave prior to the birth or placement.)    How much leave can I take each year under the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA)?   You are entitled to a total of up to 12 workweeks of unpaid leave during any 12-month period (not necessarily a calendar year or leave year). The 12-month period begins on the date you first take the leave and continues for 12 months. You are not entitled to 12 additional weeks of leave under FMLA until the previous 12-month period ends and an event or situation occurs that entitles you to another period of such leave. (This may include a continuation of a previous situation or circumstance, e.g., a serious health condition.)    What justification is required to use leave under the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA)?    You may be required to provide advance leave notice and medical certification. Ordinarily, you must provide 30 days advance notice when the need for leave is  foreseeable . If the need for leave is not foreseeable, e.g., because of a medical emergency, you must provide notice within a reasonable period of time appropriate to the circumstances involved. An agency may require medical certification to support a request for leave because of a serious health condition and may require second or third opinions (at the employer's expense).   If you cannot provide the required medical certification before FMLA leave is to begin, you must be provided  provisional  leave. Once this leave has commenced and you fail to provide the medical certification, the agency may charge you as absent without leave (AWOL) or may allow you to request that the provisional leave be charged as leave without pay or to your appropriate leave account.    What are the job benefits and protections provided under the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA)?    Upon return from this leave, you must be returned to the same position or to an equivalent position with equivalent benefits, pay, status, and other terms and conditions of employment. When you take FMLA leave, you are entitled to maintain health benefits coverage and may choose to pay the employee share of the premium on a current basis or pay upon return to work. The use of this leave cannot result in the loss of any employment benefit that accrued prior to the start of your leave.    Can I substitute paid leave for leave under the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA)?    You may elect, but  the agency may not require you , to substitute advanced, accrued or accumulated annual and/or sick leave for the unpaid leave in accordance with current law and regulations. You may  not  retroactively substitute paid time off for unpaid leave under FMLA. FMLA leave is  in addition to  other paid time off available to you.   Under certain conditions, this leave may be taken intermittently, or you may work under a work schedule that is reduced by the number of hours of leave taken as family and medical leave.       Additional Leave Benefits    Further information on additional leave benefits may be obtained from the Office of Personnel Management's (OPM) brochure, ""Family-Friendly Leave Policies for Federal Employees."" This publication is available on OPM ONLINE and can be ordered from the Government Printing Office (LEAVE-95-1, November 1995).    You may also contact your agency personnel office, or OPM's Compensation Administration Division at (202) 606-2858.       Health Benefits    Federal employees may cover a legally adopted child or a foster child under their Federal Employees Health Benefits (FEHB) family enroll-ment upon showing proof of the child's eligibility as a family member. The child must be single, under the age of 22, and financially dependent on the employee. Proof of adoption or foster child status must be provided by the employee.    Following are some questions and answers regarding health benefits.    Do adopted and foster children receive the same health coverage as the Federal employee?    The child receives the same health benefits coverage that is available to the Federal employee and all other family members. There are no exclusions or waiting periods because of preexisting medical conditions.   A child who meets the definition of ""member of family"" under the Federal Employees Health Benefits (FEHB) law receives coverage regardless of whether he or she has coverage under Medicaid.    Where do I apply for coverage for my adopted or foster child?    You must apply at your employing office. The employing office makes the determination whether the child meets the requirements for an adopted or foster child based on documents you provide.    What proof must I provide for an adopted child?    You must provide the final decree papers.    What are the requirements for covering foster children?    The child must be living with you, you must be raising the child as your own, and you must have assumed full parental responsibility and control of the child. There must be an expectation that you will continue to raise the child into adulthood. A child living with you under a pre-adoption agreement may qualify as a foster child.   Under the Federal Employees Health Benefits (FEHB) law, a foster child is an unmarried dependent child under 22 years of age who lives with you in a regular parent-child relationship; not a child who is temporarily living with you nor one who is placed in your home by a welfare or social service agency which retains control of the child and pays for maintenance.    Must I obtain a court order for custody in order to cover my foster child on my health benefits enrollment?    A court order for  permanent  custody is acceptable as proof of dependency, but is not necessarily required.   However, a court order for temporary custody or a Power of Attorney is not acceptable proof for health benefits enrollment. Other acceptable proof of foster child status are:     evidence that the child has been included as a dependent on your tax returns for previous years;    canceled checks, money orders, or receipts for periodic payments received from you for or on behalf of the child;    evidence of goods or services which show regular or substantial contributions of considerable value; and    sworn affidavits from people unrelated to you that the child lives in your home.       The employing office will ultimately make the final decision as to what proof is acceptable in an individual case.    When does health coverage for an adopted or a foster child begin?    Coverage for an adopted child begins the day the adoption decree is final.    Coverage for a foster child begins the first day of the pay period in which the employing office receives all properly completed documents necessary to establish eligibility of the child as a foster child.    I will be traveling overseas to pick up a child who I am adopting and will be staying three to four weeks to ensure the paperwork goes through. Since the child might qualify only as a foster child prior to final adoption, how will she meet the ""living with"" requirement when she is not at my home back in the States?    It is true a child is not considered adopted until the adoption is final. Nevertheless, the child would meet the foster child requirement even though the child is not technically residing with you at your permanent home. The effective date would be the first day of the pay period in which you begin living with the child overseas.    When does an adopted or foster child's health benefits coverage stop?    Health benefits stop when the child reaches the age of 22, marries, or is no longer dependent on the employee. Health benefits can continue after age 22 if the person is incapable of self-support because of a disability incurred before age 22. Contact your employing offical for information on how to continue coverage in such cases.    Would my adopted or foster child qualify for continued health benefits under the temporary continuation of coverage (TCC) provisions of the Federal Employees Health Benefits (FEHB) law?    The TCC provisions allow children who no longer qualify as a dependent child (e.g., child reaches age 22, marries before age 22, no longer lives with the employee) to continue their FEHB coverage for up to 36 months. The child is enrolled in his or her own right and pays both the employee and the Government's share of the premium, plus an additional 2% administrative cost. You should notify your employing office within 60 days after the child no longer qualifies for cover-age as a family member.    A child who loses FEHB coverage for any reason other than by cancellation has a 31-day temporary extension of coverage, at no cost, for the purpose of converting to a non-group contract with his or her current health benefits plan. To convert the child's coverage to a non-group plan, you or your child must apply directly to the health benefits plan within 31 days after the child's eligibility ends.    For further information on health benefits, contact your personnel office.       Tax Benefits for Adoption    Effective January 1, 1997, adoptive parents may be able to take a new tax credit for qualifying expenses paid to adopt an eligible child. The adoption credit is a non-refundable credit that you subtract from your tax liability.    Also, money or other benefits from a private sector employer for qualifying adoption expenses may be excluded from your gross income. (The Federal Government does not provide such benefits, but you might work part-time for a private sector employer or your spouse might be employed by a private sector employer.)    Following are some questions and answers regarding tax benefits.    What are qualifying expenses in the adoption process?    Qualifying expenses are reasonable and necessary adoption fees, court costs, attorney fees, and other expenses directly related to, and whose principal purpose is for, the legal adoption of an eligible child.    What are non-qualifying adoption expenses?    Non-qualifying adoption expenses include:     expenses that violate State and Federal law;    expenses for carrying out any surrogate parenting arrangement;    expenses for the adoption of your spouse's child;    expenses paid using funds received from any Federal, State, or local program; and    expenses allowed as a credit or deduction under any other Federal income tax rule.       What is the definition of eligible child?    An eligible child is:     Under 18 years old, or    Physically or mentally incapable of caring for himself or herself.       How long will the adoption credit be in effect?    It will be in effect until December 31, 2001. After 2001, the adoption credit will apply only to qualifying expenses for adopting an eligible child with special needs.    What is the definition of an eligible child with special needs?    An eligible child with special needs is a U.S. citizen or resident where a State (or the District of Columbia or a U.S. possession) determines that the child cannot or should not be returned to his or her parent's home and probably will not be adopted unless adoption assistance is provided to the adoptive parents.    Factors used to determine if a child has special needs could include:     the child's ethnic background;    the child's age;    whether the child is a member of a minority or sibling group; and    whether the child has a medical condition or physical, mental, or emotional disability.    A foreign child, who is not a U.S. citizen or resident, cannot be treated as a child with special needs.      When do I take the adoption tax credit for expenses paid for a child who is a U.S. citizen or resident?    If you adopt a child who is a U.S. citizen or resident (and the adoption is not final) you take the adoption credit, not in the year that you paid expenses to adopt, but in the following tax year. The tax credit for adoption expenses paid in the year when the adoption becomes final, is taken in that same year.    When do I take the adoption credit for expenses paid for a child who is not a U.S. citizen or resident?    If you adopt a child who is not a U.S. citizen or resident, you cannot take the adoption credit until the adoption becomes final. Credit can be taken only for the year the adoption becomes final. Adoption expenses paid earlier are treated as paid during the year the adoption becomes final.    How do I claim the credit or exclusion?    You must file Internal Revenue Service (IRS) Form 8839 with either Form 1040 or Form 1040A to claim the credit or exclusion. Your income tax package has specific instructions.   If you are married, you must file a joint return to take the adoption credit or qualify for the income exclusion. If you are legally separated from your spouse for the last six months of the tax year, you may be able to file a separate return and still take the credit or qualify for the exclusion.   You must identify, on the tax return for the year you claim the credit or exclusion, all eligible children for whom you paid expenses to adopt. You must give (if known) the child's name, age, and taxpayer identification number.   If you do not know the above information, you may be required to give other identifying information including the name of an agent who assisted with the adoption.    Are the credit and the exclusion for qualifying adoption expenses subject to a dollar limit and an income limit?    Yes. These limits apply separately.    What is the dollar limit?    The amount of expenses that you can claim as a credit or the amount of private employer-provided adoption assistance (if your spouse works for a private sector employer or if you work part-time for a private sector employer) that you can exclude from your income is limited to $5,000 for each effort to adopt an eligible child or $6,000 for each effort to adopt an eligible child with special needs. This is the maximum that can be claimed over all taxable years.   If more than one person is claiming expenses for a child, the limit applies to the total expenses paid for the child. That is, they are limited to $5,000 between them (or $6,000 if expenses are for a child with special needs). Anything over that limit cannot be claimed as credit in any year.    What is the income limit?    The income limit is based on modified adjusted gross income (AGI). If your modified AGI is $75,000 or less, you are not subject to any income limit. If your modified AGI is more than $75,000, but less than $115,000, the credit phases out. If your modified AGI is $115,000 or more, you cannot take the credit or exclusion.    What happens to unused credit?    The amount of your allowable adoption credit for a year cannot be more than your regular tax liability for that year, minus certain other credits.   If your credit is more than this limit, you can carry the unused credit to your next five tax years, or until used, whichever comes first.    Can both a credit and an exclusion be claimed for expenses of adopting an eligible child?    Yes. You may claim both a credit and an exclusion, but they cannot be claimed for the same expense.    For more information on tax benefits for adoption, contact the Internal Revenue Service at 1-(800) 829-1040.       Adoption Assistance Programs    Two adoption assistance programs that you should be aware of are the Federal Title IV-E Adoption Assistance and State Adoption Subsidy Programs. Eligibility criteria for State adoption subsidies vary. Check with your adoption agency and State adoption officials to find out what your State allows.     Federal Title IV-E Adoption Assistance    Under this assistance program, parents of an eligible child may receive a monthly subsidy for the ordinary needs of the child. These payments are not designated for a specific purpose such as medical expenses, living expenses or special services. The funds may be used for any identifiable needs of the child.    An eligible child is one who has been determined by the State to be a special needs child, i.e., free for adoption and considered hard to place because of a specific factor or condition (member of a sibling group, medically disabled, etc.). In some circumstances, the State must make an effort to place the child without adoption subsidy.    Adoptive parents do not have to meet any financial eligibility criteria to receive adoption assistance on behalf of their child. A child for whom Title IV-E adoption assistance is provided is automatically eligible for medical assistance under Title XIX (Medicaid) and may receive social services under Title XX.    In addition, non-recurring adoption expenses (legal fees, court costs) are available to adoptive parents. A non-recurring adoption expense is a one-time adoption fee that is necessary for the adoption of a special needs child, which is not incurred in violations of State and Federal law, and has not been reimbursed from other sources or other funds.     State Adoption Subsidy Programs    These programs provide assistance for children who are not eligible under the Federal Title IV-E program. Adoption subsidies take various forms in different States depending on the child's needs and State agency's program. Under State-funded pro-grams, there are generally three types of adoption subsidies: medical, maintenance, and special services. Medical subsidies cover some or all forthe costs related to a child's specific medical condition that are not covered by the family's health insurance. They may also cover the costs of related therapy, rehabilitation and special education. Some States provide medical assistance through Medicaid which also pays for health care needs not covered by the adoptive family's health insurance policy or other community resources. Maintenance or support subsidies are direct payments to the adoptive family to help cover the child's living expenses.    Special service subsidies are usually one-time payments to cover a child's emergency needs or other extra-ordinary needs; less often, they are repeated payments for services not covered by medical or maintenance subsidies. Each State determines what is an allowable cost.    Further information on adoption assistance can be obtained by calling the National Adoption Information Clearinghouse at (703) 352-3488; the National Adoption Center at (215) 735-9988; and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' Children's Bureau at (202) 205-8618.       Office of Work/Life Programs    The Office of Personnel Management's (OPM) Office of Work/Life Programs is available to provide technical assistance and advice to agencies to help them develop or enhance work/life policies and programs, including adoption.    Please call the Office of Work/Life Programs staff at (202) 606-5520 or email  workandfamily@opm.gov  for further information and assistance.

It provides material and services to help residents meet their personal, educational, and professional needs.  Emphasis is placed on providing citizens information through an ever-changing variety of media resources.          General Library Objectives        To provide a free, legally established public library that will serve all residents of York County without discrimination and in full cooperation with the Library of Virginia.    To identify the library needs of the area – educational, cultural, and recreational – and to develop a long-range library plan to fill those needs.    To select books, audiovisuals, and other library materials, process these, and make them available to the public.     To recognize the total composition of the area – including such factors as age; cultural diversity; and educational, economic, and recreational needs – when acquiring library materials.      To support and endorse the “Freedom to Read” statement and the “Library Bill of Rights.”                        Return to Top               Persons to Be Served        The library will serve the residents of the County of York.  Service will be neither denied nor abridged on the grounds of racial, religious, socioeconomic or political status.    The library will also serve persons residing outside of York County who demonstrate a reasonable need for this service.  There is no non-resident fee.  This service is subject to discontinuance if it appears that service to York County residents is in any way limited.    Interlibrary Loan service will be extended to residents of the County of York exclusively.  This transaction will be a function of the Reference Department.    If an individual or group makes excessive demands on the library, thereby affecting service to the general public, then service to the individual or group may be limited.    The use of the library and its services may be denied to people who fail to return library materials, accumulate excessive fines, destroy library property, act in an objectionable fashion in the library, or refuse to obey library rules.                        Return to Top               CIRCULATION POLICY      These policies are meant to ensure equitable access to material among library patrons.  If, on occasion, library personnel feel that the strict interpretation of the Registration and Circulation Policies would have the opposite effect, they should feel free to exercise their judgment and/or bring the matter to a supervisor.          Membership        Library cards may be issued to any Hampton Roads area resident at least four years old.  (A parent or guardian must sign the application for an applicant younger than sixteen.)  Proof of identity is required as well as proof of current address.  Proof of address may be delayed until the next library visit.    Institutions may receive an institutional library card if the institution indicates it is willing to be responsible for returning materials, paying fines for overdue materials and paying for lost materials.  Apply to the Head of Circulation.    Five items may be borrowed at time of registration.    Individuals who will be in the area less than six months may apply for temporary library cards.  A patron may borrow up to five items at a time with a temporary card.    In the interest of maintaining accurate records, patrons are asked once a year to verify their addresses and telephone numbers.  Each July 1, the memberships of those patrons who have not used their cards in three years will be deleted.                        Return to Top               Lost and Damaged Cards          A damaged card that cannot be used is replaced free.  A card that is lost or discarded by the patron is replaced once free of charge.  After that, there is a charge of $2 for a new card.  (When this happens, a patron may borrow one time using ID alone.)          Circulation Period and Renewals        Books and audiocassettes are loaned for three weeks and may be renewed once by telephone, online, or in person unless they have been reserved.    New adult fiction and New York Times best sellers are loaned for two weeks. They may not be renewed.    Videocassettes are loaned for two weeks and may be renewed once.    A maximum of 50 items may be loaned out on one card at one time. (30 items for non-residents.)    New books – limit of 5 on loan to the same borrower                        Return to Top               Fines and Fees        Adult and Juvenile Non-Fiction Books – 10 cents per day    Juvenile Fiction and Easy-Reading Books – 5 cents per day    Audiocassettes – 10 cents per day    Videocassettes – $.50 per day    Pamphlets – 10 cents per day per group      Maximum Fines:      Videocassettes –  $5.00 each    Pamphlets – $1 per group    Adult Books, Juvenile Non-Fiction, Audiocassettes –$5 each    Easy-Reading Books – $3 each                        Return to Top               Charges for Lost Items          The charge for lost items is the current replacement cost, plus a processing fee.  The processing fee is equal to the maximum fine.  The purchase price (or default price on very old items) is charged.    When a lost item is paid for and then found, the amount paid—less  the processing fee—is returned if it is within six months of the due date and the item has not been replaced.          Overdue Notices        Telephone reminder at 2 weeks.    Written reminder at 4 weeks.    At 60 days (after due date) the item is declared lost and a bill for its replacement cost is sent.  The patron is blocked from borrowing further items until payment in full is made.                        Return to Top               Interlibrary Loans        The York County Public Library will lend books on interlibrary loan.  Titles in high demand, reference materials, Virginia reference, periodicals, microfilm, microfiche and audio- and videocassettes will not be loaned.  The loan period is three weeks.    Interlibrary loan service is available only to York County residents who hold a valid York County Public Library membership card.  Other patrons are asked to use libraries in their area of residence for interlibrary loan requests.    The York County Public Library does not charge for interlibrary loans;  however, the borrower will be required to pay fees charged by the lending  institution.  The overdue fee for interlibrary loan items is 50 cents per day.  Fines are put in the donation fund.    If there are no reserves on the title, and it is not in a special collection, books on interlibrary loan may be renewed on request one time.    Requested items that are checked out may be reserved.    Copies of up to ten pages of non-circulating materials will be provided on request at no charge.    If an interlibrary loan item is lost, the lending library establishes the cost of the lost item, which is charged to the responsible borrower, including any fees charged.                           Return to Top                 MEETING ROOM POLICY     The York County Public Library has two meeting rooms available for public use by non-profit organizations.  The Yorktown Library’s meeting room seats sixty-three (63) people, or forty-eight (48) with tables.  The Tabb Library’s meeting room seats one hundred and ten (110) people, or seventy-eight (78) with tables.  There is no fee for the use of the rooms.    The meeting rooms are available for public gatherings of non-profit organizations; groups of a cultural, civic or educational character or entities sponsored by such organizations; or organizations whose purpose is to support the library system.  They are not available for social gatherings, money raising events, or commercial purposes.    The meeting rooms are available for use during the Library’s operating hours.      Reservations are accepted on a first-come, first-served basis.  Although every reasonable effort will be made to avoid canceling any group’s previously scheduled meeting, programs and meetings sponsored by the Library or the York County Government will always take precedence.     Seating arrangements and set-up are the responsibility of reserving group.  Groups are asked to arrive early enough to set up chairs, if necessary, and to return the room to the same arrangement it was in when they arrived.                        Return to Top               Scheduling          A meeting room application form must be completed by the group leader prior to the first meeting. Reservations for use of the rooms may be made in person at the library or by fax.  The signature on the form indicates that he or she has read and agrees to abide by the rules governing the use of the meeting rooms.  The rooms will be assigned in order of receipt of qualifying applicants.  The Manager of Library Services is authorized to deny permission to use the rooms to any group that is disorderly or objectionable in any way, or that violates the meeting room regulations.    Applicants must include the following information on the application: the name of the organization; the time, date, and site desired; the number of persons expected (no less than 10); and the name and telephone number of the person filing the application (who will be responsible for use of the room).  Applicants are asked to include an alternate contact person, in case the applicant cannot be reached.    Applicants must request the equipment they intend to use.                        Return to Top               Regulations        Food and non-alcoholic drinks may be served in the meeting rooms.  Both meeting rooms have kitchen units available for group use.  Please remember that the Yorktown meeting room’s facilities and equipment are shared with the Library staff.    Each group is responsible for tidying and straightening the rooms after their use.    Children and youth groups using the meeting rooms must have adult sponsors with them.    The fact that a group is permitted to use the meeting rooms does not in any way constitute an endorsement of the group’s policies or beliefs.    Groups may schedule up to two meetings per month for two months, equaling four meetings within a two-month period. Groups may schedule additional meetings the day of the last meeting of the first month, as long as the group does not exceed the limit of two meetings per month and four meetings scheduled in total. A new application must be completed with each scheduling.    Should the meeting rooms be used for exhibits or displays, the Library is not responsible for loss or damage to any article on display belonging to an individual.    When the meeting room key is obtained, the applicant must show identification and sign for it.  Applicants must return the key immediately after unlocking the meeting room doors and the equipment room doors.    It is the responsibility of the group to make certain the outside door is locked when the meeting is finished.    Applicants will be responsible for the meeting room and any damages.    Failure to abide by these regulations will result in the loss of meeting room privileges.                        Return to Top               After-Hours Use        If arrangements are made in advance, a meeting may be allowed to take place before and/or after normal operating hours.  Meetings must be concluded no later than 10 PM.    When the meeting room key is obtained, the applicant must show identification and sign for it.  The key must be returned the following day or deposited in the after hours book-drop.  Failure to return the key by the following day will result in the loss of future meeting rooms privileges.    Patrons may enter the Yorktown Library through the front door. At the Tabb Library, patrons may enter the building through the front doors or the side door in the meeting room.    Before exiting the building, patrons responsible for the meeting room must lock the front doors of the library and the side meeting room doors.                        Return to Top                INTERNET POLICY     The York County Public Library provides free public access to the Internet as a part of an ongoing effort to meet the informational, educational and recreational needs of the community.  A York County library card is required to access the Internet.  The Library has no control over information on the Internet and cannot be held responsible for its accuracy, reliability or timeliness.  Users should carefully judge the worth of these sources and use them with discretion.    It is the responsibility of the parents or legal guardians, not library staff, to determine what is appropriate for their children.  Any restrictions to a minor’s access to the Internet must come from them.    As the possession and distribution of obscene materials and child pornography are both illegal in the Commonwealth of Virginia, patrons may not use library electronic equipment to access, view, download or print these materials. See (Code of Virginia Section 18.2-372 through 18.2-391.1; United States Code Title 18 Chapter 71 & 110)    Internet patrons are bound by local, state, and federal laws relating to copyrights, security, pornography, and other statutes regarding electronic media including but not limited to:      The Privacy Protection Act    The Computer Fraud and Abuse Act    The Computer Virus Eradication Act    The Virginia Computer Crimes Act    The Electronic Communications and Privacy Act    The U. S. Copyright Act    Credit Card Fraud Act      Patrons must respect the library’s system security mechanisms.  Computer settings and configurations are not to be changed.    Patrons must not willfully damage any computer equipment or software.  See (Code of Virginia Section 18.2-138).    Patrons must respect the privacy of other Internet users.    Failure to comply with the policy will result in a loss of Internet privileges.    Violation of local, state, or federal laws may lead to prosecution.                        Return to Top               UNATTENDED CHILD POLICY     The York County Public Library offers a welcoming, educational, and safe place for you and your child.    Parents, guardians, and caregivers are responsible for the safety, behavior, and supervision of their children at all times in the Library and on Library property.    Children, like all library users, are required to respect Library property and to act in a manner appropriate to the use and function of the Library.    Children ages 10 and under must be accompanied by a parent, guardian, or caregiver age 16 or older at all times and in all areas of the Library and its property except when participating in a Library sponsored program, such as Story Time.     Older children and adolescents who come to the Library without a parent, guardian, or caregiver are welcome for appropriate use of the Library, such as homework or reading.  Vandalism and disruptive behavior will not be tolerated and may serve as grounds for removal from Library property.    Parents, guardians, and caregivers should be aware of Library opening and closing times and make suitable arrangements to meet and/or transport their children.  In the even that a minor 17 or younger is left after Library hours and no one can be contacted to provide transportation, the staff will call the York County Sheriff’s Office for assistance.  Staff will not transport children home or to any other destination under any circumstances.                        Return to Top               Group Visit Policy        The York County Public Library welcomes visits from groups, such as schools, daycare centers, and home-schooling groups.    Groups of children must be accompanied by an adult. Groups of eight (8) or more children must be accompanied by at least two adults.    Teachers or group leaders are responsible for group discipline and must remain with the group the entire visit.    The behavior of the group should not disturb other Library patrons.                        Return to Top               Philosophy Behind Unattended Child Policy        We are glad your children are here!  We want our library to be a welcoming, educational and safe place for your child.          Our library staff is here to serve you and has many duties to perform in order to help all of our patrons in the best way possible.  As a result, they cannot monitor the whereabouts or behavior of our smallest patrons — your children.  Staff cannot assume the responsibility of a child’s care when they use the library.        A child could be lured away by a stranger or become ill.  A child could wander outside and become lost or injured.  An emergency could dictate that we evacuate the building.  We are primarily concerned with your child’s safety and feel this policy better assures his or her well-being.          Therefore, the behavior and welfare of children in the library are the responsibility of the parents or guardian accompanying the child to the library.

GX018-83-11117713	Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration                  The Center for Mental Health Services                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Question #1                How many people are homeless? Why?                             How many?               In 1996, an estimated 637,000 adults were homeless in a given               week. In the same year, an estimated 2.1 million adults were homeless               over the course of a year. These numbers increase dramatically               when children are included, to 842,000 and 3.5 million, respectively. 1               Over a five-year period, about 2–3 percent of the U.S. population               (5–8 million people) will experience at least one night of               homelessness. For the great majority of these people, the experience               is short and often caused by a natural disaster, a house fire,               or a community evacuation. 2               A much smaller group, perhaps as many as 500,000 people, have               greater difficulty ending their homelessness. As one researcher               who examined a sample of this group over a two-year period found: 3                                Most—about 80%—exit from homelessness within                 about 2–3 weeks. They often have more personal, social,                 and economic resources to draw on than people who are homeless                 for                 longer periods of time.                                                   About 10% are homeless for up to two months, with housing                   availability and affordability adding to the time they are                 homeless.                                                    Another group of about 10% is homeless on a chronic, protracted                 basis—as long as 7–8 months in a two-year period.                 Disabilities associated with mental illnesses and substance use                 are common.                 On any given night, this group can account for up to 50% of those                 seeking emergency shelter.                            Why?               The reasons why people become homeless are as varied and complex               as the people themselves. Several  structural factors  contribute               greatly to homelessness.                               Poverty . People who are homeless are the poorest of the                   poor. In 1996, the median monthly income for people who were                 homeless was $300, only 44% of the Federal poverty level for                 a single adult. 4                 Decreases in the numbers of manufacturing and industrial jobs                 combined with a decline in the real value of minimum wage by                 18% between                   1979 and 1997 have left significant numbers of people without                 a livable income. 5                                                   Housing . The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban                 Development estimates that there are five million households                 in the U.S.                 with incomes below 50% of the local median who pay more than                 half of                   their income for rent or live in severely substandard housing.                   This is worsened by a decline in the number of housing units                 affordable to extremely low income households by 5% since 1991,                 a loss of                   over 370,000 units. Federal rental assistance has not been                 able to bridge the gap; the average wait for Section 8 rental                 assistance                   is now 28 months. 6                                                                    Disability.  People with disabilities                 who are unable to work and must rely on entitlements such as                 Supplemental Security                   Income (SSI) can find it virtually impossible to find affordable                   housing. People receiving Federal SSI benefits, which were                   $545 per month in 2002, cannot cover the cost of an efficiency                   or one-bedroom apartment in any major housing market in the               country. 7                                         There are also several  individual risk factors  that may                           increase people’s vulnerability to becoming homeless                           and experiencing homelessness on a longer basis. 8                              Untreated mental illness  can cause individuals to                             become paranoid, anxious, or depressed, making it                 difficult or impossible to maintain employment, pay bills, or                 keep                             supportive social relationships.                                                                 Substance abuse  can                       drain financial resources, erode supportive social relationships,                       and can also make exiting                               from homelessness extremely difficult.                                                                 Co-occurring disorders.  Individuals with co-occurring                             mental illnesses and substance use disorders are                 among the most difficult to stably house and treat due to the                 limited                             availability of integrated mental health and substance                     abuse                             treatment in most localities.                                                                 Other circumstances . People might also find themselves                         homeless for a variety of other reasons including domestic                         violence, chronic or unexpected health care expenses,                 release from incarceration, “aging out” of youth                 systems such as foster care, or divorce or separation.                                           1 Burt, M.R., Aron, L.Y., Lee, E., and Valente, J.J.,                (2001) Helping America's Homeless.

GX254-48-9830319	"THE CHICAGO CONTINUUM OF CARE  VISION STATEMENT In ten years, all individuals and families facing homelessness in Chicago will have access to safe, decent, affordable housing and the resources and supports needed to sustain it. WHAT WE BELIEVE Homelessness is a complex social problem, which does not lend itself to simple solutions. Yet we believe that great strides can be made toward ending homelessness if we start by addressing housing issues, then ensure that there are the resources and supports in place to sustain that housing. While we do not have to end poverty in its entirety to end homelessness, ultimately, our ability to end homelessness rests upon the degree to which we are able to wed the efforts of the homeless service delivery system to those of other mainstream programs and systems of care  programs and systems whose failures have contributed to its growth. Only through comprehensive, cross systems strategies will we be able to fully assist people to access and sustain affordable housing and achieve community integration and economic stability. This effort will take all of us. As this 10-year plan details, Chicago is ready to embrace the challenge of system change and integration necessary to prevent homelessness and end it for the thousands of men, women, and children in shelter or on the streets each night who could and should be sleeping in their own beds.

Unfortunately, so has the number of individuals and families who become homeless. The Chicago Continuum of Care  an inclusive network of over 200 public and private organizations and individuals concerned with homelessness in Chicago  has come together to create a plan to end homelessness in the next ten years. This is no small task. Our success hinges upon our ability to mobilize, re-deploy, expand, and coordinate our financial and human resources, with the recognition that it will truly take all of us to end homelessness in Chicago. Getting Housed, Staying Housed: A Collaborative Plan to End Homelessness outlines, in broad strokes, the philosophy that will guide our efforts, the fundamental components of the approach we will take, and three strategic initiatives, which will organize our actions over the next five years.  What We Know Tens of thousands of Chicagoans face homelessness each year. Many of these utilize the city's publicly funded system of shelter and supports designed to address homelessness. Some stay for brief periods and do not return. Others graduate through multiple programs before exiting. Others move in and out of the system on a fairly regular basis over time. And still others take up residence in the system for years, and during that time, rarely leave it. In addition, there are those who experience homelessness, but for numerous reasons, never find their way into the system. Instead, they are homeless on the streets, in their cars, or on the couches of family, friends, or strangers. Overall Chicago's homeless population is highly diverse. Yet those facing homelessness have at least two things in common  the experience of abject poverty and the absence of safe and affordable housing. Our current system and resources have proven inadequate to the challenge of significantly reducing, let alone ending, homelessness. A new approach is needed.  Core Tenets of the New Approach The most effective solution to homelessness is to provide affordable housing with the supports that make it sustainable. In our efforts to do this we will: 1) Prevent homelessness whenever possible; 2) Rapidly re-house people when homelessness cannot be prevented; 3) Provide wraparound services that promote housing stability and self-sufficiency.  Page 2   Five-Year Strategic Initiatives The plan outlines three strategic initiatives to begin the process of system change. These initiatives and their objectives form our agenda for change over the next five years. Through them we will: 1) Expand the range and availability of prevention strategies, increase their immediate accessibility, and improve their long-term effectiveness. 2) Expand the availability of affordable permanent housing; increase its accessibility; and transition the existing tiered shelter system into a Housing First system. 3) Provide transitional services that ensure linkage to community resources, and increase the availability and awareness of formal community supports.  Implementing the Plan A shift as fundamental as the one described in this plan  that entails a complete reorientation of the homeless service delivery system, the gradual redeployment of current resources, the generation of additional public and private resources, and significant cross-systems collaboration  requires an intentional implementation and change management approach. To this end, members of the Chicago Continuum of Care will develop periodic action plans that detail short-term implementation strategies. In addition, hands-on technical assistance strategies are currently being developed to increase the success of this undertaking. The Governing Board of the Chicago Continuum of Care invites you to become a part of the implementation process. Homelessness in Chicago is not acceptable and together we can end it.  Page 3   Getting Housed, Staying Housed  INTRODUCTION Homelessness in Chicago affects all facets of the community, cutting across race, ethnicity, age and education level. However, homelessness1 is most likely to affect low-income vulnerable populations who experience first-hand a lack of safe and affordable housing, low wages, and limited access to health care. Additionally, job loss, family violence, mental illness, addictions and release from institutional facilities can result in housing loss when people are unaware of or unable to access community support systems. Over the past 20 years, the number of shelter beds in Chicago has increased to more than 6,500, supported by millions of dollars each year. Both anecdotal and statistical data suggest that homelessness has increased and broadened during this time to include more families with children, non-traditional family types and a greater number of working poor households. This growth in the size and diversity of the homeless population is the result of a complex interplay of structural trends such as: reductions in the availability of low-cost housing; net losses in employment and employment related benefits income due to economic changes such as deindustrialization; erosion of the real dollar value of public entitlements, and narrowing of benefits eligibility criteria; and the inadequacy of resources directed to house and support community reintegration for persons with serious mental illness in the wake of deinstitutionalization. 2,3 Imminent policy and program decisions in welfare and subsidized housing programs are likely to further exacerbate the present situation. Moreover, the cumulative impact of the strains that lead to homelessness makes it very difficult for people who are homeless to become ""re-housed"". The current situation and projected trends demand new approaches. Chicago must focus on prevention and on permanently re-housing those who become homeless.  How Many People Are Homeless in Chicago? Counting persons who are homeless is a notoriously difficult task fraught with definitional and technical challenges. As a result, comprehensive and accurate numbers are difficult to generate. In Chicago, the Chicago Department of Human Services (CDHS) tracks the number of persons who access city-funded shelters and homeless service programs and compiles this data annually. City funded shelters account for approximately two-thirds of the 6,500 shelter beds available in Chicago. According to estimates derived from annual CDHS statistics, approximately 15,000 persons were housed in these shelters from July 1, 2000  June 30, 2001.4 For Chicago, this is the only available longitudinal measure of homelessness  that is, a measure of the number of people who are homeless over a period of time. However, it is important to bear in mind that CDHS statistics do not account for those people who annually fill the shelter beds that are not supported by city funds. Point-in-time data are the best way to understand the magnitude of homelessness on a daily basis. A 2001 point-in-time provider survey conducted by the University of Illinois at Chicago indicates that approximately 6,100 people are served within Chicago's greater homeless system each day.5 However, not all persons who are homeless access the shelter system. In addition to those persons in the shelters, many individuals are temporarily housed in institutions such as mental health and substance abuse facilities and jails; living on the streets or in cars; illegally squatting in abandoned public and private housing; or, as is particularly the case with families and youth, precariously doubled up with relatives or friends. A broader definition of homelessness encompasses these households as well. By this broader definition, advocates such as the Chicago Coalition for the  Page 4   Homeless estimate Chicago's homeless population to be as high as 80,000 over the course of a given year.6  Who Experiences Homelessness? Over time homelessness and our strategies for researching it have changed. Many of the original stereotypes of homelessness were created by examining point-in-time data - historically the most common type of data available on persons who are homeless. Such data focuses on demographic characteristics, whereas, longitudinal data captures patterns of shelter usage over time. Because single adults with serious mental illness and other disabilities tend to remain homeless longer than other populations  such as families  they are generally over-represented in point-in-time counts. For example, if, on any given night, these individuals fill 1,750 of the approximately 3,500 shelter beds for single adults, they appear to represent over 50% of the homeless single adult population. However, since over the course of the year the other 1,750 beds are occupied by a constantly changing census of people, those 1,750 persons with serious disabilities may, in fact, represent a much smaller fraction of the total number of single adult shelter users during the year. More recent research efforts that have focused upon the analysis of longitudinal data on shelter usage bear this out. Such research, conducted in New York and Philadelphia, indicates that, with regard to shelter utilization, there are three general patterns of homelessness  chronic homelessness, episodic homelessness, and transitional homelessness.7 Chronic Homelessness Chronic homelessness refers to an extended episode of homelessness (generally two or more years). According to longitudinal research, people who experience chronic homelessness are more likely to have a serious mental illness, sometimes with co-occurring substance abuse, unstable employment histories, and histories of hospitalization and/or incarceration. It is estimated that 10% of the single adult homeless population experiences this persistent homelessness. Because many of these individuals use the shelter system for extended periods of time they have been found to consume 50% of the total shelter days. Episodic Homelessness Episodic homelessness refers to recurrent periods of homelessness. People who experience episodic homelessness are younger and use the shelter system more sporadically than those whose shelter use is chronic, often have substance addictions, leave shelters when they get income or use them seasonally, and are more resistant to services. Longitudinal research indicates that approximately 9 percent of the single adult population fits this pattern of homelessness. These individuals use fewer resources than those whose homelessness is chronic, but are still frequent users of the system, staying for extended periods of time and utilizing approximately 30% of the shelter days over the course of a year. Transitional Homelessness Transitional homelessness generally refers to a single episode of homelessness that is of relatively short duration. Persons who experience transitional homelessness use homeless resources for brief periods, in times of economic hardship and temporary housing loss. The majority of families and single adults who become homeless over the course of a year fall into this category, and most become homeless due to a housing crisis.  Page 5   Getting Housed, Staying Housed  Homelessness in Chicago In 2001, a study was conducted by the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC) to develop a better understanding of the circumstances and service needs of persons facing homelessness in the Chicago area, and gaps in existing systems of care. The resulting data represent the first regional comprehensive needs assessment focused on homelessness.8 As part of the study, over 600 persons who were homeless or at-risk of homelessness were interviewed in the City of Chicago. Twenty percent of the people interviewed in homeless shelters had been homeless for a period of two or more years, and more than half had experienced repeated episodes of homelessness. In fact, those interviewed had experienced an average of four previous episodes of homelessness. While extended length and frequent episodes of homelessness are primary indicators of chronic and episodic homelessness, persons who experience these two patterns of homelessness are more likely to be over-represented in studies of homelessness like the UIC study, that use point-in-time research methods. When asked to identify factors that had contributed to their current homelessness, the overwhelming majority of persons interviewed indicated multiple factors, substantiating the premise that people facing a single stressor may be able to avert homelessness, but that multiple stressors overwhelm existing safety net structures. Inability to pay rent (59%), job loss (48%), drug or alcohol problems (43%), family disagreement (40%), being cut off from public aid (25%), overcrowding (21%), domestic abuse (19%), institutional release (ranging from 23% to 17% depending on the nature of institution), residence being torn down or condemned (18%), landlord dispute (16%) and health problems (16%) were the most frequently noted contributing factors. When adults were asked to cite the one most important reason for their homelessness, they most frequently noted addiction (23%), unemployment (17%), the unaffordability of their previous housing (15%), and domestic disagreement (not domestic violence) (12%). When asked what types of services or assistance they needed in the past 12 months, persons interviewed most frequently reported that they needed help in finding a job (54%) and a place to live (51%). In addition they noted needing transportation assistance, case management services, and a range of health services, such as eye and dental care and assistance with obtaining medication. Many of the people who reported needing these services also reported that they had obtained them. The service needs that people reported the least success in obtaining were dental and eye care, cash rent assistance, help finding a job, help with budgeting, and help finding a place to live.  How our System Evolved and Why It Needs to Change The homeless shelter and service system in Chicago, like those in most large urban areas, has evolved over the past two decades to address the changing demographic of its homeless population. Currently there are approximately 6,500 shelter beds reflecting a range of shelter models. Initially the system was predominantly comprised of seasonal or overnight facilities designed to harbor the homeless against harsh weather, provide some degree of safety, and address basic needs. Today this shelter model represents less than a fifth of the beds in Chicago's system. These programs only serve single adults. Over the past two decades 24-hour shelter facilities developed for both individuals and families that allow longer lengths of stay (some up to two years) in a services-enriched environment. The impetus for these more comprehensive shelter service models has been threefold. It has derived in part from the dramatic influx of families into the system that has occurred since the late 1980s. As families began to join the ranks of the homeless it was almost immediately apparent that children in particular were ill suited to spend 12 hours each day on the city streets or seeking out daytime havens. Secondly, this shift in service philosophy has reflected a growing awareness of the cyclical nature of homelessness for many who experience it. The fact that many of those who became homeless were Page 6   experiencing repeated and prolonged episodes of homelessness suggested that minimalist, basic needs approaches, while effective at protecting people from the larger hazards of street life, were insufficient to truly move people out of homelessness. Finally, it reflects an attempt on the part of homeless service providers to compensate for the inadequacies of certain mainstream programs and systems by bringing an increasing range of services such as mental health and substance abuse intervention on-site. Over time, in the absence of responsive, affordable housing alternatives, this approach expanded to a residential service model designed to equip homeless households with the skills and resources to ""succeed"" in permanent housing. This has culminated in the evolution of a tiered system of care that moves those who are homeless through a succession of shelter programs designed to graduate them to permanent housing and self-sufficiency. While this approach is logical on its face, it has ultimately proven ineffective for a variety of reasons. Not the least of these is the fact that a shelter-based response that aims to ""fix"" the individual factors that have contributed to a household's homelessness does little to address the larger structural causes of homelessness mentioned earlier. Moreover, many of the problems that deeply impoverished households face, such as lack of education and marketable skills, histories of trauma and domestic abuse, and serious disabilities, are not resolved in such a short amount of time and to the degree that would enable them to succeed in the competitive private housing market. Thus many remain in the system for long periods of time or leave only to return again. To compound this issue, the services and supports tied to shelter end or significantly diminish once the resident leaves the shelter. And, at the same time that shelter programs have become more service-intensive they have frequently adopted more demanding eligibility criteria and stricter program rules that have often effectively barred those households with the greatest needs.

To end homelessness in Chicago by 2012, we will dramatically shift our current approach to addressing homelessness from a shelter-based strategy to a housing-based strategy. This housing-based strategy has three emphases: 1) prevention efforts to forestall homelessness for those at imminent risk; 2) rapid re-housing of those who are homeless (a Housing First approach); and, 3) the provision of wraparound services and supports to promote housing stability and selfsufficiency.  Prevention It has long been argued that the most humane strategy for addressing homelessness for those at imminent risk is to prevent its occurrence in the first place. Prevention efforts include strategies such as one-time or short-term rent or mortgage assistance, legal assistance programs, representative payee and direct payment programs, and housing placement services. They also include more systemic strategies that seek to prevent homelessness by ensuring that people leaving institutions such as jails, prisons, or treatment facilities are not discharged to the streets or shelter system, as well as strategies that seek to forestall homelessness in cases of family crises such as domestic violence. By far the most common prevention approach is the provision of one-time or short-term financial assistance. Currently in Chicago, approximately three million dollars of government funding are invested in one-time rent, mortgage, and utility assistance annually. Five-Year Prevention Strategic Initiative Over the next five years, Chicago's Continuum will significantly increase resources directed to prevention efforts as the first line of defense in its strategy to combat homelessness. Through this initiative, the Continuum will expand the breadth of current efforts, increase their immediate accessibility, and improve their long-term effectiveness. To expand the range and availability of prevention strategies, we will:   Better coordinate and expand legal assistance and housing resources available for one-time, short-term and transitional financial assistance that can be used to avert eviction. Increase linkage to permanent housing and services for persons leaving institutions.  To increase timely access to prevention resources, we will:   Establish a 24-hour prevention and referral Hotline, coordinated with 3-1-1, assessment, transportation, and prevention resources. Improve and expand mobile assessment capabilities to immediately identify appropriate shelter alternatives and facilitate their access for persons at imminent risk of homelessness.  To improve the long-term effectiveness of prevention strategies, we will link households assisted by prevention programs to ongoing community resources to support their sustainability. Page 8   Housing First For those who are already homeless or for whom homelessness cannot be prevented, the Continuum will employ a Housing First strategy. As described in the National Alliance to End Homelessness's 10-year plan, a Housing First approach seeks to assist persons to exit homelessness as quickly as possible by placing them in permanent housing and linking them to needed services.9 This approach assumes that the factors that have contributed to a household's homelessness can best be remedied once the household is housed. It also accepts that for some lifelong support may be required to prevent the reoccurrence of homelessness. Hence it seeks to maximize utilization of mainstream resources. But for most, the model seeks long-term selfsufficiency, promoted through a wraparound service philosophy (described below). For Chicago, this approach requires a fundamental shift in its shelter strategy, away from its current tiered system of care to an Interim Housing model in which short-term housing is provided for the minimum time needed to access permanent housing, with services focused on an immediate and comprehensive needs assessment, resource acquisition (i.e., public benefits and other forms of assistance), and housing placement. Within this Housing First model, two core principles define permanent housing: choice regarding the location and type of housing, and no predetermined limit on the length of time that the household can remain in the housing unit. Accordingly, the form of permanent housing will vary according to the needs and desires of each household. For some, permanent housing will mean a Safe Haven, eventually moving to a Single-Room Occupancy (SRO) unit within a project-based development with on-site supportive services. For others, permanent housing will be an individual apartment unit with a temporary rent subsidy, monthly case management, and facilitated access to community supportive services. For still others, the type of permanent housing may change over time. Five-Year Housing First Strategic Initiative Over the next five years, Chicago's Continuum must undertake three efforts simultaneously in order for its new Housing First approach to be successful. It must expand the availability of affordable permanent housing; increase its accessibility; and transition the existing tiered shelter system into a Housing First system. To expand the availability of affordable permanent housing, we will:   Create new project-based permanent supportive housing units for persons with serious and persistent disabilities. Expand permanent supportive housing subsidies for persons with serious and persistent disabilities who can live independently in market rate housing with appropriate supportive services. Develop additional engagement housing, such as safe havens and harm reduction programs for those who need permanent housing, but are resistant to traditional service models. Expand transitional rent subsidies for households who can be placed in community-based permanent housing with integrated services, in which the tenant holds the lease or assumes the lease over the period of the transitional subsidy. Develop and increase the availability of appropriate Housing First models of permanent housing for youth who are homeless.       To increase the accessibility of affordable permanent housing, we will: Page 9   Getting Housed, Staying Housed   Develop an affordable housing clearinghouse that will be used to link households in interim housing with appropriate market housing. Expand and increase coordination of street outreach for persons who are homeless and not requesting services to provide assessment and linkage to engagement housing and permanent supportive housing.  To transition the existing shelter system to a Housing First system, we will:   Develop standards for Interim Housing and permanent housing models that promote housing placement in the most suitable, least restrictive settings possible. Use local public funding to encourage, and eventually mandate, existing shelter programs to convert to the new Housing First model.  Wraparound Services In many respects, housing stability is a function of a household's ability to access fundamental resources and supports that assure that, when a crisis occurs, it does not threaten the security of that housing. For all of us, these supports include affordable healthcare with mental health and substance abuse services; livable wage employment and/or other income supports; and for families, childcare. These supports are all the more critical for poor households, for whom a crisis often means choosing between addressing essential needs for housing, food, or medical care. Chicago's Continuum is dedicated to ensuring that households have access to a full range of resources and services to protect the stability of their housing. This will be accomplished through the implementation of a w raparound services approach. Wraparound services refer to a comprehensive service provision model that guarantees that any and all services needed by an individual or family are integrated through a cohesive, individualized service plan that guides all service provision. Chicago's Continuum will infuse this service approach across all components of its homeless service delivery system  prevention, interim housing, and permanent housing. Currently, service referral is a component of most homeless service provision, but in the absence of more active and integrated case management, referral-based case management often results in fragmented care. The implementation of a wraparound services approach will mean that case managers across agencies must work together to develop one plan of action for each client, with each agency contributing, according to its strengths and resources, to support the individual or family in achieving housing stability and long-term self-sufficiency. Because service intensity is determined based upon client need, this may also mean that initially an agency provides daily or weekly case management, which may shift to monthly or on-call assistance over an extended period of time. For some, services will always remain an integral part of the residential environment. For others, this support will be transitional, sufficient to ensure that employment and community-based resources, such as health care, schools, social services, civic organizations, and communities of faith, are secured. Five-Year Wraparound Services Strategic Initiative Over the next five years, this initiative will simultaneously strengthen community supports and safety net systems for persons at-risk of homelessness and for those who are being re-housed, and increase their accessibility. This will be accomplished by providing transitional services that ensure linkage to these community resources, and increasing the availability and awareness of formal community supports.  Page 10   To ensure linkage to available community resources, we will:   Expand the provision of community-based case management services that embody a wraparound services approach. Develop formal systems integration strategies between the Housing First system and mainstream service systems, such as public entitlements (TANF, Medicaid, Social Security, and Food Stamps), employment training and placement, public health, community mental health, and substance abuse, to ensure that formerly homeless households have streamlined access to the array of formal supports available in the community.  To increase the availability and awareness of formal community supports, we will:    Identify alternative resources to fund targeted supportive services for persons with severe and persistent disabilities placed in permanent supportive housing. Implement follow-up strategies to work with households assisted with basic prevention strategies to increase their housing stability and reduce their future risk of homelessness. Develop a broadly disseminated community education program on various factors that contribute to homelessness and methods to mitigate their impact. For example a campaign on the cycle of violence could promote options for addressing spousal abuse, elder abuse and other forms of domestic violence so that they do not result in homelessness.  System Infrastructure The three initiatives described above will require an underlying system-level infrastructure in order to be effective and efficient. To support the planned activities for each of the initiatives, we will:  Implement a homeless information management system with information and referral, case management, and benefits screening functionality to collect information about the people who become homeless, improve the effectiveness of service delivery, and understand the relationships between service utilization and client outcomes over time. The affordable housing clearinghouse can also be seamlessly linked with the homeless information management system. Consolidate housing assistance resources into a Housing Assistance Fund that can be coordinated centrally, with minimal overhead, and serve prevention, housing placement, and long-term subsidy purposes.    How Is the Getting Housed, Staying Housed Model Different? Under the Getting Housed, Staying Housed model, current agencies in Chicago's homeless service system will need to redefine how services should be provided and how, as service providers, they will evolve. Some existing shelter providers may choose to shift their shelter program model to the new interim housing model by offering short-term residential care with `Housing First'-oriented services, such as comprehensive needs and resource assessment, permanent housing placement and community service linkage. Others may move away from residential programs and provide permanent community-based supportive services, and still others may shift their operations to provide permanent supportive housing. This housing and service system shift will be challenging  it will require agency and program-level reorganization, Board and staff training, and deliberate system-level change management. To be successful, it will require a committed public and private  Page 11   Getting Housed, Staying Housed partnership to increase and reallocate resources. Finally, it will require significant systems integration efforts to coordinate and network services at all levels  client, agency, neighborhood and system. The difference between the existing service approach (Figure 1) and the new Getting Housed, Staying Housed approach (Figure 2) are conceptually diagrammed below.  Figure 1: Current Shelter Model  ""The issue is not to just serve the homeless, but also to work with others to end the crisis we are facing relating to our homeless population. The shelter system is a quick fix to get people out of a Figure 2: Getting Housed, Staying Housed Model  bad situation, but we have to address the core issues.""  Page 12   - Ray Vzquez Commissioner of CDHS  ""Whereas the debate for the last few years has been about work programs, what we're seeing now is that work isn't enough to keep people out of the shelter system. The $5.15 per hour minimum wage is not enough to cover rents greater than $700 or $800 a month."" - Steven Banks Counsel to the Coalition for the Homeless  ""I don't think you can address the other problems that people have unless you give them a decent place to live. We believe that an awful lot of people who end up homeless are just poor people with a housing crisis; and it would be a lot cheaper to get them back into housing."" - Denise Rogers Minnesota Housing Finance Agency  There's no question that housing prices have been going up several times the rate of inflation, and that is clearly having an impact on their exiting the homeless system."" - Dennis Culhane University of Pennsylvania  Page 13   Getting Housed, Staying Housed PLAN IMPLEMENTATION Efforts to implement Getting Housed, Staying Housed are already underway by the Chicago Continuum of Care. The five-year plan presents a framework for implementation through the Prevention, Housing First, and Wraparound Services strategic initiatives. Each of these elements must be developed in lockstep with one another. Without implementing prevention strategies, there will continue to be an intense need for emergency shelter. Without expanding the availability of affordable housing, it will be hard to assist people to leave the system quickly. Without developing employment strategies, it will be difficult to keep people in permanent housing. Equally as important, the transition process must be carefully managed to ensure that people who are homeless do not experience any interruption in services or additional hardship, as a result. We envision three stages to the implementation process: Assessment & Preparation. The Continuum has begun the analysis that will be used to develop a ""roadmap"" for change. Assessment activities will include a detailed examination of the current system, which will consider how programs are currently structured, how resources are now used, and the nature of existing resources and their regulatory constraints. During this stage, the Continuum will also concretely define program standards, develop education materials on the new approach, identify ways to efficiently model the transition to maximize the impact and minimize the challenges of each change, and build public understanding and support for the new approach. Transition. The Continuum will manage a well-organized transition process that supports a dualoperating system that will incrementally evolve from the current model to the new one over a period of several years. This transition will be guided by the analysis and plans developed during the assessment stage. These stages will overlap, as there will be a continuing need for assessment and evaluation of plan models throughout the transition period. Technical assistance resources will need to be an integral part of this process to ensure that the transition is effectively managed, and that people and agencies are not displaced in the process. Initial steps in the transition phase will include creation of key infrastructure elements required to support the new system; commitment of additional resources for the development of permanent housing and expansion of mainstream services; legislative advocacy to build broader State and Federal support; and proactive outreach to other housing and human systems to begin systems integration efforts. Full Implementation. This final stage represents the complete implementation of the plan. By this point, the Continuum should experience reductions in the numbers entering the interim housing system, and an increase in the number of households exiting the system to permanent selfsufficiency. As a result, significant reductions in expenditures on the core ""shelter"" system will be recognized, and a majority of the resources will be directed to supporting households' housing stability. To ensure the viability of the Housing First model, ongoing evaluation activities will be conducted to determine the effectiveness of the new approach, and to guide the development of the second five-year strategy toward our 10-year goal to end homelessness in Chicago.  Evaluation Evaluation will be an important part of plan implementation. Each action plan will delineate specific benchmarks and outcome measures as a framework to gauge progress and report to policymakers and funders. Key to the evaluation effort will be the development of the homeless information management system, which will provide a way of understanding how people who are homeless use the system of services, and the impact of these services in promoting housing stability and selfsufficiency. The homeless information system will also collect data that can be used to generate point-in-time and longitudinal counts of homelessness in Chicago. Page 14   THE CHICAGO CONTINUUM OF CARE The Chicago Continuum of Care is a consortium of community organizations, private and public, not-for-profit and for-profit entities committed to ending homelessness in Chicago. It includes schools, faith organizations, local businesses and employers, civic organizations, and concerned individuals. However, the core of the Continuum, particularly for the purposes of developing the Strategic Plan, includes public and private providers and funders of services that help address the needs of people who are homeless. Shelter providers, mental health organizations, substance abuse treatment programs, domestic violence counseling centers, employment assistance groups, housing developers, and state and city government offices--all have played key roles in creating the Plan. The Chicago Continuum of Care is many things  it is the system of housing, services, and supports for those facing homelessness; the governance structure that oversees the planning process for ending homelessness in Chicago; and the group responsible for overseeing the HUD funding process that brings roughly 30 million dollars of federal support to homeless programs in Chicago each year. The Chicago Continuum of Care would like to acknowledge the efforts of the members of the strategic planning committee, chaired by Jean Butzen, president of Lakefront SRO, and Arturo Valdivia Bendixen, former Executive Director of Interfaith House.  THE NATIONAL PLAN TO END HOMELESSNESS This Plan is highly influenced by the work of The National Alliance to End Homelessness and its Ten Year Plan to End Homelessness. In January 2001, the full Continuum membership came together for the first time to analyze the current status of homelessness in Chicago. At this meeting members were briefed on a campaign drafted by the National Alliance to End Homelessness. The National Plan to End Homelessness, like the Chicago plan suggests that any plan to end homelessness must include four components: planning for outcomes, closing the front door to homelessness through prevention, opening the back door from homelessness by streamlining the process of rehousing, and strengthening the web of community supports to keep people housed.  Page 15   Getting Housed, Staying Housed CHICAGO CONTINUUM OF CARE LEADERSHIP The Chicago Continuum of Care is overseen by a Governing Board, which coordinates and facilitates the planning process and oversees the distribution of funding. The Governing Board is comprised of both elected and appointed members representing the range of organizations and groups needed to end homelessness, including homeless service providers, consumers and advocates, city, county and state agencies, and business and foundation leaders. Twenty government slots on the board are permanent. There are also twenty service provider slots and twenty community slots, which are elected for two-year terms.

However, since the data are reported to CDHS by programs in aggregate form, these statistics reflect duplicated client counts across programs  that is, when one person uses more than one shelter program within the year, they are counted separately at each program. Internal departmental estimates for an unduplicated count were derived using the following assumptions:  That, for the single adult population, the number of individuals who enter transitional and second stage shelter programs without using an overnight shelter program is minimal. Thus, the level of duplication across overnight shelter programs cancels out the number of individuals who enter transitional or second stage programs without using an overnight program. That most families who are homeless are served by a transitional shelter program. That only 25% of families who use warming centers do not go on to use transitional shelter. That the majority of families who enter second stage programs have been referred from a transitional shelter program.    Thus for the single adult population, only the CDHS statistics for overnight programs are considered for the unduplicated count. For families, the count is generated by adding the number of families served in transitional programs with 25% of the number served within warming centers. Based on calculations derived from these assumptions, CDHS estimates that annually approximately 10,000 households (8,000 individuals and 2,000 families) comprised of 15,000 people are served by the CDHS-funded shelter system.

Individuals on the benefit              rolls between age 65-69 who are not receiving retirement benefits,              or who are receiving only partial benefits because they are working,              will receive their payments automatically, without lifting a finger.                           ""Our automated              systems will help us identify the affected beneficiaries and make              retroactive payments quickly,"" said Kenneth S. Apfel, Commissioner              of Social Security. ""Beneficiaries do not need to contact SSA to get              their retroactive benefits. Beneficiaries should contact SSA only              if they recently have changed their address or bank.""              Legislation              to repeal the retirement earnings test is expected to see final passage              in Congress this week and to be signed by the President shortly thereafter.              Once the bill is signed, SSA will send notices to all beneficiaries              affected by the earnings test.              If the bill              is signed into law by early April, individuals should receive their              retroactive check in early May. Their June check would then be fully              adjusted to reflect the change in the law.              Under current              law, for Social Security beneficiaries age 65-69, benefits are reduced              $1 for every $3 of earnings above $17,000 per year. Workers are exempt              from the test when they reach age 70.              About 800,000              beneficiaries who are either working or are dependents of workers              age 65 through 69 in the year 2000 would have forfeited about $6 billion              in Social Security payments this year because of the earnings test.              Eliminating the earnings test will allow each beneficiary to receive,              on average, an additional $6,700 this year.              Around 415,000              of these working beneficiaries (and their dependents) between the              ages of 65 and 69 have already had $1.4 billion in Social Security              benefits withheld because of the earnings test. With the elimination              of the earnings test, they will each receive a retroactive payment              averaging about $3,500 each."

The estimate is conservative — it does not include those affected by natural disasters, nor those who do not contact a homeless assistance provider, e.g., who may be taken in by a friend or spend the night in a car.   The circumstances that cause homelessness for two to three million Americans are varied. However, research conducted since the late 1980's shows that interactions among the supply of affordable housing, poverty, and disability account for most of the precipitating factors. Among poor persons, the risk of a night of homelessness is far higher than for the general population. Somewhere between four to six percent of the poor experience homelessness annually. Most of these experiences are short-term and the individuals exit homelessness with minimal assistance and generally are not seen again.   But the subgroup that tends to be the most visible is a group of about 200,000 people who experience homelessness on a protracted or repeated basis. On any given night, this group will represent almost half of those who are homeless. This subgroup has been identified as the chronically or long term homeless. There is increasing consensus that we can take actions that will reduce and end this level of chronic homelessness.      Exploring Solutions      Beginning in March, 2001, the Secretary's office initiated several activities to improve the Department of Health and Human Services' (HHS) response to the services needed by persons experiencing homelessness.           Secretary Tommy Thompson met with Secretary Mel Martinez of the Department     of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and Secretary Thompson committed his     Department to a collaboration that capitalized on the expertise of HHS in     service delivery and of HUD in housing.         HHS staff initiated regular, informal discussions with HUD and Department     of Veterans Affairs (VA) staff to understand the programs and opportunities     that could be involved in a collaboration.         HHS, HUD and VA staff explored goals and activities of mutual interest and     recommended to leadership that collaboration was best achieved by adopting     a specific and targeted focus on the issue of long term and repeated     homelessness.         Discussions with the HHS Operating Divisions were held to determine what     options they saw to make their programs more accessible to homeless persons.         Budget formulations and other administrative scenarios within HHS were     considered.         An ambitious partnership with States was initiated that acknowledged the     role of State agencies in setting the priorities for using HHS assistance.     The Secretary sent all Governors an invitation to participate in the partnership.     Beginning in November 2001, a series of Policy Academies for State and Local     Policymakers was begun. Thirty-six States applied to participate in the first     of these, knowing that only eight could be accommodated.     Throughout these explorations, a leading concern was for HHS-assisted services to be more accessible to eligible homeless persons being placed in HUD-supported housing. Interdepartmental discussions had clearly identified new emphases that were making it increasingly important for applications for HUD's homelessness assistance to demonstrate the use of mainstream HHS treatment services to assist chronically homeless people. By summer's end, it was clear that the complexity of HHS' structure and program variety obviated a simple linear plan, i.e., one that involved an easily introduced change that expanded opportunities for access by homeless individuals.   The final development of significance came in the release of the Administration's budget for fiscal year 2003. President George W. Bush endorsed as goal of his administration ending chronic homelessness in a decade.      The Secretary's Work Group on Ending Chronic Homelessness      At the start of calendar year 2002, Secretary Thompson established the Secretary's Work Group on Ending Chronic Homelessness. He asked Deputy Secretary Claude Allen to lead the Work Group in a comprehensive review of the Department's relevant programs. The Work Group was to report recommendations for a Department-wide approach that would contribute to the Administration's goal of ending chronic homelessness and improve HHS' ability to assist persons experiencing chronic homelessness.                          Representation on the Secretary's Work Group On Ending Chronic Homelessness:                 Office of the Secretary           Administration on Aging           Administration on Children and Families           Assistant Secretary for Budget, Technology, and Finance           Assistant Secretary for Legislation           Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation           Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services           Health Resources and Services Administration           Office of the General Counsel           Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration                          The action simultaneously addressed two needs:           First, it brought the relevant HHS agencies into a collaboration to formulate     a Department-wide strategy that addressed the multiple needs of this subgroup.         Second, by focusing on chronic homelessness, it established a compelling     link to themes that had been articulated by the White House, HUD and VA on     this same issue.     On February 28, 2002, Deputy Secretary Allen convened the first meeting of the Secretary's Work Group on Ending Chronic Homelessness. Representatives were chosen by agency administrators for their knowledge of agency programs and their ability to represent the agency authoritatively (Appendix A). Mr. Allen itemized charges to the Work Group members and offered a plan of approach to undertake four tasks:           Define the population that experiences chronic homelessness and itemize their     service needs.         Analyze the response of relevant HHS mainstream assistance programs to the     itemized service needs.         Specify outcomes and objectives that would improve the response of these     mainstream programs to long term and repeated homelessness.         Offer actions the agencies could take that would improve access to and     coordination of services that would contribute to reducing and ending chronic     homelessness.                            Charge to the Work Group:                 Improve access to treatments and services           Improve coordination across these services           Identify strategies to prevent additional episodes of chronic homelessness           Itemize accountability and evaluation processes                          An Interagency Subcommittee was formed immediately (Appendix B) and charged with pursuing each of the four tasks. The Subcommittee met formally over a dozen times and held numerous informal meetings to analyze data, formulate recommendations, and edit written work.   To accomplish its work, the Subcommittee:           Reviewed epidemiological and services research literature that documented     what is known about those who experience long term and repeated homelessness     and about treatments, services, and supports that are effective with these     persons. This material is summarized in  Chapter 2 .         Developed, administered and tabulated a service inventory for eight relevant     mainstream HHS programs. The inventory sought not only to understand the     administrative features of each program, but their specific response to the     services needed by persons experiencing chronic homelessness. The findings     are summarized in  Chapter 3 .         Summarized what was learned from the inventory in the areas of                a) administrative characteristics of the programs;          b) regulatory or program design barriers to services identified by program  officials;          c) service coverage offered by relevant programs, including what was known  about current access by homeless persons; and          d) opportunities or concerns that program officials identified for improved  access by chronically homeless persons.               Convened a Listening Session on July 16 to benefit from the experiences of     States, municipalities, and providers who had struggled with weaving together     a comprehensive set of funding sources to address the complexities of chronic     homelessness. Six presenters, including the executive director of the U.S.     Interagency Council on Homelessness spoke to Work Group and Subcommittee     members about their experiences, with particular attention to the use of     HHS assistance to provide treatments and services responsive to chronic     homelessness.         Based on the above processes, the Subcommittee identified objectives under     each of its charges that could position HHS to be more responsive to the     issue of chronic homelessness. Numerous options were itemized that could     contribute to implementing the objectives, with an emphasis on short term     steps HHS could take that would support the Administration's goal of ending     chronic homelessness. The Work Group selected and refined these options and     developed goals and strategies for a comprehensive Department plan. The Work     Group recommendations are presented in  Chapter 5 .     Throughout the process, the Deputy Secretary's office provided critical guidance and support for the completion of the tasks. Work Group members were kept informed via a series of progress reports that summarized progress and next steps and by their representatives on the Interagency Subcommittee.   [ Go to  Contents  ]      Chapter 2:    Defining Chronic Homelessness and Understanding    Treatment and Support Needs       [  Top  |  Contents  |  Main Page of Report  ]       What is Chronic Homelessness?      The first attempts to describe the current generation of homeless persons were based on survey methods. The surveys were conducted during a specific time period, e.g, the month of February, and used a convenience sample, e.g., going to soup kitchens or providers that specifically assist homeless individuals. Survey methods are the source for a commonly cited figure for homelessness in the United States, viz., 600,000 persons are homeless on any given night. Survey approaches continue to be used and are a legitimate, valuable tool for understanding the prevalence of a condition, such as chronic homelessness, and for understanding the characteristics of those experiencing that condition.   As homeless assistance matured, information system technologies were introduced into many homelessness assistance settings. Administrative systems made another method of population description possible — one that described the users of homeless assistance over a long period of time rather than a snapshot in time. Longitudinal analyses of the service users confirmed important distinctions among homeless persons that had first been noted by the Institute of Medicine in 1988. Specifically, the group is not homogeneous and three important subgroups regularly appear: (1)             temporarily homeless  — persons who experience only one     spell of homelessness, usually short, and who are not seen again by the homeless     assistance system;          episodically homeless  — those who use the system with     intermittent frequency, but usually for short periods; and          chronically homeless  — those with a protracted homeless     experience, often a year or longer, or whose spells in the homeless assistance     system are both frequent and long.     These subgroups emerge from actual utilization patterns in numerous cities and show relatively similar distributions: Approximately 80 percent of users are temporarily homeless, 10 percent are episodic, and 10 percent are chronic.   Applying the 10 percent estimate to the number of persons who are homeless annually results in a figure of approximately 200,000 individuals annually who will be chronically homeless. (2)  The Department believes that by linking affordable housing with treatment and support services, substantial and permanent reductions in the occurrence of chronic homelessness are achievable.      What Characteristics Are Associated with Chronic   Homelessness?      While chronic homelessness may be identifiable by a pattern of homeless duration, other facts associated with this subgroup add to our understanding.            Disability:  The presence of a disabling condition is almost universal     in the population. These conditions involve serious health conditions, substance     abuse, and psychiatric illnesses. The prevalence of a disabling condition     runs as high as 85 percent having one of more of these chronic problems.     In contrast, data from mid-1990's indicate approximately 12 percent of     working-age persons have a moderate to severe disability. Disability is a     highly relevant factor where services are concerned since certain kinds of     disability are an eligibility portal for many HHS assistance programs.          Heavy Use of Services:  Persons experiencing chronic homelessness     are heavy users of the homeless assistance system and of other health and     social services. Although they constitute 10 percent of the users of homeless     shelter assistance, they consume fully 50 percent of the days of shelter     provided by that system.           In addition, analyses in New York City indicate that use of expensive emergency     room visits, uncompensated care, and involvement with the criminal justice     system among the chronically homeless represent significant costs to local,     State, and Federal programs. The analysis tracked the service costs attributable     to a cohort of chronically homeless persons before and after their placement     in permanent supportive housing. The following New York data were provided     at the July 18, 2002 meeting of the U.S. Interagency Council on Homelessness     and show the changes in annual health care costs for the 2 years after a     person was placed in housing compared to the annual costs incurred for the     2 years preceding housing placement. For health care, the data clearly show     placement in supportive housing is associated with overall reductions in     health care costs.                 Psychiatric hospital        $8,260                    Municipal hospital    1,771                    Medicaid-Inpatient    3,787                    Medicaid-Outpatient    2,657                    Annual savings (per person)    $11,161                               Engagement with Treatments:  More than a decade of research has shown     that persons experiencing chronic homelessness frequently exhibit a pattern     of being disconnected from conventional community life. Many have limited     support systems, reflected in most being single adults with weak family     connections. Many are from ethnic and racial minorities and research also     shows they may be reluctant to interact with systems they do not understand     or which do not understand them. Many have past experiences with mainstream     services that did not effectively address their needs or prevent them from     falling into homelessness. These characteristics contribute to the long or     repetitive patterns of homelessness they exhibit. They also reflect why     re-engaging a chronically homeless person with treatments can be challenging.          Multiple Problems:  Chronically homeless individuals fall within     the subset of persons who present a complex set of multi-problem challenges     to service providers. Like frail elders with complex medical conditions,     HIV patients with psychiatric and substance abuse issues, or a TANF client     with domestic violence or counseling needs, the service needs of chronically     homeless people outstrip the in-house competencies of most providers.                        The Needs of a Chronically Homeless Person Cross Many Service System     Boundaries.            In addition to the issues noted above, extreme poverty, poor job skills,     lack of education, and negative childhood experiences are common features     of chronic homelessness. The figure above, first used in the briefing material     to the Work Group, describes the array of complex service needs associated     with chronic homelessness.          Fragmented Systems:  Both practice and research have shown that the     chronically homeless person is most likely to face a service system that     is fragmented and providers who are not able to summon the flexible or     comprehensive set of treatments and services the person needs. For providers     to be effective with such individuals, they must either become uniquely     specialized or piece together an informal system of referrals and service     collaborations with other providers to ensure access to at least some of     the needed services. The homeless shelter system, in dealing with daily demands     that routinely exceed capacity, typically is not able to reshape itself along     either of these tracks. Without services that address the multi-problem nature     of long term and repeated homelessness, multi-problem clients rarely progress     out of the system.        What Treatments and Services Are Effective?      Responding to the needs of people who experience chronic homelessness poses significant challenges. Their needs include a broad range of services, from food, clothing and emergency shelter to treatment and income support, and cross many service systems.   However none of these services are as effective without safe, affordable housing. Years of federal demonstration programs and the experience of community and faith-based providers have shown what is effective in preventing and ending homelessness among people who have serious health and behavioral health disorders. Implementing evidence-based and promising practices is essential for a comprehensive, integrated service system that effectively reduces chronic homelessness.   The following services and treatment needs are organized into core and supportive services. The  core services  include those that are needed to move people from the streets into housing and to stabilize their conditions. The  supportive services  include those that are needed to reintegrate people into the community, such as with jobs, education and socialization. The full definitions for each of the services are presented in Appendix C. Appendix D lists representative published citations of the effectiveness for each service.     Core Services             Information and Referral         Outreach and Engagement         Health Related and Home Health Services, Including HIV/AIDS         Alcohol and Drug Abuse Services         Mental Health and Counseling Services         Inpatient Services         Supportive Case Management Services         Intensive Case Management Services         Income Management and Support         Residential Treatment Services         Discharge Planning       Supportive Services:             Life Skills Services         Child Care Services         Education and Training Services         Employment Services         Legal Services         Transportation Services     To be effective, these services must be accessible and provided in a coordinated and flexible manner. This includes the option of being offered in non-office based settings (e.g., on the street or in shelters) and during non-standard operating hours, being able to increase or decrease service levels to accommodate changing needs over time, and keeping case files open even during periods of inactivity so that eligibility does not have to be re-established when an individual is ready to engage or re-engage.   Providers need the flexibility to operate with a ""no wrong door, no reject"" policy, meaning that services are made available to individuals no matter where they enter the system and whether or not they are willing to accept specific interventions that may be indicated. In addition, strategies such as co-location of services not typically offered under the same roof can help reduce fragmentation and increase access to services.                      HHS, HUD, and VA have agreed on the characteristics of persons experiencing  chronic homelessness and use the following definition in their collaborations:      An unaccompanied homeless individual with a disabling condition who has  either been continuously homeless for a year or has had at least four (4)  episodes of homelessness in the past three (3) years.                   Why the Definition of Chronic Homelessness and the List of   Treatments Are Relevant to HHS Assistance Programs      There are at least three reasons why understanding who experiences chronic homelessness and what treatments and services are effective is relevant to the HHS programs designed to assist poor and disabled persons.   First, these mainstream programs are extremely likely to have had substantial contact with these individuals prior to their becoming chronically homeless. Research studies show that persons experiencing chronic homelessness have long and extensive histories of involvement with the publicly-funded treatment system before their period of long term homelessness. These service experiences seemingly did little to prevent their slide into a pattern of long term homelessness.   No mainstream program wants to waste an investment it has made in helping clients make gains. Falling out of treatment and into a pattern of long term homelessness represents a set back to gains the client experienced from treatment and services. In addition to concerns about the efficient use of resources, this experience may mean the person is wary of re-engaging with the types of providers that were not attentive to his or her risk of becoming homeless.   Second, their homeless status does not mean that chronically homeless persons are no longer using mainstream service resources. As noted above, they are heavy users of services, often expensive inpatient and emergency room services, unguided by a comprehensive treatment plan. Mainstream programs continue to absorb at least some of the costs for these expensive and ad hoc treatments.   Third, the levels of disability and poverty that characterize persons experiencing chronic homelessness make them likely to be eligible for a number of the HHS mainstream programs. The fact that they are unsheltered should not restrict them from benefitting from this assistance, but their homelessness often presents so many challenges that access to these benefits is not ideal. If HHS can craft approaches that improve their access to mainstream HHS service programs, contributing to a reduction in chronic homelessness, these same approaches should work for other eligible homeless individuals. These approaches might, thereby, provide solutions for addressing homelessness among families or youth.   HHS recognizes that the characteristics of chronic homelessness are primarily conceptual. They help to distinguish a population that presents service providers with unique demands and unique opportunities. The characteristics are an assortment of various problems and eligibility criteria that are relevant to many of the assistance programs supported by the Department. The characteristics reinforce the multiple treatment needs suggested in the earlier figure, but they do not have the rigor or uniqueness to suggest a singular eligibility group.   Instead, chronic homelessness — as a group of individuals with multiple service needs — overlaps with the types of beneficiaries and services of many of the HHS mainstream programs. This overlap suggests the appropriateness of response by the mainstream.   The access chronically homeless persons have to the mainstream programs and the ability of these programs to deliver the needed treatments and services consumed significant attention prior to the development of recommendations. The results of this examination are presented in the following chapter.      Endnotes       1.   Institute of Medicine.

[ Go to  Contents  ]      Chapter 3:     How HHS Mainstream Service Programs Align    With the Treatments and Services That Address    Chronic Homelessness      [  Top  |  Contents  |  Main Page of Report  ]       Mainstream HHS Service Delivery Programs      In 1999, the General Accounting Office (GAO) examined the extent to which Federal programs designed to assist low income and disabled persons responded to homelessness. (1)  The report identified up to 50 programs in eight Departments and Agencies that provided relevant assistance. Almost one-third of these programs were specifically targeted to homeless persons (16 of the 50) (2) , while the balance constitute some of the largest and best known of the Federal assistance programs such as Food Stamps, Medicaid, Public Housing, and Supplemental Security Income. Collectively, these programs serve millions of individuals. The report referred to these as non-targeted programs, but the phrase 'mainstream programs' has been widely used to embrace them.   GAO identified 12 relevant mainstream programs in HHS. The Work Group took these 12 programs as a starting point to explore improved access, coordination, and prevention activities related to chronic homelessness. Three were eliminated as being less applicable to chronic homelessness. Specifically, Head Start, the State Children's Health Insurance Program, and the Maternal and Child Health Services Block Grant were dropped from further consideration because they were not likely to address single, disabled, poor adults who primarily make up the chronically homeless population. Two others were collapsed into one program, based on advice from the Health Resources and Services Administration which administers them. Specifically, Migrant Health Centers were not treated as a separate program as GAO had done, but were subsumed within the Consolidated Community Health Centers cluster. This left 8 mainstream programs as the focus of the Work Group. (3)                           Mainstream HHS Programs Selected for Their Relevance to Chronic Homelessness:                 Medicaid           Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF)           Social Services Block Grant           Community Services Block Grant           Community Health Centers           Ryan White Programs           Substance Abuse Prevention and Treatment Block Grant           Community Mental Health Services Block Grant                               Are HHS Mainstream Programs Responsive to Chronic   Homelessness?      Each of the eight programs was asked to provide responses for the following information:            Coverage of each core and supportive service .          Access to the service  by homeless and chronically     homeless persons.          Concerns or opportunities  program officials noted     that might influence the applicability of the program to chronic homelessness.          Administrative features  of each program that might     affect the ability of the program to respond to chronic homelessness.     All of these circumstances were integrated into an inventory that was completed by each of 8 mainstream programs. The compilation and review of these service inventory responses was carefully reviewed and contributed substantially to the Work Group's recommendations. In addition, experiences shared by States, municipalities, and providers in the Listening Session and lessons from a site visit to a homeless health care clinic by members of the Interagency Subcommittee members were considered.      Findings         1) Availability of Core and Supportive Services      Each program was asked to indicate for each core and supportive service whether that service was required or optional (e.g., could be selected from a menu of options; offered at State's discretion). Several findings are noteworthy.   As these programs have been authorized, there is substantial flexibility in the services that can be supported. Four of the 8 programs give the State discretion in selecting what services will be supported. The others feature both required and optional services that the State, city or community-based recipient may offer. Therefore, in administering these 8 programs, there is considerable opportunity for the State or grant recipient to tailor service responses to the unique circumstances of the service beneficiaries. These opportunities extend to including the services the identified in the previous chapter as effective in helping people break a cycle of chronic homelessness. (See  insert  and  Table 1 .)   In all of the programs, there are also restrictions on offering certain services. The most common exclusion was on support for inpatient care. Only Medicaid is authorized to provide inpatient services.   The only core service to be offered in all 8 programs was information and referral, but outreach, supportive case management and substance abuse services are available from at least 7 of the 8 programs.                           Number of Mainstream Programs Supporting     Core Services                                Information and Referral            8                        Outreach and Engagement            7                       Alcohol and Drug Abuse Services            7                     Supportive Case Management Services            7                     Health Related and Home Health Services, Including HIV/AIDS            6                     Intensive Case Management Services            6                     Discharge Planning            6                     Mental Health and Counseling Services            5                     Residential Treatment Services            5                     Income Management and Support            4                     Inpatient Services            1                Three of the 8 programs can support 10 of the 11 core services (inpatient coverage is excluded in each): TANF, Ryan White titles, and the Community Mental Health Services Block Grant. However, these programs also serve the most highly specified target groups — by family status or diagnosis. They may be accessible only by certain persons who are chronically homeless.   None of the 8 programs offers all of the core and supportive services. This fact contributes to the frequently cited complaint of community and faith-based providers that they must juggle multiple funding sources to sustain a program that provides comprehensive services to their clients. For example, in one northeastern state, an average homeless shelter uses 17 sources of Federal support and 5 State sources to compile the array of services needed by its clients. (4)    This factor also has implications for homeless people. They are most likely to encounter  providers who are not able to offer the comprehensive set of services.  Negotiating such fragmentation is especially challenging for a person dealing with impairments.   For supportive services, coverage appears to be somewhat better. Five of the 8 programs cover all of the supportive services. Transportation, primarily as it relates to accessing treatments and services, is covered by all 8 programs. However, as  Table 1  shows, variability in coverage remains a pattern and it reinforces the fragmentation issue noted above.                          Number of Mainstream Programs     Supporting Supportive Services                               Transportation            8                       Education and Training            6                     Life Skills            6                     Child Care            6                     Employment Services            6                     Legal Assistance            5                   2) Use of Available Services by Chronically Homeless Persons      Two inventory questions are relevant here.           In describing the administrative features of each program, program officials     indicated whether homelessness was mentioned as a circumstance that received     consideration in the program. One program — the Community Services     Block Grant — reported this to be the case.         In addition, officials were asked if factors that characterize chronic     homelessness — a disabling condition or the pattern of     homelessness — would affect a person's eligibility for the program.     Two of the programs — Medicaid and the Mental Health Block     Grant — indicated that a disabling condition would be critical     for program eligibility. No programs indicated that a pattern of long term     or repeated homelessness presented a barrier to accessing a service, nor     would it suggest that a priority consideration for access to one of the     mainstream programs be given.     Thus, while the majority of the programs do not identify homelessness as a circumstance for consideration, the characteristics of chronic homelessness appear to create few barriers for access to these services.   For each core and supportive service, the inventory also asked whether persons experiencing chronic homelessness used the service and if data were available on the extent of use. Since homelessness was generally not identified as a circumstance for consideration for receipt of services by these programs, it is not surprising that their administrative systems would not flag homelessness or former homelessness as a characteristics on which data could be tabulated.   Consistent with the observations in the 1999 GAO report — which found that mainstream, non-targeted programs could not document access by homeless persons — 70 percent of the inventory responses about service use by homeless persons are unknowns. The programs report that they have no data to inform them about access. Thirty percent of the responses are positive, indicating homeless persons do use the service. But officials were not able to provide hard data on utilization. (5)    Clearly, it is a challenge for HHS to provide a baseline to demonstrate current access to mainstream services by persons experiencing long-term homelessness. The challenge will have to be addressed in any Department attempt to document that efforts to reduce the prevalence of chronic homelessness or end it are successful.      3) Concerns and Opportunities      To benefit from the insights of program officials about the relevance of their program to addressing chronic homelessness, the program officials were invited to offer observations about concerns or opportunities in five areas:            Regulation or administrative issues   (e.g., flexibility     and limitations in designing service content, role of States in designing     program, eligibility specifications, opportunities to apply for waivers or     expansions, legal/civil rights concerns)           Patterns of funding   (e.g., how traditions influence     fund distribution toward new issues, services, client groups, or groups of     providers)            Capacity issues   (e.g., resource trends in the Program,     treatment gaps, models of effective interventions, competencies of provider     staff)           Fragmentation of services   (e.g., degree of specialization     by service or funding, program culture on client referral and linkage, prevalence     of one-stop service approaches, integration of providers into HUD's continuum     of care planning processes)            Priorities, incentives and motivations   (e.g., priority     placed on addressing homelessness in the Program, emphasis on cost containment,     emphasis placed on the underserved, nature of the performance that is     incentivized)      Several of these areas yielded information from program officials that was even more clearly expressed in the July 2002 Listening Session with States, municipalities and providers.            Funding Silos:  Each of the 8 mainstream programs was created to respond     to a unique need or population and its implementation is most often driven     by its authorization. The consequence of this evolution is an assortment     of assistance programs covering health and social services, and administered     by a variety of State and local entities. The administering entities are     not required to assemble these programs into a coherent pattern that might     result in an improved response to the overlapping, multiple needs of the     targeted populations. In addition, the administering entities may find that     the authorizations for these programs make such a coordinated approach difficult.           The problem is often captured by the phrase ""funding silos."" The implications     are not unique for homelessness. For example, in discussions of TANF     reauthorization in June, 2002, both the Administration and the House of     Representatives included provisions that addressed the impact of such silos     on serving needy families. Specifically, it was proposed that States receive     flexible authority to build integrated service delivery systems for TANF     families involving as many as nine separate assistance programs.     Fragmented funding led to the following issues for chronic homelessness:            Coordination Issues:  Funding silos mean that Federal assistance     moves to different agencies within State government, sometimes going directly     to the community level. There is no requirement for coordination across these     programs. One multi-State report summarized this as:           ""...the federal government thinks about policy in terms of specific programs     and categorical funding streams... States, on the other hand, increasingly     think about how a coherent and seamless service delivery system might better     assist disadvantaged [persons]."" (6)            While States and community organizations are required to submit applications     and plans when seeking HHS assistance, it has been several decades since     HHS required any degree of joint planning or coordination across the assistance     programs it supports. Thus, a State's TANF plan may discuss the State's plan     to address substance abuse among eligible families. But there is no requirement     that the State plan show a relationship to the assistance offered by the     State under its Substance Abuse Prevention and Treatment Block Grant, nor     demonstrate consultation and collaboration with the State's substance abuse     administration.           The proposal noted above to give States authority for flexibility under TANF     reauthorization was intended to address this difficulty by mandating close     coordination among the programs it would cover. Another relevant parallel     is the success HUD has had requiring that its applicants demonstrate a rational     plan for the range of assistance HUD offers: A consolidated plan for all     HUD assistance is required. In addition, HUD requires communities to develop     a coherent, prioritized approach for the homeless assistance that HUD offers.     This 'continuum of care' plan is a well-known homelessness planning strategy     in over 400 communities in the U.S.                Eligibility Gaps:  For chronically homeless clients, particular those     with multiple diagnoses, funding silos mean they may be eligible for some     of the services they need from one program, but not be able to secure the     remainder of their services because they are not eligible under the rules     of those other programs.           The most telling example of this involves homeless persons with substance     use disorders and co-occurring psychiatric and primary health care problems.     They may have access to limited substance abuse treatments supported by the     Substance Abuse Prevention and Treatment Block Grant. But, they may find     that they do not meet eligibility criteria for receipt of Medicaid coverage,     nor qualify as having a serious and persistent mental illness for access     to services supported by the Community Mental Health Services Block Grant.           Such problems in accessing services reimbursed by other funding sources are     not uncommon. The Listening Session further underscored the obstacles States,     municipalities and providers face in using multiple funding sources to address     the multi-problem nature of chronic homelessness.                Flexibility:  Many service providers have learned to live with funding     silos and pursue funding from multiple assistance programs to be able to     offer comprehensive services to their clients. But they report that they     are challenged in trying to work flexibly across these silos.                Privacy provisions may mean that information in client records is not accessible  across programs serving the same clients.          Audit teams have different rules and visit at different times so that providers  are continually making adjustments to comply with each new visit.          Cost allocation rules governing Federal funds require that States and providers  which are using multiple funding sources to serve a client group must establish  a reasonable methodology for how much of each funding source will be used.  One basis for reasonable allocation is the size of the benefitting population.  Cost allocation rules may mean that the relatively low representation of  chronic homelessness (or the absence of a priority to identify such consumers)  in a large mainstream caseload restricts the resources that providers may  be able to devote to this group.          Adjusting or securing service funding to match a client's need for treatment  and support as the client moves out of homelessness may be so difficult that  gaps in services occur and jeopardize progress. One example of this involves  clients losing a case manager at each stage of progress that requires them  to shift to a different provider or service reimbursement source. At the  Listening Session, one representative noted clients who had worked with more  than a dozen case managers as they exited homelessness.          Lastly, attempts at collaboration with other providers, including those who  offer housing, are often considered overhead — a cost of doing  business. In cash-strapped human services programs, this can become a  disincentive to engage in planning for seamless service delivery systems.            Capacity Issues:  The capacity of the programs to respond to chronic homelessness was expressed in several forms.            Funding:  Program officials uniformly expressed that resources were     finite and their application to particular population groups was usually     a priority left to the State or provider. There is considerable variety in     the scale of funding and how extensively each program is relied on as a source     of service dollars. Some, such as Medicaid, come with a requirement for matching     funds that requires substantial investment of a State's own funds. Any expansion     of programs has implications for the program partners that have to be considered     carefully.           Funding trends also varied in the 8 programs. In a few, such as the Social     Services Block Grant, the trend line has been down. In others, such as the     Community Health Centers, Administration and Congressional interest has led     to current and promised future expansion.           Under any of these funding conditions, HHS does not mandate what the State     or grantee must do. The Department's approach has been to encourage States     and community-based grantees to capitalize on existing flexibility, issue     letters of guidance, offer technical assistance, and promulgate evidence-based     practices. The recommendations to the Department are consistent with this     approach.          Staffing:  An important aspect of quality of services is the availability     and qualifications of staff to deliver health and social services. Program     officials reported staffing shortages that led to waiting lists and high     case loads under existing service demands. They voiced that working with     chronically homeless groups would present substantial challenges to mainstream     systems because of the multi-problem nature of this group, current workloads,     and staff readiness to work with such a clientele.           Many mainstream staff are not prepared to provide the outreach and engagement     services to chronically homeless persons who have not yet re-engaged with     treatment services. In addition to the fact that these services often occur     out-of-office, reimbursement practices associated with managed care may limit     the extensiveness or intensiveness of these services.           When staff do work with such clients, they may not be prepared to modify     some of their clinical practices for a clientele whose lack of a stable residence     makes a treatment regimen impossible — the classic example is     prescribing a refrigerated medication. As clients change from homeless to     housed, mainstream staff may not be sufficient or prepared to provide needed     services in non-office based settings, such as the client's home, or deliver     services that are critical to the person's successful placement, e.g., helping     a client gain skills at budgeting or working a microwave.          Knowledge and Technology:  HHS has invested uniquely in research     that demonstrates effective, evidence-based treatments and supports for persons     experiencing chronic homelessness. Outside of the homeless-specific service     delivery system, these findings and service models are not widely known,     practiced, or reimbursed. Consequently, homeless-specific providers frequently     report that the mainstream programs in their cities often direct homeless     persons to their systems because of concerns about service reimbursement     or not knowing what to do with such clients. For mainstream providers to     be more receptive to this group of clients, much needs to be done to convey     what is known about effective treatment and to encourage action.           Another concern relates to the technology of administrative information systems.     Such systems provide documentation of treatment for billing, linking a client's     records over time, and program accountability. As noted previously, mainstream     program officials were not able to provide data to demonstrate their programs     served chronically homeless persons. Providers could benefit from guidance     in identifying how a treatment plan for a person with long term or repeated     homelessness is formulated, implemented, documented, and assessed. A consequence     of such capacity would be in supporting the establishment and documentation     of performance measures on homelessness.           Finally, an important area is privacy and civil rights issues. Expediting     coordination of services across multiple providers has to be balanced with     protections of civil rights (e.g., commitment statutes), privacy, and significant     challenges to how information can be better linked. The goal of ensuring     access to needed services should be enhanced while giving careful consideration     to protecting each client's rights.        Implications of the Findings      The findings presented above represent a consolidation of statements, tabulations, or observations accumulated during several months of information seeking. Few of the findings are unique to any one service program; they tended to cover concerns and opportunities involving multiple programs and agencies. The next chapter briefly describes the processes used to distill the accumulated information and to develop recommendations for a comprehensive approach for the Department.

Wash, DC: 1999.    2.   HHS is responsible for five programs specifically targeted to homeless persons. Three of these were acknowledged in the GAO report:            Health Care for the Homeless , providing primary care services to homeless     persons;           Runaway and Homeless Youth programs , providing street outreach,     transitional living, and basic service centers for this population; and          Projects for Assistance in Transition from Homelessness , assisting     States to provide a variety of services to homeless persons with serious     psychiatric problems.     HHS is also responsible for a  Federal Surplus Real Property  program that transfers surplus Federal land and buildings to organizations that use it to provide homeless assistance. Since the latter program was not a direct service program, it was not included in the 1999 GAO study. Finally, in 2001, HHS added its newest targeted program:  Cooperative Agreements for the Development of Comprehensive Drug and Alcohol Treatment for Systems for Homeless Persons , stressing service delivery to those with substance use problems. All of these programs emphasize service responses to homelessness and cumulatively report assisting more than 600,000 homeless persons annually. In this report, the emphasis was on the contribution the non-targeted HHS programs can make to reducing and ending chronic homelessness. The Department acknowledges the vital contributions the targeted programs are already making in addressing chronic homelessness and the de facto role they will play in a comprehensive approach.    3.   This is not meant to convey that other HHS assistance programs are not relevant or applicable to chronic homelessness. The selection of these eight was consistent with expectations established by the earlier GAO study and provided a diverse sample of HHS programs for consideration.    4.   Personal communication to W. Leginski from L. Hatton, May 2002.    5.   The authorization for some of these mainstream programs may restrict whether the Department can obtain specific data on homelessness. Only the Community Health Centers reported data for the service of primary health care, indicating that the service was provided to 80,000 homeless persons.    6.   ""Eliminating the Silos"" January 2002. The Midwest Welfare Peer Assistance Network: Madison, WI. p. 2.     [ Go to  Contents  ]      Chapter 4:    How the Plan Was Developed       [  Top  |  Contents  |  Main Page of Report  ]       Addressing the Charge      The overall charge to the Work Group was to develop and recommend a comprehensive approach for how the Department could contribute to the Administration's goal of ending chronic homelessness in a decade. The approach had to be responsive to three (1)  components of the original charge. Each of these components has been restated as a separate charge addressed by the plan.            To improve access  for persons experiencing chronic     homelessness — 'determine what actions can be taken to expand access     to treatments and supports for chronically homeless persons.'          To improve service coordination  — 'identify     partnerships at the federal, national, state, and local levels to improve     coordinated service delivery.'          To prevent additional chronic homelessness  — 'identify     and address the risks of homelessness faced by current service participants'     and 'provide treatments and supports that contribute to housing stability.'     The Administration's goal to end to chronic homelessness in a decade has been incorporated into the charge by offering both short term recommendations, reflecting actions for the next two years, as and recommendations that would allow the Department to evolve and adapt throughout the decade.      The Structure of the Plan      A comprehensive plan for HHS on chronic homelessness should demonstrate parallels to the HHS strategic plan to permit its possible consolidation into the HHS strategic plan. Therefore, the Work Group has used the components of the HHS strategic plan —  mission, goals, objectives, and strategies  — to structure its recommendations.   The  mission and goals  are readily derived from the overall charge and the three component charges noted above. Within each of the three goals, the Work Group formulated  objectives  — statements that are unique to each goal and articulate what the Department might try to accomplish. They have been stated with a long-term focus, but could be modified based on experience or policy.   For each set of goals and objectives,  strategies  that implement the goal and its objectives have also been listed. These strategies have a shorter time frame: It is generally the Work Group's expectation that they would be focused on during the next two years.   While the time frame for these strategies may be short term, the actions they reflect are founded on the relatively well-defined repertoire of responses that the Department and its programs must work within. The Department's repertoire is summarized in the themes noted in the insert. One of more or these themes characterizes each of the strategies for action stated in the next chapter.                Recurring Themes for Opportunities Where HHS May Take Action:                        Application processes, waivers, or conditions for HHS    funding  — Capitalizing on the work processes by which awards    and entitlement programs are granted, such as application instructions,    opportunities to request waivers from standard operations, or conditions    that must be met to receive funding.        Tools, technical assistance, and training  — Developing and    delivering guidance such as curricula, blueprints, or best practices in the    form of materials, training events, and technical assistance interventions    such as site visits or specialized consultations.        Administrative flexibility  — Examining opportunities for    relief or flexibility in administrative practices that may be creating    impediments for eligible persons to participate in an HHS assistance program.        Organizational realignment  — Considering structural changes    that would improve the administration of programs.                       Action steps typically constitute the next component of a plan. However, since each of these strategies will need to be considered by the divisions of the Department that are responsible for the relevant program, action steps are not offered in this report. The final level of the plan presents  examples . For each strategy, brief examples of how the strategy might be implemented have been developed. The examples apply either to specific operating divisions within HHS or may have broader Departmental application. The examples are illustrative;  their viability under Department authority or regulation has not yet been vetted .   As the strategies are explored by the divisions that make up HHS, the examples may fall away or undergo substantial modification. Actions by Department and its components will be based on careful consideration of each of the following:           Authority         Resources, staffing, and program applicability         Time frame for accomplishment         Cost to the State or grantee         Internal consistency         The best sequence for implementation        Feasibility of Recommendations      The Work Group was further assisted in developing its goals and strategies by program officials from the eight mainstream programs identified in  Chapter 2 . The officials were invited to review an extensive listing of potential recommendations and, using a standard response protocol, to identify:           The program's current implementation of any activity related to the     recommendation;         What HHS agencies should be involved if the recommendation were to move to     the implementation stage;         If there were cost implications to the program, States, or grantees; and         If new legislation or regulation would be required.     The responses of the program officials were considered before shaping final suggestions. The desire was to ensure a mix of challenges, rather than a set of recommendations that might be too complex to be attempted or a set that was so elementary that it reflected actions that had already been taken in the programs.   The result of all of the processes described above is presented in the next chapter.      Endnotes       1.   A charge to the work group also called for establishing monitoring and evaluation benchmarks. The absence of data to inform the Department about a baseline suggested considerable developmental work would be needed before empirical benchmarks could be established. The plan includes a recommendation for this work.       [ Go to  Contents  ]      Chapter 5:     A Formal Statement of the HHS    Comprehensive Plan to End Chronic   Homelessness (1)       [  Top  |  Contents  |  Main Page of Report  ]       Mission:  To end chronic homelessness in a decade.    Goals:             Goal 1.       Improve access to treatments and supports                  Objective:   Expand the capacity of HHS programs to assist persons experiencing chronic  homelessness.           Strategies that Help Homeless People               Develop approaches in relevant programs to strengthen outreach and engagement      activities that will facilitate enrollment in treatment and service programs      of individuals who are chronically homeless.              Examples:                     Encourage mainstream programs that support outreach and case management   to identify chronically homeless persons as potentially eligible candidates   for these services. Where appropriate, pursue new funding to expand services   such as increased outreach, increased case management/enrollment assistance,   or ombudsman programs for homeless persons that will advocate for service   access.              Investigate approaches that expedite eligibility processes (such as reducing   or simplifying documentation requirements, and/or use out- stationing where   applicable) or advances in technology and communications that expedite the   exchange and processing of information, including rural areas or where providers   are distant from clinic sites and Disability Determination Offices.                   Implement approaches in relevant programs that facilitate prompt eligibility      review for persons identified as chronically homeless or at risk of becoming      chronically homeless.              Examples:                     Relevant Operating Divisions could establish an interagency agreement   with the Social Security Administration (SSA) to provide cross training for   people working with homeless individuals on appropriate medical documentation   needed to determine disability.               SSA should be encouraged to designate appropriate contacts in Disability   Determination Service offices who would work with individuals serving as   homeless ombudsmen in HHS programs to identify barriers to eligibility and   work collaboratively to rectify them.               Promote the inclusion of homeless shelters among the entities conducting   eligibility and enrollment functions for mainstream programs.                    Explore ways to maintain periods of program eligibility and/or avoid loss      of coverage for individuals who are chronically homeless.              Example:                      Encourage States to ""suspend"" and not ""terminate"" Medicaid eligibility   for individuals who are institutionalized so that the individuals do not   have to initiate the application process over again upon their release.                      Strategies to Give Service Providers Tools, Training or Technical  Assistance               Develop toolkits and blueprints that describe exemplary outreach, enrollment,      and service delivery approaches for persons experiencing chronic homelessness,      disseminate them and support their use in in-service training.               Examples:                     Develop interagency agreements between relevant Operating Divisions (e.g.,   the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, the Health Resources and   Services Administration, Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services   Administration, etc) and the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development   (HUD) to develop tools that explain the basic eligibility requirements for   mainstream programs and health and social service resources available to   homeless persons. These tools should be designed for use by both individuals   who are homeless and providers/persons who assist them.               SAMHSA is developing a blueprint on ending chronic homelessness.                   Provide training and technical assistance for mainstream service providers      on steps that can be taken to end chronic homelessness.              Examples:                     Repeat the ""We Can Do This"" training conference (SAMHSA's 2001 training   on ending chronic homelessness among persons with behavioral health problems)   on a biennial basis and emphasize the participation of mainstream service   providers as sponsors and presenters to encourage the inclusion of chronically   homeless persons in their activities.              Identify annual meetings of homeless-specific grantees (e.g., annual   Health Care for the Homeless Conference) and of associations representing   mainstream programs (e.g., meetings of the American Public Human Services   Association) and capitalize on opportunities to present approaches to improving   access for persons experiencing chronic homelessness.              Promote the availability of technical assistance documents on services   and policy issues related to chronic homelessness via internet access,   distribution at relevant meetings, and to academic settings offering instruction   on the issue of homelessness.                   Support the homeless-specific service providers assisted by HHS in developing      and establishing administrative arrangements with mainstream providers to      ensure that their homeless clients can effectively use the mainstream programs      for which they are eligible.              Example:                      Develop program guidance showcasing exemplary practices, based on actual   experiences, that demonstrates how effective collaboration can be achieved   between the homeless-specific service system, including faith and community-based   providers, and the mainstream system. These exemplary practices may include   co-location arrangements, financial agreements between two systems,   restructuring, and/or skill-specialization agreements that recognize the   differences in the systems to work with clients at various stages of readiness   to benefit from mainstream services.                    Establish a formal program of training for providers of services to persons      experiencing chronic homelessness.              Example:                      Fund an expansion of the existing training centers in HRSA's Bureau   of Health Professions to  provide intensive training on providing   effective services, outreach and care to persons who are chronically homeless.   Training could extend beyond mainstream providers to include opportunities   for formerly homeless persons to become providers. A training certificate   for specific skill sets acquired in training (e.g., outreach worker) or for   completing the overall curriculum could be awarded as an indication of the   quality of the training process.                   Provide technical assistance to States through State Policy Academies to      develop and implement State-specific action plans to identify and address      chronic homelessness.              Example:                      Expand the Policy Academy on Chronic Homelessness from an event that   reaches a limited number of States to an opportunity for all States willing   to implement an action plan to end chronic homelessness in their State. Provide   participating States with up to one year of intensive technical assistance   to achieve a break-through in policy direction.                      Strategies that Involve New or Realigned Funding               As mainstream programs formulate future budgets or experience budget growth,      set priorities for a sharpened focus on addressing chronic homelessness.              Examples:                      a) In developing budget submissions for future years, relevant mainstream   programs should reflect the Department's goal of reducing chronic homelessness   by including activities that will support the goal.               b) Direct a percentage of the growth in the community health care center   funding to services to chronic homelessness.               c) Relevant block grant programs should actively examine how their programs   can contribute to the Department's and Administration's goal of ending chronic   homelessness, including the feasibility of legislative proposals that identify   the inclusion of homelessness or establishing priorities for the use of any   increased funding for the program.                      Strategies for Accountability               Establish a work group under the HHS Data Council that will investigate the      feasibility of developing quality measures and/or performance measure(s)      that can be reported by States and grantees to reflect the access of chronically      homeless persons to mainstream assistance programs. Where appropriate and      feasible, the measures should be uniform across these assistance programs.        The work group should identify implementation issues, the frequency      of reporting, and how requested reporting might vary across the different      types of assistance programs to provide the Department with a baseline and      ability to monitor changes over time.               Examples:                     SAMHSA has developed the following ""core client outcome measure"" for   its discretionary programs, which may be applicable to other mainstream   programs:                    Number of clients who are homeless (i.e. no fixed address, includes       shelters) at admission to a treatment setting and at six months post-admission.                         In annual reports or grant/project reports, require State and local grantees   to provide timely information, e.g. no less then every two years, describing   how program activities have assisted homeless persons.               HUD allows applicants for homeless grants to request funding to develop   homeless management information systems (HMIS) that can provide HUD with   annual performance data. These HMIS approaches could be examined as a possible   source of information on the use of HHS assistance to address chronic   homelessness.                           Goal 2.       Improve coordination at Federal, State, and local levels                  Objectives   Develop a framework for promoting collaboration in providing services to  persons experiencing chronic homelessness at Federal, State, and local levels.     Use the Interagency Council on Homelessness and other interagency mechanisms  to coordinate planning, programmatic activities, and evaluation that address  chronic homelessness efforts in HHS with HUD, VA, and other relevant Departments.           Strategies to Promote Collaboration               Promote and incentivize coordination between all mainstream and homeless-specific      HHS funding sources that address chronic homelessness.              Examples:                     Where appropriate, add a new section to applications requesting funding   for mainstream assistance that requires the applicants to demonstrate how   the assistance will be used in concert with other HHS support to form an   integrated safety net for poor and disabled individuals and families. Require   that they articulate outcomes associated with the coordination and that they   have an infrastructure in place to operationalize and manage this   coordination.              Develop an incentive program in which States submitting block grant   applications that demonstrate a coordinated set of activities to address   services to homeless people (including those who are chronically homeless)   across mainstream programs are eligible for a partial bonus payment up front,   with the balance of the bonus based on their achievement of a performance   goal they set-e.g., number of chronically homeless people receiving comprehensive   support in housing.                    Provide incentives for States and localities to coordinate HHS-assisted services      and housing for persons experiencing long-term homelessness.              Examples:                     Permit applicants to use grant funds to support interagency collaborations   that address chronic homelessness, including expenses for FTEs associated   with partnership activities, incentive funds, flexible fund reserves,   contributions to HUD continuum of care activities, etc.              In competitive applications for services (such as community health centers,   some Ryan White programs, SAMHSA's Grants for the Benefit of Homeless   Individuals), give bonus points to applicants willing to address chronic   homelessness via partnerships with other types of providers, notably housing   providers.              Permit States and communities to experiment with various approaches to   creating a coordinated, comprehensive system of services to address chronic   homelessness (e.g., establish an infrastructure that supports coordination,   have flexibility in the use of funds, forge systemic relationships between   providers for effective client referral, conduct cross-system training) and   introduce new service technologies (e.g., assertive case management models,   critical time intervention approaches). This might be done as pilot projects,   under existing authorities, such as the recent Medicare+Choice arrangements   with preferred provider organizations.                   Permit flexibility in paying for services delivered to individuals experiencing      chronic homelessness, particularly involving services from different funding      streams.              Examples:                     Explore the authority for appropriate grantees to designate a percentage   amount of an award that can be used flexibly and to assist in providing timely,   comprehensive services to a person who is chronically homeless, e.g., to   secure a critical service that is only available from another provider.              Allow States to blend a small portion of funds from multiple, relevant   HHS assistance programs to target homelessness. The Listening Session presenters   referred to the application of this concept to homelessness as a 'mini-waiver.'   This could be done through a multi-program waiver or through relief from   cost allocation rules for this portion of the funds. One large-scale version   of this was attempted with the flexible authorities proposed in legislation   reauthorizing the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program. The intent   of such flexible waivers and authorities is a relaxation of rules would be   to permit States to experiment with adaptive uses of these assistance programs   to respond comprehensively and flexibly to the needs of poor and disabled   clients. Persons experiencing chronic homelessness should be included in   this consideration.              Develop a pilot program that covers multiple mainstream programs and   allows funds to be pooled for a specific purpose. For example, multiple systems   could contribute resources to pay for continuity of case management. As the   chronically homeless client progresses from homeless-to-housed or receives   services from different systems, the case manager would remain constant,   ensure consistency of a treatment plan, and be empowered to work with each   system.                       Strategies to Improve Coordination               Establish an ongoing body within HHS to identify, monitor, and coordinate      Departmental activities to address services to eligible persons experiencing      homelessness, including those with long term and repeated patterns of      homelessness, and coordinate these efforts with other Federal agencies.              Example:                      Charge and rename the Secretary's Work Group on Ending Chronic Homelessness   to serve in this capacity. Subcommittees of the Work Group could address   and advise on specific facets such as chronic homelessness or homelessness   among families with children. The Work Group could also ensure that the   activities undertaken by the Department are periodically assessed and adjusted   to achieve long-term outcomes, e.g., ending chronic homelessness.                           Goal 3       Prevent additional chronic homelessness                  Objectives:   Promote programs and policies designed to ensure that persons returning to  the community from institutional or other sheltered settings (including foster  care) do not become homeless.     Promote programs and policies that address the service and housing needs  of persons identified as at-risk of housing loss who are currently participating  in HHS assisted mainstream programs.           Strategies to Reduce the Incidence of Homelessness               Identify both the risk and protective factors for homelessness and preventive      interventions that could be used to identify and prevent homelessness among      persons at risk.              Examples:                     The Research Coordination Council could be requested to examine how HHS   can synthesize, sponsor or conduct epidemiological and health services research   on protective and risk factors for homelessness and to identify preventive   interventions that could be provided in health care and human services settings   that are effective at preventing at-risk clients from entering a pattern   of residential instability that could result in chronic homelessness. A   dissemination plan should be an integral part of a department plan.              NIH or AHRQ could sponsor investigator-initiated research to examine   the organization, effectiveness, and cost of such preventive interventions.   In addition, NIH or ASPE could also fund a contract for a 'meta-analysis'   of existing research and evaluation studies on the histories of persons   experiencing long-term homelessness to determine what is known about identifiable   risk factors for chronic homelessness. Alternatively, this could be done   by stimulating investigator initiated research in NIH that explores these   factors and then applies them retrospectively to shelter data bases and assesses   their predictive ability. The risk factors could then be promulgated as 'markers   of concern' to mainstream providers so that current clients with these   characteristics might have housing stability issues included in their treatment   plans.                   Identify and promote the use of effective, evidence-based homelessness prevention      interventions, ranging from family strengthening and high-risk youth programs      to specific interventions such as discharge planning, Assertive Community      Treatment (ACT) and Critical Time Intervention (CTI). Develop and disseminate      guidelines for these interventions in order to reduce the incidence of      individuals being placed in emergency shelter or other fragile residential      circumstances.              Examples:                      HRSA has recently supported a grantee to disseminate discharge-planning   guidance via the Internet. The applicability of this homelessness prevention   strategy could be reinforced via in-service training, letters of guidance,   and other dissemination approaches.              Conduct replicability studies of ACT and CTI and provide models and   guidelines for their use in community based settings, as well as their   applicability to effective discharge planning.                         An Alternate Listing      The above approach organizes the goals and strategies under each of the original charges to the Work Group. Such an approach demonstrates the responsiveness of the Work Group to each charge, but is not the only way of presenting HHS' comprehensive approach. This alternative listing may also prove useful. Three restated goals describe the HHS plan to end chronic homelessness:            Help eligible, chronically homeless persons receive health and social     services;           Empower our State and community partners to improve their response to     the needs of homeless people; and            Work to prevent new episodes of homelessness within the HHS clientele.           The strategies listed previously can be aligned with each of these restated goals to present a comprehensive approach. They are briefly paraphrased and aligned with one of the above goals:     Help eligible, chronically homeless individuals receive health and social   services             Strengthen outreach and engagement activities         Improve the eligibility review process         Explore ways to maintain program eligibility         Improve the transition of clients from homeless-specific programs to mainstream     service providers       Empower our State and community partners to improve their response to people   experiencing chronic homelessness.             Use State Policy Academies to help States develop specific action plans to     respond to chronic homelessness         Permit flexibility in paying for services that respond to the needs of persons     with multiple problems         Reward coordination across HHS assistance programs to address the multiple     problems of chronically homeless people         Provide incentives for States and localities to coordinate services and housing         Develop, disseminate and use toolkits and blueprints to strengthen outreach,     enrollment, and service delivery         Provide training and technical assistance on chronic homelessness to mainstream     service providers         Establish a formal program of training on chronic homelessness         Address chronic homelessness in the formulation of future HHS budgets or     in priorities for using a portion of expanded resources         Develop an approach for baseline data, performance measurement, and the     measurement of reduced chronic homelessness within HHS         Establish an ongoing oversight body within HHS to direct and monitor the     plan       Work to prevent new episodes of homelessness within the HHS clientele             Identify risk and protective factors to prevent future episodes of chronic     homelessness         Promote the use of effective, evidence-based homelessness prevention     interventions        Closing Considerations      These recommendations form a basis for the programs of HHS to explore ways in which their actions can contribute to the Administration's goal of ending chronic homelessness. They are neither prescriptive nor exhaustive of the possibilities for programs. However, in recognizing that categorical program approaches have limits in responding to the needs of a multi-problem clientele, the Work Group explicitly avoided recommendations that create additional programs or funding streams. Success is not measured exclusively by the existence of a program, but from the accumulation of operations supported by:           a program mission;         a management structure to carry out the mission;         policies that guide operations;         funding and incentives for the activities of the program;         technical assistance to ensure credible and accountable activities; and         outcomes that demonstrate the success of the above.     The Work Group believes the Administration's goal of ending chronic homelessness combined with the recommendations offered above accumulate to provide these six supports. Their interaction will guarantee the Department's success.      Endnotes       1.   It is assumed throughout this document that no strategies will be implemented without seeking and attaining all relevant legislative and/or regulatory changes needed to ensure that all programs within HHS continue to operate within their given authority and mission. It is also assumed that, to the extent the strategies seek to impose any requirements on applicants as conditions of given awards, before doing so, programs will confirm that their authorizing authority and program/administrative regulations permit such imposition of conditions. It is further assumed that no proposals will be implemented without resolving any inherent budget implications.           Where to?

This report, issued in March 1960, is the response to that          legislative mandate.         March 23, 1960                  THE RETIREMENT TEST           UNDER OLD-AGE AND SURVIVORS INSURANCE         A Report on a Study Called for by the Committee on Ways and Means          of the House of Representatives, 85th Congress, Second Session, in House          Report No. 2288 on H.R. 13549, the Social Security Amendments of 1958                  Department of Health, Education, and Welfare          Washington, D.C.: 1960                                         Hon. Wilbur D. Mills Chairman,              Committee on Ways and Means              House of Representatives              Washington 25, D.C.                Dear Mr. Chairman,                I have the honor to transmit to you a report on ""The Retirement              Test Under Old-Age and Survivors Insurance."" This report was              occasioned in part by the request of your Committee in its report              accompanying H.R. 13549 the Social Security Amendments of 1958 (85th              Congress,, 2nd Session, H. Rept. 2288). You will recall that the report              asked the Department to study certain aspects of the retirement test.                             Although in the opinion of the Department the retirement test is an              essential part of the old-age and survivors insurance program, the              test in its present form is subject to a number of valid criticisms.              The Department has taken this occasion to make a study, not only of              the particular problem the Committee expressed concern about, but              also of other aspects of the retirement test. The Department presents              in this report a proposal that it has developed to improve the retirement              test so as to eliminate or greatly reduce the causes for criticism.                             We are convinced that this is the best solution that can be devised              to the problems involved; but we have not concluded upon whether it              is desirable to provide for an increase in taxes in order to make              enactment of the proposal possible. The Department plans to continue              its evaluation of this question                Sincerely yours,              Secretary                                   THE RETIREMENT TEST                    UNDER OLD-AGE AND SURVIVORS INSURANCE         The report of the Committee on Ways and Means of the House of Representatives          on the Social Security Amendments of 1958 (House Report No. 2288) contains          the following section calling for a study of the retirement test under          the old-age and survivors insurance program:         ""The committee has asked the Department of Health, Education, and          Welfare to study certain aspects of the present test of retirement which          seem to the committee to have questionable results. The present test is          basically on an annual basis but under one of the provisions benefits          are nevertheless paid for any month in which an individual earns $80 or          less ($100 or less under the bill) and does not render substantial services          in self-employment. Thus a person may have very high earnings in a single          month and yet get benefits for the remaining 11 months in the year. We          have asked the Department to consider possible changes in this provision.""         In response to this request, the Department of Health, Education, and          Welfare has conducted a comprehensive study of the retirement test, with          particular attention to various changes in the retirement test designed          to meet the problem the Committee had expressed interest in. This report          sets forth the findings of that study.                   WHY          THERE IS A TEST OF RETIREMENT IN OLD-AGE AND SURVIVORS INSURANCE         The basic purpose of the old-age and survivors insurance program is to          provide benefits for workers and their families when the worker's earnings          can be presumed to have stopped or to have been substantially reduced          as a result of his retirement, disability, or death. Since it is not reasonable          to presume that all workers retire or suffer a significant reduction in          earnings upon attainment of age 65, the program includes a ""retirement          test""--a provision intended to restrict the payment of benefits to          those among the aged who can be presumed to have suffered such a loss.         If the retirement test had been removed from the program in June 1959,          about 1.4 million people age 65 and over (working people and their dependents)          who had not been getting benefits up until then could have immediately          started to get benefits. Many of these people are working full time and          earning as much as they ever have in their lives; the payment of full          benefits to them would serve no socially useful purpose. And the removal          of the test would not help the vast majority of beneficiaries now on the          rolls, who are unable to work or to get jobs.         Payment of full benefits to all of the aged who are still working would          be very costly, both in the immediate future and in the long run. Benefit          costs in 1959 would have been increased by about $2 billion if the retirement          test had not been in effect for that year. In terms of long-range costs,          the removal of the test would increase the level-premium cost of old-age          and survivors insurance by 1 percent of taxable earnings--an increase          of 12 percent in the estimated level-premium cost of the old-age and survivors          insurance provisions (8.38 percent of taxable earnings). [1 ]         [1] The disability insurance part of the program is estimated to cost          an additional 0.35 percent of taxable earnings.         The Social Security Board, the Federal Security Agency (predecessor of          the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare) and the Department have          always recommended in the past, and the Department recommends now, that          a test of retirement be retained in the old-age and survivors insurance          program.                   THE PROVISIONS OF THE PRESENT RETIREMENT TEST          [1 ]         Under the present retirement test a beneficiary gets all of his benefits          when his earnings are $1200 or less in a year (this is the concept referred          to in the report as the ""exempt amount""). Anyone making $1200          or less is, in effect, presumed to be retired. Beneficiaries may get benefits,          therefore, even though they have a significant amount of part-time work          on a regular basis or have relatively high earnings for part of the year.          (In fact, there undoubtedly are a few people at even this relatively low          level of $1200 a year who are working full time and earning as much as          they did before age 65.)         Ordinarily, a beneficiary has a check withheld [2] for each $80, or part          of $80, in excess of $1200 in earnings (the concept referred to throughout          this report as the ""unit of excess earnings"" or the ""excess          unit""). This means that a beneficiary gets at least one benefit if          his earnings are $2080 a year or less. [3 ] The          reason why the number of benefit payments that can be made in a year varies          as earnings vary between $1200 and $2080 is to avoid a sharp line below          which all benefits would be payable for a year and above which none would          be payable. If the test were not graduated, it would not be uncommon to          have the payment of $2000 or more in benefits depend on a few dollars          of earnings. The law also provides that no matter what his annual earnings,          a beneficiary gets a benefit for any month in which he neither earns wages          of more than $100 nor renders substantial services in self-employment          (this provision is referred to as the ""monthly measure of retirement"").         [1] The limitation on the amount of earnings a beneficiary may haveand          get benefits, although designed primarily as a test of retirement for          the aged worker, also applies to beneficiaries receiving dependents' and          survivors` benefits under the program.         [2] Where the dependents of a retired worker are getting benefits          based on his earnings, those benefits are withheld for any month for which          his benefit is withheld.         [3 ]  The figure $2080          is the result of adding to the $1200 exempt amount 11 times $80. Thus          at least one month's benefit is payable when earnings for a full year          are $1200 plus $880 ($80 for each of the 11 months).         The retirement test does not apply to beneficiaries aged 72 or over;          after that age, benefits are payable regardless of the beneficiary's earnings.          (This provision was enacted in recognition of the fact that a few people--particularly          the self-employed--continue working to a very advanced age. Without this          provision these people might never get any benefits even though they had          paid contributions longer than most other beneficiaries.) The test applies          to the earnings   of beneficiaries in covered and non-covered          work in the United States and covered work outside the United States.          (A special provision applies to beneficiaries working in non-covered work          outside the United States so that levels of earnings in foreign countries          need not be equated with those in the United States.)                   HOW          THE RETIREMENT TEST DEVELOPED         The reasons why the test has taken its present quite complicated form          will be easier to understand if the considerations that led to the various          changes that have been made in it through the years are reviewed.         From 1940 through 1950 the test of retirement applied only to earnings          from covered employment. During those years work as an employee in commerce          and industry was, generally speaking, the only employment covered by the          program. The test was entirely on a monthly basis; the beneficiary got          a benefit for any month in which he earned less than $15 in covered employment.         Effective in 1951, when the self-employed were brought under the program,          the test of retirement for the self-employed was put, for the most part,          on an annual basis. (This was necessary because it is practically impossible          in most cases for a self-employed person to compute his earnings on a          monthly basis.) Specifically, it was provided that a person with self-employment          earnings of $600 or less for the year could get benefits for all months          in the year no matter what his earnings were in any single month.         One part of the test, however, was placed on a monthly basis even though          the earnings were figured over the whole year. No matter how high his          annual earnings, a self-employed beneficiary could get a benefit for any          month in which he did not render substantial services in his business.          This latter provision served three purposes; First, it placed the self-employed          beneficiary on a par with the wage earner in that he could receive a benefit          for any month in which he did not work or in which he worked very little.          Second, it allowed the payment of benefits to a self-employed beneficiary          for months in which he did no work in the year in which he retired, even          though his total earnings for the year were above the exempt amount by          reason of work done before retirement. And third, the provision allowed          payment of benefits to a person whose self-employment income came, not          from work in operating the business, but rather from the investment he          had in the business.         Two important criticisms of the test soon developed. First, there was          criticism on the basis that the self-employed person could work, say,          for three months, earn up to the annual exempt amount, and still get benefits          for the whole year, while the wage earner who worked in three months and          had the same total yearly earnings had three months' benefits withheld.          (The 1950 amendments provided that a person could not get a benefit for          any month in which he earned over $50 in covered wages.) Second, a beneficiary          who had both self-employment income and wages was in an unwarrantedly          favorable position because he could meet the two tests separately; that          is, he could have earnings from self-employment for the year of as much          as the annual exempt amount, and also have wages in every month amounting          to as much as the monthly exempt amount, and still get all of his benefits.          The 1954 amendments removed these two anomalies by providing that earnings          from self-employment and wage employment would be combined for retirement          test purposes and by providing a test with an annual exempt amount ($1200)          for both the self-employed beneficiary and the wage-earner beneficiary.         The 1954 amendments also provided that the wage earner could get a benefit          for any month in which he earned no more than $80 (this amount was changed          to $100 beginning with 1959) regardless of his earnings for the year.          This provision was included partly to avoid situations where a worker          would not be able to get benefits under the 1954 amendments although he          could have gotten them before. The provision also solved the problem of          finding a way to pay benefits for the rest of a year when a worker retired          in the middle of the year after his earnings were over the exempt amount.          (Without the provision, a worker who retired in July, for example, after          earning $2500 in that year could not get benefits for any part of the          year.)                   THE          NUMBER OF PEOPLE AFFECTED BY THE TEST         At the end of June 1959, 11.1 million of the more than 15.5 million people          age 65 and over in the United States were either getting old-age and survivors          insurance benefits or could have gotten them if the breadwinner of the          family had not been working. Of the 11.1 million, 4.9 million--44 percent--were          age 72 or over and thus did not come under the operation of the retirement          test. Of the remaining 6.2 million, an estimated 3.2 million did not have          any earnings at all. Generally the retirement test does not affect the          benefits these people get because most of them cannot work or cannot find          work. [l] Another 1.0 million are expected to earn less than $900 in the          year and also generally would not be affected by the test.[2] We have,          then, a total of 9.1 million--about 4/5--of the 11.1 million eligible          for benefits who in all likelihood are not directly or concretely affected          by the retirement test.         There are, then, about 2 million of the aged who are directly affected          by the retirement test. The 2 million fall into 3 groups. One group, numbering          about 300,000, is the group of people who are getting full benefits and          who are earning just under $1200 a year (between $900 and $1200). A sizable          proportion of these can be assumed to be deliberately holding their earnings          to $1200 or Just under that amount in order to get full benefits. For          these people the test is clearly operating as a deterrent to work. The          second group, also numbering about 300,000, is the group of people who          are earning between $1200 and $2080 and under the present retirement test          are getting some benefits for the year, the number of benefits being determined          by the specific provisions of the retirement test. [3] The third group,          numbering about 1.4 million, is composed of people who are making over          $2080 in a year and therefore are generally not getting benefits. Some          of these people are working full time and earning about as they did before          they attained age 65; others may have suffered significant reductions          in earning power, although not enough to reduce their income below $2080.          In general, the existence of the retirement test in its present form prevents          these people from getting any benefits for the year.                   [l] In the last survey of beneficiaries conducted by the Bureau of          Old-Age and Survivors Insurance, about 70 percent of those not working          said that they were not able to work.         [2] This group may include a few who are deterred by the provisions          of the test from earning more than they do.         [3] These estimates exclude those who came on the rolls during the          year and earned amounts falling in the indicated range, in most instances          before ""retirement.""                                                                                                                                   THE          COMMITTEE'S REQUEST         The Committee asked the Department to consider possible changes in the          provision of law under which a person may have very high earnings in a          single month and yet get benefits for the remaining 11 months of the year.          The situation the Committee is concerned about grows out of the provision          in the law setting up a monthly measure of retirement. This is the provision          under which benefits are not withheld for any month in which the beneficiary          neither earns wages of more than $100 nor renders substantial services          in self-employment, regardless of what his total earnings are within the          year.                   Possible          Elimination of the Monthly Measure of Retirement         In seeking a solution for the problem raised by the Committee the Department          considered first whether the monthly measure of retirement should be eliminated,          but came to the conclusion that it should not.         A major function of the monthly measure is to make it possible to pay          benefits to a retired worker beginning with the first month of his retirement.          Without a monthly measure of retirement, if a person retired from full-time          work at the end of June, for example, after earning more than $2080 in          a year, he could not get benefits until the following January. It would          not seem reasonable for the program to require that a beneficiary go through          the first several months of retirement without getting benefits. The benefits          should start as soon as possible after earnings cease, when the need for          the benefits arises; the monthly measure of retirement is the provision          in the present law that makes this possible.         Moreover, since people move in and out of employment after reaching retirement          age, the problem is not confined to the year of initial retirement for          each beneficiary. For example, take a person who has been on the benefit          rolls for a year, getting $100 a month, and now has a chance to take a          job in January, and does so. He thinks he will be able to keep on working          and he spends most or all of his earnings for current living expenses.          In June of the following year his employer goes out of business and he          is unable to get another job. Now, because in the first months of the          year he has earned, say, $2100, he cannot get benefits for the next 6          months, and will not have earnings either.         And the problem exists not only for people who leave employment in the          middle of a year, but also for those who return to work during the course          of a year. Take for example a beneficiary who has been retired from a          regular full-time job and has gotten benefits of $110 a month for a year          or so. He is not satisfied to be idle and would like to work. An opportunity          comes up for him in July of his second retirement year to take a full-time          job paying $85 a week. If he takes it he will earn $2210, and therefore          will have to return the $660 in benefits that he has already gotten or          have his benefits withheld at a point when he is no longer earning. This          will seem quite unfair to him, since he was not working during the months          when he got the benefits. Moreover, the need to repay the benefits will          be a significant barrier to his taking the job.         Removing the monthly measure of retirement would prevent the payment          of benefits in cases where under present law some benefits are paid to          the beneficiary in a year even though he may have had high earnings for          a few months of the year. But removal of the monthly measure would make          it impossible to pay benefits promptly upon retirement, and therefore          would prevent the program from carrying out a major one of its objectives.          Accordingly, the Department recommends that a monthly measure of retirement          be retained in the program.                   A Separate          Retirement Test for People with Relatively High Earnings         The Department believes there is only one feasible proposal for preventing          benefit payments where a person has relatively high earnings in a few          months of the year. The Department is of the opinion, however, that the          way in which the law operates at present is to be preferred, and it does          not recommend adoption of this proposal. The proposal would add, on top          of the present retirement test, a provision that no matter how little          he worked, a person could not get full benefits if his earnings for the          year were above some fairly high figure--for example, $4800 (the present          maximum on taxable and creditable earnings). One form such a proposal          might take would be to withhold one monthly benefit for, say, every $400          of earnings above $4800 in a year. To take account of the peculiar circumstances          of self-employed people, it might be provided that the proposal would          not apply to a self-employed person unless he actually had done some work          during the year.         Here are some examples illustrating how the proposal would operate:         1. A farmer moves into town after turning the operation of his farm over          to a paid manager. He gets a profit of $6000 from the operation of the          farm. If he did absolutely no work in connection with operating the farm          he would get benefits for the full year just as he does under present          law. If, however, he helped with the work during the spring plantings          he could get benefits for only nine months; three benefits would be withheld          because of his income from the farm even though he worked in only one          month.         2. A movie star works on a picture during 2 months of a year and earns          $10000. He does not work in the other months of the year. Under present          law he could get benefits for the 10 months in which he did not work.          Under the proposal he would get no benefits.         3. An operator of a mail order business turns the management of the business          over to his son and moves to Florida; his business yields him $7200 in          earnings. Like the farmer in the first example, if he did not work at          all he would get benefits for the whole year. If he did do any work at          all in connection with the business he would get benefits for only six          months; six benefits would be withheld.         As the examples show, a self-employed beneficiary with a business that          produces a high income would, under the proposal, have to completely disassociate          himself from the operation of his business in order to get full benefits.          Under the proposal as much as a whole year's benefits would depend on          whether the beneficiary did any work at all.         When a self-employed beneficiary has high earnings and yet works in his          business very little during the year most of his earnings probably come          from his investment in the business rather than from the work he performed.          Thus the effect of the proposal in many cases would be to withhold benefits          on the basis of investment income. But the wage-earner beneficiary can          get his benefits even though his invested savings yield a large income.          There is no good reason why the self-employed person should not be able          to have income from his investment in his business without losing his          rights to benefits. [1]         [1] Income from investments in real estate, stocks, bonds and the          like is not taxed for social security nor credited toward benefits, nor          does it count for purposes of the retirement test. If benefits were withheld          from people who have income from investments and other forms of savings,          the program would discourage personal savings.         More important than the undesirable effect just described is the fact          that the proposal would add complexity to an already too complex provision          in order to deny benefits to a very small group of beneficiaries. And          the beneficiaries would be people who really are essentially retired.          Generally speaking, any person who would be prevented from getting benefits          solely by this provision is likely to be a person who has retired within          the normal meaning of the word, and there is real justification for paying          benefits to him for months in which he does not work. Because the proposal          would deny benefits to only a very small group, it would not save any          appreciable amount of money; there would be virtually no saving in the          long-run costs of the program.         Because of the serious disadvantages associated with it, the Department          does not favor the adoption of this proposal nor of any proposal that          would have a similar effect.         Conclusion         The Department of Health, Education and Welfare recommends that no action          be taken to remove the monthly measure of retirement or to put an additional          earnings limitation on top of the present retirement test. Acceptance          by the Congress of this recommendation would mean that the situation that          the Committee has expressed interest in--the payment of benefits to a          person even though he may have had very high earnings for a few months          in a year--will not be changed. The Department believes that, for the          very few retired people who come out of retirement for a short time and          earn substantial amounts of income, the most appropriate action is to          suspend their benefits for the months in which they actually worked. This          is the approach taken in the present law and in fact the approach that          has always been taken under the law. Ever since the program started paying          monthly benefits the retirement test has been so framed that a person          could get a benefit for any month in which he did not work, regardless          of how much he worked or earned in any other month; and generally, over          the years, this approach has been accepted without disfavor. Moreover,          it is the only approach that is consistent with the treatment that should          be, and is, accorded to a person in the year in which he first retires          (that is, it is consistent with the payment of benefits to a person for          months after retirement even if he has earned large sums in that same          year before he retired).                   THE          RETIREMENT TEST AND THE QUESTION OF INCENTIVES         The          Problem         Powerful incentives to work for people age 65 and over now exist. Generally,          earnings from work make possible a higher standard of living than most          people can manage to obtain for themselves in retirement, since earnings          generally are much higher than benefits. There are many intangible satisfactions          in work--interesting activity, and the feeling that the man has a contribution          to make to the economy and is an important part of the community. Actually,          most beneficiaries who are not working either are not well enough to work          or cannot find jobs.         Nevertheless, it is unquestionably true that many older people would          do more work than they do if the provisions of the retirement test did          not operate so as to reduce the net addition to their income as a result          of working. This is particularly true of people who are retired from their          regular jobs and who would like to find same part-time or less demanding          work to do. To the extent possible, retired people should be encouraged          to accept jobs, earn money to improve their economic situations, and make          a contribution to production and the national economy. Under present law          it frequently happens that a beneficiary finds himself in a situation          where, while he will be better off if he does a given amount of work than          if he does no work at all, he would be still better off if he could have          managed to restrict his work to a point where he would have earned somewhat          less than he did. Thus the retirement test causes beneficiaries to restrict          their earnings to lesser amounts than they could and would like to earn          in order not to suffer a loss in total income.         An example or two may help to clarify the effect that the test has on          incentives to work. Take the case of a beneficiary getting $1200 a year          in benefits and faced with a choice between a job paying $1800 a year          and one paying $1200. If he takes the $1800 job he will be only $1000          better off than if he does not do any work [1]; but if he takes the $1200          job his increase in income for the year will be $1200. Obviously, he would          do better financially to take the $1200 job, although he might make more          of a contribution to the economy, and feel better about his activities,          if he could afford to, and did, take the $1800 job.         [1] The $600 of earnings in excess of $1200 causes the withholding          of eight benefits of $100 each-$800. Therefore, the worker has $1800 in          earnings and $400 in benefits, or a total of $2200 for the year--$1000          more than the $1200 in benefits he could have gotten if he had not worked          at all.         Or take the case where a beneficiary has occasion to earn just over the          $1200 exempt amount and lose a full month's benefit as a result. (Usually          if he does earn just over 1200 it is through inadvertence or as a result          of demands made upon him by his employer.) Whether the beneficiary actually          does do the extra work and loses a month's benefit, or refrains from doing          the extra work in order to get full benefits, the test is operating in          an undesirable manner, since it either discourages him from work or penalizes          him for working. And this situation can occur not only at the $1200 point,          but at every one of the breaking points from $1200 to $2080. [1]         As a final example, take a man who with his wife has a benefit income          of $180 a month (the maximum under present law) and is offered a job paying          $3000 a year. In this situation it is impossible for the family to lose          in income as the result of the man's work; but the addition to his income          if he takes the job and does $3000 worth of work will be only $840. [2]          If he takes the job he will be somewhat better off financially than if          he does not. And if he is chiefly interested in maximizing his income,          or if the job is particularly interesting or not too demanding, he may          take it in spite of its not being very profitable. On the other hand,          he may well think that the extra $840 in income does not make it worth          his while to take the job. This is a situation in which it might be highly          desirable, for the economy, the beneficiary, and the old-age and survivors          insurance program, for the man to take the job and make whatever contribution          he can. Yet the present law greatly reduces his incentive to do so.         [l] By ""breaking point"" is meant the point at which the          beneficiary loses an additional month's benefit as a result of the operation          of the $80 unit of excess earnings; that is, if he earns more than $1280          he loses 2 months' benefits, if he earns more than $1360 he loses 3 months'          benefits, and so on.         [2] The beneficiary loses benefit income of $2160--12 months' benefits          at 180 a month. Since he would have had $2160 had he not worked and since          he has $3000 as a result of working, the net addition to his income is          $840.         It is generally agreed that provisions of law that operate to discourage          people from working as much as they can and want to work are, in that          respect, undesirable. Even when a person has attained an age that is generally          regarded as the time when retirement from work is taken for granted, it          is probably better for him to continue active, so far as his health will          permit; both the individual himself and the economy as a whole will benefit          by his continuing in productive activity.         It would be highly desirable, then, to bring the provisions of the law          into harmony with the general system of incentives; that is, to devise          a retirement test that would result in a person's having increased income          as a result of increased work that he does.         On the other hand, a point that must be kept in mind in connection with          any proposal that would eliminate or reduce the disincentive effect of          the retirement test is that any such change that can be devised has the          result of increasing the earnings level at which some benefits are payable.          Generally speaking, at present no benefits can be paid to anyone who works          throughout the year and makes more than $2080. All of the proposals described          in the following discussion would increase the level of earnings up to          which some benefits can be paid.         The fact must be faced that the retirement test is the center of an insoluble          dilemma. There is, on the one hand, the need to conserve the funds of          the program by not paying benefits to people who have substantial work          income, and on the other hand, the need to avoid interfering with incentives          to work. Both of these objectives cannot be fully accomplished. The best          that can be done is to accommodate the two, so that while the funds of          the system are in large part directed to the most socially useful purposes,          at the same time interference with incentives to work is kept at a reasonably          low level.                   Proposals          to Improve Incentives                   An          increase in the exempt amount --The proposal for changing          the retirement test that is most frequently advanced is to increase the          exempt amount above the present $1200 level--for example, to $1500. This          proposal has a great deal of popular appeal. It is the kind of change          in the retirement test that people usually think of first--in some cases,          perhaps, because the $1200 exempt amount is the only part of the retirement          test that they are familiar with. And an increase in the exempt amount          would result in increased income for many beneficiaries. People who are          able to control their earnings and who now limit them to $1200 in a year          would be encouraged to increase their work to the point where they earned          $1500 (if that were the new exempt amount), and all those who earn between          $1200 and $2380 [1] would get more benefits than they can under present          law.         [1] The $2380 figure is $1500 plus $880 (i.e., 11 x $80).                  Increasing the exempt amount would not, however, have much effect on the          problem of improving incentives to work, except for amounts of earnings          up to the new exempt amount, nor would it remove any of the problems and          inequities of the present test; it would merely change the point at which          they occur. If the new amount were $1500, a man who had a choice between          a job paying $1800 and a job paying $1500 would generally do better financially          to take the lower-paying job; and the person who planned to earn exactly          $1500 and inadvertently went just over that amount would have the same          problem of losing more in benefits than his earnings above the exempt          amount.         If the exempt amount were raised an increase in the other elements of          the test--the unit of excess earnings (now $80) and the monthly measure          of retirement (now $100)--might seem to be called for. Setting the excess          unit and the monthly measure at the same amount, and both at one-twelfth          of the exempt amount, has the merit of simplicity, but it is not essential          that all three elements correspond. It is quite important for the sake          of public understanding that the monthly measure of retirement be one-twelfth          of. the exempt amount. People interpret $1200 a year to mean $100 a month.          Before the 1958 amendments, when the exempt amount was $1200 and the monthly          measure $80, many people did not understand that they could not get benefits          for a month in which they made over $80 but less than $100, and many incurred          losses on that account. If in addition to an increase   in          the exempt amount to $1500 the monthly measure of retirement were increased          to $125, the increase in the cost of the program would be 0.11 percent          of payroll. If the exempt amount were increased to $1800 and the monthly          measure were set at $150, the increase in the cost of the program would          be 0.24 percent of payroll. Estimates of the cost effects of other possible          changes are given in the Appendix.         An increase in the unit of excess earnings-another way of reducing the          effect of the retirement test as a deterrent to work at certain levels          would be to increase the unit of excess earnings--the amount (now $80)          by which earnings in excess of $1200 are divided to determine the number          of benefits that must be withheld because of earnings. Since a month's          benefit is withheld for every $80 in excess earnings, anyone whose benefits          amount to less than $80 has some incentive to work and earn more than          $1200 now, since in general he loses less in benefits than the amount          of his excess earnings. Increasing the $80 unit would provide a positive          incentive to earn above $1200 for all those whose benefit amounts were          less than the amount of the new excess unit, and for all other beneficiaries          it would in general reduce the loss in total income because of earnings          in excess of $1200.         In order to eliminate reductions in income as a result of work for the          great majority of the beneficiaries, a substantial increase in the unit          of excess earnings would be necessary. An increase to $125 would mean          that a million retired worker beneficiary families--15 percent of all          such families--would still be losing more in benefits than the unit of          excess earnings that caused the loss. Actually an increase to $175 or          $200 would be necessary to approach a complete solution to the problem.          With an excess unit of $175 all but six-tenths of one percent of the retired          worker beneficiary families would have benefits lower than the excess          unit and hence would stand to lose less in benefits than the amount of          their excess earnings. At $200 the figure   would be four-tenths          of one percent.         Generally, the families that would still be at a disadvantage with a          $175 or $200 excess unit would be those consisting of a retired worker,          wife and child, or a retired worker with two or more children, getting          benefits at the higher amounts. Families of this composition are, of course,          rare.         An example may be helpful to show how the proposal would work. Take the          case of a beneficiary with a benefit of $100 a month and suppose he were          to earn $1760 in a year. Under present law, 7 months' benefits ($700)          would be withheld for his $560 of excess earrings, so that in comparison          with the situation in which he could earn exactly $1200, he would lose          $140 ($700 minus $560 of excess earnings) in total income for the year.          He therefore would not earn $1760 if he understood the law and had any          control over how much he could work and earn. Under a proposal to increase          the unit of excess earnings to, say, $175, this same beneficiary, because          of his $560 in excess earnings, would have 4 months' benefits ($400) withheld.          He would thus have gained $160 in total income from his earnings of $560          above $1200.         A peculiarity of this proposal may be brought out by changing the benefit          amount in the foregoing example. Suppose a man's benefit were $80 a month          instead of $100. The beneficiary would still have 4 months' benefits withheld,          but the amount withheld would be only $320 instead of $400. Thus the second          beneficiary would have gained $240 rather than $160 as a result of the          same amount of work.         The effect of this proposal on incentives to work is quite capricious;          the net addition to the beneficiary's income as a result of work is not          related at all to the amount earned by doing the work.         An increase in the excess unit, moreover, does not completely solve the          problem of benefit losses as a result of earnings, even for the beneficiary          whose family benefit amount is smaller than the excess unit. In any situation          where a beneficiary makes just over the exempt amount, or just over that          amount plus one or more excess units, and consequently loses a month's          benefit as a result of having excess earnings amounting to a fractional          part of the unit, he can lose in total income. Thus if a beneficiary made          the mistake of making 1201 in a year, no matter what the amount of the          excess unit, he would lose a whole month's benefit for the extra dollar          in earning:.         Still another example may be helpful at this point. Assume that the excess          unit were increased to $175. A beneficiary who has benefits amounting          to $100 a month has an opportunity to take a job at $1900 a year. If he          does, he will lose 4 months' benefits--one for each $175 in excess of          $1200. He expects, then, that his total income will be $1900 in earnings          and $800 in benefits, for a total of $2700. His employer is caught with          a rush job and asks him to do extra work. He does so, and is paid $25          extra for the work. For the $25 additional earnings he loses a whole month's          benefit of $100, so that he is actually $75 worse off as a result of doing          the extra work.         It is clear, then, that an increase in the unit of excess earnings could          not of itself solve the problem of benefit losses as a result of work          even if the unit were increased as high as $175 or $200. And an increase          in the excess unit would of course increase the long-range cost of the          program, the amount of the increase depending upon the size of the increase          in the unit. An increase in the unit to $175 would cost 0.15 percent;          to $200, 0.19 percent.         Since increasing the excess unit does not completely solve the problem,          since under it the amount of additional net income to the beneficiary          as a result of work has no relation to the amount he earned by doing the          work, and since it would involve significant increases in cost, the Department          does not recommend its adoption.         A          delayed retirement credit --Another proposal that has          been urged on the grounds that it will improve incentives for older workers          to get and keep jobs is one that would give a higher benefit amount at          retirement to the worker who delays retirement beyond age 65. A proposal          of this sort is actually independent of any change in the retirement test;          but it is often advanced as an alternative to changes in the test as a          way to encourage older people to continue working.         Actually it is doubtful that a delayed retirement credit of this sort--a          slight increase in the benefit upon eventual retirement--would be very          effective in increasing the number of people who work after 65. For those          who can continue in their regular jobs, their regular full-time earnings          are a much stronger incentive than a delayed retirement credit could provide.          For those who must retire from their regular jobs but might be induced          to take on less demanding work, a more effective incentive than a delayed          retirement credit would be a revision in the retirement test that would          make it possible for them to gain more in income from working than they          can under present law.         Aside from the question of incentives a case can be made for the idea          that a man who does not retire until some years after reaching age 65,          and therefore does not get benefits when he is first eligible and continues          to make contributions to the program, should get a higher benefit amount          than a man with the same average earnings who retired at 65. Many people          argue that the first man's additional contributions and the fact that          he will get fewer benefits than he would have drawn if he had retired          at age 65 should be recognized by a higher benefit when he does retire.         Many of the sponsors of proposals for a delayed retirement credit either          imply or state explicitly that the cost of such a proposal would be very          little or nothing because people would be encouraged to go on working          beyond age 65 in order to increase their benefits when they do retire          and would therefore claim their benefits at older ages than they do now.          Actually, a delayed retirement credit would increase program costs because          it would give extra benefits to the many people who now work past retirement          age. The number of people who would receive extra benefits is suggested          by the fact that more than two-thirds of the men coming on the rolls in          the last few years have been over 65. The average age at which men become          entitled to benefits is about 68.         A substantial increase in benefits for persons who continue to work after          age 65 would be costly. For example, a credit large enough to provide,          on the earnings record of a person who delays retirement, benefits actuarially          equivalent to the amounts that would have been paid to him and his dependents          if he had retired at age 65 would amount to an increase of 7.2 percent,          in all benefits payable to the family, for each year of delayed retirement,          and would raise the level-premium cost of the program by about one percent          of taxable earnings--the same as the cost of eliminating the retirement          test. Most of the proposals for delayed retirement credits that have received          serious consideration have been much more modest--1 or 2 percent a year--and          correspondingly less costly (by the same token, it is likely that they          would be correspondingly less effective in encouraging people to work          who otherwise would not work.) A credit of 1 percent would increase program          costs by 0.14 percent of taxable earnings; a credit of 2 percent, by 0.28          percent of taxable earnings.         The increased cost of a delayed retirement credit would be incurred,          of course, only for the benefit of those who are able to continue their          employment beyond age 65. The delayed retirement credit would not provide          any increase in benefits for those who are unable, because of health,          labor market conditions, or the retirement policies of employers, to continue          in employment beyond that age. There is nothing to suggest that the worker          who retires later than 65 needs higher benefits than the worker who had          to retire at 65.         Primarily because of the high cost of even a modest delayed retirement          credit, and the real doubt whether it would prove to be a significant          incentive to continuing work, the Department does not recommend that such          a credit be provided under the program.         A          reduction in the age at which benefits are paid without            regard to earnings --Still          another approach to the problem of incentives involved in the test would          be to reduce from 72 to 68 the age at which benefits are paid without          regard to earnings.         There would be increased incentive to work under the proposal both for          workers under 68 and for those 68 and over. For a worker under 68 there          would be an incentive to stay on in his job because when he reached age          68--only three years after the time when he could first get benefits--he          would have the advantage of getting all of his benefits on top of his          earnings. Under present law he cannot get both until age 72, and to most          people who would not otherwise continue to work it probably does not seem          worthwhile to hang onto a job and forego benefits for seven years in order          to have both benefits and earnings at the end of the 7-year period. For          a period as short as three years it is not unreasonable to expect that          many workers among those who have some control over the decision on whether          or not they will retire would stay in their jobs so as to be assured of          having both benefits and earnings from a regular job after that period.          For workers 68 and over there would obviously be the usual incentive to          work--full earnings--because their earnings could not reduce their benefit          income. And there are real advantages, in the form of lessened irritation          and increased public acceptance, in a provision under which many more          beneficiaries could feel free to earn what they could without keeping          records or worrying about whether they might earn too much.         The basic approach of the law to the problem of retirement, if this proposal          were enacted, could be described in these terms: Age 68 would be looked          upon as the normal age of retirement, and benefits would be payable at          that age regardless of earnings. (Actually, about half of all workers          claim their benefits before they reach age 68.) Because in fact many workers          retire before age 68, either because they are no longer able to work or          because they are retired by their employers, benefits would be payable          before age 68 to anyone who met a fairly strict test of retirement (the          present test). Prior to age 65 (62 for women) benefits would be payable          only if the person demonstrated that he could not work--that is, if he          met the requirements for disability insurance benefits.         There are advantages in moving in the direction of establishing in the          minds of people the idea that a higher age than 65 is the normal retirement          age. Such a change in attitude toward retirement age (which might in time          induce changes in the retirement policies and hiring policies of employers),          plus improvement in incentives to work might help to meet the criticism          that the Nation is wasting its human resources by policies that force          older workers out of jobs they are still capable of doing and anxious          to have.         On the other hand, there are disadvantages to the proposal, too. Many          people do continue after age 68 to work full time at their regular jobs--many          more than do so after age 72--and there is no reason related to the basic          objectives of old-age and survivors insurance why benefits should be paid          to them on top of their full-time earnings, no matter how high.         Enactment of the proposal, if no other changes were made in the retirement          test, would mean that all of the shortcomings of the present test described          earlier in the report would remain--though a much smaller number of people          would be affected--and, by the same token, dissatisfaction with those          shortcomings would remain, though it would probably be lessened since          each worker would be under the test for only three years.         The proposal would cost 0.35 percent of payroll, over one-third of the          cost of complete elimination of the test. The Department does not recommend          the proposal, in spite of its advantages, because it is expensive, because          it does not correct any of the anomalies and problems that arise in the          present test, and because the additional money that would be spent would          go to many who are working full time at high earnings.         A          proposal to withhold $1 in benefits for each $2 in excess of $1200 and          up to $2400, and withhold $1 in benefits for each $1 in earnings in excess          of $2400 --The Department has also considered a proposal          to eliminate the $80 unit of excess earnings and substitute for it a provision          for reducing the benefit amount payable by $1 for each $2 of earnings          in excess of the $1200 exempt amount. The Department believes that this          proposal is as good an approach as can be devised to the problem of how          to preserve incentives for older people to work at a moderate cost to          the social insurance system.         An example will help to make clear how the proposal would work. Take          the case of a man who, with his wife, is eligible for benefits amounting          to $150 a month. He has a chance to take a job paying $1500 a year. Under          present laws for the $300 in earnings over $1200 he would lose 4 benefits          or $600. Instead of gaining by doing extra works he would actually lose          twice as much in benefits as he gained in earnings. With a one-for-two-reduction          proposal for his $300 in excess earnings he would lose, of course, only          $150 in benefits.         Let us take another example, that of a man who is eligible for benefits          of $90 a month and has an opportunity to make $1600 in the year. Under          present law he would lose 5 monthly benefits--$450--for his $400 of earnings          in excess of $1200. Under the one-for-two reduction proposal he would          lose $200 and would therefore be $200 better off, rather than $50 worse          off.         Under this proposal there would no longer be any reason for beneficiaries          to seek out jobs at $1200 and to limit their work activity. The effect          of the provision would be to support rather than interfere with the desire          of older people to continue to work to the extent they are able to do          so. The proposed provision would furnish an incentive to work throughout          the entire range of benefits and would avoid the anomalies that arise          at the various breaking points in the present annual test.         Elimination of the $80 unit of excess earnings, moreover, would be a          significant simplification of the earnings test. The $80 excess unit is          a completely arbitrary element in the test included to avoid the sharp          borderline that would occur if there were not some graded reduction of          benefits to take account of earnings over the exempt amount. (It would          be unreasonable to withhold a year's benefits for a dollar of excess earnings          and the $80 provision was included in the law to prevent that result.)          Since the amount of $80 is arbitrary it is difficult for beneficiaries          to understand.         Although most beneficiaries would find the new test to their advantage          some would, at least theoretically, be somewhat worse off than under present          law. They would be those beneficiaries who get less than $40 in benefits          and yet earn in excess of $1200 in a year. Even for people at these low          benefit levels it is likely that the disadvantage would be largely theoretical,          since probably few people at these benefit levels work for earnings of          as much as $1200 in a year. And those who do would of course gain as a          result of their work, although they would not gain as much as they do          under present law. (Now, as a result of the $80 excess unit, a beneficiary          getting benefits of, say, $35 loses only that $35 for every $80 of excess          earnings, whereas under the proposal he would lose $40.)         The proposal for a $1 reduction in benefits for $2 of earnings, if applied          to all earnings, would result in the payment of some benefits to people          earning relatively high amounts. A man and wife getting the present maximum          benefits of $180, for example, would get $100 in benefits for the year          with earnings of $5320. To reduce costs somewhat by preventing these partial          payments to people who have relatively high earnings it could be provided          that earnings above $2400 a year would reduce benefits dollar for dollar.          Without this modification the change in the test would cost 0.19 percent          of payroll. With this modification, the change would cost 0.15 percent.[          l]         [1] Other types of reduction proposals were also considered by the          Department, including a straight dollar-for-dollar reduction and a proposal          to add on top of the present retirement test, with all of its complexities,          a provision to make a dollar-for-dollar adjustment at the end of the year          for beneficiaries who had more withheld in benefits than the amount of          their excess earnings over $1200. Neither of these proposals furnishes          a positive incentive to the beneficiary to work; and the second proposal          does not correct the situation where a beneficiary can lose by earning          just over a breaking point as compared with earning at the breaking point.          And the dollar-for-dollar reduction, with the elimination of the $80 unit          of excess earnings, would mean such a significant de-liberalization for          people with benefit amounts less than $80 that it would need to be accompanied          by an increase in the exempt amount in order to be acceptable, and would          therefore mean a rather heavy increase in cost.         A proposal that would increase costs to this degree would require at          this time that provision be made for additional financing, in view of          the current close balance of the fund. We have not in this report tried          to conclude on whether additional cost should be incurred for this purpose,          but rather have tried only to develop the best solution for the problems          involved in the retirement test. We believe the solution that we have          developed is the best.                  SUMMARY          OF FINDINGS         The findings and recommendations of the Department with respect to the          retirement test under the old-age and survivors insurance program can          be summarized as follows:         I. The retirement test in the old-age and survivors insurance program          is necessary in order to assure that the funds of the program will be          employed for socially useful purposes. Elimination of the retirement test          would substantially increase the cost of the program, and the additional          cost would be incurred chiefly as a result of paying full benefits to          people who are fully employed at relatively high earnings. The Department          therefore recommends that a test of retirement be retained in the program.         II. The Department recommends that the monthly measure of retirement          be retained in the test, since to remove it would prevent the program          from attaining its objective of making benefits available to people immediately          upon retirement and during other periods when they do not have income          from work.         III. The Department has developed but does not recommends a proposal          that would eliminate the payment of benefits in the sort of case the Committee          asked the Department to study--the case of a person who is retired throughout          most of the year but comes back into employment for a month or two and          has high earnings. Under present law, because of the monthly test, he          gets benefits for the months in which he did not work. The Department          believes that it is desirable to withhold benefits only for the months          in which the person works, as is done under present law.         IV. The Department has developed a proposal designed to improve incentives          for older people to work, to remove certain inequities that now arise          in the operation of the retirement test, and to make the test more understandable          and acceptable. That proposal is to eliminate the present provision requiring          that a whole month's benefit be withheld for every $80, or fraction of          $80, of earnings in excess of $1200, and to substitute for it a provision          for withholding $l in benefits for each $2 in earnings in excess of $1200          and up to $2400, and for withholding $1 in benefits for each $l in earnings          in excess of $2400. We are convinced that this is the best solution that          can be devised to the problems involved; but we have not concluded upon          whether it is desirable to provide for an increase in taxes in order to          make enactment of the proposal possible. The Department plans to continue          its evaluation of this question.

While this guide is written from the perspective of an employment and training agency (e.g., a Private Industry Council (PIC) operating under the Job Training Partnership Act), much of the material presented is likely to be of interest to the wide variety of public and private organizations providing services to homeless families and individuals.  Among the major objectives of this guide are the following:      to enhance agencies' knowledge of homeless individuals;    to provide guidance on the types of homeless persons that are most (and least) likely to benefit from employment and training services;    to identify the full range of services likely to be needed by homeless individuals to be successful in completing training and securing and retaining employment, and how these services can be provided directly by employment and training agencies or arranged through linkages with public or private service providers;    to identify the specific planning and implementation steps needed by employment and training agencies to establish an effective service delivery system for recruiting and serving homeless individuals; and     to provide examples of successful strategies used by employment and training agencies, and homeless-serving agencies, in assisting homeless individuals to (re)enter the workforce.     Much of the material presented in this  Best Practices Guide  is based on the experiences of 63 organizations from across the United States who provided comprehensive services for homeless individuals and families under the Job Training for the Homeless Demonstration Program (JTHDP). (1)   JTHDP, authorized under Section 731 of the Stewart B. McKinney Homeless Assistance Act of 1987, was intended to ""provide information and direction for the future of job training for homeless Americans."" (2)    Under this legislation, the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) was authorized to plan, implement, and test the effectiveness of a comprehensive range of employment, training, and other support services to assist homeless individuals to find and retain employment. (3)     During the 86 months JTHDP operated (from September 1988 through November 1995), over 45,000 homeless individuals were served by a variety of program grantees, including Job Training Partnership Act (JTPA) Service Delivery Areas (SDAs) and PICs, community-based organizations, education organizations, and homeless shelters.  Exhibit 1-1 provides a listing of the 63 JTHDP grantees and their locations.  Appendix A provides additional background information about JTHDP. (4)      The remaining sections of this chapter provide:  (1) a brief overview of the problem of homelessness in the United States, (2) a discussion of the services needed by homeless individuals to break the cycle of homelessness, and (3) an overview of the remaining chapters of this guide.   A. THE PROBLEM OF HOMELESSNESS IN THE UNITED STATES     Since the early 1980s, the problem of homelessness in the United States, particularly within urban communities, has been the subject of increasing public attention.  This attention has been generated in part by the increased number of visible homeless, and by important changes in the socioeconomic and demographic composition of the homeless population to include more families, working poor, and individuals suffering from problems of chronic mental illness and chemical dependency.

(5)   Based on direct counts in shelters and soup kitchens, this study estimated that between 500,000 and 600,000 individuals were homeless in the United States during a seven-day period in March, 1987. Using this point-in-time estimate as a basis, the Urban Institute estimated that more than one million persons in the United States were homeless at some time during 1987. (6)     A number of factors appear to be contributing to changes in the size and characteristics of the homeless population in the United States.   Economic restructuring, corporate downsizing, and rapid technological change  have led to job loss for some workers, the need to re-locate, and changing skill requirements.  The  rising housing costs, demolition of lower-cost single room occupancy (SRO) hotels, and gentrification within urban areas  have made it difficult for some individuals (especially the unemployed and underemployed) to locate affordable housing for themselves and their families.  Finally, there are a host of other factors that, according to experts, seem to have exacerbated the problem of homelessness, including  more restrictive eligibility requirements for welfare and disability benefits,   reductions in the purchasing power of public benefits,  the  deinstitutionalization and lack of mental health care services for mentally ill persons, and growing problems of substance abuse.    In response to apparent increases in the size and changes in the composition of the homeless population in the United States, Congress enacted the Stewart B. McKinney Homeless Assistance Act (Public Law 100-77) in 1987.  At the time of its enactment, this Act represented the nation's most comprehensive piece of legislation for the homeless population and included nearly 20 provisions to meet the needs of homeless persons.  It provided for emergency shelter, food, health care, mental health care, housing, education, job training, and other community services.  This Act, probably more than any other piece of federal legislation, recognized the need to pull together the resources of a variety of government agencies to provide comprehensive services for homeless individuals and families.     B. A COMPREHENSIVE MODEL FOR PROVIDING SERVICES NEEDED TO BREAK THE CYCLE OF HOMELESSNESS    Homeless individuals can face a broad array of problems -- ranging from substance abuse, to basic skills deficiencies, to lack of transportation and appropriate clothing -- that need to be addressed before they are likely to secure and retain employment.  For each homeless individual, these problems come in different combinations and intensities, which means that individual circumstances need to be carefully assessed and the range of services provided need to be targeted on the needs of each individual served.   The experiences of the 63 grantees involved in the Job Training for the Homeless Demonstration Program, as well as the results of other important studies on homelessness, suggest that the following core services -- provided either by a sponsoring agency or through linkages with other local human service providers -- need to be made available to assist homeless individuals in securing and retaining employment:     Case management and counseling;  Assessment and employability development planning;  Job training services, including remedial education, basic skills training, literacy instruction, job search assistance, job counseling, vocational and occupational skills training, and on-the-job training;  Job development and placement services;  Post-placement follow-up and support services (e.g., additional job placement services, training after placement, self-help support groups, mentoring);  Housing services (e.g., emergency housing assistance, assessment of housing needs, referrals to appropriate housing alternatives); and   Other support services (e.g. child care; transportation; chemical dependency assessment, counseling, and referral to outpatient or inpatient treatment as appropriate; mental health assessment, counseling, and referral to treatment; other health care services; clothing; and life skills training);  Based on the experiences of JTHDP sites, Exhibit 1-2 provides an overview of a model for providing a comprehensive range of services to effectively assist homeless individuals and families to secure and retain employment.        The need for comprehensive provision of services points to the need for strong linkages and coordination arrangements with other local service providers.  Therefore, careful planning of the service delivery strategy is needed, including identifying the agencies within the network of local human service agencies able to provide the needed range of services.  JTHDP grantees were able to greatly expand the availability of services for their participants and to leverage funding for providing additional services to participants through extensive use of coordination.  For example, as shown in Exhibit 1-3, one JTHDP site (Knoxville-Knox County Community Action Committee) relied upon over 50 service providers within its locality to ensure each homeless individual received the specific services he or she needed.  Among some of the underlying themes that are emphasized throughout this  Best Practices Guide  are the following:    Establish Linkages with Homeless-serving Agencies.   Employment and training agencies need to establish linkages with homeless-serving agencies, such as shelters and transitional housing facilities, to help with outreach, recruitment, and screening of homeless individuals.  Homeless individuals need to be carefully pre-screened and assessed prior to acceptance in an employment and training program.  Homeless-serving agencies are well-positioned to help in this pre-screening process.   Stabilize Homeless Individuals Prior to Enrollment.   Homeless individuals need to be stable  prior  to enrollment in employment and training programs.  This generally means living in, at a minimum, transitional housing or an emergency shelter that allows the individual to have an extended stay.  This also means addressing problems such as a lack of financial resources, domestic violence, and other problems that can impact successful participation in employment and training activities, as well as screening out serious substance abusers and those who are mentally ill and unlikely to benefit from participation in your program.  Once again, homeless-serving agencies or other agencies referring individuals can be helpful.   Provide Thorough Assessment and Ongoing Case Management.   Participant assessment and case management are critical to tailoring services to meet the needs of each individual.  Barriers to employment are not always evident at the time of intake; as a result, both assessment and case management should be ongoing activities.    Arrange for Short-term Job Search Assistance.    Homeless individuals are often primarily interested in obtaining employment and improving their housing situation in the shortest time possible.  Hence, employment and training programs need to provide, either through in-house capabilities or linkages, job search assistance for those who are primarily interested in obtaining employment in the shortest time possible.      Provide Basic Skills and Work Readiness Skills Training.   Some homeless individuals need basic and/or work readiness skills training prior to entry into training and employment.  This training can be conducted in conjunction with other training or job search assistance.    Provide Follow-up and Support.   The problems that led to homelessness do not suddenly disappear upon entering a training program, finding a job, or securing permanent housing.  Ongoing assessment, case management, and follow-up   support are important ingredients for assisting homeless individuals in retaining employment.   Provide Staff Training on Serving Homeless Persons.   Employment and training agencies may need to provide training for their staff and service providers on the needs of and misperceptions about homeless people, the variety of referral agencies locally available to meet those needs, and the best practices for serving homeless participants.         EXHIBIT 1-2:  COMPREHENSIVE MODEL FOR PROVIDING EMPLOYMENT AND TRAINING SERVICES TO HOMELESS INDIVIDUALS              EXHIBIT 1-3: ONE JTHDP GRANTEE'S LINKAGES  WITH SERVICE PROVIDERS         Service     Providers     Housing -    Emergency      1.

Each chapter is organized around a discussion of a specific service or group of services that should be part of a comprehensive employment and training service delivery system for homeless individuals.  Each chapter begins with a discussion of the challenges that employment and training agencies may face in providing a particular service to homeless individuals.  The discussion then shifts to an assessment of effective strategies for providing each service.  Throughout each chapter, examples of effective strategies are illustrated with experiences drawn from JTHDP grantees.     Chapter 2 (Initial Services)  addresses the services employment and training agencies are likely to need to provide (or arrange for) in order to effectively recruit and assess homeless individuals.  These services include marketing job training services to homeless people, determining which homeless people can benefit from the services provided by each employment and training agency, developing case plans based on assessment, and using case management as the focal point for connecting participants with the range of services they need.    Chapter 3 (Education and Training Services)  discusses effective strategies for providing education and training services for homeless individuals to assist them in securing and retaining employment.  The services discussed include:  basic skills (i.e., remedial education, literacy training, and English-as-a-Second-Language training) and occupational skills training (including on-the-job training and work experience).    Chapter 4 (Placement and Post-placement Services)  examines various strategies for assisting homeless individuals to find and retain jobs over the long term.  This includes discussion of job search assistance, job development, placement, and post-placement services (such as regular contact with the participant and employer and re-placement services).    Chapter 5 (Housing and Support Services)  examines the critically important range of housing assistance and support services which may be needed by homeless individuals.  This chapter identifies the most commonly needed services for homeless people (beyond employment- related services) to be able to secure and retain employment, and illustrates some of the community linkages which have helped JTHDP grantees access those services.       CHAPTER 2    INITIAL SERVICES: RECRUITMENT, INTAKE, ASSESSMENT, AND CASE MANAGEMENT                          This chapter presents effective strategies for structuring and providing a range of services -- outreach, intake, assessment, and case management -- needed to recruit and prepare homeless individuals for participation in employment and training activities.  As discussed, some of these services will need to be provided directly by your agency, while others you will want to arrange for through linkages with other organizations -- particularly, homeless-serving agencies.   A. RECRUITMENT     1. Background and Challenges    Recruitment includes the ways agencies publicize the availability of their services and encourage individuals within the eligible population to participate.  There are a variety of methods typically used by agencies to make potentially eligible individuals within their service area aware of the range of employment, training, housing and other support services available through their programs.  Among the recruitment strategies employed by JTHDP sites were the following:     making regular presentations to administrators/staff at local human service agencies, to ensure that those agencies refer appropriate individuals;   distributing posters and brochures with information about the program to human service providers, libraries, schools, and other educational institutions;   promoting public service announcements on television and radio;   writing newspaper stories and advertisements; and   using word-of-mouth.      In the areas of outreach and participant recruitment, it is important for employment and training programs to concentrate their relatively limited staff time and administrative resources on methods that yield a pool of program applicants who: (1) are eligible for participation, (2) are motivated to participate in employment and training activities, (3) have a high probability of completing training and upgrading their basic and work-related skills, and (4) once trained, have a high probability of securing and retaining a job.  JTHDP experience demonstrated that it was possible to interest large segments of the homeless population in employment and training programs if outreach strategies were carefully designed.  JTHDP also demonstrated that if homeless individuals were carefully screened through the recruitment (and assessment) process, many could complete training and/or secure employment. (7)   When designing strategies for recruiting homeless individuals for employment and training programs, JTHDP experience suggests that it is important to consider the following points about homeless individuals:       Homeless individuals are by no means a homogenous group; careful assessment is needed to identify those who are likely to benefit from employment and training services.   Generally, with the exception of not having a fixed residence, homeless individuals are probably similar to other disadvantaged adults and youth your program is already serving.  Exhibit 2-1 provides an overview of some of the characteristics of homeless individuals served by JTHDP sites and several of the distinctive subpopulations of the homeless population served.  Exhibit 2-2 provides a comparison of selected characteristics of JTHDP participants with JTPA Title II-A participants. (8)   Despite similarities with other disadvantaged populations you may be serving, homeless individuals may face a larger number of barriers to employment than those typically served by your program.  For example, there are segments of the homeless population with serious mental illness or active substance abuse problems who are not likely to be appropriate for employment and training activities.     Homeless individuals can be a fairly transient group and may lack familiarity with the local service delivery system.   Some homeless individuals may have migrated from other localities and be unfamiliar with employment, training, housing, and support service programs available in your area.  Other homeless individuals may move from an emergency shelter to the street to the homes of friends or relatives, and so forth, making them a moving target for outreach efforts.      Some homeless individuals may have little interest in receiving job training.   The dire economic circumstances faced by most homeless individuals are likely to mean that they are (at least upon entry into the employment and training program) primarily interested in obtaining a job as rapidly as possible.  Many homeless individuals are likely to lack interest in pursuing job training, at least until it is determined they cannot obtain a job with their existing base of skills and work experience.  It is important to remember that many homeless individuals will have developed work-related skills and relevant experience over the years and may not need further training. (9)   It is also important to remember that some homeless (like other disadvantaged individuals) may have failed in the past in education or training settings and, therefore, are not anxious to return to a setting in which they have been unsuccessful.

JTHDP figures are based on participant-level data maintained by sites for Phases 2 through 4.  Sample size for JTHDP participants is 28,617.       2. Strategies     The recruitment strategies used for homeless individuals are likely to be quite similar to those your agency used to recruit other disadvantaged individuals, though homeless individuals are likely to require additional outreach efforts through homeless-serving agencies.  Two key lessons learned by JTHDP grantees relating to recruitment of homeless individuals for employment and training programs were the following:       do not recruit homeless individuals directly off the street; and     utilize homeless-serving and other agencies to assist with recruitment of homeless individuals.       Homeless-serving agencies have a track-record of working with this target population and, if well-instructed, can provide a reservoir of appropriate and well-screened homeless participants for your program.  Several strategies designed to help employment and training agencies identify and recruit appropriate homeless individuals are presented below.      a.  Outreach Strategy #1:  Identify the Types of Homeless Individuals You Can and Cannot Effectively Serve    Through past experiences, your agency has learned that not all individuals are appropriate for or likely to benefit from participation in employment and training activities.  It is essential to direct outreach efforts toward those homeless individuals who are highly motivated and have a strong likelihood of successfully utilizing the services you offer to obtain and retain employment (and eventually achieve long-term self sufficiency).  Some important considerations include the following:    Housing Status.   Individuals living on the street or tenuously in shelters are unlikely to be able to make a long-term commitment to training.  Outreach should be targeted on those homeless individuals who are in housing situations that allow for an extended stay (e.g., transitional facilities that allow for six months or a year stays, emergency shelters with open-ended stays).   Involvement with Drugs and Alcohol.   JTHDP grantees found that an active substance abuse problem was a barrier to completing training and obtaining employment, but that clients in recovery were often highly-motivated and successful program participants.    Means of Financial Support.   Those individuals without a means of financial support are generally less able to participate in long-term training.  Some JTHDP sites placed participants in part-time jobs and training concurrently, or found other means of financial support.   Preference for Training Versus a Job.   Because of their homeless situation and lack of financial support, many homeless individuals have a strong preference for working over training.  It is important during outreach to make clear what your program offers so that homeless individuals understand the nature of their commitment to the program.         b.  Outreach Strategy #2:  Identify Agencies That Can Help With Outreach and Recruitment    Depending on the types of homeless individuals your agency is able to serve, you will need to identify and establish linkages with other agencies in the community that are able to screen and refer homeless individuals to you.  In addition to the screening and referring function, homeless-serving agencies can help your participants secure appropriate housing and support services.  Below are some of the types of homeless-serving agencies with which you will want to consider developing linkages:     Shelters and transitional housing programs  should be your first stop.  These programs are likely to be able to provide a steady stream of homeless persons who are temporarily housed.  If you work closely with them, they can effectively screen and refer those individuals who are ready and can most benefit from job training.  They are also likely to be able to extend periods of stay at their facilities to assist those entering training or other employment services.  These agencies may also provide assessment and ongoing case management services that can be helpful in tailoring services to meet client needs and monitoring client progress toward self-sufficiency.   Community action agencies  offer a broad range of services to the homeless and non-homeless alike.  They may be able to provide on-going support and information and referral for an extensive array of needed services.   Public assistance agencies  may know when their clients are at risk of homelessness and can refer them to your program at the point when they are nearing or have recently become homeless, an easier point at which to serve them than after they have been homeless for several months.   Halfway houses  for individuals in recovery or for ex-offenders returning to the community provide support services that can help people maintain sobriety and stability while they are in a job training program and after job placement. They often provide transitional housing and on-going case management.   Soup kitchens  typically attract the most transient homeless persons, but they also serve increasing numbers of homeless families and individuals who may be motivated to work.  Many also provide a range of services beyond serving food.  These multi-service agencies, if provided with criteria for screening homeless individuals, can provide a steady source of appropriate referrals for an employment and training program.   Domestic violence programs  provide direct outreach services to battered and abused individuals, many of whom are in need of job training and employment services to become economically independent.  These programs typically provide temporary housing, case management, and a wide range of specialized support services.          The Tucson Indian Center (TIC) conducted an extensive outreach effort with several phases.  First, TIC mailed brochures to social service agencies in the area.  Second, it followed-up with phone calls to verify that the information was received and to set up face-to-face meetings.  Third, TIC staff held meetings with social service agencies in Tucson that worked with the homeless or American Indians.  TIC contacted agencies including: shelters, Indian tribes, substance abuse programs, city agencies, and churches.         c.  Outreach Strategy #3:  Develop Cooperative Agreements with Appropriate Referring Agencies      After identifying agencies that serve and could refer homeless persons potentially eligible for your services, meet with the directors and front-line staff of these agencies.  At this meeting:    Market the value of your agency's services.   An important point to emphasize is that job training and employment services hold the key to long-term and higher wage employment -- key ingredients in making self-sufficiency a reality.    Explain the specific elements of your agency's services (e.g., intensity of case management, available support services, and duration and types of training).   Be clear about the scope and limits of what your agency provides and about the requirements and expectations for participation in your program.   Obtain background information about these agencies, including the types of individuals served, how these individuals flow through the program, types of services provided, and the extent and duration of participation.      If the homeless-serving agency can serve as an effective referral source, negotiate a cooperative agreement.  This document should be specific in terms of the roles and responsibilities of both the partners, the anticipated number and types of homeless individuals to be referred, and the criteria used to screen individuals for referral.  Emphasize the importance of  quality and appropriate referrals  over quantity of referrals.  As part of the agreement, specify the types of on-going services both partners will provide for individuals referred to your program, including the types of assessments administered and case management responsibilities.      d.  Outreach Strategy #4: Be Sure Referring Agencies Conduct Thorough Initial Screenings to Determine Appropriateness of Clients for Your Program    Prior to referral to an employment and training program, the homeless-serving or other referring agencies should assess the individual's appropriateness for employment and training services.  JTHDP sites found that some of the problems that led to homelessness -- such as, mental illness, substance abuse problems, serious basic skills deficiencies, and inability to work cooperatively with others in the workplace -- were often not revealed (or apparent) at the time of intake.  However, over time, through observation and building of trust between the referring agency's case manager and client, a better understanding of the unique circumstances of each individual and potential problems that may stand in the way of successful job training and placement are likely to emerge.  The careful pre-screening of potential participants by the referring agency using criteria provided by the employment and training agency -- while not  ensuring success -- can greatly increase the odds that referred individuals will successfully complete training and enter employment.        Knoxville-Knox County Community Action Committee operated the Homeward Bound program for homeless individuals in the Knoxville area.  This program, co-located with the JTPA agency, screened homeless individuals for eventual participation in JTPA (and provided a range of other employment, support, and housing services).  In working closely with staff at the JTPA agency over a five-year period, Homeward Bound staff came to realize that about 20 to 25 percent of the homeless individuals they served were interested in and appropriate for referral to JTPA for training.  Homeward Bound case managers assessed and worked with homeless individuals typically a month or longer before determining whether they were suitable for referral to JTPA.  The Homeward Bound staff met regularly with JTPA staff to discuss referrals and make collaborative decisions on which Homeward Bound participants would be referred to JTPA for training.          e.  Outreach Strategy #5:  Provide Feedback to the Referring Agency on Appropriate and Inappropriate Referrals    It is very important to maintain an ongoing dialogue with the staff at the agencies making referrals to your program.  This is particularly important when the agency is just beginning to refer homeless individuals to your program.  Remember these two main points:         Start slowly with the referring agency.   The agency should send over only a few potential participants at first so that each agency can get a feel for the types of individuals appropriate for referral.      Share with the referring agency the specific reasons that each referred individual is suitable or unsuitable for your program.   Feedback is also needed as participants  proceed through your program so that the referring agency understands the types of individuals that seem to be most successful in completing training and finding/retaining a job.         Similar to referrals from other sources, there will be both successes and failures when working with homeless individuals.  The key over time is to refine (through discussions) the screening procedures used by the referring agency so an increasing proportion of those referred complete training, and successfully enter and retain employment.    B. INTAKE     1. Background and Challenges    The intake process serves two very important functions -- (1) documentation is obtained to determine applicant eligibility for program services and (2) information is obtained to preliminarily assess the suitability of the applicant for program services.  While homeless individuals are probably not all that different from many of the disadvantaged individuals your program is already serving, it is important to keep in mind some of the special circumstances that may arise with respect to intake of homeless individuals into your program:    The existence and validity of documentation needed during the intake/eligibility determination process can sometimes be a problem for homeless individuals.   For example, homeless individuals may have lost identification, such as their driver's license and other needed documents during their period of homelessness.  It can also be difficult for some homeless individuals to provide documented proof of their homelessness (especially if they are not staying in a homeless shelter or transitional facility).    Homeless individuals may be guarded (or suspicious) about sharing information and documentation with program staff.    Some homeless individuals have been shuttled from agency to agency, been ""accessed"" over and over, and perhaps had bad or humiliating experiences with human service agencies in the past.  For example, they may have been asked to leave emergency or transitional housing facilities because of active substance abuse issues; they may have been thrown out of employment and training programs in the past because of bad attendance or poor behavior.  As a result of these past experiences and fears that they may not be considered for program services, homeless participants may be guarded about their past and unwilling to share information during the intake process.  For example, until they develop a trusting relationship, homeless individuals may be very reluctant to share information about past job loss, basic skills deficiencies, alcohol or drug use, arrests, abusive family relationships, or mental and physical health problems.    Homeless individuals may find it very difficult to make long-term commitments to basic skills or job-related training .  Even those homeless individuals who express a strong preference for job training may find it very difficult to pursue training over the long-term without some form of financial assistance (e.g., a Pell grant or public assistance).  Because of their lack of resources, homeless participants may need more flexible training options (e.g., a combination of part-time work and part-time training, on-the-job training, or compressed training options).      2. Strategies    The intake process is important because it: (1) clarifies for the applicant the types of program services available through your program and the responsibilities of participants under the program and (2) provides an opportunity for the program to make an initial determination of whether the individual is appropriate for program services.  Below, several strategies relating to an effective intake process are offered based on JTHDP experiences.      a.  Intake Strategy #1: Request Background Information and Documentation From the Referring Agency      A key during the intake process is to learn as much as possible about the individuals who are to be served.  Collection of detailed information about each applicant makes it possible to determine those individuals who are appropriate or inappropriate for program services. This information can also be helpful in beginning to tailor employment, training, and other program services to meet the specific needs of each participant.  To the extent possible, your agency should gather background information on each homeless individual directly from the case manager at the referring agency.  Some important issues to discuss with the referring agency (and with the applicant during the intake process) include the following:       reasons the individual became homeless;    evidence of a history of substance abuse or mental illness;    behavioral problems such as displaying repeated disruptive behavior;    basic skills deficiencies;    other potential barriers to employment, e.g., lack of financial support, health issues; and     needs for support services -- especially housing, transportation, and child care.     As discussed above, determining eligibility can sometimes be delayed or complicated for homeless individuals because of difficulties in acquiring necessary documentation.  The referring agency may be able to provide this documentation, or other agencies in your area may be able to assist homeless individuals in gathering needed documentation.       Elgin Community College (ECC) in Illinois developed a linkage with Centro de Informacion, a local community-based organization serving the Hispanic population.  ECC served a large Hispanic population and found the need to link with an agency that was more familiar with some of the distinctive needs of that population.  In addition to providing ESL classes and advocacy, Centro de Informacion assisted ECC participants in securing documentation, such as birth certificates.  This service was an invaluable resource that enabled ECC to enroll its JTHDP clients in JTPA training.           b.  Intake Strategy #2:  Use the Intake Process to Clarify Program Objectives, Services, and Expectations    Intake and the suitability determination process represent an opportunity not only to gather information about potential participants, but also to explain program objectives, services, and expectations.  As with any program participant, clearly explain the specific types of services provided through your program, including their duration and timing.  Make sure to delineate the time involved in training (both the number of hours per week and the number of weeks/months an individual may be involved in training) and the responsibilities of training participants if they undertake long-term training.  Also, make sure to indicate limits on the cost of tuition and the types of institutions that may be attended.  You will want to assess, with input from the referring agency, the degree to which applicants are committed and motivated to participate in job training and eventual employment, and that their expectations for employment are realistic.  You may want to conduct skills and interest assessments during the intake process to help guide your discussions with the applicant.       At Project WORTH, a JTHDP project sponsored by the Jefferson County Public Schools in Louisville, Kentucky, intake was a multi-step process beginning with a group orientation that provided a program overview.  The overview helped applicants determine whether the program goals and structure were compatible with their personal goals.  Those who were interested were then interviewed privately.  If they met the eligibility criteria, they took a basic reading skills test.  Only if their reading level met the program's minimum standard was an appointment made to begin the official intake process.             c.  Intake Strategy #3:  Assess the Types of Resources Available to Maintain Participation During Involvement in Employment and Training Activities     Because of their lack of resources and possible limitations on stays at emergency or transitional facilities, homeless individuals may be reluctant to commit to long-term training or may need to attend such programs part-time (while working).  It is important to accurately assess their situation prior to enrollment in employment and training activities.   Some applicants will come to the program with public assistance they can rely on during their period of training -- perhaps AFDC, food stamps, Supplemental Security Income (SSI), general assistance (GA) or emergency assistance (EA).  Some may be eligible for cash assistance or food stamps but are unaware of their eligibility and need to be referred to the appropriate agency.  Others may come to the program with part-time or even full-time (but low-wage) employment.  Still others (especially single, homeless males) may have exhausted their benefits (e.g., unemployment compensation or general assistance) and may not be eligible to receive any public assistance beyond food stamps.    One of the distinctive characteristics of homeless applicants, as compared to other applicants to your program, is their lack of stable housing.  It is important to understand their current housing situation, and to verify that situation with the referring agency.  An emergency shelter may be willing to guarantee a bed or a transitional housing facility may be flexible with the curfew, as long as the individual is participating in your program.  Hence, during the intake process, some important questions to ask are:        What is your housing situation, and how long can you remain in that housing?     What resources do you have available to sustain yourself during a prolonged period of training?     Are you willing to work full- or part-time while in training?      How will you take care of dependent children while in training?    What type of transportation do you have available so you can attend training?           d.  Intake Strategy #4:  Have a Well-coordinated Plan for Referring Ineligible or Inappropriate Applicants to Other Needed Services    Even if homeless individuals are well-screened by the referring agency, it is likely some of those referred will find that your program is not for them (e.g., they would rather get a job first and then consider training) or you may find that the individual is not yet ready or appropriate for training.  Hence, it is important for your program to have a well-coordinated plan for referring those who are inappropriate to other services.  JTHDP experience suggests that in working with homeless individuals strong linkages will be needed with the following types of organizations:      the Employment Service and other programs providing job search services;      public assistance agencies (e.g., departments of social services, community action organizations);     housing programs, both public and private;    in-patient and out-patient substance abuse programs and support groups (such as Alcoholics and Narcotics Anonymous);    programs for veterans (e.g., Veterans Administration hospitals and support centers);    vocational rehabilitation programs; and    mental health and other health care providers, including dentists and opticians.      In working with homeless individuals -- many of whom have been referred back and forth between agencies in the past -- the way in which referrals are made can make an critical difference in whether the individual follows up on the referral.  In addition to a resource directory of available service providers, your agency should have an established contact at other agencies and formal procedures for making referrals.  These procedures should include some type of feedback to the referring agency about the results of the referral.  By having an established relationship with service providers, you can better understand the other agencies' eligibility requirements and increase the likelihood that individuals you refer for services at other agencies are eligible and receive the services.  (See Chapter 5 for more information on linkages with agencies providing housing and other support services.)       The Seattle/King County Private Industry Council, a JTHDP grantee, used its intake process as the beginning of a comprehensive assessment that determined which applicants were appropriate for job training services and identified the range of services applicants needed to increase their chances of achieving self-sufficiency.  Once screened, participants were enrolled in employment and training activities or referred to services at other agencies, if necessary. For example, if there was evidence of chemical dependency, the individual was referred to a drug/alcohol recovery center for treatment prior to enrolling in training.  The PIC had cooperative agreements with a number of substance abuse programs, which enabled applicants to be served quickly and increased their chances of returning to the PIC for employment and training services.           C. ASSESSMENT AND CASE MANAGEMENT         1. Background and Challenges    Assessment and case management are closely related activities.  The client assessment process identifies client aptitudes, skills, obstacles to employment (and self-sufficiency), and needed services.  This process results in the development of a case plan identifying client objectives and specific steps and services required to meet each specific objective.  Case management involves the assignment of an agency staff member (i.e., case manager) to each participant to regularly monitor participant progress toward achieving case plan objectives and to make adjustments in the plan, as needed.  The case manager also serves as a resource to participants for troubleshooting problems and access to other services needed to achieve case plan objectives.  Assessment and case management are essential for tailoring services to the specific needs and employment barriers faced by each participant.  Organizations referring homeless individuals to employment and training programs will likely have assessed the individual prior to referral.  Your agency should work closely with these referring organizations to understand the assessments that have already been conducted, and, if possible, to obtain the results of relevant assessments.  The use of assessments conducted by other agencies will reduce the burden of additional assessment for participants and also save resources.         Seattle's homeless project used a comprehensive assessment process.  Assessment covered six areas:  basic skills, work skills, pre-employment/work maturity skills, life skills, housing needs, and support services.  The case manager and/or the assessment specialist were responsible for conducting the assessment and preparing an Individual Training and Housing Plan together with the participant, which they adjusted based on ongoing assessment and case management throughout the client's participation in the program.           Challenges you might encounter in assessing and case managing homeless participants include:    There is a fine line between over- and under-assessment.   A thorough assessment is necessary to determine participant goals and to tailor services to the specific needs of participants.  A lengthy and unnecessary assessment, however, may discourage participation and take away from time that individuals (and staff) could be devoting to employment and training activities.    With multiple agencies involved, there can be overlap and confusion in the area of case management .  Homeless persons, particularly those living in a structured housing setting or participating in substance abuse treatment programs, may already be working with case managers from other agencies.  Your agency will want to coordinate efforts with these case managers to avoid duplication of services and confusion for both staff and participants.  For example, where multiple case managers are involved, one case manager could be suggesting one solution to a problem, while another is suggesting a different solution.  It is preferable, when multiple agencies are involved with one client, to identify a single lead case manager who takes responsibility for the client.   Homeless individuals may be guarded about providing needed information .  As discussed earlier, until you are able to develop rapport with homeless individuals, it is possible that they will be reluctant to share information about themselves that may be important in developing a case plan.  For example, they may be reluctant to discuss the problems that led to their homelessness, such as basic skill deficiencies, substance abuse problems, incarceration, or an abusive family situation.          The Home Builders Institute's HEART program addressed case management overlap by establishing a formal agreement with a local case management organization.  The agreement spelled out linkages between the HEART program, the case management organization, the JTPA provider, and shelters.  Case management for HEART participants was based on the case plan which was developed jointly by the case manager, the HEART training coordinator, and a JTPA representative.            2. Strategies           a.  Assessment and Case Management Strategy #1: When Possible, Use Other Agencies to Help with Assessment and Case Management    As we discussed in the section on intake, if a homeless client has been referred from another agency, it is important to obtain as much input and information from that agency as possible.  In the case of homeless individuals referred by other agencies, there is a strong likelihood they have already had some form of assessment.  In addition to receiving help in the assessment process, your agency may be able to secure case management services (or some part of the case management function) through linkages with other organizations.  For example, many participants referred from homeless-serving agencies will have case managers (e.g., individuals living in transitional housing facilities).     If you rely upon case managers (outside of your organization) for information and tracking client progress, meet regularly with these case managers to coordinate case activities.    Any staff working with the participant -- whether they are in your job training agency or in a partner agency -- should be familiar with the goals and objectives of the participant's case plan.       Project WORTH in Louisville, Kentucky developed a client programming flow chart that identified which specific staff at each agency were responsible for every step of the case plan.  Job development, for example, was identified as a shared responsibility between the case manager, the Project WORTH job developer, and the client's vocational teacher.  The case manager shared responsibility for housing follow-up with Project WORTH's housing liaison and job developer, along with the Section 8 coordinator for the county housing agency.            b.  Assessment and Case Management Strategy #2:  Help Establish Realistic Training and Job Expectations for Participants    Not unlike other disadvantaged individuals coming to employment and training programs, some homeless individuals may arrive with ""pie in the sky"" expectations about the types of jobs for which they might be able to train.  For example, an individual may come to the program with substantial basic skills deficiencies expressing a desire to become a registered nurse (which requires graduation from a college nursing program).  While attempting not to diminish motivational levels of the individual, it is important during the assessment process and case management meetings to convey to the participant:       what your program can and cannot do (e.g., there are constraints on how long the individual can be assisted and the types of institutions that can be attended);    the basic skills and educational prerequisites for entering training (and eventually for the preferred occupations);     limits on the tuition charges for training; and     the likely time involved and financial commitment on the part of the participant.     JTHDP sites reported that when properly and thoroughly discussed -- together with supporting objective test results from educational and occupational interest tests -- most individuals came around to realistic views of the types of training they should undertake.      c.  Assessment and Case Management Strategy #3:  Assess Housing and Support Service Needs and Document Referrals in the Case Plan    JTHDP grantees found that homeless participants were substantially more likely to complete training programs and enter employment if, during the assessment process, housing and support service needs were carefully identified and subsequently addressed.  Housing assistance and support services must be carefully tailored to both the needs and preferences of the individual.  For example, while transitional housing located far from a bus stop might not be a problem for a person with a car, it would present problems for homeless individuals dependent on public transportation to get to a training site or to work.  As with any plan for service delivery, housing assistance and support services should have clear goals and resources that will be used to reach the goals.  The goals and resources should be clear to both the case manager and the participant.   If the individual is referred from other agencies with an expertise in the area of providing housing assistance (e.g., a homeless-serving agency such as an emergency shelter), it is possible that the homeless-serving or other referring agencies will have already conducted a thorough assessment and established a plan for improving an individual's housing situation.  Ask these referral agencies to share their information about the participant and steps the individual should be taking to improve his or her housing situation.  If a housing assessment has not been completed or is not available from the referring agency, some important questions to ask are:       How long has the individual been homeless?    Where does the individual reside (e.g., on the street, in emergency shelters, with friends or family, or in supported or transitional housing)?    What are the individual's preferences for short-term and long-term living arrangements (e.g., rent, location, sharing of an apartment or living alone, willingness to live in emergency shelters or transitional facilities)?    What potential resources are available (including friends and relatives) and what are the barriers to securing and upgrading housing?    Does the applicant have special needs or requirements (e.g., a physical or mental disability, a history of substance abuse, or a history of serious mental illness)?      Any referrals your agency does make for housing or other support services should always be documented in the case plan.  Tracking each referral and its outcome helps to assure that homeless participants (and other participants) receive the services they need and enables administrative staff to renegotiate referral agreements when documentation shows that they are not working smoothly.        d.  Assessment and Case Management Strategy #4:  Continue Assessment and Case Management Throughout a Participant's Involvement in Your Program    Because of reluctance on the part of participants to discuss some sensitive issues at the time of intake  and  because circumstances can change over time (e.g., need for transportation or housing assistance), questions relating to the individual's circumstances and service needs should be asked periodically and the case plan updated accordingly.  The frequency of meetings between clients and case managers varied across JTHDP sites, but generally were more frequent (e.g., once a week) during the early weeks of a client's participation and at points of crisis or transition.  These meetings were typically in-person and focused on monitoring the progress participants were making toward achieving their case plan goals.  In some JTHDP sites, case managers met regularly as a group with a supervisor to share progress and seek group advice on individual clients.    Finally, it is important to keep case manager/client ratios low enough so that the case managers have time to get to know and maintain regular contact with each client and have the flexibility to devote additional time to clients should unforeseen problems arise.  JTHDP sites tried to keep case management caseloads typically under 25 participants per case manager (at any point in time).        CHAPTER 3   THE ROAD TO SELF-SUPPORTING EMPLOYMENT: EDUCATION AND TRAINING SERVICES     This chapter describes education and training services needed by homeless individuals to secure and retain employment.  These services --  basic skills , including remedial education, literacy training, and English-as-a-Second-Language instruction, and  occupational skills training , including classroom training, on-the-job training, and work experience -- do not vary from the services needed by most employment and training program participants, but the need for flexibility in service delivery may be greater for homeless participants.  What follows is a discussion of the special challenges in providing education and training services to homeless individuals and effective strategies for overcoming those challenges.  Many of the strategies identified as effective in delivering basic skills training are relevant to the delivery of effective occupational skills training (and vice versa).   A. BASIC SKILLS TRAINING     1. Background and Challenges    Employment and training programs are likely to find that basic education deficiencies need to be addressed for as many as a quarter of homeless individuals referred for occupational training.  For example, about one-fourth (23 percent) of JTHDP participants received remedial or basic skills training, and 22 percent were school dropouts. (10)   In some instances, the referring agency may be able to provide or arrange for basic skills training before the participant is served by your agency; but in other cases, it will be necessary to arrange such services before the participant can enroll or concurrent with enrollment in occupational training.  While the basic skills deficiencies and the ways they are addressed are similar for homeless individuals and other disadvantaged individuals, there are some potential barriers to providing basic skills training for homeless individuals, including the following:    Urgency to obtain employment.   Although participant assessment may indicate a need for educational remediation, the participant's circumstances may rule out this type of instruction unless some arrangement is made for income and housing support while the individual is involved in basic skills instruction.   Past failures in educational settings.   Some individuals may have failed in previous efforts to address basic skills deficiencies (e.g., dropped out of high school or failed to complete a literacy program).  As a result, they may enter programs with low self-esteem and lack confidence in their ability to succeed within an educational setting.   Resistance to structure and requirements.   As with many adults, the structure and requirements of classroom training may be something homeless individuals thought they had left behind long ago.  For homeless individuals, this feeling may be heightened because of the lack of structure during their period of homelessness. (11)        2. Strategies     a.  Basic Skills Strategy #1:  Develop a Step-by-Step Plan for Upgrading Basic Skills in Line with Job Training and Employment Objectives    Tests of basic skills conducted during the assessment process (and perhaps by the referring agency) should provide your case manager with a detailed picture of the participant's basic skills deficiencies.  Test results and their implications for future training and employment should be discussed with each participant.  During these discussions, it will be important to gather information from the participant needed to plan the type and duration of basic skills training.  Among the issues to be discussed are:    Has the individual received basic skills training in the past?  If so, when, from whom, for what deficiencies, and was the training completed?  If the training was not completed, why was this the case?  It is important at this point to determine whether the individual has some probability of completing basic skills training, and past performance is an indication of this.   What length of time is the participant willing to commit to basic skills training, and what goals would the individual like to achieve?  Is the proposed length and type of basic skills training sufficient for the individual to qualify for and succeed in subsequent occupational training?   When can the individual attend training?  Does the individual plan to work while attending training?  Is the individual constrained in the hours he or she can attend training because of child care?  Does the residence where the individual is temporarily staying place any restriction on activities or the hours in which the individual can participate in outside activities?   Does the individual face transportation constraints, which may limit where the individual can attend training?      Based on these discussions, a realistic plan for addressing basic skills deficiencies should be developed.  The plan should be tailored to the individual, clearly setting forth the objectives of the remediation effort, the time frame and intensity of the training, and the steps the individual is expected to undertake to reach his or her goals.       One participant enrolled in the Hennepin County JTHDP program worked a full-time job and attended basic skills classes in the evening.  He welcomed the grueling schedule for three reasons:  it provided him with enough income to get by while pursuing skills training that would lead to a better job, he didn't have the time to associate with other residents where he was living who would likely have been a negative influence, and it kept him too busy to even consider revisiting his own history of substance abuse.          b.  Basic Skills Strategy #2:  Provide for a Wide Variety of Settings, Methods, and Timing in Arranging for Basic Skills Training         Whether your program provides basic skills training in-house or through referral, there should be considerable flexibility in the delivery of this basic skills training to your homeless participants.  In selecting basic skills providers, consider the following:    Access open entry/exit programs.   Because a person does not necessarily become homeless at the beginning of a semester and a homeless person needs to move quickly toward employment, it is important to be able to access basic skills training rapidly (i.e., without having to wait for a new class to form in the fall or spring semester).   Provide for flexible training hours.   Because homeless participants may have time-specific obligations at their housing facility, or need to work while enrolled in training, basic skills training should be available during the day and in the evening.   Incorporate individually-paced instruction.   Because individuals, homeless or otherwise, do not learn at the same rate, basic skills training needs to be individually-paced.   Tailor methods to the individual.   Some individuals work best using pen and paper; others progress more quickly using a computer.  Assure through your coordination arrangements and/or through in-house capabilities that participants will be able to utilize the methods best suited to their learning style.  Generally, a blend of computer and teacher-assisted instruction seems to work best.          At Elgin Community College (ECC), all participants who did not graduate from high school or who graduated but felt deficient in basic skills were referred to the ECC Adult Basic Education Center.  An immediate assessment (the Test of Adult Basic Education) was administered, and since the program was open entry/open exit, the participant could begin classes the next day.  Both morning and evening classes were available, instruction was individually-paced using computers or work books, and child care was provided.  This service was available to all in the community.            When establishing coordination agreements with providers for basic skills training, keep in mind that community colleges and vocational schools sometimes precede their occupational skills training with several weeks of remediation.  Other facilities will provide tutoring and self-help laboratories for students to address specific basic skills deficiencies while they are in occupational skills training.       c.  Basic Skills Strategy #3:  Regularly Monitor How the Individual Is Progressing        It is important for case managers to regularly monitor participants' progress toward achieving basic skills goals.  First, they may be less likely to have had successful experiences in similar types of programs in the past, and without support may not complete the training.  As a result, they may require additional support.  Second, the lack of structure in some homeless individuals' lives may make the transition to classroom training more difficult.  Regular attention from a case manager and flexibility in the delivery of basic skills may make the difference in whether a participant completes or fails to complete basic skills instruction.  Third, those homeless participants who have not used their basic skills regularly, may need only a ""refresher"" course in basic skills.  Staying attuned to the individual may enable the participant to move more quickly through basic skills training.       At the Greater Washington Boys and Girls Club, all participants received, at a minimum, monthly progress reports from the Education Specialist.  These reports were discussed with the participants and their case managers.  The reports described participants' progress in meeting their basic skills goals and in GED preparation.  The Specialist also provided direction and guidance to the vocational instructors and provided input for curriculum and training development.            d.  Basic Skills Strategy #4:  Assure That Basic Skills Training Is Contextual     There are many training programs that teach basic skills in a ""real world"" context (e.g., learning multiplication through calculating sales tax as opposed to rote memorization of the multiplication tables).  This type of learning has proven to be effective with students of all ages.  It is particularly important for adults, who need to relearn basic skills which are frequently geared to younger students.         The Homeless Initiatives Pilot Project (HIPP) of the Seattle-King County PIC found that homeless persons with low basic skills were unable to get hired or retain jobs that provided livable wages. Basic skills deficiencies also deprived homeless persons of opportunities to enter vocational training.  As a result, all participants scoring below the employable range on the basic skills competency tests were required to take basic skills as part of their program.  Basic skills training was offered concurrently with other training or work development activities.  HIPP found that basic skills were acquired more rapidly and with greater retention if the learning was contextual and closely tied to real work or life tasks.            e.  Basic Skills Strategy #5:  Include Life Skills Training as Part of Any Occupational or Basic Skills Training Program for Homeless Individuals      Individuals fall into homelessness, in part, because they have difficulty managing their lives.  No matter how successful you may be in providing them with education and training, they are likely to become homeless again unless they improve their ability to handle the responsibilities of day-to-day living.  Life skills training can incorporate a broad range of topics and is often integrated into job search/pre-employment training, occupational skills training, or basic skills training.  Life skills training can be provided directly by your agency, through referral, or by agencies with which your participants are already linked. Some of the topics typically covered in life skills courses include:       communication skills,    anger management,    self-esteem development,    motivation skills,    personal budgeting,     goal setting, and    consumer awareness.     There are several topics that are of particular benefit to homeless participants:    Self-esteem training  can counter the psychological effects of homelessness.  This can be particularly important for individuals who have escaped from an abusive relationship or who have been battered or otherwise abused since they became homeless.         Some of the abused women interviewed during site visits identified self-esteem as their most critical employability issue.  The Kentucky Domestic Violence Association (KDVA) used resume writing to foster self-esteem; by identifying and highlighting skills, the agency found that participants enhanced their self-esteem.  KDVA allowed two full days for resume-writing during its pre-employment skills workshop to gain the full self-esteem benefit that can result from resume preparation.       Building  participant motivation  through small group training and support groups, and reinforcing motivation through the case management relationship can help identify and recognize even small successes and keep participants progressing toward their goals.        Project Decisions in Saint Paul successfully added three half-days of motivational training for some participants to lower the dropout rates that peaked after assessment.  Other participants entered motivational training later, after they began job search when discouragement can set in.  Offered by a charismatic and skilled Goodwill Industries consultant, the motivational training focused on planning and goal-setting in four areas: personal, job, family, and community.  One Project Decisions staff member described the motivational training as ""validating your inner vision of what you think you can be.""    Project WORTH staff made a great effort to acknowledge and regularly reward even small accomplishments, such as a participant who had good attendance in training or raised his/her reading level.  Awards included gift certificates for restaurant dinners and for shopping at area department stores.       Many of the circumstances that contribute to homelessness relate to  money management .  Some homeless people lived beyond their means for too long; others did not understand which debts could be negotiated and which were inflexible.  Money management training can help participants to better manage their finances in the future.  It can also help participants make appropriate training choices by increasing their understanding of the implications for long-term self-sufficiency of taking an immediate job opening paying minimum wage versus enrolling in training that will lead to a higher-paying job.      Housing management  instructs individuals about the rights and responsibilities of renters and landlords.  For example, homeless individuals who have been living in a shelter or transitional housing for a prolonged period may need to be reintroduced to the concept of living on their own.  They may not understand the relationship between delinquent rent payments or destruction of property and eviction.  Additionally, don't assume that people you advise to ""find a roommate"" necessarily know how to find an appropriate roommate or are able to live in an accommodating way with a roommate.         Greater Washington Boys and Girls Clubs' Project Uplift hired a housing coordinator to teach home management skills classes once a week for 10 weeks.  Each week was devoted to a different topic, and students were allowed to begin the 10-week cycle at any time.  The District of Columbia's Rental Accommodations Board compiled the information for the home management skills curriculum; topics included budgeting, money management, finding housing, Section 8 and other subsidized housing, security deposits, leases, landlord/tenant responsibilities, dealing with the telephone company, maintaining a lease, rent control, and eviction.  To be eligible for Project Uplift's housing assistance services, participants had to have attended at least five classes.          B. OCCUPATIONAL SKILLS TRAINING    1. Background and Challenges    The goal of occupational skills training is to upgrade participants' skills so they can secure employment with wages enabling them to be self-sufficient.   Some of the distinctive challenges that employment and training agencies may face in providing occupational training for homeless individuals include the following:     Homeless individuals may have few resources to sustain themselves while in training.   While in training, the homeless individual needs to cope with the basic needs for shelter, food, and daily living expenses.  Transportation to and from training may be a problem.  They may also experience difficulties in arranging and paying for child care.  Because of the circumstances that led to their homelessness, some homeless individuals do not have existing relationships with family and friends to assist them in meeting these basic needs.   Homeless individuals may have a strong preference for employment over training. (12)   Because of their lack of resources and permanent housing, many homeless individuals are likely to have a preference for securing work in the shortest time possible.  Alternatively, they may seek short-term training or training opportunities that allow them to work concurrently.       Some homeless individuals may only need training to upgrade their skills.    The skills homeless individuals may have developed in previous training programs or on the job may be out-of-date or simply ""rusty.""  For example, homeless individuals who have been incarcerated may have many years of job-related experience, but dropped out of the labor market for several years.  Training programs focusing on refreshing skills may be able to move the homeless individuals quickly toward employment and, at the same time, save scarce training dollars.      2. Strategies   a.  Occupational Training Strategy #1: Tailor Occupational Training to the Interests and Needs of the Individual, as Well as the Local Demands of the Labor Market    The assessment process is intended to match the participant with the appropriate training option(s).  To meet the diverse needs of your homeless participants:      assist those participants seeking part-time employment to do so in conjunction with their skills training;   have available open-entry training programs;  offer training courses in the evening as well as during the day;  offer ""compressed"" training options, i.e., courses offered for more hours over a shorter period of time;  arrange for on-the-job training opportunities, which provide an opportunity to combine training and wages, a necessity for many homeless individuals;  make sure training is provided in an occupation in which there is local demand for workers; and  when possible, offer work experience which provides an opportunity for the most needy to gain valuable ""world of work"" experience.       The training programs offered to the JTHDP homeless participants of the Massachusetts Career Development Institute (MCDI) were determined as a result of an analysis of the demands of the local labor market and were certified to be in compliance with the local PIC's guidelines for occupational skills training programs.  All areas of study combined classroom and laboratory experiences to ensure comprehensive coverage of program content.  All programs stressed positive attendance and punctuality, adherence to safety standards, and positive attitudes.  All program clusters had active private sector advisory boards which met quarterly to review curricula, staff, equipment, and methodology.  Most programs were open entry/open exit with either full- or part-time schedules to allow flexibility and facilitate participation and retention.  These characteristics of occupational skills training, in large measure, accounted for MCDI's placement rate of 71 percent and average wage at placement of $7.27 for their participants.       It is important to keep the participant involved throughout the process of selecting the area for occupational skills training.  Pushing a participant into an occupational training area they are not interested in or qualified for does a disservice to both the participant and your agency.  After making the investment in training, the participant may not seek employment in the area, or retain the job after he or she obtains employment.  Work toward matching participant interest with real job possibilities.        Project WORTH offered several job training services with the goal of helping participants gain self-sufficiency.  The placement strategy emphasized interest, aptitude, and skills.  For some participants, there was a focus on short-term training that provided marketable skills within a three- to six-month period.  After researching the needs of the Louisville business community, Project WORTH found that the following training courses would allow participants to obtain employment on a timely basis, earning an adequate wage with benefits: basic computer skills, clerical, certified nursing assistant, licensed practical nurse, child care worker, emergency medical technician, and basic construction.         b.  Occupational Training Strategy #2:  Develop Coordination Agreements With a Wide Variety of Education and Training Providers      To accommodate the interests and needs of a participant, you will need to develop coordination agreements with a broad range of training providers.  In developing your linkages, look at the occupational areas in which your participants are likely to seek training, as well as the setting in which the training is delivered.  Offer as many and as flexible methods for pursuing education and training as you possibly can (e.g., literacy programs providing both group classroom instruction and self-paced computer training).        Elgin Community College (ECC), in coordination with their local PIC (and the vendors with whom the PIC contracted), was able to make available to participants a wide array of occupational training opportunities.  Participants, in conjunction with their case manager, could select between part-time and full-time, day or evening, and text book/computer-assisted training that lasted from two to 16 weeks.  The training areas included: certified nursing assistant, food sanitation, truck driving, paralegal, computer science, auto mechanics, plastics, data processing, keyboarding, accounting, maintenance, machine tool, and others.  These courses were offered at a number of locations, many with easy access to transportation.  ECC could also assist with child care and other needed support services.       Agreements between the employment and training agency and the service provider should clearly delineate all responsibilities. This is particularly true for OJTs and work experience (WEX) placements.  Some of the areas to be delineated include:     prerequisite skills for individuals to participate;  training responsibilities;  oversight responsibilities;  days, hours, and total duration of training; and  responsibility for funding (OJTs and WEX). (13)          In developing their WEX program, the Private Industry Council of Snohomish County increasingly delineated the responsibilities of all those involved -- participants, the PIC, and the WEX site.  For example, PIC staff were responsible for developing and monitoring according to program policies for host agency agreements, developing job descriptions and training objectives, performance review, time card/record keeping, payroll, and site monitoring.  In general, the PIC monitored WEX sites every two weeks to maintain regular contact with the participant, obtain a written supervisory evaluation, and to assess when the participant was ready for the next activity.      c.  Occupational Training Strategy #3:  Keep Homeless Participants Moving Toward Self-Sufficiency    Homeless individuals are anxious to proceed along the path toward self-sufficiency.  Find ways to get participants into a learning situation immediately.  ""Down time"" can be dangerous for a homeless person.  Once participants have been assessed and have developed a case plan, most JTHDP sites found they had a greater chance of success if they began some type of training or education at once.  Plus, getting them used to a schedule early helps acclimate them to the demands of working.  Open entry/exit training programs are ideal for homeless participants.  This structure allows homeless individuals to access training when they are ready so there is no down time.  Some JTHDP sites extended assessment while others offered job readiness or life skills classes until occupational training began.  As discussed earlier, homeless individuals oftentimes need to move toward their goals quickly and experience the sense of success that develops with pursuing one's goals.    d.  Occupational Training Strategy #4:  Offer Case Management During and After Training Activities to Trouble Shoot and Provide Support      The trust relationship developed between a participant and his/her case manager may enable the homeless individual to discuss difficulties he or she is having before the difficulties become obstacles to success.  A case manager may be able to identify potential problems before they interfere with a participant's progress in training.  For example, a case manager who becomes aware of a participant's car problem may be able to secure a voucher for repairs before it interferes with his or her ability to report to work on time.  Case managers can also help to resolve work-related conflicts before they escalate to the point where the participant loses his or her job.  For example, if the case manager is aware of an interpersonal problem the participant is having at work, he or she can role play the situation with the participant, enabling the individual to practice how to best resolve the situation.    e.  Occupational Training Strategy #5:  Make Sure the Homeless Participant Has All Necessary Supports in Place Prior to and Throughout Training    Homeless participants are likely to need a variety of support services prior to and during the training period.  Many of these services can be arranged for and provided by homeless-serving and other agencies in your community.  Through the assessment process, these services and the appropriate provider should be identified.  For example, support services may include provision of transportation vouchers or work clothes, or arrangements with an emergency shelter to save a bed until 8:00 p.m. (when your participant finishes training).   Do not assume that just because an individual is referred to another agency for services, he or she has successfully obtained the requested service.  There are many points at which the referral can breakdown both before the service is received and even after the participant begins receiving the service.   It is important to check on the success of the initial referral (both with the participant and the referral agency) and to regularly monitor that the participant continues to receive the service.   f.  Occupational Training Strategy #6:  Develop OJT Placements as an Option for Your Homeless Participants       On-the-Job Training (OJT) provides the opportunity for a participant to learn job-related skills, while at the same time receive wages. (14)   This strategy is particularly effective for homeless individuals in need of immediate income, but who may not have the job-related skills needed to obtain a permanent and well-paying job.  OJT has the added benefit of generally leading to permanent employment and providing trainees with the opportunity to learn through a more ""hands-on"" approach than may be typical within a classroom setting.  OJT can also be advantageous for employers.  In addition to receiving a partial subsidy to offset the added costs of providing skills training, the employer is able to test the trainee over a prolonged period within the work setting to determine if the individual is productive and works cooperatively with others.   A number of JTHDP sites found that OJT was both feasible and highly advantageous for their homeless adult participants. The flexibility of training under OJTs, as well as the ability of such arrangements to provide both skills upgrading and immediate wages, made OJT a particularly attractive alternative.       The Private Industry Council of Snohomish County viewed OJT as an essential part of their overall program strategy to assist participants in finding employment. During a 45-day period, participants worked with program staff to identify and develop an employer training site.  Development activities for this included both participant and staff cold calls to employers and contacts to the PIC's existing network of business partners and other employers.  This process was structured and required the participant to be in attendance, supervised, and assisted in his or her training site search.  OJT sites were developed in high demand occupations or areas that met the needs, interests, and abilities of the participant.           g.  Occupational Training Strategy #7: Use Work Experience for Individuals with Serious Barriers to Employment    JTHDP sites found that work experience was a particularly effective strategy for homeless individuals lacking workplace experience (e.g., displaced homemakers) and for those facing formidable barriers to employment (e.g., chronic mental illness, a long history of substance abuse, or individuals with serious basic skills deficiencies).  Work experience placements enabled JTHDP sites to place those who otherwise would have been uncompetitive within the labor market and to provide skills training that eventually served as a bridge to permanent, unsubsidized employment.   JTHDP sites indicated that it took considerable time and effort to work with employers to initially develop WEX slots.  However, once a position was developed -- and the initial individuals placed with the employer worked out successfully -- the employer was often willing to open up other slots.  A key was to be responsive to the employer and to provide assurances that each worker would be carefully screened for the position and receive support and regular oversight to ensure that the requirements of the employer were met.        Fountain House (FH) in New York City, serving homeless mentally ill individuals, was able to secure numerous work experience opportunities.  In structuring its work experience program, FH staff guaranteed that a specific number of workers would be at the job site each day, even if that meant that FH staff would perform the job.  The agency trained each new worker at the employer site on the specific tasks that they were to perform.  The worker was then observed by a case manager to make sure that they performed the tasks in a timely and effective manner.  The case manager also frequently checked with the employer to make certain that the individual was working out.  If there were problems, the JTHDP site worked with the individual and/or provided another placement for the employer.       JTHDP sites also found that WEX participants needed to have a clear understanding of their specific responsibilities at the work site, as well as the nature of work experience.  For example, it was important that participants understood that WEX placements were not intended to be permanent placements.  Participants also needed to understand that the purpose of WEX placements was to gain work experience and it was possible that this experience might not be in the vocational area of choice for the participant.      CHAPTER 4   GETTING AND KEEPING A JOB: PLACEMENT AND POST-PLACEMENT SERVICES     The ultimate goal of most employment and training programs is for participants to secure and retain positions consistent with their training which provide wages that enable them to be self-sufficient.  This goal applies to homeless participants as well.  This chapter identifies those aspects of job search assistance, job development, placement, and post-placement services that require special consideration in assisting homeless people to secure lasting employment.   A. JOB SEARCH, DEVELOPMENT, AND PLACEMENT SERVICES    1. Background and Challenges    To be successful, job search, development, and placement activities (henceforth referred to as placement assistance or services) must focus on both the participant and conditions within the labor market.  From the participant's perspective, these activities involve providing encouragement, direction, and coaching to mobilize the active involvement of the participant in securing a job.  In terms of the labor market, placement assistance involves understanding the availability of job opportunities appropriate to each participant, as well as developing and maintaining relationships with employers.     Some of the challenges in assisting homeless individuals with placement activities include the following:    Some homeless persons are difficult candidates to present to employers.   Because homelessness and its causative factors can be so disruptive to maintenance of a ""normal life,"" some homeless people have what one JTHDP staffer described as ""strange work histories.""  Their resumes may have large gaps, they may have few or no references, and their physical appearance may pose a serious barrier to securing employment.  For example, a homeless individual may not have received dental care for many years, resulting in loss of teeth and decay.  Another barrier to employment some homeless individuals face is a criminal history, which limits the types of jobs for which they can be considered.    Some homeless participants may be constrained by the hours they are available for work.   Some homeless participants involved in residential programs (e.g., halfway houses for ex-offenders or substance abusers) may have requirements, such as a curfew or chores, that limit the hours available for employment.  Other participants may continue in training while they are working, thereby limiting which hours they can devote to either training or work.    Many homeless participants will express an urgency in securing employment.   Having received minimal income while in training, homeless participants are typically ready to enter the work force and bring home a pay check once training is completed.  Without appropriate job opportunities (e.g., those for which the participant was trained) readily available, the homeless participant is likely to pursue  any  available employment.    Transportation can be a serious barrier to employment.   Many homeless individuals do not own a car and may not have sufficient resources to ride public transportation.  In addition, public transportation may limit employment options (e.g., buses may not serve some areas where there are high paying jobs).    Homeless participants may not have an address or phone number at which employers can contact them.   JTHDP sites took creative steps to solve this problem, using strategies ranging from changing the way agency staff answered the phone to obtaining voice mail or post office boxes for their participants.      The Seattle program pioneered a voice mail option for its homeless participants through voice mailboxes donated by a business supporter.  The program had designated voice mailboxes for participants to use in their job and housing searches.  This resource enhanced the effectiveness of participants' job and housing searches by improving their ability to receive messages from potential employers and landlords.  Several other JTHDP sites adopted this approach.     Finally, there is the issue of the quality of the placement.  There were two schools of thought among the JTHDP sites.  Some sites felt that any job was better than no job: participants needed to develop work habits, build a resume, and earn enough income to begin to stabilize their lives; higher-quality jobs (with health insurance, advancement potential, and in-service training opportunities) could come later.  Other sites emphasized extended pre-employment services to attain job placements with health insurance and career paths, rather than placing participants in jobs that offered little more than they were able to receive through welfare and food stamps.      2. Strategies    JTHDP experience suggests that most homeless individuals participating in an employment and training program can find a job in a relatively short period.  In some sites, for example, the placement rates were more than 60 percent of those served.  What homeless individuals need, in particular, is to be shown effective techniques for finding job openings and be provided with other types of assistance (e.g., transportation vouchers, work clothing) that help in securing the job.  Some homeless individuals -- those facing more serious barriers to employment -- may need more specialized job development and placement assistance.       a.  Job Placement Strategy #1:  Gather Labor Market Information    There are a number of sources available that can provide information on what jobs are available, including minimum educational and competency requirements, hours, location, wages, and benefits.  These sources are the same sources used for your other participants, including the Employment Service, city/county/state government listings, job fairs, job hot lines, and private employment agencies which compile job openings in specific industries.  Of course, the newspaper and Yellow Pages still provide a laundry list of opportunities and possible employers to contact for job openings.  Your efforts should focus on those opportunities most appropriate for your participants.         The Seattle program (HIPP) developed a broad array of employment opportunities for their homeless participants which resulted in a 54 percent placement rate.  These resources included: (1) the Job Net System (the ES's computerized statewide job bank), (2) job requests from employers (HIPP received hundreds of requests from local employers because of their reputation as a reliable referral source), (3) YWCA Master Employer Contact List (from their relationship with the YWCA, HIPP participants had access to this list which covered a wide variety of employers), (4) Employer Panels (four times a year, a panel of six to seven employers were asked to talk with HIPP participants about ""What Employers Really Want,""  (5) YWCA Employer Advisory Group (the group consisted of employers, community volunteers and service providers who met regularly to assist in developing employment opportunities), and (6) the Return to Work Strategy (the PIC, in partnership with the Seattle Conservation Corps, received an award from HUD to fund a job development position and support services for homeless participants entering unsubsidized employment).      b.  Job Placement Strategy #2:  Identify How Your Homeless Participants Fit Into Your Existing Job Placement Strategy     Because of the special challenges your homeless participants present, your job development strategy may differ for your homeless participants.  One of the decisions your agency will need to make is whether your job placement approach for homeless participants is participant-directed or directed by the job developer.  It is likely that you will want to use a combination of the two approaches, depending upon the barriers to employment and the tightness of the job market faced by the participant.  JTHDP grantees adopted a variety of different approaches to placement activities.  Overall, JTHDP grantees found that many of their homeless participants, if provided with support and training in effective job search techniques, could search and find jobs for themselves.       Jobs for Homeless People (JHP), in Washington, D.C., implemented two processes to assist participants in securing employment.  The first was ""JHP job development"" in which JHP staff developed working relationships with particular employers and referred participants with appropriate skills and interests to fill job openings as they occurred.  JHP case managers targeted key industries which matched up well with the employment characteristics of JHP participants.  The second placement process was ""participant job development"" in which the participant directed his or her own job search with JHP training and technical back up.  Resources were put at the participants' disposal (voice mail, telephone, resume writing software, job listings, yellow pages, industry catalogues, etc.), and they used those resources -- with the help of case managers -- to discover and develop job opportunities.        c.  Job Placement Strategy #3:  Use a Variety of Strategies to Involve Participants in Their Own Search for a Job    Some important lessons JTHDP sites learned about ensuring participants' effective job search included the following:      Provide a job search workshop.   Probably the most important strategy is to provide participants with knowledge about how to effectively search for a job on their own.  The workshop should include the basics of uncovering and following-up on job leads, developing a resume, interview techniques, and dealing with the stresses inherent in job search.  The length of such workshops varied among JTHDP sites, with most lasting between three and 10 days.   Make sure that the job search workshop includes role playing and initial contacts with employers to help individuals get over the fear of making ""cold calls"" and to practice their techniques for approaching employers.  Some materials presented as part of one such workshop are included as Appendix B.           Friends of the Homeless (FOH) in Columbus, Ohio, developed a two-week orientation program for participants who chose direct job placement services.  The program included orientation, literacy assessment, and classroom training on self-esteem, decision-making, and conflict resolution in the first week.  In the second week, classes in job readiness (e.g., resume-writing, how to contact employers) and life skills were taught.  Following the classes, participants began self-directed job search with the aid of FOH's job developer.        Emphasize the ""hidden"" job market.   JTHDP sites found that, especially in working with individuals who faced serious barriers to employment, it was essential to tap into the ""hidden job market.""  This means looking beyond jobs advertised in newspapers and listed with private and public employment agencies.  For example, one JTHDP site recorded a 90 percent placement rate by having each participant contact firms (A through Z listed in the Yellow Pages) that employed workers in the specific field in which the individual was interested (e.g., plumbing).   Emphasize the need to contact those who have the authority to hire.   In searching for a job within the ""hidden"" job market, it is important for individuals to make direct contact with those within the firm who know about job openings and have the authority to hire.  This is typically not an individual within the firm's personnel department, but rather a manager within an operating department/division of the firm.   Provide a structure for those involved in self-directed job search.  Searching for a job should be considered by participants as a full-time job.  JTHDP sites found that it was important to provide a structure for those involved in self-directed job search.  Many JTHDP sites used job clubs which met regularly as an opportunity for participants to share job leads, practice their interviewing skills, and focus their job placement efforts.          The Jackson Employment Center (in Tucson, AZ) which focussed on self-directed job search for their program participants, required that individuals attend a one-week job search seminar.  After completing the seminar, participants joined a job search club that required them to search for a job Monday through Friday from 8:30 to 4:30.  As a group, individuals came to a phone bank each morning and called employers (using the Yellow Pages) until they obtained three quality leads.  They would then use the remaining time in the day to follow up on each of the leads.          Monitor participants' progress in their job search activities.   The employment and training agency should monitor the individual's job search progress on a daily basis to make sure the individual uses the most effective approaches.  For example, for those who are ineffective in turning up job leads, it may be useful to monitor calls made to employers to see if the individual is contacting individuals with the authority to hire and effectively presenting their experience and skills.  In monitoring, the agency needs to provide emotional support and encouragement for participants because job search can be a frustrating process (involving frequent rejections).      d.  Job Placement Strategy #4:  Establish and Maintain Relationships with Employers    The key to successful job development is to establish relationships with a broad range of employers.  These relationships are particularly important when working with homeless participants because of their often spotty work histories and other barriers to employment.  One key question in working with homeless participants is whether job developers should appeal to employers' sense of corporate social responsibility by marketing their participants as ""recently homeless"" or whether they should conceal their participants' homeless status.     JTHDP programs differed in their handling of this issue.  Those JTHDP sites who disclosed the homeless status of their participants found they needed to educate employers about the myths and realities of the homeless and build strong relationships with employers.  Peer-to-peer marketing was particularly effective:  an employer who had successfully hired and retained homeless job seekers was the best spokesperson to sell the program to other employers.  Other sites had better luck keeping employers from knowing about their applicants' homelessness.  Some JTHDP sites made the decision on an employer-by-employer basis.  Each employment and training agency will need to gauge the level of community support for homeless issues and then adjust their policy choice based on their own local program experience.   The first step job developers will need to take is to develop a listing of those employers likely to need employees with the types of skills your participants typically acquire.  These employers should represent the broad range of occupations your participants hope to enter, as well as cover the geographic area from which your participants are drawn.  Particular emphasis should be placed on developing relationships with employers who are close to public transportation.  In addition, relationships are needed with a range of employers providing part-time and full-time opportunities, as well as shift work, and temporary and permanent opportunities.  Don't forget the homeless-serving agencies you have developed contacts with -- their board members and staff are likely to be familiar with employers willing to employ homeless individuals.     Finally, one of the best sources for job leads for your homeless and other participants are the organizations providing the training.  They often initiate the job development process weeks prior to the end of training, enabling the participant to move directly from training into employment.  Often these instructors have come from the private sector and maintained contacts with a range of employers.  Employers are more likely to hire those who have been trained and recommended by an instructor with whom they are familiar.   As an employment and training agency, you have several advantages you can use to promote your participants to employers:         There is no cost for your job placement services (unlike some employment agencies).    Your agency screens all individuals  prior  to referral to the employer.    Job applicants have been trained and have access to the support services necessary for them to retain employment.  If you offer follow-up support services, let the employer know of these services as well.      You have individuals who are ready to be placed  immediately .    If someone is placed and does not work out, you have other qualified trainees who you can refer.     To maintain relationships with employers, it is important to understand the requirements of employers for each specific position.  Your agency should only send candidates who meet the employment criteria and have addressed the issues that could interfere with a successful employment experience. You will also need to periodically contact employers to see how the placement is working out.  This will enable you to maintain the employer as a referral source (because they know you stand behind your placements) and also gives you the opportunity to inquire about new job openings.   e.  Job Placement Strategy #5: Job Developers Need to Work Closely With Case Managers    Job developers need to work closely with the case manager.  In addition, if possible, the job developer may want to contact other individuals who would be able to provide useful background information about the participant (e.g., staff at the participant's shelter facility or a case manager at the agency that referred the individual).  The job developer needs to understand not only the individual's training and job-related skills, but other issues related to the individual's motivation levels and behavioral issues.  For example, there may be behavior problems or personal issues (such as past substance abuse problems or inability to get along with others) that the participant may not readily share with the job developer, but which the individual was willing to share with the case manager once they had established rapport.  Simple up-front communication with the professionals who know the participant the best can go a long way toward assuring successful placement and retention.       f.  Job Placement Strategy #6: Begin Job Development Before Training Is Completed      Beginning job development and placement activities in the weeks leading up to the end of training can help ensure that participants have a job waiting for them when they complete training.  The job developer should meet with the participant at least several weeks before training is completed to discuss job search strategies.  Homeless individuals, in particular, are likely to want to find a job as quickly as possible after training is completed.  If a job is not waiting for them, they may settle for a position that does not use the job-related skills they developed or provide a wage that is adequate to promote long-term self-sufficiency.  Furthermore, the less time that elapses between the end of training and the start of employment, the less likely they will be to fall back into the problems that may have contributed to their homelessness.       The Jobs for Homeless Consortium (JFHC) in Berkeley, California, developed an automated Skills Bank that enabled them to match appropriate participant resumes to job vacancies stored in their automated Job Openings Bank (e.g., job opening information received from local employment service agencies, employers whom JFHC developed contacts, public job posting services, newspaper listings, and cold calls to employers).  The appropriate resumes could be quickly faxed or mailed to employers.  Automating and integrating these functions led to rapid response to job openings.  JFHC or the participant would make follow-up calls to employers.  JFHC would also conduct additional mass mailings and cold calls to employers in the area to inform them of JFHC's free services and to request job vacancy mailings.      g.  Job Placement Strategy #7:  Be Sure That All Necessary Support Services Are in Place to Assist Your Homeless Participants to Secure Employment      Be sure the participant is ready to begin and continue working; any barriers to regular work attendance should be taken care of prior to placement.  Some of the necessary support services include transportation vouchers, work clothes and equipment, and child care.  In addition, participants may need assistance improving their personal appearance and hygiene.  Without money for basic needs like shelter and food, many homeless people have disregarded personal appearance, such as teeth, eye glasses, and clothing.  No matter how well trained, without an appropriate personal appearance, your participant will be unlikely to secure a job.  Remember, there are many sources in your community that are able to provide these services at no or reduced cost to your agency.     Specific subpopulations, including ex-offenders, the chronically mentally ill, and women fleeing domestic violence, may need additional assistance in securing and retaining employment.  For example, in working with participants with a criminal history, your job development strategy should include knowing which of your participants have such a history and identifying employers who are more sympathetic, or at least less concerned with a criminal history.  Agencies in your community (perhaps the agencies referring homeless persons to your program) are experienced in working with issues surrounding these subpopulations -- use their expertise to develop targeted strategies.     B. POST-PLACEMENT SERVICES     1. Background and Challenges    Particularly for homeless people, initial job placement may only be a step toward eventual self-sufficiency.  The purpose of post-placement services is to ensure a smooth transition from training to employment and to provide needed supports to assure job retention.  Post-placement follow-up can be conducted with the participant, the employer, or both.  They can consist of telephone contact or in-person contact in your office, at the place of employment, or at the participant's residence.     These services are particularly important for homeless participants because sometimes the behaviors and circumstances that contributed to the participant's homelessness can recur once that participant moves out of the support system the program and case management relationship provide.  For example, of those placed in jobs, 60 percent of JTHDP participants receiving post-placement follow-up services were employed 13 weeks after placement as compared to 38 percent for those not receiving post-placement services.    Some special considerations when providing post-placement services to homeless participants include:      Lack of a permanent address.   Follow-up contact with some homeless participants can be more difficult because of their lack of a permanent address.  The address a participant gave at the time of placement may not be his or her address one month after placement; homeless individuals are continually trying to upgrade their housing situation.  You may need to contact them at their place of employment (which may have its own set of complications); although these contacts as well because homeless individuals often upgrade or change their employment.      Reluctance to seek or accept support.   Many homeless individuals, once employed want to put their period of homelessness behind them.  They may be unwilling to contact your agency for help and may even be reluctant to accept calls from your agency and/or additional help you may feel they need.      Behavior problems may emerge once the participant becomes employed.   Once the individual becomes employed and/or moves into unsubsidized housing, the problems that contributed to homelessness may re-emerge.  Some JTHDP sites found that the point at which the individual began to receive a pay check was a point when some participants let down their guard and reverted to behavior that led to homelessness (e.g., started to drink again).  Also, the stress of working, development of new relationships on the job, and poor communication skills may lead to problems and misunderstandings in the workplace.         2. Strategies       a.  Post-placement Strategy #1:  Offer a Broad Array of Post-placement Services to Meet the Diverse Needs of Your Placed Participants    Post-placement services should be tailored to the individual's needs and can include the following:     visits to participant's place of residence or in your office to provide job support, structure, and referrals for needed material services;   ongoing peer support groups for placed participants to identify problems they are experiencing that could affect their employment, and to develop solutions and identify resources to help resolve the problems;  re-placement services;  continuing life skills classes (e.g., sessions on adjustment to the workplace, handling work-related stress, and budgeting);  material assistance, such as transportation assistance, stipends to assist participants until they receive their first pay check, and replacement tools;  housing stabilization services;  contact with employers to discuss participants' work performance, attitude, attendance, and punctuality; and   program graduates as mentors for current participants in your training program.           In addition to providing basic post-placement support -- job support, housing stabilization, placement follow-up, and material support -- Jobs for Homeless Consortium further ensured job retention by providing an ""employment pack.""  The pack included transportation and food vouchers until the first pay check; on a case-by-case basis it also paid for job-related clothing, shoes, tools, union dues, and grooming.  Placed participants were eligible for housing subsidies that further ensured employment and housing stabilization.     You may not be able to provide a full range of post-placement support services to each placed participant.  Take the time to understand each participant's situation, including the services received in the past.  This may involve talking with the participant's employment and training case manager (if different from the post-placement case manager), the referring agency case manager, and possibly the employer.  Identify needed services, and then prioritize those most needed to assure employment retention.  JTHDP sites reported higher than average retention rates (the retention rate for all placed participants was 59 percent) for those participants receiving post-placement services. (15)   Agencies in your community will be able to provide a range of post-placement services to round out the ones your agency can provide.  The linkages you already have in place will help to expedite this process.    b.  Post-placement Strategy #2: Provide Emotional Support as Well as Material Support    ""Self-efficacy -- confidence in one's capability to perform specific, challenging behaviors -- is a valuable cognitive contributor to successful performance of such behaviors."" (16)   In other words, believing that you can accomplish what you set out to do will help you to do so.  The cited study found self-efficacy to be an important factor in successful job search among disadvantaged individuals.  Some homeless participants have no family supports, and the peer supports they do have are sometimes not good influences on maintaining employment.  The relationships they have made through their involvement with your agency may be a critical (and perhaps their only) source of support in their search for employment.   These relationships can be particularly important at the start of a new job, which is stressful for everyone and can be exacerbated for the homeless (who may have had unsuccessful experiences in the past or who are unaccustomed to the structure the job requires).  A case manager/job counselor can help instill a sense of confidence by providing ongoing support, being aware of the job expectations for the participant, assisting with problem solving, and assessing additional support needs.   Support groups can also be a source of emotional support, easing the transition into the work force by allowing individuals with similar strengths and deficiencies to share their problems and solutions with one another.  Group dynamics can play a significant role in assisting participants to deal effectively with a variety of personal and external barriers to employment.  JTHDP sites found that attendance improved when groups were held either before or after usual work hours and if food was provided.  (Many businesses are willing to donate food on a regular basis to a good cause.)  If your agency is unable to provide this type of support, seek it out through homeless-serving or other agencies.  It likely exists in your community.        The Kentucky Domestic Violence Association (KDVA) promoted a very thorough approach to post-placement services.  Once a participant began her employment, staff maintained contact in an effort to provide continuous support and encouragement and troubleshoot if necessary.  While participants were encouraged to work out difficulties with employers on their own, staff were available to intervene.  Staff served as mediators between employees and employers and provided additional training to participants who were having difficulty learning jobs.  Staff also provided ongoing case management services such as assisting with changes in child care, helping with legal problems, intervening with landlords, and locating rental assistance.  Since many of their participants were placed in entry-level jobs due to multiple employment barriers, KDVA continued to encourage participants to improve their job situations through promotions, job changes, or traditional training and education.  Finally, support groups, as well as individual counseling, were offered on an ongoing basis to all women who participated in the employment program.    c.  Post-placement Strategy #3: Be Creative and Persistent in Your Approach to Contact the Placed Participant    Some of your homeless participants may be difficult to contact or be reticent to respond to your contacts and available post-placement services.  You may need to access participants through their employers (discretely) or in the evening at their residences.  The contact should be frequent during the initial four weeks after placement and then can likely taper off.       The Jackson Employment Center, in Tucson, Arizona, began its post-placement support immediately upon placement.  Often the employment specialist and/or case manager visited participants in the evenings at their residences.  Regular visits were made twice a week, and participants who were experiencing difficulty may have been seen three or four times a week.  The number of visits tapered off over time, but for some participants, visits continued for a year or longer.  This approach permitted early intervention when participants were most likely to lose employment because of poor adjustment to the work environment or a re-emerging behavioral or health problem.    d.  Post-placement Strategy #4: Encourage Placed Participants to Pursue Additional Skills Training    As discussed earlier, many homeless individuals are anxious to secure employment because of their lack of financial support and stable housing.  As a result, they may not obtain needed skills training to secure a job which provides a living wage.  Through on-going post-placement contact, you may be able to encourage the placed participant to enroll in skills training concurrent with employment.  It is important to become aware of skills training needed to advance in the participant's current job or in the employment area identified through the objective assessment process, and of places to access the training which meet the participant's time constraints.   As stated earlier, JTHDP participants receiving post-placement training had among the highest retention rates.     e.  Post-placement Strategy #5: Be Prepared for Some of Your Homeless Participants to Need Placement Services Again -- Build This into Your Retention Strategy    Many homeless participants are anxious to enter employment, and their initial job placement may not be one in which they stay for long.  Some participants, once they secure employment and have a pay check coming in, may be willing to pursue more lasting employment or employment that builds more on the training they received.  Others may have difficulty in adjusting to their work environment and as a result may not retain their job.  With some additional support and problem solving, these individuals should be ready to pursue another placement.  The case manager/job counselor should be prepared to provide job placement services similar to those provided for the initial placement.       CHAPTER 5   THE FINAL INGREDIENTS: HOUSING AND OTHER SUPPORT SERVICES     This chapter describes the types of housing assistance and other support services homeless persons are likely to need during their participation in your employment and training program.  Housing assistance is set forth in a separate section in this chapter because of its importance as a support service for homeless persons.  JTHDP experience suggests that the provision of a continuum of housing assistance is a critical element if homeless individuals are to be served effectively.  With the exception of those receiving emergency housing assistance, retention rates were higher than average (59 percent) for individuals receiving all other housing services.  Among those receiving permanent housing placements, the 13 week retention rate was 80 percent.  The retention rates for those receiving other types of housing assistance through JTHDP were also much higher than the average: 76 percent for those receiving security deposits/rental assistance, 75 percent for those receiving assistance with furnishings/moving, 67 percent for those receiving housing assistance counseling, and 66 percent for those receiving transitional housing placements.   In addition to housing assistance, this chapter discusses the range of support services likely to be needed by homeless persons participating in employment and training programs.  The underlying theme throughout this chapter is that employment and training programs can provide the support services needed to assist homeless individuals in securing and retaining employment through linkages with public and private housing and other support service providers.   A. HOUSING SERVICES    1. Background and Challenges    Any program planning to provide education and training services to homeless individuals needs to make a range of housing assistance services and resources available either directly or through referrals. (17)   Your program is unlikely to achieve success in training and placing homeless individuals in jobs unless they have a place to live.  For example, homeless individuals need a place where they can safely leave their possessions and where they can shower and dress for work or training.   While the need to incorporate housing strategies into the overall individualized service strategy may seem obvious, it is not necessarily one of the services with which employment and training programs are familiar.   Before we begin describing the challenges and strategies in providing housing assistance, it is important to understand the range of housing options and types of housing assistance.  The continuum of housing alternatives includes four major types:     Emergency shelters  typically provide a place to sleep. Shelters may be open 24 hours a day, or they may be what is called a ""turnout"" shelter, where residents arrive at a specified time (e.g., 7:00 p.m.) and must leave the next morning by a specified time (e.g., 7:00 a.m).  Generally, admission to shelters is open, but stays are either on a first come/first served basis or can be limited to a maximum number of days.  While these shelters primarily focus their efforts on providing temporary shelter, they may also provide some referral services (e.g., for clothing, health care, or transportation services) and may provide case management.   Transitional housing  provides housing for a time-limited period (generally ranging from six to 18 months) and is intended to serve as a bridge from emergency shelters to permanent housing.  Eligibility may be based on demonstrated need, or limited to specific target populations such as ex-offenders or individuals in recovery.  Although not always present, transitional housing may have case managers to assist with information and referral and case planning.  These facilities may also have requirements for individuals to work and save a portion of their income (in preparation for moving into permanent housing).   Subsidized permanent housing  provides publicly-funded housing assistance through programs, such as the Section 8 Existing Housing Program (under which qualified participants receive certificates to pay for a portion of their rent), the Single Room Occupancy (SRO) program, and locally-administered public housing programs.  These programs are either directly administered by a local housing authority or a local housing authority in conjunction with community-based organizations.  As long as eligibility requirements are met, there is no time limit on the length of stay in these subsidized units.   Unsubsidized permanent housing  includes the rental or purchase of housing units on the open market.  Individuals may remain in unsubsidized permanent housing as long as they meet the requirements of the rental or purchase agreement.       You may face a number of challenges directly providing or arranging for housing assistance for homeless participants.      Housing assistance can be costly, particularly when it involves partial or full payment of rental assistance over a prolonged period.   In some urban areas, for example, the cost of a studio or one-bedroom apartment can be $350 or more a month (which over a one-year training period would add up to over $4,000).     Employment and training agencies often are not knowledgeable or experienced in providing or arranging for housing assistance.  The range of available housing assistance and alternatives within a community is often complicated. There are a number of federally-subsidized housing programs, as well as other transitional and emergency housing programs funded by private and public sources.  Each program has different eligibility requirements and application procedures.  Some housing programs accept applications one day of the year; others may only accept applications for families of four or more.  An understanding -- either through in-house expertise or linkages with housing assistance providers -- of the specific housing opportunities available in your community is needed to effectively meet the housing needs of your homeless participants.      In many localities, the demand for housing (e.g., vacancies in emergency, transitional, and subsidized permanent housing units) far exceeds the supply.   For example, there may be few openings in transitional housing facilities for low-income or homeless individuals, except for those with special needs (e.g., ex-offenders, substance abusers in recovery, battered women, or mentally-ill individuals).  Waiting lists for subsidized housing, such as public housing or Section 8 Existing Housing, might be very long (a year or longer) and may not be a viable option for certain types of individuals, such as single males.      2. Strategies    JTHDP experience underscored the importance of understanding and effectively addressing each homeless individual's housing situation before he or she enters education, training, and employment.  Demonstration sites found that given the cost of providing housing assistance and the continuum of housing options to meet the varying needs of their participants, they needed to establish linkages with a variety of housing assistance providers in their locality.  What follows are more specific strategies for assisting your homeless participants to obtain needed housing assistance.     a.  Housing Strategy #1: Understand Your Local Housing Environment and the Needs of Your Participants; Develop a Plan Consistent with Both       Understanding your local housing environment should involve a careful assessment of: (1) the range of housing needs of your homeless participants and (2) the availability of housing and housing services through other service providers.  You need to first understand the range of housing needs and problems faced by homeless participants, which are likely to vary considerably by individual.  For example, some homeless individuals with past problems of substance abuse or mental illness may need a supportive housing situation, which provides regular case management and monitoring of their situation.  Other homeless individuals may need references and sufficient financial resources so they can rent an unsubsidized housing unit.  Still others may need referrals (and advocacy) so they can obtain transitional housing or Section 8 certificates or gain entry into public housing units.    Also of importance in working with homeless individuals is understanding the availability of housing and housing services, including:        the local housing market (e.g., the cost, availability, and location of unsubsidized rental units);  the range of emergency and transitional housing facilities within the community, including types of facilities, eligibility requirements, methods for referral, and availability of slots;  the types of subsidized rental assistance and units within the community (e.g., public housing, Section 8 Existing Housing, SRO units), including types of agencies providing assistance, eligibility requirements, methods of referral, and waiting lists/availability of slots; and  the range of other housing assistance available in the community, including rental assistance (e.g., first/last month's rent, security deposit), furniture, utility assistance, and roommate services.     While conducting an assessment of participants' needs and the availability of housing resources, employment and training programs should be careful not ""to re-invent the wheel.""  Much of the information needed is already available from other public and private sector agencies.  Local agencies that may be able to furnish you with helpful information include:  (1) the local housing authority; (2) homeless-serving agencies such as the Salvation Army, St. Vincent de Paul, Traveler's Aid, emergency/ transitional facilities, and (if it exists) a coalition on homelessness; (3) local public assistance agencies (e.g., state or local departments of human services or social services); and (4) nonprofit social service agencies, such as Goodwill Industries and Community Action Committees.    Once this information has been collected and reviewed, you will need a plan for providing or (more likely) arranging for homeless participants to receive the types of housing services/assistance they need to be successful in training or employment.  The housing assistance plan should cover the range of assistance services that will be provided to homeless individuals both directly through your program and through other local service providers, with particular emphasis on provision of:  (1) emergency shelter, (2) transitional housing, (3) subsidized housing and rental subsidies, (4) counseling on housing alternatives, and (5) security deposits.       b.  Housing Strategy #2:  Develop Coordination Agreement with Agencies in Your Community That Provide the Range of Housing Services Your Participants May Need    To access the housing assistance resources that your participants are likely to need, your program should establish either formal or informal agreements for the provision of services.  JTHDP experience suggests that it is probably best to establish formal, written agreements.  Formal agreements clearly set forth each agency's role and responsibilities, reducing confusion and structuring accountability.     In these agreements, you should clearly set forth the types of housing services to be provided, the availability of slots or services, methods for referral, and the duration of the agreement.  From your perspective, it is important to pin down the details of the arrangement, particularly relating to the number of participants who will be able to access specific types of assistance (e.g., ""during the fiscal year, at least 15 participants will be eligible to receive security deposits of up to $500, subject to the following conditions...."").     It is also important to clarify whether referrals will be subject to waiting lists and how long these waiting lists will be.  To the extent possible, it is best to negotiate that the linked service provider set aside a number of slots (in a transitional facility, for example) that will be reserved and immediately available.  An example of the linkages for housing assistance developed by one of the employment and training agencies participating in JTHDP is presented in Appendix C.         The City of Waterbury's JTHDP program staff worked with private landlords to secure priority access for their clients to low cost housing.  In return, program case managers agreed to inform landlords of any changes in program participants' status.  Landlords were willing to guarantee this access because of the increased stability clients had from participating in the program and the involvement of a case manager.        The director of Louisville's Project WORTH used the memorandum of understanding (MOU) between DOL and HUD as leverage to gain cooperation from the housing authority, enabling WORTH to access half of the housing authority's Section 8 certificates for homeless families.  One reason the housing authority honored the MOU is that WORTH worked hard to make the relationship work well:  WORTH staff worked directly with landlords to get them to accept Section 8 tenants and prepared clients in transitional housing for the different and greater responsibilities of Section 8 housing.     One way of developing the linkages you need to serve your homeless participants is to join your local coalition on homelessness, if one exists in your community.  Effective coalitions can introduce you to local providers of shelter and transitional housing, and provide the forum for negotiating interagency agreements with those providers.  Coalitions can provide introductions to landlords who can help -- perhaps by notifying your program when low-rent units become vacant or by giving your participants a break on security deposits and/or rent based on the fact that they have a case manager and a program behind them.    Coalitions are also often the starting point for efforts to develop new transitional housing -- something you will want to know about, even if your agency is not in a position to lead the way.  Your agency, by participating in the coalition, can heighten coalition members' awareness of employment and training options for their clients and clearly position your agency as an active member of the community working toward increased self-sufficiency for the disadvantaged.      c.  Housing Strategy #3: Carefully Assess the Housing Needs of Each Homeless Participant During Assessment and Tailor a Plan that Effectively Addresses His/Her Specific Needs    As part of the assessment process, it is important to carefully consider the housing situation and needs of homeless individuals.  JTHDP sites found that success in job training and job placement/retention was associated with stabilizing the housing condition of homeless participants (i.e., at a minimum, getting individuals off the street and into emergency shelters and preferably transitional facilities). (18)       d.  Housing Strategy #4:  Make Referrals Based on Housing Needs and Follow Up on Referrals           Once housing goals and resources have been identified, your employment and training program should make appropriate referrals to the collaborating agencies providing the housing assistance.  As with any support service, you need to make sure that participants follow up on the referral and that they obtain the requested services from the linked organization.  It also may be the case that while the individual follows up on the referral, the agency receiving the referral may not be willing to provide the service  (perhaps because of past problems with the individual) or may not have available space.  Hence, make sure to follow up on the referral with both the participant and the housing service providers to whom the participant is referred.     It is also important to follow up with the participant and the linked service provider periodically after the individual begins to receive the service.  Problems may arise (e.g., failure of the individual to get along with others in the housing facility, failure to make rent payments on a timely basis, or disruptive behavior) which need troubleshooting before they become bigger problems.        e.  Housing Strategy #5:  Consider Using Housing Upgrades to Reward Progress    You (or the housing assistance providers you work with) might want to consider using housing upgrades to reward participants for their progress toward self-sufficiency goals.  Some JTHDP demonstration sites found that they could encourage participants to work harder toward achieving their training and employment goals by using housing upgrades as a reward for reaching predetermined benchmarks.  The extent to which programs use housing as a reward depends, at least in part, on the range of housing over which they have control; obviously if no Section 8 vouchers are available, then Section 8 cannot be held out as an incentive to reward positive behavior.  For many programs though, especially if they have formal arrangements with housing-based service providers, tying housing to achievement is a practical approach.       Jackson Employment Center (JEC) used a ""carrot and stick"" philosophy.  Participants who progressed through the program were maintained within the shelter facilities and upgraded; those who failed to perform received counseling and warnings, then their housing vouchers were shifted from a weekly to a daily basis, and eventually they lost their access to shelter.  JEC structured its program with shelter as an inducement to prompt behavioral change and active program participation and gave priority for choice housing units to those who abided by JEC rules.      B. OTHER SUPPORT SERVICES    1. Background and Challenges    Support services, while not your agency's primary focus, are often crucial to success for homeless participants.  Transportation, child care, health care, and other needs can prevent a homeless participant from completing training or maintaining a good job placement.  JTHDP sites provided support services in a variety of ways, both directly and through referral.  Transportation, for example, was the most commonly provided support service throughout the JTHDP (76 percent of participants received transportation assistance).  Some sites operated vans and buses while others obtained public transportation passes or tokens for their participants.  Other support services commonly provided, either directly or through referral, included food/meals, self-esteem/motivation/attitude adjustment training, personal needs, and clothing/work equipment.     Some considerations related to providing support services to homeless participants follow.       For homeless participants, support service needs are often wider in scope and more pressing.   For example, rather than just needing some presentable work clothing, they may need virtually an entire wardrobe.   The intensity of need tends to vary depending upon how long an individual has been homeless, as well as how effectively he or she has been stabilized prior to enrolling in the job training program.     One of the challenges employment and training agencies must face in serving homeless people is to ensure that the homeless participant has some means of support during the training period.   Without some financial support (e.g., public assistance or a part-time job), it is difficult to complete occupational skills training.     The need for substance abuse and mental health treatment services is likely to be more prevalent among the homeless population.   Accessing these services in a timely manner, though, is often difficult.       2. Strategies      a.  Support Service Strategy #1:  Develop Coordination Agreements With Agencies in Your Community to Provide the Range of Needed Support Services    To ensure that support service needs do not interfere with successful completion of employment and training activities, your program should address these needs, either directly or through referrals to community agencies.  For those service needs your agency is unable to provide directly, develop interagency coordination and referral agreements with the appropriate community agencies.  Many case managers develop interpersonal relationships with other service providers, both within and beyond their own agencies, that help them access services for their clients.  More effective is a system of interagency agreements, so that the arrangements have support at the policymaker level and are not solely dependent on staff relationships.  (See Housing Strategy #2 above.)        The Southeast Tennessee Private Industry Council developed a coordination arrangement with the Chattanooga Community Kitchen, the area's only homeless day shelter and a site visited by 75 percent of the area's homeless persons on a regular basis.  The Community Kitchen became a leading agency in providing in-kind support to homeless individuals enrolled in the PIC's employment and training activities.  The Community Kitchen provided at no charge: three meals a day, seven days a week; a day shelter with shower and laundry facilities; a clothing program; a health clinic; benefits services (assistance in applying for food stamps, Social Security, veterans' benefits, etc.); and literacy and basic skills training.    b.  Support Service Strategy #2:  Assess Support Service Needs On An Ongoing Basis   An ongoing, client-centered assessment strategy, that begins at intake and continues throughout your involvement with the participant, can help assure successful outcomes by identifying new support service needs.  Use ongoing assessment to identify and access new support services as you learn more about the participants and as new needs arise. (19)        HELP (San Diego Private Industry Council's JTHDP program) case managers used information from the initial interview, intake and assessment forms, and information from the referral agency to identify reasons for homelessness (e.g., eviction, job loss/lack of training) and obstacles to employment (e.g., lack of transportation, substance abuse).  This information, once discussed with the participant, guided referral to an array of support services, which enabled clients to attend training and seek employment.  Case mangers periodically reviewed the list of needed support services to assess their continued relevance.  These discussions with the participant frequently led to the deletion of some service needs from the case plan and the identification and inclusion of other needs.      c.  Support Service Strategy #3:  Assist Participants in Accessing Support Services For Which They Are Eligible    Assisting participants to qualify for and enroll in whatever income support and health services programs are feasible and appropriate can make the difference between completing and not completing training.  This is a role for case managers, but they can only perform it well if they are trained and informed about the variety of federal, state, and local options. For example, many homeless participants are eligible for Medicaid, and many communities have special health clinics or other services specifically for the homeless.  Food stamps, AFDC for people with children, and (in many states) general assistance for the homeless and other poor who do not qualify for AFDC, are options for subsistence and income.  In addition to training your case managers on the variety of services available to the homeless, your agency might want to provide a brief reference manual with information on programs, social service organizations, contact names, and phone numbers.  Your agency could develop the manual or use one provided by the United Way or another organization serving the homeless.       Catholic Charities in Saint Paul, Minnesota served single adult participants and encouraged them to sign up for General Assistance as an interim source of income until they began earning wages.  As General Assistance recipients, they were also eligible for up to 30 days of county-paid shelter per quarter.           d.  Support Service Strategy #4:  Address Transportation Needs Either Directly or Through Referral    Plan to assist most participants with transportation, both during training and the initial period of employment.  Specific strategies will vary according to the quality of public transportation in your community, but do not ignore this very basic need.  Also, be realistic about the impact of transportation when identifying training, transitional housing, and employment options for participants; an overly long and difficult commute can sabotage the best training or employment placement.      e.  Support Service Strategy #5: Coordinate With Substance Abuse and Mental Health Treatment Programs      The need for substance abuse and mental health treatment is likely to be more prevalent among the homeless than among the general population.  A few JTHDP sites tried having their own substance abuse counselor in-house, but most sites found that they succeeded more readily if they referred applicants with substance abuse problems for treatment to agencies specializing in that service, and then waited to enroll people once they were solidly ""in recovery.""  For those individuals participating in outpatient treatment, many JTHDP sites linked participating in employment and training activities to continued involvement in outpatient treatment.   Many of the demonstration sites found that referrals for substance abuse and mental health treatment -- particularly residential treatment -- involved long waiting lists.  Several sites negotiated special arrangements for their applicants or participants.  One quid pro quo you can offer a treatment program that shortens the normal waiting time for your participants is to accept their participants on a priority basis once they have dealt with their substance abuse or mental health issues.       Project Uplift at the Greater Washington Boys and Girls Club, whose target population included a high percentage of drug-dependent individuals, developed a linkage with St. Vincent de Paul for both in- and out-patient drug treatment, in which Uplift referrals were placed at the top of the waiting list.  Depending on the severity of the problem, participants were enrolled concurrently or sequentially in drug treatment and in Project Uplift.   Project WORTH used its involvement in the metropolitan-wide coalition on homelessness to develop strong linkages with substance abuse and mental health providers.  If substance abuse or mental health showed up as an issue at intake or assessment, the participant was referred to a therapist who then advised Project WORTH when the participant was ready to enroll in training and employment services.         APPENDIX A:   OVERVIEW OF THE JOB TRAINING FOR  THE HOMELESS DEMONSTRATION PROGRAM    A. Authorizing Legislation and Guidelines    The Job Training for the Homeless Demonstration Program (JTHDP) was authorized under Section 731 of the Stewart B. McKinney Homeless Assistance Act of 1987.  Under this legislation, the Department of Labor (DOL) was authorized to plan, implement, and evaluate a job training demonstration program for homeless individuals.  The resulting JTHDP, administered by DOL's Employment and Training Administration (ETA), represented the first comprehensive federal program specifically designed to provide employment and training services (and a wide range of other supportive services) for homeless individuals and to assist them in securing employment.  Under the demonstration effort, the term ""homeless"" or ""homeless"" individual referred to one who:      Lacked a fixed, regular, and adequate nighttime residence; and   Had a primary nighttime residence that was:  (a)  a supervised publicly or privately operated shelter designed to provide temporary living accommodations (including welfare hotels, congregate shelters, halfway"

Traditional Adoption:   The adoption agency selects the adoptive family for the child.  Birth parents do not read home studies and there is no contact between birth parents and adoptive family.  Non-identifying information is shared with birth parents and adoptive family. Semi-Traditional Adoption :               Birth parent has active role in choosing adoptive family on basis of reading home studies, with identifying information removed.  There is no face-to-face contact.  Adoptive parents receive non-identifying information about birth parents. Semi-Open Adoption :               Birth parent has active role in choosing adoptive family on basis of reading adoptive family home study with identifying information removed.  In addition, there is a face-to-face meeting between birth parents and the adoptive family. Open Adoption:   Adoption arrangement whereby the birth             parent(s) and the prospective adoptive parent(s) determine by mutual consent, the amount of identifying information that will be shared or communicated about the other.      ADOPTION EXCHANGE: A recruitment and referral agency which helps social workers find adoptive families for special needs children.  The exchange does not place children.      ADOPTION SUBSIDY ASSISTANCE: Financial, medical, or social service assistance provided to the adopting parents to provide for the needs of an eligible special needs child.      CONSENT TO ADOPT: A Consent to Adopt is a legal document the birth parent signs which releases all of their parental rights to the child to the specific adoptive parents they have selected.  It cannot be signed until a minimum of 72 hours has elapsed from the time of a child's birth.  Once signed and properly witnessed and notarized, it cannot be revoked by the birthparent.  Nevada law requires that Consents to Adopt be witnessed by a licensed social worker.      DIVISION OF CHILD AND FAMILY SERVICES, STATE OF NEVADA (DCFS): The agency designed to provide child welfare services.  It is the agency designated by law to establish adoption standards and to administer the adoption program.      FINALIZATION: The process in district court, in which an adoption is recognized by the law as final, and the adopted child is considered in the same relationship to you as though he/she was born to you.  In Nevada, the child must have resided in the adoptive home for a minimum of six months, before finalization can take place.      FOSTER CARE: Temporary care for children by families who are licensed by the Division of Child and Family Services or other private agency.      HOMESTUDY: This is a written report completed by a social worker, after compiling the information contained in your application,  personal references, medical and law enforcement reports, individual and/or group interviews, and required home visits.  During this process the worker evaluates the family motivation for adoption, expectations, parenting skills, ability to support a child, etc.  An approved home study does not guarantee placement of a child.      INDEPENDENT OR PRIVATE ADOPTION: An adoption arranged directly between birth parents and adoptive parents.  Also known as specific adoption.      INTERNATIONAL ADOPTION: The adoption of a child from a country Nevada other than U.S.  Also known as foreign adoption or intercountry adoption.                                                                                                            HOME        SITEMAP          This          page is Bobby Approved           Federal Rehabilitation Act ( Section          508             Last Updated:          08/26/03 01:39:49 PM

Clay Shaw, Jr., (R-FL), Chairman of the Subcommittee on Social Security of the Committee on Ways and Means, today announced that on  Wednesday, February 16, 2000 , the Subcommittee ordered  favorably  reported to the full Committee,  as amended ,  H.R. 5,  the ""Senior Citizens' Freedom to Work Act of 2000,"" by  unanimous voice vote .    DESCRIPTION OF H.R. 5 AS APPROVED:    H.R. 5 would lower the age at which seniors are exempt from the Social Security ""earnings limit"" from age 70 to the full retirement age (currently 65, rising to 67 by 2027).    This current Social Security policy, sometimes called the ""earnings penalty,"" reduces the benefits of seniors if their earnings from wages and self-employment income exceed a specific threshold, or ""earnings limit."" In 2000, the earnings limit for working seniors between ages 65 and 69 is $17,000. Social Security benefits are reduced by $1 for every $3 of earnings in excess of the limit. The effect would be to allow seniors who have reached the full retirement age to work without experiencing a reduction in their Social Security benefits if their income rises above the earnings limit thresholds.     H.R. 5 also would make several technical and conforming amendments incorporating this change with current law. The proposed legislation would be effective for earnings in taxable years ending after December 31, 1999."
GX087-42-15888949	"STATEMENT OF         CHARISSE M. PHILLIPS    DIRECTOR, OFFICE OF FRAUD PREVENTION PROGRAMS    BUREAU OF CONSULAR AFFAIRS    UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF STATE         BEFORE THE         SUBCOMMITTEE ON SOCIAL SECURITY,    COMMITTEE ON WAYS AND MEANS         AND THE         SUBCOMMITTEE ON IMMIGRATION, BORDER SECURITY, AND CLAIMS, COMMITTEE ON THE JUDICIARY         UNITED STATES HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES         September 19, 2002         Mr. Chairman and Members of the Committees:         Thank you for the opportunity to appear at this hearing on  Preserving the Integrity of Social Security Numbers and Preventing Their Misuse by Terrorists .              I have had the privilege of serving as the Director of Fraud Prevention Programs, in the Bureau of Consular Affairs, for two years now.    Previously I served in a number of consular sections abroad where I had front-line experience with document fraud, and     with attempts by criminals, terrorists, and hostile governments to gain  U.S.  travel documents.    I have been a consular officer for almost 17 years.            The Bureau of Consular Affairs is in the business of preventing travel document fraud.    We have an integral interest in the quality of identity documents and vital records produced in the  United States , because those documents form the basis of  U.S.  passport issuance.    The  U.S.  passport is perhaps the most highly valued document in the world, because of the many benefits and privileges it confers.    It is not “just a document” – it is the pass-key into our country.         We have developed an extremely tamper-resistant passport.    In fact, passport and immigration authorities in other countries have told us what we have found ourselves – the  U.S.  passports now being issued are now so difficult to alter or counterfeit that alien smugglers have stopped trying to alter them.            Instead they are acquiring authentic passports that have been lost or stolen and then using “look-alike” travelers to match passports stolen from American tourists overseas.    They are helping impostors apply for  U.S.  passports using identities stolen from  U.S.  citizens in the  USA .    They are also producing and selling counterfeit documents – birth certificates, driver’s licenses, Social Security cards – to aliens to use in applying for passports.    All these documents are available – cheap – on the Internet.         Personnel of the Bureau of Consular Affairs are experienced at detecting these false documents.    We have done studies of our passport issuances, and we provide training and information to our passport staff to kept them alert.    But as home computers, the Web, and high tech scanners and copiers become more accessible, we need more and better tools for our people.         One tool that will help our officers is on-line access to Social Security Administration records.    Comparing the documents submitted in support of passport and visa applications against the official databases of the issuing authorities will greatly improve the accuracy and integrity of the citizenship and identity confirmation process.    We are currently working closely with the Social Security Administration and state vital records offices toward this goal.         I will begin by giving some examples of document fraud cases.         Alien Smuggling Ring Exposed          Let me tell you about the methadone moms.    As these low-income women leave their drug-rehab clinics, they are targeted by alien smugglers.    They are offered money – several hundred dollars, maybe – to apply for passports for their own kids.    But, here’s the catch.    They will submit photos of different kids, supplied by the alien smugglers.    Who are these substitute kids?    In the majority of cases, they are the children of people in the  U.S.  either illegally, or as permanent residents, but who cannot bring their kids to the  U.S.  immediately through any legal means.    Their parents pay thousands of dollars for those fraudulent passports.    How do we know about this?    An alert passport employee.    We are fortunate to have a cadre of trained, experienced and loyal personnel who detect these attempts to obtain our passports through fraud.         Operation  Oak Park : Passport Agency Uncovers Criminal Document Ring         Late in 2000, the Chicago Passport Agency's Fraud Program Manager (FPM) linked 25 passport applications to a document fraud ring involving Nigerian nationals.    A subsequent investigation conducted by the State Department’s Diplomatic Security Field Office in  Chicago  revealed the fraud ring involved one document broker, who was already under investigation by the U.S. Postal Inspector's Office, the Social Security Administration’s Inspector General’s Office, the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS), and the Drug Enforcement Agency. With Diplomatic Security as the catalyst, the agencies and others formed a task force, ""Operation Oak Park"", under the direction of the U.S. Attorney.          The ringleader and his associates provided young women with computer-generated counterfeit birth certificates and immunization records that named the women as the mothers of non-existent newborn babies.    They used those documents to apply for Social Security cards, which they passed on to the ringleader.    He then created other counterfeit birth certificates, using the name on the Social Security card but with the date of birth of the ultimate recipient or purchaser of the documents.    The recipients could then use the birth certificates and social security cards to obtain driver’s licenses and apply for passports. The ringleader charged about $5,000 for each fraudulent identity.         The investigation developed leads into Jamaican and Nigerian community-based criminal activities and implicated two Illinois State Bureau of Vital Statistics employees and one federal employee, who actively participated in the broader fraudulent documents scheme.          Operation Blind Date          When federal investigators arrested the ringleader, he agreed to cooperate, spawning a subsidiary investigation, Operation Blind Date. Under guidance from the task force he arranged for his network of brokers to fly to  Chicago  to pick up their documents and meet a supposedly corrupt Social Security supervisor, who was in reality an undercover Secret Service agent.    The Chicago Police Department was included in the operation and arrested eight of the ringleader’s associates ostensibly in routine traffic stops as they left his office so they wouldn’t suspect him of turning them in.    Those arrested included six Nigerian nationals, a Kenyan and a Jamaican posse street gang leader who was sought at the time by U.S. Customs and the DEA for narcotics trafficking.         As part of a plea agreement, the ringleader took responsibility for preparing more than 100 sets of false documents. He was charged with fraudulently obtaining and selling passports and Social Security cards and counterfeiting birth certificates. He faced a possible sentence of 10 years imprisonment and a $250,000 fine. However, he did not give up as easily as it appeared at the time.    In December 2001, his family informed federal agents that the individual, who was at home on electronic detention while awaiting sentencing, had passed away.    However, when a Secret Service agent went to the morgue to identify the body he discovered that the corpse was not the ringleader’s.    The family and their doctor allegedly conspired to kidnap and murder a homeless man, pass him off as the convicted individual and planned to have the body cremated as soon as the morgue released it.    A manhunt for the ringleader ensued, and federal agents were able to track him to Massachusetts. He was apparently planning to flee the country to Poland where he had ties. He is still awaiting sentencing. The U.S. Attorney in Chicago has added capital murder charges to the document fraud charges.          West African fraud in Texas          Interagency cooperation is also active in other parts of the country to combat document fraud.    The Houston Passport Agency’s region has two of the country’s largest enclaves of West African nationals in the U.S.    The majority resides in Dallas and Houston, which has over 50,000 Nigerian residents. The number of scams involving West African nationals in this region grew so great that a federal task force comprised of various federal and local law enforcement agencies convened several years ago in an effort to share case information and develop joint strategies. The majority of passport fraud cases by West Africans detected involved additional crimes, such as marriage fraud, narcotics trafficking, credit card fraud, insurance fraud and Social Security fraud.         Falsified Visas Also Used for Social Security Fraud         Another type of fraud we have seen involves altered visas used by people who are already in the U.S. to obtain a benefit.    Copies of fraudulent visas have been submitted to the Social Security Administration and the INS.    The SSA applications are most commonly submitted by citizens of the Former Soviet Union who have legitimately issued visitor visas.    The visas are altered, however, to show work classification so that the person will appear eligible for a Social Security number.         Why Social Security Number Checking is Critical to Passport and Visa Processing         Passport Applications         As state and local vital statistics offices improve the security features of their birth certificates to deter counterfeiters, deceased identity fraud will become an increasingly popular mode of fraud.    Confirming a deceased identity is often difficult for Passport Agency Fraud Program Managers (FPMs) since many states have not cross-matched out-of-state birth and death records.     Social Security data can be very useful in exposing attempts at passport fraud.         FPMs have learned to recognize potential fraud cases by spotting anomalies in passport applications.    Among the most frequent indicators of passport fraud are:         ·                   The breeder document phenomenon    In this scenario, a birth certificate is used to generate a series of new documents, culminating in an application for a passport.    One hallmark of such activity is a readily identifiable timeline sequence of the respective transactions.    First, a birth certificate appears, then a Social Security card or a document such as a state ID or driver’s license, and finally, the passport application is executed.         ·          Little evidence to support the deposed facts     Often, a passport application shows omissions and references to third parties (e.g., a friend as the person-to-be-notified in the event of an emergency).    In person, the applicant is generally unfamiliar with the assumed identity, thus tending to respond evasively and making claims that are generally inconsistent with his appearance.         ·          Unusual signatures    Signatures on the applications may appear labored or obviously forged.    FPMs are trained to detect handwriting that is not American in style.         Passport Agency personnel frequently check whether a previously issued passport was issued in error.    The most useful method to do so is to obtain copy of the previous application and verify the subject’s Social Security number and check birth/death records and the FBI’s National Crime Information Center files.     If the passport was issued in a deceased identity a possible indicator would be a recently issued SSN or a record of two SSN’s issued in that identity. There will also be minimal personal data on the original application.    If the passport was obtained based on a counterfeit or falsely filed delayed birth certificate,   a new SSN in the applicant’s identity may have been issued weeks after the first passport was issued. The previous application may show a different SSN.         Immigrant Visa Utility         Consular sections at U.S. Embassies and Consulates also rely on Social Security records when handling immigrant visa case.    Consular Sections overseas are sometimes hard pressed to determine whether an elderly petitioner in an immigrant visa case is still alive, particularly in cases where the petition was filed many years before.    In other cases, the follow-to-join beneficiaries may claim the original petitioner is deceased in order to avoid a likely visa refusal resulting from ineligibility under the public charge section of the Immigration and Nationality Act.    Sometimes there are also fraud problems when employment-based immigrant visa cases filed many years before for beneficiaries to care for elderly or seriously ill individuals raise questions whether the individuals still need such assistance.    A check of the SSA database will in some cases provide definitive evidence of misrepresentation.         How the Department of State Combats the Fraud         Purchasing SSA Database         My office has purchased from Social Security a CD ROM with death records of social security recipients dating back to 1936.    We have made this available to our passport and visa personnel on-line.    Fraud Prevention Managers in consular sections and passport agencies now have access to over 77 million U.S. death records via the Office of Fraud Prevention Programs’ Intranet Web page.    Over 98% of the death records in the database are for individuals who died after 1962.    However, the database only includes death records of individuals for whom a death benefit claim was made to SSA.    It may therefore not provide a positive response if the decedent never worked or never had a social security number, even if that person is indeed deceased.         Multiple Passport Issuance Verification Helps Detect Fraudulent Passport Applications         Passport Services’ Multiple Passport Issuance Verification (MIV) feature of the new Photodigitized Passport Issuance System is a quantum leap forward in fraud prevention technology that is already paying handsome dividends.            Acting much like a name-check system, MIV automatically searches the passport files database for records of passport issuance during the past ten years and notifies the adjudicating officer if an applicant was issued a previous passport.    It tells the officer how many passports were issued and for each issuance provides the name, date and place of birth, passport number, issuance and expiration dates.    Some records also provide the Social Security number.    This is proving to be a powerful tool for passport agency FPMs.    A recent survey of ten passport agencies revealed that the MIV system detected an average of 25 additional fraud cases per month.             Liaison with Vital Records Offices         When questions arise concerning the authenticity of a U.S birth certificate submitted with a passport application, FPMs often seek to verify the questioned document with appropriate local authorities.    Over the years, FPMs have established informal working relationships with most of the state registrars in their regions.         Consular personnel also work with the National Association for Public Health Statistics and Information Systems (NAPHSIS).    At their annual conference in 2001 NAPHSIS members approved a Consular Affairs-drafted resolution recommending cooperation with the Department of State’s anti-fraud program.    In the resolution, NAPHSIS recognized that cooperation with the State Department is essential to the integrity of the passport issuance process and the states’ vital records operations.    The resolution encouraged all vital statistics offices to establish and maintain liaison with the FPM whose passport agency is responsible for their state.         What the Problem Needs Now         We need to be able to confirm Social Security Numbers easily and routinely.    Right now our people put a lot of energy into developing informal contacts to help them confirm Social Security Numbers and work histories.    They rely on this information in suspect cases to help them quickly identify the  bonafide   Americans taking an innocent trip from the aliens, sometimes criminal aliens, who are seeking U.S. passports to evade the scrutiny of immigration officials around the world.         Our people also need help with confirming the bonafides of U.S. birth certificates and driver’s licenses.    This country has more than 8,000 authorities issuing birth certificates, and more than 50,000 different versions issued by states, counties and municipalities.    One commonly accepted proof of identity is the driver’s license.    It is not commonly known, however, that high-quality duplicates of state licenses are available on the Internet, with only a removable sticker warning “novelty item” to deter criminals.    Our passport workers have no way of verifying driver’s licenses, either on-line or though routine access.    We call these documents “breeder documents” because they can all be used to obtain more identity documents.    Over the past several years we have been working with other agencies to combat fraudulent use of these documents and detect counterfeits and other fraud.            We have begun to brief Social Security fraud investigators in identifying foreign passports presented with Social Security number applications.    We are also working closely with the Social Security Administration to identify a way for us to routinely verify Social Security Numbers on-line.         We are working with the National Association of Public Health Statistics and Information Systems and the Social Security Administration to encourage states to automate their birth and death records.    My office is also building a database of lost-or-stolen blank documents, such as birth certificates.    We are also part of an interagency working group, headed by INS, on developing standards for U.S. birth certificates, to make it easier to identity counterfeits.         In addition, we are talking to the American Association of Motor Vehicle Administrators on standardizing driver’s license features.    My office recently sponsored a pilot program at one Passport Agency to purchase readers to verify that the information on the front of driver’s licenses at least matches that on the barcodes or magnetic strips on the back – police departments use these same devices to detect underage drinkers.    We are also developing a pilot program with one state Department of Motor Vehicles to construct a train-the-trainers program on foreign passports, and share information on trends in document fraud.         If we have this much difficulty with fraudulent documents in the United States, it is easy to imagine the problem encountered in our consular sections overseas.    Some countries have automated, centralized records that are verified before passports are issued, and their documents are therefore easy to accept.    In others, wars and natural disasters have destroyed vital local records, where they even existed.    Poorly paid civil registry workers are also subject to pressure to fraudulently issue legitimate documents.         To counter this problem, my office maintains information on lost-or-stolen blank foreign travel documents.    Every consular section has a designated Fraud Prevention Manager who is responsible for helping new officers learn the local documents, and for maintaining exemplars for reference.    We have on-line country fraud summaries available for visa adjudicators to refer to.    We train consular officers to detect altered or counterfeit documents, even when they have never seen such documents before.    In addition, the U.S. Government has several programs to encourage countries to centralize and automate their vital records.         As much progress as we believe we have made, we continue to explore possibilities for improving our fraud detection.    For instance, we would like to explore the use of commercial databases to help identify fraudulent applications.    We will work with INS to obtain additional information from its records that would be helpful.          We in the State Department are proud of our fraud prevention programs and the technological improvements we are making.    We will continue to work with the Social Security Administration, other Federal agencies, and the states to aggressively combat document fraud."

The purpose of SSI is to assure a minimum level of income. Entitlement to SSI in most states triggers entitlement to Medicaid. Several ""work incentives"" are built into the SSI program. These work incentives are designed to enabled individuals with disabilities to return to work, increase their work activity without the loss of SSI disability status, or have their SSI benefits protected from reduction based on increased earnings. One particularly powerful work incentive under the SSI program is commonly referred to as 1619(b). This program is for individuals enrolled in SSI who have earnings above the substantial gainful activity or SGA level ($780 per month in 2002) that have disqualified them from receiving a cash benefit. Under 1619(b), these individuals retain their SSI eligibility as well as their Medicaid benefits. Generally the 1619(b) program is a beneficiary protection that advantages as individual. However, for married couples where both spouses are SSI eligible, the program can create disadvantages for the spouse in the form of loss of SSI entitlement and Medicaid due to income deeming from the spouse on 1619(b). Currently, 1619(b) protects only the working individual for Medicaid. A major concern of beneficiaries who try to work is the continuation of health care coverage for themselves and their spouses. Budget Proposal Included in the President's FY 2004 budget request is a proposal that would extend 1619 status to an SSI eligible spouse (whether the spouse is aged, blind or has a disability) of a working SSI beneficiary who is in the 1619(b) status. By doing this the eligible spouse will not lose entitlement to Medicaid because of increased work efforts. CMS estimated that there would be about 1700-1800 individuals per year affected by this provision."

Apfel, Commissioner of Social Security,               Praises              Senate Action and Announces Implementation Plan for the Repeal of              the Retirement Earnings Test               Kenneth S.              Apfel, Commissioner of Social Security, today praised the United States              Senate for its vote of 100-0 earlier this week to eliminate the retirement              earnings test. The United States House of Representatives passed a              similar version on March 1 by a 422-0 vote. ""Beneficiaries who are              65 years young should be allowed to contribute their energy, talent              and experience to the workplace without being penalized for doing              so,"" said Commissioner Apfel. ""I know that the President is anxious              to sign this bill into law. I also want people to know that SSA is              moving to implement this important piece of legislation as quickly              as possible.""             The retirement              earnings test has been a part of the Social Security program since              its inception when there were 5 workers for every beneficiary. Demographics              are changing the dynamics of both the workforce and the Social Security              program. Today, there are three workers for every beneficiary and              by 2030 there will be 2 workers per beneficiary. ""The earnings test              is counterproductive in an economy in which employers want and need              the skills and talents of older workers,"" commented Apfel. ""It is              an outdated policy that discourages healthy seniors from continuing              to work past age 65 if they choose to do so.""              The legislation,              which is retroactive to January 1, 2000, will affect around 800,000              beneficiaries who are either working or are dependents of workers.              In addition, there are about another 100,000 persons who have not              filed claims for benefits because they are working (or because they              are dependents of workers). The legislation will allow these people              to receive benefits this year when they file claims for benefits.              Altogether, about $6 billion in benefits will be paid this year because              of the legislation. With the elimination of the earnings test, each              beneficiary affected by the legislation will receive, on average,              an additional $6,700 in benefits this year.              About 415,000              of the affected beneficiaries (workers and dependents) have already              had $1.4 billion in Social Security benefits withheld because of the              earnings test since January 1. If the elimination of the earnings              test is signed into law by mid-April, each beneficiary will receive              a retroactive payment in May, averaging about $3,500.              ""We are working              hard to ensure that Social Security beneficiaries who are affected              by the new law will have money in their pockets quickly,"" said Apfel.              SSA will send notices to all beneficiaries potentially affected by              the earnings test shortly after the bill is signed. The notices will              tell beneficiaries about the legislation and how SSA will implement              the new law. If the President signs the bill by mid-April, SSA will              be able to make retroactive payments to beneficiaries by early May              2000 and change monthly benefit payments to reflect the new law by              June 2000.              While there              is a short-term cost to eliminate the retirement earnings test--about              $22 billion over ten years, there is virtually no long-term cost to              the Social Security program to eliminate it.              ""This bi-partisan              legislation is an excellent example of how we can all work together              to make positive changes to the Social Security program,"" said Commissioner              Apfel. ""We can and must apply this same spirit of cooperation to strengthening              Social Security for future generations of Americans."""

This article discusses the retirement test and recomputation of benefit provisions and provides statistical data for 1995.   In 1995, about 806,000 persons aged 65-70 had significant earnings resulting in the withholding of benefits by the retirement earnings test.  About 1,659,000 persons aged 65 or older realized an increase in their benefit amount because of their earnings.

It examines work activity within sectors of employment and looks at the issues of whether work return in certain industries and occupations varies according to the demographic characteristics of the beneficiaries.  The article also presents data on sector-specific employer accommodations that can aid in sustained work return.   Postentitlement work was fairly evenly distributed across occupational and industrial sectors.  Persons with higher levels of educational attainment were found to be in white-collar employment sectors.  There were noticeable differences in the availability of employer accommodations across postentitlement occupations and industries.

It addresses issues that most concern U.S. analysts: how the United Kingdom has kept its future public pension costs at a manageable level, the extent to which privatization of public pensions has contributed to low pensions costs, the popular appeal of individual pension accounts, and the impact of privatization on retirement income.  These issues are best understood in the context of the U.K. pension program's particular institutional structure and policies, two of  which--""contracting  out"" of public pensions and strong reliance on means-tested  benefits-- have been largely rejected in the evolution of U.S. policy to date.   Particular use is made of recently available data on coverage rates for public and private pension programs over the total working population and administrative records on inactive personal pension accounts.

GX018-19-4506268	"2003 Annual Report of the SSI Program                                                                                                  II. HIGHLIGHTS       The Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program is a nationwide Federal assistance program administered by the Social Security Administration (SSA) that guarantees a minimum level of income for needy aged, blind, or disabled individuals. This section presents highlights of recent SSI program experience, a summary of important changes to the program in the last year, a discussion of current issues facing the SSI program, and a summary of the key results from the 25-year forecasts.       A. RECENT PROGRAM EXPERIENCE       SSI program experience during the past year included the following:        During 2002, 1.7 million individuals applied for SSI benefits based on  blindness  or  disability , an increase of 10 percent over 2001. An additional 0.1 million applied for SSI benefits based on age, an increase of 6 percent from 2001.     On average during calendar year 2002, 6.5   million individuals received Federal SSI benefits on a monthly basis. This group was composed of 1.2 million aged recipients, 5.2 million disabled recipients, and fewer than 0.1 million blind recipients. An estimated 7.3 million aged, blind, or disabled individuals received at least 1 month's Federal SSI benefit during the year.     Federal expenditures for cash payments under the SSI program during calendar year 2002 totaled $31.6 billion.     On average during calendar year 2002, 2.5 million individuals received Federally-administered State supplementary payments on a monthly basis. This group was composed of 0.6 million aged recipients, 1.8 million disabled recipients, and fewer than 0.05 million blind recipients. An estimated 2.8 million individuals received at least 1 month's Federally-administered State supplementary payment during calendar year 2002.     State expenditures for Federally-administered supplements during calendar year 2002 totaled $3.8 billion, excluding fees for Federal administration.     The percentage of SSI recipients participating in direct deposit has more than doubled since 1995, reaching 51 percent in 2002.     The cost of administering the SSI program in fiscal year 2002 was $2.6 billion, which was roughly 7 percent of total Federally-administered SSI expenditures.     In January 2003, 6.8 million individuals received Federally-administered monthly SSI benefits averaging $411. Of these, 6.5 million received monthly Federal SSI payments averaging $381, and 2.4 million received monthly State supplementation payments averaging $128.        B. SSI LEGISLATION SINCE THE 2002 ANNUAL REPORT       Since the 2002 SSI Annual Report was transmitted to the President and Congress on May 30, 2002, there have been no legislative changes enacted that would have a significant effect on Federal expenditures made under the SSI program.       C. CURRENT ISSUES FACING THE SSI PROGRAM       For several years, the current issues section of this report has noted that the stewardship and integrity of the SSI program are primary issues confronting SSA in its responsibility for administering the program. While stewardship and program integrity remain major issues facing SSI in 2003, progress has been made toward achieving an immediate objective of President Bush's Management Plan to reduce erroneous SSI payments, a goal that SSA fully supports. SSA has a number of ongoing initiatives designed to prevent, identify, and correct erroneous payments, and continues to seek additional ways to protect the integrity of the SSI program. In last year's report, virtually this entire current issues section described SSA's program integrity challenges and successes, and the Corrective Action Plan to improve SSA's administration of the SSI program.       Since last year's report, SSA has implemented a number of initiatives in the Corrective Action Plan. For example, pilot projects have begun in the areas of birth and death on-line verification, monthly wage reporting using touch-tone and voice recognition technology, proof of identity to deter fraud in the disability process, and the use of credit bureau and other public database information to detect unreported income and resources. SSA made a number of enhancements in the area of debt collection including the implementation of automated netting of SSI overpayments and underpayments and the use of credit bureaus and tax refund offsets. Additionally, in order to measure progress of its program integrity initiatives, SSA has developed a new quality assurance system, which will provide SSI program managers with timely data to facilitate quality and accuracy.        The ongoing initiatives and the Corrective Action Plan have paid off. In January 2003, the General Accounting Office (GAO) took the SSI program off its list of programs at high risk for abuse, mismanagement, and overpayment. GAO stated that ""SSA has made sufficient progress in improving the financial integrity and management to warrant removing its high-risk designation."" GAO went on to say, however, that ""sustained management attention is necessary to improve SSI program integrity"" and that ""SSA also has not addressed a key program vulnerability--program complexity--that is associated with SSI overpayments.""       Included in the President's Fiscal Year 2004 Budget are several SSI proposals that would address program integrity and simplification. One provision in the President's Budget would require SSA to review 50 percent of all SSI disability and blindness allowance decisions made for individuals age 18 or older. The reviews, which are virtually the same as reviews already required in the Social Security program, would be conducted before payments are made. These preeffectuation reviews would make the SSI and Social Security programs more consistent, and further improve integrity in the SSI program through increased monitoring to ensure that only eligible individuals receive benefits.        Additional provisions in the President's Fiscal Year 2004 Budget would eliminate the need for counting small amounts of interest and dividend income and income that is received irregularly or infrequently in the SSI means test or benefit computation. These proposals would eliminate triple counting of certain income under retrospective accounting. The proposals also would provide that most compensation to military personnel be treated as earned rather than unearned income, which would reduce the likelihood of errors in eligibility and benefit determination in these cases. Finally, the proposals would allow more generous disregards and modestly increase benefits to most disabled or blind children or spouses of military personnel.       Provisions in the draft ""Supplemental Security Income Amendments of 2002,"" which was sent to Congress on September 26, 2002, would eliminate the dedicated account requirement, make time-limited resource exclusions uniform at 9 months, and exclude gifts for educational expenses to the same extent grants and scholarships are currently excluded.       Admittedly, in the scope of the SSI program, enactment of these proposals would result in only modest program simplification. However, as part of the Corrective Action Plan, SSA is continuing to analyze proposals relating to the much larger issues of wages and in-kind support and maintenance, two areas often cited as complex and error prone. Intercomponent workgroups overseen by SSA's highest management are working on these issues and plan to have recommendations completed later this year. It is not clear at this point whether the recommendations will include significant legislative or other policy-related proposals.        What has been clear in the larger program simplification effort is the difficulty of reaching consensus on how to achieve the goal of simplification while maintaining benefit adequacy, benefit equity, and program integrity. Over the 29-year life of the SSI program, there have been at least nine major internal and external studies undertaken specifically to determine how best to simplify SSI. Many of the administrative proposals generated by these study groups have been implemented, but none of the legislative recommendations relating to wages or in-kind income have been adopted. The reasons that the agency has not pursued these legislative recommendations for changes in how wages and in-kind income are counted vary according to the specific features of the proposals. However, it can be said generally that each of the proposals would either significantly increase program expenditures or reduce individuals' benefits.       Notwithstanding the inability to achieve significant program simplification in the past, SSA continues to search for ways in which complex policies might be simplified at reasonable cost and without disadvantaging applicants and recipients or sacrificing program integrity. SSA will look for ideas from within and outside the agency, including Social Security field office personnel, the Social Security Advisory Board, Congress, SSI recipients, and advocates for the aged, blind, and disabled. It is recognized that more efficient and effective administration of SSI leads to more public confidence in the program, which makes it easier for eligible aged, blind, and disabled individuals to access the benefits to which they are entitled.       SSA is one of the 18 Federal agencies that are members of the United States Interagency Council on Homelessness. SSA has a long history of providing service to the American public that includes access to the programs it administers by the homeless population. SSA is committed to supporting the President's initiative to end homelessness within 10 years. To this end, SSA's fiscal year 2003 appropriation includes $8 million to conduct outreach to the homeless and other under-served populations. In developing plans for this outreach effort, SSA reviewed the evaluations of significant outreach efforts conducted during the 1990s, and met with leaders of national homeless advocacy organizations and members of the interagency council. SSA plans to prepare a Federal Register notice this summer that announces plans to fund cooperative agreements aimed at reaching potentially eligible homeless individuals. The notice will solicit proposals to help homeless people, including adults, children, and youth with disabilities who have difficulty navigating the disability application process, and will describe agency initiatives including the reduction of disability determination processing times and improvements in service quality.        D. KEY RESULTS FROM THE 25-YEAR FORECASTS       The major findings in the 25-year forecasts prepared for this report are summarized below:        Following small declines in the SSI recipient population in the late 1990s due to the combined impact of Public Law 104-121 and Public Law 104-193, modest growth in the SSI rolls resumed in 2000, and is expected to continue throughout the projection period largely due to the growth in the U.S. population. By 2027, the Federal SSI recipient population is estimated to reach 8.4 million. Expressed as a percentage of the total U.S. population, the number of Federal SSI recipients is projected to grow slightly from 2.18 percent of the population in 2002 to 2.33 percent by 2027.      Federal expenditures for SSI payments in calendar year 2003 are estimated to increase by $1.5 billion to $33.1 billion, an increase of 4.7 percent from 2002 levels. In constant 2003 dollars, SSI program outlays are projected to increase to $42.7 billion in 2027, a real increase of 1.1 percent per year.      Furthermore, when compared to the  Gross Domestic Product (GDP) , Federal SSI expenditures are projected to decline over time, from the current level of 0.30 percent of GDP in 2002 to 0.25 percent of GDP by 2027.                                                                                                                                                         Privacy        Policy  |  Accessibility Policy  |         Linking Policy  |  Site        Map"
GX243-03-11502827	"?  National Clearinghouse on Child Abuse and Neglect Information National Adoption Information Clearinghouse  Gateways to Information: Protecting Children and Strengthening Families  Obtaining Background Information on Your Prospective Adopted Child: A Fact Sheet for Families Why is background information important? In any type of adoption (agency or independent, domestic or intercountry), involving children of any age, it is important to obtain as much thorough and accurate medical, genetic, and social history information as you can about your prospective child. While adoption, like any form of parenting, involves a certain level of risk, background information is useful for the following reasons:  It enables you to make an informed decision about accepting a child. When you have complete and accurate knowledge of a child's needs (medical or emotional) prior to placement, you will be better able to determine if your family is prepared to care for this child. You are also able to consider whether you have the emotional and financial resources to meet any special needs that may be identified for the child. It may enable you to access Federal or State adoption subsidies available for children with special needs. Adoption subsidies (sometimes called adoption assistance) are available for some children with special needs. Not all children will qualify for adoption subsidies. The National Adoption Information Clearinghouse fact sheet on Subsidized Adoption (www.calib.com/naic/ pubs/f_subsid.cfm) is one source for more information. It provides an opportunity for your child to develop an accurate sense of his or her own history. Without accurate information, adopted children may develop unrealistic fantasies about their history or may blame themselves for the separation from their birth families. They may feel disconnected from their past or like a piece of themselves is missing and incomplete. As they grow older, they will also lack information critical to their own childbearing decisions. It provides an opportunity for early diagnosis, treatment, and intervention for developmental problems and conditions. Knowledge of medical problems or genetic predispositions in a child's birth family may help you diagnose and treat conditions more quickly. Knowing whether a child has been tested for a specific disease or condition, and the results of such tests, avoids duplicative testing.        330 C Street, SW, Washington, DC 20447 (888) 251-0075 or (703) 352-3488 naic.acf.hhs.gov naic@calib.com  703.385.3206 (Fax)   Obtaining Background Information: A Fact Sheet for Families  naic.acf.hhs.gov  Where would I find background information about waiting children?  Contact your local agencies and ask about the types of children their agency usually places with adoptive families, the ages of children who generally are available for adoption, and the general backgrounds of the children. There are also many excellent books about adoption that can provide information (see Where can I go for more information? at the end of this fact sheet). Keep in mind that each child is an individual with his or her own potential problems, as well as his or her own strengths, abilities, talents, and charms. Agencies will often share more specific information about each child after your family has completed a home study and expresses an interest in adopting that particular child. The national online photolisting AdoptUSKids (www.adoptuskids.org) provides pictures and general descriptions of children around the country who are waiting for families. Because the descriptions in photolistings are so brief, it is important to understand what might be meant by certain phrases. For example, a description such as ""very active, impulsive, needs a lot of attention and acts out"" may suggest a diagnosis of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder; a child described as ""developmentally delayed"" may be diagnosed with mild to moderate mental retardation. Be alert to any phrases that would indicate what it might be like to live with this particular child. After your home study is completed, talking with the child's caseworker and others who know the child, such as a child's former foster parents or teachers, will give you a more complete sense of a particular child.  What questions should I ask a child's caseworker?  Once your home study is complete and you express an interest in a particular child, you will have an opportunity to talk in-depth with the child's caseworkers and, possibly, others in the child's life. Asking questions and listening carefully to the responses will help you better understand what it would be like to live with that child. The questions you ask and the information you receive will depend to some degree on the child's age. With an infant, the birth parents' health history1, particularly the birth mother's prenatal history, will be most important. With an older child, you will be seeking more comprehensive information (including social, developmental, educational, and mental health histories). If the child has been in foster care, the questions you ask may be much more complex. Keep the following questions in mind when listening to any child's background information:     What would a child with this history believe about him/herself? What would a child with this history believe about parents/caretakers/the world? What types of behaviors should I expect from a child with this history? What special skills, abilities, or resources might be necessary to parent this particular child (e.g., medical knowledge or skills, accessible housing, special cultural or parenting training)?  1  Regulations issued as a result of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act 1996 (HIPAA), which went into effect April 14, 2003, may impact the amount or type of information about birth parents' health information that may be shared by agencies.  March 2003  2   Obtaining Background Information: A Fact Sheet for Families  naic.acf.hhs.gov  Questions Regarding the Child's Medical and Family History    How complete is the social/medical history on the birth family, including extended family? What is missing? Is it possible to get more information? What is the birth family's racial, ethnic, cultural, and religious background? What is the general physical description of the child's birth parents, siblings, and other close relatives? Are there pictures? (Attempt to get pictures of a child's birth parents and relatives whenever possible, because this will enable you to answer the questions frequently asked by adopted children: ""What did my birth parents look like?"" or ""Who do I look like?"") Is there a family history of drug or alcohol abuse? Is there a family history of mental illness or other genetic conditions, or predispositions to diseases such as diabetes or heart disease? What was the age and cause of death of close relatives in the birth family? What is known about the birth parents' developmental history--physically, emotionally, cognitively, including language development? What is known about the educational background of the birth parents and the child's siblings? What are the special skills, abilities, talents, or interests of birth parents and family members? Are there letters, pictures, videotapes, and gifts from the birth family? What was the birth mother's health like during pregnancy, and what was the health of each parent at the time of the child's birth? What prenatal care did the child receive, and what was his or her condition at birth? When did he or she achieve developmental milestones, and have there been any developmental assessments reflecting deviation from typical development? Are there prior medical, dental, psychological, or psychiatric examinations and/or diagnoses for this child? Are there records of any immunizations and/or health care received while the child was in out-of-home care? What is the child's current need for medical, dental, developmental, psychological, or psychiatric care? What is the child's HIV status?                 Questions Regarding the Child's Social and Placement History    Why did the birth parents make an adoption plan for the child, or why was the child removed from his or her birth family? Did the child suffer any physical, sexual, or emotional abuse or neglect? At what point in the child's life did he or she experience these traumas? How often? By whom? How many placements did the child have, and where (e.g., relative placements, foster homes, orphanages, residential treatment facilities, hospitals)? What were the reasons for placements or re-placements? What does the child remember about his or her placements? What does the child believe about why he or she was placed or moved from one placement to another? (The child's belief may or may not be accurate, but it is important to understand a child's perception of his or her placement history.) 3  March 2003   Obtaining Background Information: A Fact Sheet for Families  naic.acf.hhs.gov          Where is the child currently enrolled and what is his or her performance at school? What are the results of any educational testing and are there any special educational needs? Are there significant events (early separations, multiple caretakers, abuse/neglect) in the child's life that could affect his or her capacity to relate to a new family? What are the past and existing relationships in the child's life with people he or she has regularly lived with or visited (e.g., siblings, birth parents, foster parents, orphanage workers, teachers, therapists, nurses)? How has the child responded to visits with these persons in the past? Is future contact planned with any of these persons? How often? Who is responsible for seeing that it happens? What are the child's strengths? What are the child's special interests, talents, and/or hobbies?  You should seek assistance in interpreting this information by speaking with doctors, mental health professionals, education professionals, and parents who have adopted children with similar needs and issues.  Why might all the information not be available?  Complex Family Histories. Social workers in the child welfare system make every effort to collect complete background information about each of the children for whom they are responsible. This often includes positive information about the child and family as well as problems. However, children in foster care often have complex and difficult family histories. They often are older, need to be placed with their brothers and sisters who may also have been removed from their birth family, have experienced trauma, and have experienced frequent moves both while in their family of origin and while in the foster care system. All these factors may make it difficult to obtain a complete background history. Gaps in Recordkeeping. Children in the foster care system may have had many different social workers in various units of the social service system before becoming available for adoption. Recordkeeping may vary, and workers may have moved on. Children may have had multiple foster placements; foster families may no longer work for an agency. Intercountry Adoptions. The only source of information in intercountry adoptions may be the agency, orphanage, and/or adoption facilitator in the country of origin. There may be no (or very limited) information about a child's birth family. Doctors or attorneys who facilitated an adoption may have retired or moved out of the area.  Many children placed internationally may have health and developmental problems, particularly if they were placed at an early age in an institutional setting. Some problems, such as certain vitamin deficiencies and scabies, are unique to children adopted internationally and may depend on the child's country of origin. Other problems, such as learning disabilities and the effects of prenatal alcohol or drug exposure, are similar to those that children in the United States experience. The resource listing Developmental Assessments for International Adoptees (naic.acf.hhs.gov/pubs/r_devev.cfm) has helpful information about where to have development assessed.  March 2003  4   Obtaining Background Information: A Fact Sheet for Families  naic.acf.hhs.gov  Limitations in Knowledge. Agencies, social workers, and intermediaries cannot disclose what they do not know. For example, children who have been abused may not feel comfortable telling anyone about the abuse until they are in a safe, stable environment. Indeed, an adoptive parent may be the very first person a child feels comfortable talking to about an incident of abuse.  What should I do if some or all of the information is not available?  In domestic agency adoptions the family can ask the agency to try to contact the child's birth family (or others in the child's life) for additional information. Former foster parents can sometimes be the best source of information regarding an older child. The National Adoption Information Clearinghouse has a listing of adoption statutes related to access to identifying and nonidentifying information in each State (naic.acf.hhs.gov/ laws/index.cfm). In any case, it is important to be honest with your child regarding what you know about his or her birth family and background information. How that information is shared with a child will depend on the family and the child's developmental level. The National Adoption Information Clearinghouse fact sheet Explaining Adoption to Your Children, Family and Friends (naic.acf.hhs.gov/pubs/f_explaining.cfm) has additional information. INTERNET RESOURCES National Resource Center for Special Needs Adoption Back issues of their newsletter, The Roundtable (www.nrcadoption.org/roundtable.html), can be obtained through the Web site. This publication regularly has articles relating to children who have been adopted from foster care. Volume 10, #1 has an article for social workers by Kay Donley Ziegler regarding sharing children's background information (disclosure). National Adoption Information Clearinghouse's Statutes-at-a-Glance The Statutes-at-a-Glance (naic.acf.hhs.gov/laws/index.cfm) series highlights specific topics and provides a quick overview and comparison of legal requirements across the States.
