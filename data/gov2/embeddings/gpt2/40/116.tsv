GX062-07-10022605	SEVENTH MEETING  Thursday, October 17, 2002  Welcome and Opening Remarks     CHAIRMAN KASS:   Well, welcome to Council         members, guests, members of the public to this, the seventh meeting of         the President's Council on Bioethics.                I note the presence of Dean Clancy, the         designated federal officer whose presence makes this a legal meeting.                I would like to announce that we have at long         last added a lawyer to our staff.  Carter Snead from Ropes & Gray         will be joining us starting in two weeks.  He will be at the meeting         tomorrow.  I will introduce him at that time.                I would also like to announce that we now have         at headquarters a members' office so that should you find yourself in         town and need a place to sit and work and also to interact with our         lively staff, there is a special office set aside fully equipped for         your use.                Our cloning report in final version has been         produced by the Government Printing Office and Public Affairs has         produced the commercial version, copies of which are at your seats.                We have discussions of the report set up in the         months ahead, and I know others of you are talking to Diane about         arranging things on your campuses.                There will be a book forum at the American         Enterprise Institute on the 29th of this month; a session in Baltimore         sponsored by the law school of the University of Maryland and Johns         Hopkins University on the 21st of November; and there are conversations         underway at Georgetown, Princeton, and Chicago for further meetings.                Our next meeting is December 12 and 13 where we         will have what's definite for that meeting is a presentation on the         use of Ritalin and other stimulants in children; a couple of         presentations on aging and longevity research; and Francis Collins of         the Human Genome Project will be talking about uses of genetic         technologies and the prospects for enhancement.                I would also, since as everybody knows this         Council is charged with the monitoring of stem cell research, I would         at least like at this point to make a very brief presentation, an         update on the subject of the monitoring.                As I think everybody knows, since August 9th of         2001, federal funding has been available for research on embryonic stem         cells subject to the particular restrictions announced by the President         at that time.  The implementation of that policy which has fallen to         NIH has yielded the following information for us.                There is a registry of cell derivations that         meet the original criteria and the NIH has identified –  78 cell         derivations that meet the original criteria.                The NIH has reviewed 13 grant applications         involving human embryonic stem cells at its May 2000 Advisory Council         session and 19 grant applications for its October 2002 Advisory Council         sessions, and continues to receive applications each receipt date.                The NIH has also made available infrastructure         grants to help developers defray the costs of providing cell lines,         administrative supplements to encourage expansion of existing projects         to produce preliminary data of human cells, and investigator initiated         grant awards.                And so far the NIH has granted seven, 37, and         eight awards in these respective categories.                Also, six of the NIH intramural labs are         conducting research on human embryonic stem cells, and cumulatively         there are over 45 researchers representing over 40 different research         institutions receiving federal funds for research on human embryonic         stem cells.                The NIH has also finalized four material         transfer agreements with the commercial companies that have developed         these lines.  They are Y Cell, the ESL International, BresaGen,         Inc., and the University of California, San Francisco,         associated with Geron.                Data on how many of these lines are presently         available to be shipped is, however, not easy to get.  At present three         developers have lines available for shipment totaling five different         cell lines.          Finally, I'd like to mention one recent         development that I think is pertinent to our ongoing deliberations.          Since the last meeting, researchers at the National University of         Singapore funded by ESL have announced the successful culture of human         cells on human feeder cell lines.                This is a newly derived cell line, and         therefore under current policy, federal funding could not be used to do         research with it.  All of the lines that are in the NIH registry were         supported on animal feeder cells so that should human trials be         required, these cells would at least at the moment not be available for         use under the xenotransplantation regulations.                This new development, I think, will probably be         important for us as the pressure might mount for work on these new         lines that are potentially usable in clinical trials.                That just by way of an update.  Staff is         working ahead on the monitoring of stem cells, and after the beginning         of next year, we will have more to do with that at our regular         meetings.                Questions or comments on that?                (No response.)                CHAIRMAN KASS:   Well, the two sessions that         we have planned for this morning are on the topic of choosing the sex         of children, the discussion of current technology and practice, and         then a look at the demographics.

Review Action Items ~                                 Follow up from last meeting’s action items are covered under the         following headings: Center Operation, Quality Management, Projects and         Other.                         II. Center Operation ~                           Sunny shared with Team the ""12 Steps to Keeping Your Job""           hand out as a resource for Center Customers. She requested that the           Team review the handout. The Team made recommendations for changes.                                     Action:  Sunny make changes and e-mail Team final draft copy.                           Resource Specialist Coverage – ESD and WDC will share the coverage           of the Wednesday afternoon gaps for the time being. RS coverage by ESD           (Noon-1:00) and WDC (1:00-2:30).                           Job Hunter Series – Tammy reported that Job Hunter Series           facilitator copies are still on order. The decision about mandatory           attendance of CPP is not yet decided. Implementation date is set for           April 1 st .                           The Team had a conversation about overcoming challenges to           accommodating large numbers of workshop attendees in the hands-on           components of the curriculum.                           In developing a workshop curriculum for the Center, we have a quality         standard which requires a hands-on/interactive component.           L Questions:                                     Does the Job Hunter Series provide customers with opportunities for           hands on participation and what will it look like?           Can the series be broken down into parts?           If there’s a lab component in the series, how will we make the           accommodations when there are 18 computers available?           How much knowledge would a Center Intern need to proctor lab? Do           they need to know content information or just software navigation?                           L   Suggestions:                           Discussion about having two mechanisms to deliver the job hunter           series - demonstration by PowerPoint and hands-on lab usage.           The facilitator could have 1 group in the lab while the 2 nd            group takes a break (groups will alternate in the lab).           Show customers how to navigate through the series by PowerPoint and           provide options to use the lab for further exploration (Center intern           can proctor).                           Further discussion when the Team gets copy of the series for review.                     Action Pending:  Tammy provide members the facilitators handbook         for Job Hunter.                           Volunteer Issues - Gary reported that he would check with Dan Vogel           for legalities around having a community volunteer at the Center.                                     Action:  Gary checks with Dan.                     Action:  Erika provide Gary with draft job description for a         Resource Lobby support volunteer by Wednesday, 2/6.           Gary reported on the behalf of Susan Parker and Angela about getting         an Intern for the Center. The follow up action was a dead end and there         was no outcome. Angela may possibly have another contact from Western         for a work-study student. This would provide some potential advantages         over a volunteer.  Action:  Angela will follow up with new lead.                                       Lab software / New PC’s - The Team was asked to make a list of             recommendations for software that we wan on the lab’s new PC’s.             Team’s recommendation to keep:                                     MS office Suite (Word, Excel, Access & Power Point),           MS Explorer,           Note Pad,           Choices CT,  (there may be a move within ESD to stop using Choices           as a cost saving measure)                     WOIS           ORCA  (may be combined with WILMA in new, multi-state LMI program           now in development)                     Keyboard Trainer & tutorials (Excel & Access).                                       Allied Health PowerPoint Presentation - Gary introduced Christina             Benjamin an Intern from BTC. Christina is working on a PowerPoint             presentation for Allied Health. The recruitment presentation will             provide information about various healthcare fields, salary,             education, physical demand, etc… The completion date for the             project is end of February.                                                 All Staff Training – Tammy and Erika will provide training on             the ""Go2UI.com"" website on February 27 from 4-5. The CUT             forum moved to March 27 from 4:00-5:00.                                   III. Quality Management ~                                       Application Scoring - Gary followed up with the Certification Team           at our Team’s request for clarifications regarding the application           scoring system. They responded and provided an explanation of the           numeric rating – Whatcom’s app scored in the highest quartile,           thereby making it eligible for a site review. They reiterated the CUT           focus on the scoring sheet’s written comments and those           recommendations from the technical writing report to help better           understand the areas of improvement rather than to concentrate on the           application’s numeric scoring.                                               Begin Introduction to Resource Specialist Training Module – A             subgroup of the Training Team was developed to look at a strategy             for identifying module pieces for RS training. Team consisted of             Kathy K, Ronnie Sue and Gary S. Once the training strategies are             identified, the three Centers (Oak Harbor, Skagit & Whatcom)             will divide up content development for the training modules. Whatcom             is already providing training opportunities for Resource Specialists             – All Staff mtg. IT training, problem solving, etc.                                                 Baldrige Learning - As part of human resource development in             assisting staff to better understand the Baldrige quality standards,             staff in Skagit County are providing a ""readiness to             engage"" learning opportunity. The first training will be on             February 14 on all 7 quality standards as a whole system, followed             by a weekly training on one quality standard.                                                             Action:  All CUT members to share information about the           excellent Baldrige-based quality training opportunity for current and           new staff members within their offices/organizations.                                     To reinforce the quality standards, WDC has reorganized their agenda           items around Baldridge criteria. Each item is categorized under one of           the 7 quality standards. Facilitators and staff have an opportunity to           arrange the agenda according to they see fit. The activity helps staff           see that connection between their daily work and how it’s the           quality standards. A sample staff meeting agenda was distributed           demonstrating how agenda topics are organized within the seven           Baldrige criteria.                                                 Mystery Shopper - WA State is looking at customer satisfaction             levels through a mystery shopper evaluation. ESD is leading the             effort. The evaluation will review services from the customers’             perspective (Job seekers/Business customers). They will be using             different measurements i.e. how many rings before pick up, how long             it takes to return calls, etc. The mystery shopper evaluation is a             quality management tool used in researching information and             collecting data, not for singling out staff doing a less than             quality job.                                     WDC 2002 Action Plan - Workforce Development Board is responsible           for governance and oversight of the workforce development system.

To do: develop a more comprehensive overarching schedule that includes all       the work—not just reports.                                  We had a       conversation regarding limited participation in          CQI          meetings.          Noted that at                  Mount Vernon                  meetings our agenda is to       review data and make decisions, but the attendance is continually low.                                  2.              Report       Format  — we need       to develop a template for the QAC report.          Noted that QAC reports need to be completed and mailed one week       prior to the meeting (necessary for review).                                  It was       thought that we could use the Leadership team format:                          1. Actions needing your attention (give us what we need)                         2. Narrative on above                         3. Things we accomplished (this might not be of value for our       audience)                            The team       reports to three groups now: Leadership, DAIT and QAC.          The “What we want to happen” statements are different for all       three groups.                                 For the       report to the Quality Assurance Committee we need to move away from our       focus on process.    QAC will       want one-liners with a description of what this means. When we fix a       problem it will be important to note how this was done and how it may       apply to something else.    We       will need to note systematic things (political thing for the council to       take action on… write a letter to someone e.g.)                                 Some good       ideas for our reports:                          1 st        – what we continue to monitor—these are the high performing. (Doing       well as measured by comment cards, DOL.. (data sources)                          2 nd       –  things we are watching closely or taking action on (non –high       performers).                            3 rd        - action requested from another group/team.                                  At the       top in the narrative include the data reviewed during the time period.          Give information in relation to a longitudinal comparison.          This is a clear directive from QAC — trend line is wanted in       context.                            Tag on       the most recent data compared to the aggregate of previous data       —outlining what that means.    Referenced       Mike’s report out at last DAIT—this would shape our third Thursday       meetings re: how we look at data.           “Data reviewed this period was… here are our findings on it”.                                  NOTE:          Our comment cards continue to be our real time measures of customer       satisfaction.    Think it’s       important that annually we do a direct correlation of the results of the 3       ASC Q’s on our comment cards with the ACSI survey — we think comment       card data is valid and not a biased sample.          Our results compared to their results.          Noted ACSI is on the web — we all need to access this       information.    Alex       recommendation above.                            Brian       pointed out that an exit survey comparison (validating comment cards)       should be done and analyzed annually.          The team agreed to do an Exit Survey.          It is scheduled for:                         Whidbey:    Tuesday       October 14(?)                         Staffed by: Don, Malinda, Kathy H.                                  Summary:       our reports are to be tight, small, to the point.          All our customers what information in this format — “just give       it to me”.    The report IS the       summary.                            Noted       that there is a fair amount of data out there—manage this prior to       creating more data.                            3.              Draft Leadership       Report.                         This will       be covered at our next meeting.                                 4.              Mystery Shopper                                   Review Latest                                   Draft Follow Up Form Response                                   Continue Discussion from              5/15/03                                                     The       results from this last quarter show low ratings in telephone shops.          It was noted that other WDAs are performing high although they also       have low samples.    We cannot       disregard data because we have low samples.          It was noted that Gay is coming back with the specific report on       our sample shops.    For the last       quarter there was one in-person and two telephone shops.

As you leave be really, really careful. Your representation at the Park City Council of Councils was appreciated. We have received training and new ideas and still have a lot to do to build and present ourselves. There are issues to target and decisions of what to do about them. In the mean time, let’s focus on the Mystery Shopper activity which permits us to give feedback to DWS and DWS to educate us on the available services.   OUTSTANDING CUSTOMER SERVICE RECOGNITION - Kevin Crandall                           1. Kent Gygi                           Going extra mile for all customers; giving quality    service. Example was displayed during lunch today - he bought Judy Bell a Diet    Coke today so she could have a diet drink with her lunch!     Employers request him often for writing job orders, recruiting             and other needs they may have.                                 2. Sherami Jara                           Has the ability of putting people at ease with her    exceptional customer service.     She was involved with coordinating a customer conference where             customers gave feedback on what made them comfortable when applying             for services, etc.                                         MYSTERY SHOPPER UPDATE/ASSIGNMENTS - Bill Snow                           1. The Pilot Project has been completed and positive as well as         negative feedback has been gathered and reported.           2. The objectives which were feedback concerning DWS services to the         Employment Centers and education about DWS (services, pathways,         processes) for the Regional Council were met.           3. The Mystery Shopper program will continue.                           Two Mystery Shopper visits will be made to each    Employment Center bi-monthly.     Completed by January 24, 2002     American Fork: Jack Trent     Heber/Park City: Christie Hulet will send two Micron    staff members     Payson: Gary Ashby     Provo Employment Center: Kevin Crandall     Use the telephone as a job seeker for part of the    mystery shopping. This would be helpful since the telephone referrals at the    Provo Employment Center have tripled, and it would be good to review the    service being given.     Rate only the categories that are applicable.     Use the Mountainland Mystery Shopper Survey to gather                 feedback. A written summary is also acceptable.                                                             4. Mystery Shoppers will present findings at each full Council         meeting.           5. The Executive Council members will discuss and evaluate each of         the surveys before releasing the data to the Region Management Team.           6. The Regional Council Executive Committee will finalize the         report(s) and present the information in Mountainland Region Management         Team meeting.           7. Individual Center data will be shared with the Employment Center         manager.           8. Individual Center data will not be shared with other Centers.           9. Based on the scores received, Centers may receive a grade, A or B,         but competition has been removed; thus, the original traveling trophy         and celebration is eliminated.                   CUSTOMER SIMULATION EXERCISE -  Hour                           1. Each Council member will be given a scenario and assigned to an         employment counselor who will be expecting them.                           It will be necessary to give a social security    number, but the information you give for the Form 61 is not trackable, etc.     The information (name, SS#, address, etc.) will be    entered into the computer, but can be made inactive.     Scenarios     #1 Kevin Crandall (Shane Jorgenson)     #3 Christie Hulett (Jenny Nisonger)     #4 Rickie Bryant (Bret Pope)     #5 Ron Tiffany (Veterans)     #7 Judy Bell (Michelle Viertel)     #8 Rod Crockett (Colleen Cowden)     #9 Duane Frisby (Susan Rogers)     #10 Jack Trent (Sarianna Kay)     #12 Larry Ellertson (David Matkin)     #13 Gary Ashby (Jason Miller)                                                             2. Begin at the Information Desk. Give the Information Specialist the         scenario information and follow the pathway as directed.           3. There are four types of services.                           Core     Intensive     Training     Support                                 4. Go to the Information Desk and present the reason you are at the         Center today to the Information Specialist. Follow the instructions and         pathway as directed.           5. As you proceed, ask these questions to yourself: What services         were offered? Was it easy to access these services?           6. If you find something while shopping, make a recommendation(s) to         managers.                           It is important to have staff up on newspaper    articles as to the jobs available. Customers come to DWS wanting information    on job ads such as the one hiring air marshals. There was no information to be    had about this ad. Some information is being shared. Sometimes there is no    information, even after several inquiring phone calls.     Services may be labeled alphabetical, but as a shopper be             careful in judging the information given as the official title may             not be used, but the same information may be given under different             terms.                                 7. After following the ""customer"" scenario, complete the         Mountainland Mystery Shopper Survey and give to Julie.           8. Julie and Bill will rate A or B and report to the Regional         Council.           9. The Mystery Shopper feedback will then be reported in Region         Management Meeting.           10. TANF RAINY UPDATE/PACMIS PROPOSAL - Dave Ostrom                           1. The PACMIS Gap Analysis of October 9, 2001, was performed by         Information Technology International.                           The purpose was to determine whether PACMIS (Public    Assistance Case Management Information System) adequately meets the    eligibility-related business needs of Department of Human Services, DWS and    Department of Health.     Based on the report findings, PACMIS is only meeting    52% of business needs. It only does what we tell it to do. It does not support    looking at other programs. It is now a support system, but a decision making    system is needed.     Recommendations were to replace PACMIS.                                 2. PACMIS is a project costing approximately 20 million dollars and         does have an impact on TANF dollars. Shortfalls caused money shifts.         There are programs that are not being worked on or utilized which would         allow monies. The Adult Literacy program has given $117,000 for the         ""new"" PACMIS.                           Concern: How will the programs giving up money be    impacted? It seems unfair - people versus program.     Answer: PACMIS will utilize information and give assistance to             people more accurately and readily; thus, the people really are             served better.                                 3. PACMIS will come from partnering with other states who want to         implement, some product will be purchased and some will be developed on         our own. TANF surplus funds will be paying for this.                           The expense to enhance the current PACMIS system was    proposed at 2.6 million. The decision was to put this amount into the pot to    building a new system.     Projects in session have money to fund them.     $400,000 is being used to begin the new PACMIS    system.     #42 Education and Training Software-Mtland $183,000     #43 Grant to Fund Literacy Program-Mtland $40,000     #44 Discretionary Services, Family Issues-Mtland $200,000                                                             4. MOTION by Ron Tiffany for approval.                           Rod Crockett seconded the motion.     The voting was unanimous.         PROPOSAL for OREM EMPLOYMENT CENTER AND REGIONAL ADMINISTRATION OFFICE -     John Talcott                       1. Justification                           Consistency of Services     Convenience to Customers     Improved Customer Service     Employment Center Design     Consolidation of Offices eliminating duplication of offices in             the same city.                                 2. Approximate cost for the above building: $460,000. This amount         would come from the operating budget. There would be no additional cost         to the State. The on-going costs a year would be $247,000. Other         agencies will rent the currently DWS Region occupied 3rd and 4th floor         spaces at 150 E Center which will pay the State so tax payers are not         getting hit. Agencies are already showing a great interest as to when         DWS will vacate and what properties (desks, chairs, etc.) will remain.           3. Floor space would be 16,500 square feet which is 11,000 square         feet less than what the Region now occupies. However, a lot of the         27,500 square feet we now pay for, is wasted space. The Region does not         facilitate the kind of service DWS gives. The Region would be housed in         the same building, but would be separate from the Employment Center.           4. Central north Orem is the location in mind, but the specific         property has not been selected. There is a glut of office space for rent         in Orem. There will be O&N included on the rent on the new facility.         Fifteen dollars ($15.00), which is a ball park figure includes O&N.           5. It is desired to have the contract secured in the next four to six         months, but the Council’s support is needed by way of vote before this         proposal can be taken to the building utilization committee. This is         early in the process, but it takes a long time to complete the necessary         steps.           6. MOTION by Jack Trent to accept the proposal for an Orem Employment         Center and Regional Administration Office. John forward on to DFCM.                           Seconded by Gary Ashby     A unanimous vote from the 8 Council Members present    was received.     4 additional votes will be taken by telephone calls to the             Council members not present to vote. A total of 12 votes are needed             to have a valid count. Report at the January 24, 2002                                 7. Concern: Will there be money left for failure of equipment and         etc.? Computer recycles will not be impacted.           8. Next Steps (Depending on result telephone calls to voting Council         Members.)                           Present proposal to the building utilization    committee.     Make recommendation to the Senior Management Team,    pending approval to proceed.     Get with the facility planner of DFC - work on RFP,    select site.     Develop floor plans     Have the proposal hit the paper by February, 2002.     If DWS has the money to pay for the building, DFCM will give             the approval.     COUNCIL CONCERNS - None expressed.   DATE OF NEXT MEETINGS                       January 24, 2002 - Location TBA     No meetings in February, 2002.

About                        SAC                        The Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary Advisory Council                        was established by Federal law to assure continued public                        participation in the management of the Sanctuary. Since                        its establishment in March 1994, the Council has played                        a vital role in the decisions affecting the Sanctuary along                        the central California Coast. The Council's nineteen voting                        members represent a variety of local user groups, as well                        as the general public, plus seven local, state and federal                        governmental jurisdictions. In addition, the respective                        managers for the four California National Marine Sanctuaries                        (Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary, Cordell Bank                        National Marine Sanctuary, Gulf of the Farallones National                        Marine Sanctuary, and the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary)                        and the Elkhorn Slough National Estuarine Research Reserve                        sit as non-voting members. Members are appointed competitively                        by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and                        serve three-year terms. The Council meets bi-monthly in                        open sessions located throughout the 360-mile boundary of                        the Sanctuary.                           The                          Council maintains a firm commitment to the goals and objectives                          of the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary Program.                          The Council appreciates the efforts of volunteers, non-profit                          organizations, businesses, and citizens, without whose                          support the mission of the Sanctuary would be difficult                          to realize.                                                                                                                                                                                             National                  Marine Sanctuaries  |  National                  Ocean Service  |  National Oceanic                  and Atmospheric Administration                   U.S. Department of Commerce                   |  NOAA Library                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               For                  Website comments/questions, contact the  MBNMS                  Webmaster .

Comments and changes were captured on the draft form of the Leadership       Team’s Report and forwarded to Kathy K. for revision.          It was decided that we would drop the customer survey and ASCI fees       for consideration, that we would request the above, and summarize our       completed actions.                                               Mystery           Shopper Results                                         The full report was not       available to         CQI        at this meeting.    Don agreed to       summarize the material and e-mail this to team members.          The goal is to make the information available to staff, summarizing       both the key points and types of questions so that staff can better serve       all customers.                                             Comment           Card Results Display                                         The team agreed to       display the results of the following to customers in resource areas:         1.              Staff provides consistent information.         2.              I got my questions answered.         3.              Overall Satisfaction.         4.              The services met my expectation.                          The team also noted       that the following needs to be addressed: That the information needs to be       presented in a consistent format and that we need to develop protocols for       displaying the information.    We       would like to see each question in bar graph form with an eye-catching,       “punchy” heading.    Also,       the comment card boxes should be located next to the results display thus       encouraging customers to continue providing feedback.                       Note:       Change in date of next          CQI          meeting.

GX034-82-4331219	Regional       CQI Team Notes                July 17, 2003                       Present:    Kathy K.,         Malinda        , Don, Gary, Kathy H., Jim & Mike                       I.          Data Review                         The Team reviewed job seeker       and business comment card, ASCI and Mystery Shopper data available at this       time.    The following       observations were observed:         ·                E-card ratings continue to have lower scores than hard copy       cards.    The number of E-cards       submitted is up and even though they generally generate lower scores, our       total (overall) scores are up.           ·                Data for 2 nd  quarter 2003 for the “How are we       doing?” questions is even or increased from the four quarter average for       all questions.           ·                On business comment cards questions “Need Met” and       “Services Meet Ideal” continue to get the lowest scores for all       questions.    Seven out of ten       questions showed a better or equal score compared to the four quarter       average.           Mystery Shopper data continues to be a struggle for us to know what to       do with.    A meeting is in the       planning with Mystery Shopper administrative staff to talk about how the       Mystery Shopper data compares to local CQI data.          That meeting was originally scheduled locally (our WDA) and we were       to attend, but the meeting has been elevated to the Regional level so we       will not all likely be attending.                         Business Customer       Data                          The Team spent some time       talking about business customer data and the WDA’s current emphasis       toward our business customer ( strategic       goal #4 ).                   Gary                reviewed some of the long standing information we know about our business       customers ( prefer single point of       contact, need well screened applicants, our programs & requirements       are confusing, too much paperwork, emphasis is on our needs rather than       business need, etc ).    At       our last meeting in finishing up on the Problem Resolution Grid we       identified several potential key process related to business customer       which could be addressed.    The       Team also talked about needing more business data from our partners and       placing at least as much emphasis on business data as job seeker data.                 Leadership Report                         The Team spent time       discussing the Leadership (and QAC) report and outlining the points of the       report which Don will draft.    The       narrative of the report will include the information that the                 CQI        Team        is focusing on business customer satisfaction.          We’ve looked at several data sets and have historical data ( local       business card data, ACSI, Whidbey survey and national info                  Gary                  referred to and mentioned above )       and have a fairly solid understanding of the general areas business       customers find our system lacking.    In       comparing business, job seeker and training customers the ASCI data tells       us that business customers rate us lowest of the three customer groups.          The                 CQI        Team        understands that the current emphasis on focusing on business customers       not only is valid from a data standpoint, but connects to our WDA       strategic goals.    The                 CQI        Team        feels a need to connect to more business customer information, possibly       from local partners and obtain a more detailed focus.          The Team will be looking at ASCI business data in more detail to       try and obtain a more detailed focus, but needs help connecting to more       data (we don’t know what we don’t have).          The                 CQI        Team        is headed toward recommending a key process analysis to help achieve this       strategic goal.    A key process       analysis is a large undertaking and we recommend that a new work team be       established to undertake the analysis and make recommendations with the       assistance of the                 CQI        Team        .    The key process the         CQI        is considering recommending is the level of screening and evaluation on       job orders.    The                 CQI        Team        is interested in feedback from the Leadership Team on our potential       recommendations.                       Other                         The       Whidbey exit interview is scheduled for August 14 th . Kathy K.       is working with the Whidbey Center Use team already to develop a customer       survey for that center.    She       will ask the Whidbey Center Use Team if we can add our exit survey to       their questions. We crafted 2 questions that will also be added.          Kathy H. will forward a draft of the entire survey when it is       ready. We will also conduct the same survey at WorkSource Whatcom sometime       in September.    Kathy H. will       staff both exit survey days.                              Review of both the job       seeker and business comment card is scheduled for the next meeting, but we       couldn’t keep from talking about this subject to some degree.          Brief discussions took place on adding a question related to “Are       you disabled?” on the job seeker card and that lead to a discussion       about adding other demographic questions to the card.          With respect to the business card it was suggested that the card be       changed to have the same rating scale as the job seeker card for       uniformity.                           Next       Agenda’s (        Malinda        is facilitator and Mike is scribe, but Mike will be on vacation ).

GX036-67-7510850	Whidbey                   Center                  Use       Team                 February       18, 2003                                         Members Present: Jonette, Bob, Shannon, Kathy, Joyce,       Sharleen, Terri, Brian Guest: Gary Smith (WorkSource Whatcom).                          Agenda:         1.              Customer Comment Card Review.         2.              Vision and Values Review.         3.              Overview of WTS Membership System.         4.              Business Survey.         5.                             WorkSource                Whidbey-                Center                Issues                   Follow-Up           Reports:                    .               Membership card update.         .               Website update.         .               Job fair update.         .               Snohomish WS PowerPoint for Business Services.         ·                New Web Update Article.         ·                Press Releases Completed for this period.         ·                New Center Issues.         ·                New WorkSource Activities.         ·                CQI Calendar Check         6.              Action Plan- Self Assessment         ·                Strategic planning- Identify Improvement Strategies         7.              Other         8.              Build Next Agenda – March 4                   1)             Customer Comment       Card Update :         Kathy and Shannon are re-organizing the data for       presentation at the next CUT meeting on March 18 th .         Action :       Kathy and Shannon will bring information to March 18 th  CUT       meeting.                2)             Vision and Values       Review :         Brian will present at the March 18 th        meeting. This will be training for goals, visions, and values of the       partnership.         Action :       Brian will bring for a future meeting.                3)             WTS Membership       System :         Gary Smith provided an overview of the new membership       system that will be in effect starting Feb. 27 th  in                 Oak                Harbor                (The new computers will be changed out on Feb 25 th  and 26 th ).       The new membership system ensures compliance with the state wide system       which will enable a more comprehensive and usable database that will tell       us who our customers are and what services they are utilizing.                New forms : WorkSource Whatcom initiated a new       form that captures the information needed for SKIES. WorkSource Whidbey       will begin utilizing this form on Feb. 27 th  for all new       membership cards. The information will be collected and entered into SKIES       by Joyce or Bob. The new form allows us to record the jobs that people are       getting and helps our UI customers get credit for job search.           Do not refer to the new membership system as “swipe       card” or “tracking” system. WorkSource Whatcom staff have found that       membership system has a more positive connotation and it makes customers       feel as though they are a part of our system.                If a customer refuses to provide their social       security number, we can provide an alternate form of their membership       number. The formula is as follows:         1)             WDA Numeric identifier (i.e. Northwest = 3)         2)             First two characters of the last name         3)             First two characters of the first name         4)             Birth month (2-digit format)         5)             Birthday (2 digit format)         6)             Gender (M/F)         When/If duplicates occur, append a single digit       number (1-9) at the end.         It is imperative that we encourage customers to       protect their card as their social security number is embedded into the       magnetic strip on the back. While we can provide them a new card there are       machines that can access this information.         Center staff need to double check the daily list of       activities to ensure that all activities for that day are listed on the       sign-in kiosk. This is important for proper tracking of activity       participation.         The new touch screen kiosk is sensitive to touch and       we need to remind customers to use their fingernail or the corner of their       card when they are selecting daily activities.         When making membership cards staff need to capitalize       first and last names so that the database is uniform.         4)             Business Survey :           Bob will       distribute updated version (via e-mail) for discussion at next CUT       meeting.         Action :       Bob will bring updated survey for March 18 th  meeting.                5)             WorkSource Whidbey       – Center Issues :         ·                Website update :         Joe Hudon had created a separate website as       a link to WorkSource Whidbey’s calendar of events. The decision has been       made to cancel this site (sponsored by Tri-pod) and create a link from the       go2worksource website.         Action :       Kathy will work with partnership webmaster to create for Whidbey a site       similar to Whatcom. Kathy will contact webmaster to establish link to new       website. Kathy will let Jonette know when the site is operational and       Jonette will cancel tri-pod site.                 ·                Job Fair update :         The job fair       will be held on         May 22, 2        0                0        3        . Literature for the fair will go out next month. We have invited the Navy       Transition Assistance Office to be listed as a community partner. Emily       Wetzel will let us know about this at a later date. All job fair material       will go out on NWDC letterhead.                ·                Snohomish Power Point       Presentation for Businesses :         Bob is       re-designing and will present during March 18 th  meeting.         Action :       Bob will review and present at the March 18 th  meeting.                ·                New Web Update       Article :         Website       article for March - new lobby upgrade.

They will be       announcing the workshops once a week throughout March.                ·                Center Issues:         Recent       vandalism has prompted the landlord to post “no trespassing” signs       along both the front and back of our building. After these signs are       posted, we will be able to call the police to have loiterers removed       and/or prosecuted for acts of vandalism to the building.                ·                Mystery Shopper       Results:                         Mystery       shopper results from last year were presented for review.

Additional Data Sources.                         Kathy       K handed out three surveys as additional data that the team needs to       analyze for our region.    All       three are from the Washington State Workforce Training and Education       Coordinating Board:                          1. “Employers’ Workforce Training Needs and       Practices 2         0                 0         2”                          2. “Workforce Training Results 2         0                 0         2”                          3. “WorkSource Performance Indicators: First Annual       Report”                         The       report on performance measures is to provide a base line for common       measures. The team began to review, but will return to this data at our       next meeting.                             The       work of our team is to find any and all data during this time period so we       can triangulate the results. The information in the Training Results       survey found us asking more questions:                                    What           does the              CQI              team need to           do?                                   Are           there unmet needs?                                   Who           would we report this information to?                                   Can           we get subsets of information around specific Community and                          Technical                           Colleges                          attendance           and both Adults and Dislocated Workers                                         ACTION: Kathy K       to find the original of the 3 rd  report on Performance Measures       and get out to the team (only the front sides had been copied).                         ACTION: Kathy H       will find out from the Coordinating Board if subsets if data exist or can       be made available.                                 4.       Comment Card Low Performance Areas Identified.                         The team reviewed the       comment card results and determined that we should start focusing on:       “comparison to the ideal” and “services met expectation.”          The team will begin developing strategies for improvement at the       next meeting.                                 5.          Data and System Enhancements                         Gay       came into our meeting and reiterated the need for the team to continually       look at other data and how it can best be used to enhance our system.          Gay has asked the team to elevate the Mystery Shopper data to the       same level of importance as the Comment Card Data.          The third quarter of data will soon be available so that the team       can begin looking at trends.                                 There       are questions for the team:                                    How           does the Mystery Shopper data fit into              CQI             ?                                    If           negative trends are showing up, what actions will this team take?                                   How           do you reward those individuals with exemplary customer service (5)?                                   What           actions are to be taken with individuals with poor or unacceptable           customer service (2 & 1)?                                   The           team needs to get a list of who has attended the Magical Moments           Training (Customer Service).    If           a person with a poor rating has not attended this training, what           recourse does the Manager/Supervisor have? How would they get           scheduled for this training?                                         An       issue occurred at one of the offices to which the          CQI          team needs to       respond.    A letter was sent to       the Commissioner of Employment Security.          A series of negative experiences happened to a Dislocated Worker,       many employees from both WDC and ESD were specifically named.          There is a systems problem that needs to be addressed around       Training Benefits.    The letter       was analyzed for the various situations that occurred.          The team then began to brainstorm possible solutions to these       problems.    The list of       potential solutions was sent to Gay.    This       “draft” problem solving grid will be shared at the June 5 th        meeting for the team to review, complete and find resolutions                One       outcome of this letter is the re-institution of the Quality Initiative       around the final two questions that need to occur at the end of every       interaction with a customer: “Have I answered all your questions” and       “Do you know your next step(s)?”                         ACTION: Kathy K       will get Kit to make desk tents for all Center staff with these two       questions on them.                         This       is no longer a pilot, but a way to conduct business.                                 6.          Other:                         Representative       to Attend Quality Assurance Committee : Alex has requested that a representative from the team attend the next       WDC Quality Assurance committee meeting.          This representative should attend to answer questions that arise       from the committee. The meeting schedule is the last Wednesday of the       first month of each quarter (January, April, July and October). The team       will need to plan for these meetings the month before.          We need to develop a standardized formal report to both Leaders and       the Quality Assurance committee.    The       team will assign a team member to attend.

GX039-11-11011477	WorkSource Skagit                 Center Use          Team Notes                 6/11/2         0                 0         3                                 Attendance:           Jim, Linda, Joyce, Kathy, Angella, and Donna                                Agenda:                                   Team           Roles                                   Certification           Follow-up                                   Center           Issues                                   Action           Plan                                   Partner           Sharing                                         I.            Team Roles:                         Kathy       discussed the need for the team to establish roles on the team.          We decided that the Scribe duties would be for a month at a time.          Donna will scribe for June, Linda for July and Don for August       (conversation held after the meeting with Don.)                                Kathy       will facilitate for now but she will ask members to start taking a more       active part of this role.                                II.                          Certification       Follow-up (WorkSource)                         Signage :          Signs have been ordered for the street, and should be done soon                         Lab/Resource       Area :          New computers here soon.    The       lab will be done in August due to          Career Choices          in July.                         Membership       System :          Coming as soon as the new computers are installed                         Nametags :          Will be arriving shortly.    Everyone       who works here or does Resource Specialist will have a nametag.                                WorkSource       Skagit is now OFFICIAL.                                 III.          Center Issues:                                 Mystery       Shopper :       We will be “shopped” now that we are certified, probably immediately.       The mystery shopper program is an ES program that “shops” for customer       service indicators.    We may be       “shopped” in three different ways: In person, by phone or by Internet.          This area tanks in the phone shopper arena.          The proper way to answer the phone is;          “Good Morning /Afternoon, WorkSource Skagit, this is _________,       how may I help you?”    At the       end of the call, ask the person “Have I answered all of your       questions?”                                Customer       service is an issue within the partnership.                                Web       Page Link Discussion :          We will be having a web page, like Whidbey and Whatcom.          This will be a local page accessed from go2worksource.          We discussed the use of workshop descriptions from WorkSource       Whatcom on our site.                         Homework :                                            All:  The Whatcom, Whidbey and              Skagit              websites           need to look the same.    We           need to look at the sites from Whatcom & Whidbey and determine           what we want to use.                                   Angella  will combine the calendars from ES and           activities from WS.    Angella           will also verify from Rhonda when she needs the information to get it           up on the website.                                   Linda  will figure out how to draw a map that has our           partner’s locations on it, hopefully providing landmarks for           directions to the center.                                         Resource       Specialist Meetings        will need an orientation when the membership system comes up.          Kathy spoke to          Pete Lee          from ES about       Resource Specialists meeting monthly with the Intake unit at ES. Kathy       will talk to          Steve White          about making       this happen.    It will be the       best venue as more rotating Resource Specialists are from ES.          Angella can go over to the JSC and Ingrid will be able to make some       of these meetings.                                Training       on SKIES :          WDC staff need training on SKIES job referrals so that they do not       have to call or go to ES to get referred to a job.          Donna and Kathy will work this out: when, curriculum, etc.                            IV.         Action Plan:                                 Leadership       Measure :       We need to hold leadership accountable for things that need to be done at       the center.    This needs to be       measurable.    There was a staff       survey developed by Whidbey that we plan to use. Kathy will bring a copy       to the next meeting for review, and if all is acceptable, it will be sent       out    to staff to complete.                                Partner       Referral Guide :       Team members go to website and ensure that the information under their       agency is correct and up to date.                                 V.          Partner Sharing :                                 Job       Corps/Jim :          not hiring more staff, they do what they can to handle situations       that arise.    The Plastering       Trade program is ending in June.    A       possible replacement is a Medical Assistant program but it is not yet a       certainty.    They have not been       able to record placements for 3 months.          They have a center review next week.                                SVC/Linda:          There will be no one available on Fridays during the       summer quarter.    Will need to       follow-up about the SVC Resource Specialist because they cover Fridays.                                 ES/Kathy:       Governor Locke trying to keep Boeing by       revamping the UI and L&I system.    They       are trying to do away with seasonal workers claiming unemployment. This       could have a big impact on WorkSource.                                WDC/Angella :          Angella going on vacation the next two weeks so all partners need       to cover their assigned schedule.                                Meeting       closed .       Next meeting                  0         6/25/         0         3          at          2:         0                 0          PM         .

We will report a raw number count of comments and also list         staff members that received positive comment(s). Comments related to         “Are there additional services or improvements you would like to         see?” would be sorted into the following categories:           ·                  Services           ·                  Resources           ·                  Environment           ·                  Staff           ·                  Support Services           ·                  Technology           ·                  Job Referral/Placement           ·                  Misc/Other                          III.                Data Display                         The team reviewed the mock       up for the public data display that Brian provided.          The team continues to support the idea of a single page display       showing a rating scale for two or maybe three questions.          The questions/rating responses can change over time and I the team       decided to start by displaying the “Ideal..” question, “Got what I       came for” and “Staff is courteous” if three questions are shown or       the “Ideal..” question and “Staff is courteous” questions if only       two questions are displayed.           Brian will prepare new mock       ups to be reviewed at the next meeting.           IV.                Mystery       Shopper Update                         The Whatcom Management Team       is deciding how to share Mystery Shopper information.          The         CQI        team will consider this issue after the Whatcom Management Team makes its       decisions.           V.                Focus Groups                         There is no longer a need to       conduct a focus group on WTS.    There       is the possibility of a future need for a focus group related to the       Tour-of-Services which would be conducted with the Whatcom CUT.           VI.                Next       Agenda – March 6th WorkSource Whatcom                         ·                Who is going to facilitate meeting?          Kathy is not able to attend.           ·                Business Comment Cards         ·                Review of 4 th  Qtr & YTD data         ·                Public Data Display         ·                New Member

(see document)                         ACTION : Before the next meeting everyone should review #2           & 3 of the self-assessment and make sure the improvement           strategies cover the comments.                               II CENTER ISSUES:           Mystery Shopper.                                 Kathy K gave out a memo re: Mystery Shoppers, which is where some             advocate groups are checking One-Stops/Career Centers to see if they             are providing the intensive services for which people are eligible.             We do not foresee a problem in this area, but it is always important             to be vigilant.                               Inappropriate Web Sites.                                 Some Career Centers are having problems with customers getting             into inappropriate web sites. So far we do not believe it is an             issue in our Center. It is important to always remind the Resource             Specialists to check on customers randomly.                               Career Choices Class.                                 The Career Choices Class has been canceled the last two times due             to lack of customers (primarily dislocated workers). We need to             discuss whether or not we continue it or change it.                               Computer Classes.                                 Basic computer classes may continue to be offered at the Center             after the SVC grant ends, but not to the extent that the grant had             provided and will be more work search oriented. We hope partnership             staff will be interested in providing some of the training. We need             to connect the classes with the Center to help increase use of the             Center.                               Web Site Articles.                                 Kathy has written two articles for the staff web site. These were             reviewed and approved. Kathy will get them to the web master.                               Usage of Center.                                 Don handed out a graph of the monthly usage of the Center (from             the sign ins). Also included was the usage per day of the week. We             will continue to track usage to identify peak times for added             services, etc.                               Job Club.                                 Job Club will begin on Wednesdays in August. All are welcome to             participate.                               Marketing.                                 The signs for the College Way reader-board are up.             Bookmarks, marketing the Center, to be placed at partner offices,             will be ordered.             The Center Use team is considering a postcard that customers can             mail in for more information. Kathy K will get a prototype for the             team to look at.                               III Next Meeting: August 8, from 1 – 3:30.

Request by HBPA to withdraw permission to export the simulcast signal from Beulah Park and River Downs to any Advance Deposit Wagering Company. Chairman Heckman said this item is intertwined with a communication from Beulah Park dated Dec. 17, wherein they responded to all horsemen, in writing, that due to HBPA disputes over export signal fees, the winter/spring meeting will not begin until February 28. All horses must be off the grounds by December 29, and not permitted to return until February 18. With that said, Beulah Park's permit submitted for live dates is now in question, therefore we will pass over this topic, as well as items 7, 8, 9, and 10 on the agenda which all coincide with exports or dates After lengthy discussion regarding this topic, the HBPA and Beulah Park negotiated and the HBPA gave consent for Beulah Park to simulcast live races to those outlets listed in their letter of December 12, with the following stipulations: a) Beulah park will negotiate with the Ohio HBPA for a contract concerning account wagering by February 10, 2004, and will supply financial information concerning account wagering to HBPA by January 10,. The HBPA reserves the right to withdraw its consent to export to account wagering firms on or after February 10 if no agreement is reached; b) By January 15, Beulah Park will make a good faith effort to provide information concerning the relationships between all outlets being exported to and their local thoroughbred horsemen's group, if any; c) Beulah Park agrees to include a question on all subsequent model contracts regarding the relationship between receiving outlets and their local thoroughbred horsemen's group, if any, with wording to be provided by the HBPA. Further approval is contingent upon the following stipulations for the purposes of pari-mutuel wagering. Approval to export live races from Beulah Park are contingent upon: a) That there is a maintenance of a contract in good standing with the applicable thoroughbred horsemen's group as defined in the 1978 Interstate Horse Racing Act at a thoroughbred track being exported to; b) That present circumstances at any approved receiving outlet do not materially change hereafter that live thoroughbred horseracing becomes threatened or adversely affected; c) That no approved receiving outlet combines with other outlets to threaten not to, or refuse to, purchase interstate simulcasts except upon similar terms and conditions for purchase being made to each of any combination of such outlets; d) That all approved outlets receiving export products maintain all  6.   other consents or approvals required by the 1978 Interstate Horseracing Act; and e) That a contract concerning account wagering be negotiated and agreed to between the Ohio HBPA and Beulah Park by February 10. In furtherance, the HBPA reserves the right to rescind the consent hereafter should any of the foregoing conditions be violated. Also, re-dissemination of any interstate simulcast for off-track wagering purposes to any receiving outlet not specifically identified in the original or any amended requests for consent of the HBPA is prohibited without express notice to, and further consent being obtained from, the Ohio HBPA. The consent is further conditioned upon the HBPA being furnished a copy of each simulcast agreement, a breakdown of revenue accompanying the daily purse accounting report and full compliance with the Interstate Horse Racing Act of 1978. Chairman Heckman moved to authorize the Executive Director to approve exports and the ratification will be on the next agenda. Commissioner Borgemenke seconded the motion, which passed unanimously. Also, Chairman Heckman suggested Beulah Park's exports be ratified at the next meeting. Commissioner Borgemenke so moved, Commissioner Meeks seconded the motion, which passed unanimously.

This involves a search of facilities in Barn 2 at Lebanon occupied by Tony Rose and Steven Moore in July 2001 during the Warren County Fair. During that search, paraphernalia was found in the area under the control of Mr. Rose and Mr. Moore. At a later date, Mr. Rose attempted to take full responsibility. Upon motion by Commissioner Barron to deny the application for a 2004 license and issue a notice of opportunity for a hearing, the motion was seconded by Chairman Heckman, which passed unanimously. Mr. Rose was advised should he wish to have a hearing at the next meeting, he must waive the 30 day time requirement and the hearing will be set. Chairman Heckman asked for a status report on the RFP before continuing the agenda. Allocation of 2004 Race Dates. Chairman Heckman said the race dates are reduced from the minimum statutory required amounts at Scioto Downs and Lebanon, pursuant to the nine-entity agreement of last year and pursuant to the agreement between the OHHA, Scioto and Lebanon. This allows for a lesser amount of days than required by statute. Raceway Park also has a small reduction of days, below the minimum, under the same agreement. At this point in the conversation, State Wide Purse Pools were discussed. Chairman Heckman reminded everyone, bringing up the topic of freezing state wide purse pools, that three harness tracks have reduced their days and no thoroughbred tracks have requested fewer days. Mike Weiss requested an amendment to Beulah Park's schedule that would delay the opening of Beulah's meeting due to on-going negotiations with the HBPA regarding exports. Mr. Weiss spoke on exports, account wagers, source fees, statewide purse pool. The topic shifted back to item #6 on the agenda and inter-twined throughout the Beulah Park discussions. HBPA wants to know if certain outlets receiving Beulah's exports are contributing to the purse pool fund. Commissioner  14.   Barron replied that the Commission has been asking that questions for two years. River Downs General Manager Jack Hanessian responded by stating River Downs is requesting 122 days, three days over the minimum, in order to participate to the greatest extent in the state wide purse pool. Chairman Heckman called for a 10-minute recess. Chairman Heckman called the meetinging back to order by stating that if any major changes are requested after dates are approved today he will be inclined to deny them. With negotiation between the thoroughbred tracks and the HBPA currently underway, Chairman Heckman said to go forward with the allocation of race dates for the harness tracks. Raceway Park General Manager Mike White said his request from is for 116 days, six days less than in 2003; opening on March 27 through December 18, with racing on Friday, Saturday and Sunday.

Commissioner Meeks voiced no objection to the amendment. The request passed by a majority three in favor. One vote against. One abstention. Mike Weiss saidBeulah Park requests 143 days beginning January 10 through May 1, and September 18 through December 20, 2004.

Hours of operation will remain the same as previous year and the agreement will be signed with Scioto Downs and submitted. The requestincludes live quarter horse races. Motion by Chairman Heckman to approve the permit as submitted, second by Commissioner Barron. Discussion. Commissioner Meeks made a motion to amend the Chairman's motion that the Commission may re-consider the reduction in dates for Beulah Park should they wish to reduce days in the future. No objection to that amendment was made. The motion was unanimously approved as amended. Jack Hanessian said River Downs is requesting to reserve May 1 (Kentucky Derby Day) as a live race day, which was omitted from the permit, pending the agreement with Kentucky. Opening day will be April 9 through September 7, 2004. The track will race seven/seven with Beulah Park until they close and then with Thistledown. Racing alone on Tuesday and Wednesday will be dark day, unless it follows a holiday. Motion by Commissioner Barron to approve the submission, second by Commissioner Meeks, unanimously approved.

The work rules were forwarded to the Employment Law Section of the Attorney General's Office and waiting for a response. 3.

ACTION: all team members bring ideas to our       next meeting regarding what we can do systemically to increase our ratings       on these two indicators.

Call to Order and Opening Remarks   Dr. Audrey Penn, Acting Director, NINDS, welcomed Council members, guests and staff to the 151st Council meeting.  Dr. Penn introduced new Council member, Dr. Lydia Villa-Komaroff, who is Vice President for Research at Northwestern University.  Dr. Penn also introduced the ad hoc members of Council Subcommittees.  Dr. Uta Francke and Ms. Kathy Hunter were unavailable to attend this meeting.  Dr. Penn announced the conclusion of the terms of the following Council members:  Mr. Robert Abendroth; Dr. Martha Denckla; Dr. John Mazziotta; and Dr. Jerome Posner.  Noting that replacements had not yet been appointed, she thanked them for their contributions and asked them to keep their calendars open for the September meeting.   Top    II. Report of the Associate Director for Extramural Research   Government in the Sunshine Act and the Federal Advisory Committee Acts   Dr. Constance Atwell, Associate Director for Extramural Research, NINDS, reviewed the Government in the Sunshine Act and the Federal Advisory Committee Acts, which require the Department of Health and Human Services to open to public observation as many advisory committee meetings as possible, including the National Advisory Councils.  The NANDS Council meeting was open to the public, except during the review of grant applications.  Notice of the date and place for the Council meeting was published in the Federal Register thirty days prior to the meeting.   Conflict of Interest   The regulations concerning conflict of interest were reviewed.  Council members were reminded that materials furnished for review purposes and discussion during the closed portions of the meeting are considered privileged information.  All Council members present signed a statement certifying that they did not participate in the discussion of, or vote on, an application from any organization, institution, or any part of a university system, of which they are an employee, consultant, officer, director or trustee, or in which they have a financial interest. Institutions or organizations which have multi-campus institution waivers, or arespecifically designated as separate organizations under 18 U.S.C. 208(a), are exempt from this provision.   Consideration of Minutes of Previous Council Meeting   The minutes of the Council meeting of February 15-16, 2001, were considered and accepted as written.    Consideration of Dates for Future Council Meetings   The following dates for future Council meetings were reconfirmed:  September 13-14, 2001 (Thursday and Friday) September 13-14, 2001 (Thursday and Friday) February 14-15, 2002 (Thursday and Friday) May 30-31, 2002 (Thursday and Friday) September 12-13, 2002 (Thursday and Friday) February 6-7, 2003 (Thursday and Friday) May 22-23, 2003  (Thursday and Friday) September 18-19, 2003 (Thursday and Friday)   Other Items   Reports Book--Dr. Atwell called Council’s attention to the Reports Book, which includes a list of all funding actions since the previous Council meeting.  She highlighted the last section, which provides the status of applications designated as High Program Priority (HPP).   Javits Neuroscience Investigator Award--Dr. Atwell noted that at a previous meeting it was decided that Council should limit the number of Javits Awards to 12 per year.  That action had been taken in order to minimize the impact of these seven-year awards on the overall grant pool, for which an average target of four years has been set by NIH policy.  Dr. Atwell informed the Council that ten Javits awards had been approved during the first two rounds and four were pending before this Council meeting.  A motion was made and seconded to remove the limitation.  Discussion brought out concerns about the implications of long grant awards.  The motion was withdrawn and a new motion offered and passed.  The new motion raises the limit to 15 for this year only and allowed the possibility of renewing a five-year award with a two-year award, with an annual review of proposed Javits awards and program impact.   Program Announcements/Requests for Applications-- Dr. Atwell reminded Council of the many Program Announcements (PAs) and Requests for Applications (RFAs) published in the NIH Guide for Grants and Contracts since the last meeting.  Copies had been e-mailed to Council members prior to this meeting.   Expedited Review Process--Dr. Atwell reported that the expedited review process is working well.  One hundred eighty three applications have gone through expedited review and will be paid soon.   Retirement--Dr. Atwell announced the retirement of Ms. Shirley Broderick, Acting Chief, Information Resources Management Branch, and expressed appreciation for Ms. Broderick’s leadership and contributions to information technology in NINDS.   New Staff--Dr. Atwell introduced the following new staff members in the Division of Extramural Research, NINDS:  Dr. Claudia Moy and Mr. Peter Gilbert, Clinical Research Project Managers, in the Clinical Trials Cluster; Dr. Sussan Paydar, a Program Analyst, in the Neurogenetics Cluster, and Ms. Sylvia Parsons, Special Assistant to the Associate Director for Extramural Research.     Top   III. Report of the Acting Director, NINDS   Dr. Penn provided an overview of the pending budget requests for NINDS and for NIH as a whole.  NIH funding appears to be continuing on a trajectory that will result in a doubling by FY 2003.  NINDS has fared well.  While the request for FY 2002 represents a lower percentage increase than NIH as a whole, due to the need to fund new organizations and smaller Institutes and Centers (ICs) that are still growing, it is still a significant increase over last year.  NIH and individual ICs are working hard to anticipate and prepare for level funding in FY 2004 and beyond.  One strategy employed by NINDS has been to identify productive use of funds, such as supplements, that do not create a commitment in future years.   This year brought important changes in the Congressional appropriations process.  Representative Ralph Regula (R-OH), the new chairman of the House Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and Other Agencies, did not follow his predecessors’ practice of holding individual hearings for the ICs.   Instead, he convened an overview hearing similar to those held in the Senate in which the NIH Director presented a statement and IC Directors were available for questions.  This hearing was supplemented by “theme hearings” addressing issues such as chronic diseases, health disparities, and infrastructure.  A theme hearing on neuroscience was cancelled due to calendar constraints.  The major focus of the Senate hearing was stem cell research and Chairman Specter’s (R-PA) request for statements from each IC about current and future research.  In response to Mr. Specter’s questions, Dr. Penn discussed the use of embryonic stem cells in mouse models of Parkinson’s disease and privately funded therapeutic studies in ALS.   Dr. Penn announced several personnel changes.  Ms. Mary Miers, Chief, Science Policy and Analysis, will work with Dr. Gerald Fischbach on strategic planning for the Columbia University Health Sciences division.  Dr. Guy McKhann, whose long association with NINDS most recently included a year as Acting Clinical Director, will step down from that position to devote more time to his research but will continue to serve as a consultant.  Dr. Henry McFarland, Chief of the intramural Neuroimmunology Branch, will serve as Acting Clinical Director.  Finally, Dr. Penn noted with sadness the death of Dr. Clarence J. “Joe” Gibbs in February.  Dr. Gibbs had a long and distinguished research career with NINDS and was serving as Acting Chief of the Laboratory of Central Nervous System Studies at the time of his death.  There will be a memorial service for Dr. Gibbs on July 24.  Following Dr. Penn’s remarks, Mr. Abendroth expressed Council’s appreciation for Ms. Miers’s work with the Institute and with Council.   Dr. Penn then discussed policy issues related to three major disorders confronting NINDS:  transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs), Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), and autism.   TSEs include scrapie in sheep, bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) or “mad cow” disease, and other animal forms.  Human TSEs include Kuru--once associated with ritual cannibalism but no longer seen-and a variety of rare, mostly genetic forms.  The major human form, Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease (CJD) may be genetic, sporadic, or iatrogenic in origin.  The current public health concern stems from the emergence of a variant form of CJD, vCJD, first observed in the mid 1990s and linked to BSE initially in Britain and now in other countries.  There is widespread fear--though very little evidence-that CJD might be spread through the blood supply.  NINDS has been heavily engaged in discussions within NIH and the Department of Health and Human Services seeking to identify and implement appropriate measures to prevent the spread of TSEs, to develop better measures to identify contaminated blood products and infected animals, and to improve understanding of the disease mechanism.  Dr. Richard Johnson of The Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine is serving as a special consultant to the Directors of NIH and NINDS, and Dr. Paul Brown of the Division of Intramural Research continues to work as an investigator and policy advisor on TSE issues.   Most recently, Dr. Johnson and Dr. McKhann have visited the major laboratories in the U.S. where TSE research is being conducted to identify opportunities for expansion and collaboration.  Dr. Ruth Kirschstein, Acting Director of NIH, has committed $4.8 million from her discretionary fund to NINDS and other ICs to ramp up research on TSEs.  NINDS and NHLBI have awarded two major contracts to develop a rapid screening test.  TSE research requires a P-3 containment facility and thus represents a substantial commitment of resources.   Duchenne muscular dystrophy has become a major focus of patient advocacy and Congressional interest.  Concerns include the failure to develop an effective therapy despite the discovery of the disease gene in 1987; funding levels; and adequacy of the NIH peer review process for research related to muscle disease.  Dr. Penn testified at a Senate Appropriations Committee hearing in February where other witnesses were critical of NIH efforts.  Since then, there has been some progress on review issues with the formation of a new muscle biology study section, and efforts have been made to reach out to patient advocates and investigators concerned with the major muscular dystrophies.  Legislation requiring the creation of centers and an expanded research effort has been introduced in both houses of Congress.   Autism research involves several ICs, primarily NIMH, NICHD, NIDCD, and NINDS.  Legislation to expand NIH research efforts was enacted last year and is now being implemented.  In addition, the House Government Reform Committee, chaired by Representative Dan Burton (R-IN), held several hearings to explore autism issues, including incidence and prevalence, and possible association of autism and childhood vaccinations.     Council members discussed the impact of disease advocacy activities on NIH programs.  Mr. Abendroth described disease-focused legislation as a two-edged sword, especially when centers are involved.  Our political system encourages advocacy groups to seek special treatment, and members of Congress are sympathetic to their concerns.  Proliferation of centers will affect NINDS initiatives and payline, particularly if the budget does not continue to grow.  Mr. Margus noted that while he advises advocates that it is not in the best interest of science to press for set asides, it is a hard position to sell when some groups are succeeding.  He urged NIH to maintain a balanced position when discussing disease-specific legislation with the Congress.   Dr. Lowenstein observed that while the advocacy groups’ contribution is important, they don’t always see fundamental research as a high priority.  Enactment of disease-specific legislation may increase disparities by skewing funds in the direction of those who have the resources to push for them.  Dr. Mazziotta commented that many advocates are more likely to approach Congress than NIH.  Dr. Griffin wondered if pivotal findings have ever emerged from Congressionally mandated initiatives and suggested a study of this issue.  The overall challenge is to educate advocates and the Congress about the need for a strong science base and to respond creatively to disease-specific requests.   Prior to the break, Dr. Atwell introduced Mr. James Angus, the NINDS website project manager, and noted that he had previously served with the Los Angeles Museum of Natural History.    Top   IV. Presentation:  ""Novel Approaches Toward the Pathogenesis and Treatment of Multiple Sclerosis""   Training and Career Development Subcommittee   Dr. Julian Hoff, Chair of the Training Subcommittee, yielded the floor to Dr. Khachaturian, Training and Referral Officer, NINDS, who provided an update on training grants and K awards.  The subcommittee has been working on a series of clinical programs for medical students through post-residency. These include medical student summer research, the scholars program, the MD/PhD or MD/MPH program, a postdoctoral program, the NINDS career transition award, mentored clinical scientist development award, and mid-career patient-oriented research career development award.  Effective in FY 2002, there will be an upward revision of salaries and research costs from current level.  Also, three new Program Announcements have been published.  These are the Institutional National Research Service Awards (NRSA) to provide short-term research experience for medical students; the NINDS Medical Student Scholars Program, and a dual degree program.  An RFA was recently published by NINDS, NIMH and NIDA for a national and regional NRSA institutional predoctoral and postdoctoral program to attract and retain minority investigators. Additionally, another program has been launched to encourage basic scientists to focus on translational research.  Currently about 2.3 percent of the NINDS budget is allocated to training grants, and about 2.3 percent to K awards (4.6 percent combined).  The subcommittee proposes raising this amount to 6 percent of the total budget.  Although discussed at length, a definition for “translational research” was not agreed upon.  Dr. Dennis Landis suggested that the role of mentors should be emphasized more.  Therefore, at the ANA meetings in September, a group of K08 awardees and their mentors will meet the day before the main meeting to present abstracts of their research and discuss ways in which their future research careers can be facilitated.    Infrastructure, Neuroinformatics & Computational Neuroscience Subcommittee   Dr. John Mazziotta, Chair, Infrastructure, Neuroinformatics and Computational Neuroscience Subcommittee, presented a summary of the Subcommittee discussions.   Core grant--Developing programs for core grants to support infrastructure was deemed to be an effective use of funds.  Other NIH Institutes have similar programs that usually include funding for career development and patient retention in studies, accounting to up to 4.5 percent of their total budgets.  Since NINDS has career development grants as a separate mechanism, the committee proposed devoting no more than 1.5 percent of our budget to core grants for equipment, facilities, and operational costs to facilitate research.  At an average capped cost of $350,000 per year, this would equate to about 20-30 grants.  These resources could be shared by several investigators with NINDS or other NIH support.  There is interest in this concept, but the details need to be refined.    Computational Neuroscience--A workshop on computational neuroscience has resulted in several recommendations and a joint initiative with the National Science Foundation and five other NIH institutes.  The initiative will support collaborative research among the mathematics, theoretical physics, and computer science disciplines with the neurosciences.  The subcommittee is very supportive of this initiative.   Neuroinformatics--The neuroinformatics-related programs called Biomedical Information Science and Technology Initiative (BISTI), Neuroinformatics Information Science and Technology Initiative (NIfTI), and the Human Brain Project, probably should be combined under one umbrella.   BISTI is served by three types of mechanisms:  P20, R21-R33 and the industry links, SBIR and STTR.  A second workshop on NIfTI has been held, with the purpose of developing software tools to evaluate neurological data for the neuroscience and neurobehavioral research community.    Clinical Trials Subcommittee    Dr. Dan Lowenstein, Chair of the Clinical Trials Subcommittee, began his report by commenting that the morning’s meeting was only the second for the Clinical Trials Subcommittee, with their continuing goal being to develop a strategy to manage the pool of incoming clinical trial applications.  Dr. Lowenstein stated that the Subcommittee is attempting to bring more focused attention to individual grants as they come in for funding in order to advise the overall Council of the priorities that they should consider.  To broaden the expertise of the group, several individuals have been asked to advise the Subcommittee on an ad hoc basis.  Since its first meeting, the Subcommittee has begun to assemble a protocol for the pre-review of proposals which requires applicants to submit a short summary of their grant proposal three months before the due date of their application.  This information will be used by the Subcommittee members to evaluate the relevance of each application to the Institute’s interests and priorities.  It was determined that this process would begin during the next Council round in order to give applicants sufficient notice as to whether their grant would be approved for submission.  In these future grant rounds, applications will be discussed by the Subcommittee a minimum of two months prior to the grant application deadline so that information can be returned to the applicant in a useful time frame.     In addition to discussing the time frame for pre-approval of grant submissions, two other concerns were raised at the morning’s meeting that will be addressed in later discussions:  1) co-funding of grants by multiple institutes, and 2) the process that will be used by planning grant recipients in submitting their clinical trial applications.  Regarding the latter concern, the Subcommittee’s suggestion was to require these investigators to participate in the same pre-review process as the other clinical trial applicants.    Top    V. Selection of Grants to Pay From Requests for Applications (RFAs)   Drs. Joshua Sanes and Constance Atwell each provided background for the discussion of priority setting by outlining the current status of the development and approval process for NINDS solicitations and initiatives.     Dr. Sanes provided a broad overview of how the Institute’s funds are expended into extramural research grants, intramural, contracts, and training activities, etc.  Within these categories, extramural research is divided into two categories:  standard investigator-initiated, peer-reviewed research that is funded by using a set payline (approximately 80 percent of funds), and other types of research that are also investigator-initiated and peer-reviewed, but are identified as high program priority projects (HPP), proposals submitted in response to a Requests for Applications (RFAs), or clinical trials (approximately 20 percent of funds).  Within the RFA category - a focus of this discussion - some are disease-oriented and/or translational, others target an underfunded basic science area, while still others are center grants, awards for core facilities, etc.  Following this overview, Dr. Sanes presented a number of points to consider including:  1) some grants are particularly difficult to curtail once funded, like center grants; 2) it would be prudent to consider how resources are allocated to different types of awards since the NINDS budget may not be as generous in the years ahead; 3) we need to respond to legitimate concerns of patient groups and Congress, which can be difficult to do via the standard investigator-initiated R01 mechanism; and 4) good science emerges from the “marketplace” of ideas, and micromanagement of science is not usually beneficial.  He also noted that if the RFA mechanism continues to be used, a modified peer review of each RFA developed might be considered, and/or they should be broadened as much as possible.   Following Dr. Sanes’ presentation, Dr. Atwell reviewed several topics that will be discussed in greater detail at the upcoming September Council meeting.  These topics include: the balance between investigator-initiated grants (R01s, etc.) and other categories of proposals (RFAs, HPPs, clinical trials, etc.), determination of an acceptable payline, negotiated reductions in awards, and the funding of high program priority grants.  Dr. Atwell continued her presentation by discussing how funding decisions are made regarding HPP grants and proposals submitted in response to RFAs.  For example, factors that are considered in selecting grants for HPP designation include: program balance and needs, the creativity and innovation of the proposal, the level of funds that have already been invested in the project, and the potential to aid a new investigator by funding the proposal.  The criteria used to rank and select proposals submitted in response to an RFA are similar and include: merit/priority score, program balance within the RFA topic, the potential to bring a new investigator into the field, and overlap with existing grants held by the principal investigator.   Following these presentations, a number of issues were raised in a general discussion session including:   Responding to Congressional mandates with funding/research programs that are of high quality. Identifying the best means of ensuring that RFAs are designed to benefit a wide range of fields (if possible), that the process by which ideas for RFAs are reviewed is made more transparent, and that the standards used to review proposals submitted in response to RFAs are as rigorous as those used to review other investigator-initiated proposals. Determining the success and impact of projects funded through HPPs, PAs, etc. Ensuring that our program balance, ongoing level of solicitations, and current review criteria, etc. will work well in either good, or less favorable, financial times.   Further discussion of these issues is planned for the September 2001 Council meeting.    Top     VI. Update on the Stroke PRG   Dr. Thomas Jacobs, Program Director, Neural Environment Cluster, NINDS, reported that several factors provided impetus for the Stroke PRG, including increases in overall biomedical funding, the growth of knowledge in fundamental neurobiology, and a recognition that more research in stroke is needed.  After examining several planning mechanisms, it was decided to use the “Program Review Group” model that has been successful for brain tumor research.  The Brain Tumor PRG (BT-PRG) set a comprehensive research agenda, but it also broadened for scientific community and Congress the concept of research progress.  The BT-PRG switched the focus from concentrating only on funding to the larger picture of scientific achievement and the next research questions to address.   The stroke PRG process started last October with a leadership meeting of Dr. Gerald Fischbach, NINDS staff, and the two appointed co-chairs.  The co-chairs, Dr. Jim Grotta from the University of Texas, Houston, and Dr. Michael Moskowitz from Harvard, have complementing interests that will enhance the process.  A planning meeting that included 32 co-chairs who will lead 15 topic areas was held in March 2001.  The agenda for the Stroke PRG Roundtable was formulated and leading experts who could participate were identified.  The Roundtable, to be held July 15-17, 2001, will bring together 150 of these leaders in the field, including representatives from other Institutes and agencies, as well as patient advocates.  Several overarching themes, such as health disparities and pediatric stroke, will be included in the discussions of most of the topic areas.  The Roundtable will not be a traditional conference or workshop with presentations, but a working meeting, by the end of which a draft of recommendations and priorities will be produced.  The draft report will be presented at the September 2001 council.  If accepted by the Council, and approved by Dr. Penn, it will move forward to implementation.    Top   VII. Electronic Research Administration   Dr. John McGowan, Director, Division of Extramural Activities, NIAID, and the Project Manager for Electronic Research Administration (eRA), gave an overview of the system.  eRA is the paperless electronic transfer of application and administrative data.  NIH hopes to adopt this system institute-wide.  eRA is NIH's infrastructure for conducting interactive electronic transactions for the receipt, review, monitoring, and administration of NIH grant awards to biomedical investigators worldwide.  eRA integrates two parallel systems, the NIH Commons and IMPAC II.  The Commons interfaces with NIH's partners in the research community, whereas IMPAC II is used by NIH staff.  NIH Commons is slated to mesh with Federal Commons, the central electronic face of the government to the public.    eRA is built from an Oracle relational database management system.  The system is divided into modules (programs) that come into play for each application and administrative process for NIH awards.  eRA has modules for specific business functions, modules that cut across business areas, and query tools for reporting.   In addition to a congressional mandate requiring agencies to migrate from paper-based to electronic systems, NIH is pursuing eRA to lower costs and administrative effort, speed up process, and provide better quality data.  Ultimately, all parties involved will conduct seamless, secure, interactive business.  The potential benefit to the extramural community is immense.     Top   VIII. National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering   Dr. William Heetderks, Program Director, NINDS Repair and Plasticity Cluster, discussed the history, status, and implications of the newest NIH component, the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering (NIBIB).   NIBIB grows out of various NIH activities in bioengineering and imaging. The NIH Revitalization Act of 1993 directed NIH to conduct a study of bioengineering research.  The study recommended that NIH establish a high-level, central focus for basic bioengineering research, significantly expand representation of the engineering community on advisory groups, and establish an intramural bioengineering program. NIH has received similar input on biomedical imaging. To meet its goals, NIH established the NIH bioengineering consortium (BECON). BECON activities include Bioengineering Research Partnership Awards, Bioengineering Research Grants, and Mentored Quantitative Research Career Development Awards. For FY1999 NIH estimated $697.5 million in funding for bioengineering at all ICs, though the definition of bioengineering was quite broad.   Congress, noting the importance of research in imaging, bioengineering, computer science, informatics, and related fields to improving health care, established the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering with the last bill of the 106th Congress (PL 106-560). The president signed the bill in December 2000 and in April 2001 the DHHS Secretary approved a plan for implementation which is now underway.    Dr. Steven Hyman, Director of NIMH, led a committee that developed a mission statement for NIBIB following the guidance of  PL 106-560.  The statement says the goal of the Institute is to “improve health by promoting fundamental discoveries, design, and development, and translation and assessment of technological capabilities in biomedical imaging and bioengineering….” The focus of NIBIB is on research and training “that can be applied to a broad spectrum of biological processes, disorders, diseases, and across organ systems.” Although the Institute will engage in a full range of activities in support of research, partnership with other NIH Institutes and Centers will play a significant part.   NIBIB-related activities, beyond formulation of the mission statement, include:  Submission of an FY2002 budget request; appointment of Dr. Donna J. Dean as Acting Director of NIBIB; identification of a funding code (EB); efforts to identify NIH grants appropriate for transfer to the new Institute; development of interim operating guidelines; development of grant referral guidelines; recruitment of a Director; development of a candidate list for an advisory council; and recruitment of program staff.  Until the advisory council is established, FY2002 applications will be handled as dual assignments with other ICs or other IC councils will handle Council level review as “foster parents.” Council members may direct suggestions regarding the new institute to the Acting Director, Donna J. Dean, Ph.D. at  dd49p@nih.gov   or phone 301-435-6138 or fax 301-435-7268.    Top   IX. U.S. Japan Cooperative Brain Research Program   Dr. Mark Hallett, Chief, Medical Neurology Branch, Clinical Neurosciences Program, DIR, NINDS, described a cooperative program that was established by a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) signed in November 2000 between the NINDS, on behalf of the United States, and the National Institute for Physiological Sciences at Okazaki, representing Japan.  The program is open to all neuroscientists in both countries.  Associated activities may include collaborative research projects, information sharing (workshops and seminars), short-term exchanges of scientists, and other relevant activities.  Each country will fund its own scientists’ exchanges and attendance at meetings.  There are already several U.S. laboratories working with Japanese scientists under the auspices of the MOU. A U.S.-Japanese cooperative workshop, “Multimodal Neuroimaging,” is planned as a satellite session to the Society of Neuroscience meeting in San Diego this fall.  Dr. Hallett has been designated chair of an oversight committee for the U.S., which will publicize and guide the program.  It is anticipated that five to ten U.S. scientists will be supported under this program each year.    Top   X. Council Review of Pending Applications   This portion of the meeting, involving specific grant review, was closed to the public.  The Council gave special attention to applications from foreign institutions and applications for which there were concerns about human subjects, including appropriate representation of women and minority subjects, or laboratory animals.   Research Training and Career Development Programs   The Council reviewed a total of 73 research career development applications; of this total, 50 applications had primary assignment to NINDS, and 38 of them (76.0 percent) were recommended for support in the amount of $4.1 million first-year direct costs.  It is anticipated that, of the research career development grants competing at this Council, NINDS will be able to pay first-year direct costs of approximately $3.3 million.    Senator Jacob Javits Neuroscience Investigator Awards    The Senator Jacob Javits Neuroscience Investigator Awards are made to distinguished investigators who have a record of scientific excellence and productivity, who are actively pursuing an area of research of strategic importance, and who can be expected to continue to be highly productive for a seven-year period.  Candidates are nominated and selected at each Council meeting.  At this meeting, the Council recommended four investigators as Javits awardees.   Research Grant Awards   The Council reviewed a total of 1,220 research grant applications; of this total, 768 applications had primary assignment to NINDS, and 515 of them (67.1 percent) were recommended for support in the amount of $159.7 million first-year direct costs.  It is anticipated that, of the research grants competing at this Council, NINDS will be able to pay first-year direct costs of approximately $70.7 million.   Small Business Innovation Research and Small Technology Transfer Award Programs   The Council reviewed a total of 145 Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and Small Technology Transfer Award (STTR) grant applications; of this total, 73 applications had primary assignment to NINDS and 47 of them (64.4 percent) were recommended for support in the amount of $7.4 million first-year direct costs.  It is anticipated that, of the SBIR and STTR applications competing at this Council, NINDS will be able to pay first-year direct costs of approximately $3.2 million.    Academic Research Enhancement Award Program    The Council reviewed a total of 22 Academic Research Enhancement Awards (AREA) applications; of this total, 8 applications had primary assignment to NINDS, and 6 of them (75.0 percent) were recommended for support in the amount of $0.6 million direct costs.  It is anticipated that NINDS will be able to pay first-year direct costs of approximately $0.4 million.     Top   XI. Adjournment   The meeting was adjourned at 10:15 a.m. on Friday, May 25.

City of Phoenix Proposal to Accelerate the West Half of the Traffic Interchange at the Junction of I-10, Santan and South Mountain Corridors The City of Phoenix proposes to advance the completion of the west half of the Traffic Interchange at the Junction of I-10, Santan and South Mountain Corridors to June 2001. This project is scheduled to be completed in December of 2005 under the current program. The proposed plan to complete the MAG Regional Freeway System by 2007 (2007 Plan), shows that the project would be completed by December of 2004. Under this proposal, Phoenix would lend the Program the necessary funds to advance right of way, design and construction to meet the June 2001 completion date. Phoenix would pay a portion of the interest expense of the GAN based on the MAG Loan Policy and Guidelines. MAG has reviewed the proposal and compared it with the adopted MAG Loan Policy and Guidelines and find the proposal in conformance with the adopted guidelines. The Management Committee recommended approval of the proposal. Please refer to the enclosed material. *9.

Consultation on Processes for the 1999 Conformity Analysis Federal and state conformity regulations require that MAG consult with federal, state and local air quality and transportation agencies on processes proposed for the conformity analysis on the transportation program and plan. These processes include: the selection of modeling methods, the identification of exempt projects, ensuring the expeditious implementation of transportation control measures, and the identification of projects which require PM10 hotspot analysis. MAG is therefore distributing for comment the proposed processes to be applied in the upcoming conformity analysis of the MAG Fiscal Year 20002004 Transportation Improvement Program (TIP) and the MAG Long Range Transportation Plan Summary and 1999 Update (LRTP). Comments are due February 24, 1999. Please refer to the enclosed material.  10.  For information, discussion and consultation.  GENERAL ITEMS  *11. Small Plant Review and Approval Process for the Proposed Wickenburg School District Wetland Maricopa County has requested that MAG review the proposed wastewater treatment facility for the Wickenburg School District through the Small Plant Review and Approval Process of the MAG 208 Water Quality Management Plan. The Small Plant Process is designed to allow new wastewater reclamation plants which are two million gallons per day or less in capacity to be reviewed and approved as part of the 208 Plan. The capacity of the proposed constructed wetlands is 0.0166 million gallon per day (mgd). The facility is within three miles of the Town of Wickenburg and the Town has indicated that they do not object to the proposed facility. However, the Town indicated that if the property is annexed into the corporate limits, the Wickenburg Unified High School District would be responsible for any cost to connect the school to the Town sewer system should the wetland treatment method fail or otherwise be problematic. On January 19, 1999, the Water Quality Advisory Committee unanimously recommended approval of the proposed Wickenburg School District Wetland as part of the MAG 208 Water Quality Management 5  11.  For information, discussion and approval of the proposed Wickenburg School District Wetland as part of the MAG 208 Water Quality Management Plan.   MAG Regional Council -- Tentative Agenda Plan. The Management Committee concurred with the recommendation of the Water Quality Advisory Committee. Please refer to the enclosed material. *12. Draft MAG 208 Water Quality Management Plan Amendment for the City of Phoenix Cave Creek Water Reclamation Facility The City of Phoenix has requested that MAG amend the 208 Water Quality Management Plan to include an expansion of the existing Cave Creek Water Reclamation Plant and a discharge from the facility to a tributary wash of Cave Creek. The proposed expansion is for an ultimate capacity of 32 million gallons per day at build out (2015). Treated wastewater will be disposed of through reuse for turf irrigation and discharged to the Cave Butte Dam Flood Pool via a tributary wash of Cave Creek. Property of the Flood Control District of Maricopa County is immediately downstream of the proposed pipeline outfall and several issues will require resolution by the City of Phoenix. At this time, the District has no objection to the conceptual design of the pipeline discharge. On January 6, 1999, the Water Quality Advisory Committee conducted a public hearing on the Draft 208 Plan Amendment. There were no public comments provided on this facility. On January 19, 1999, the MAG Water Quality Advisory Committee unanimously recommended approval of the facility. The Management Committee concurred with the recommendation of the Water Quality Advisory Committee. Please refer to the enclosed material. *13. Financial Management Software Selection In May 1998, the Regional Council approved the FY 1999 Unified Planning Work Program which included acquiring and implementing a financial management software package at an estimated cost of $35,000. Over the past six months, the MAG staff has conducted a search and reviewed several financial management software packages. The process involved a survey of 32 councils of governments and a Request For Information (RFI) to 53 software vendors. In addition, feedback was received from more than 60 council of governments finance directors on the software used by these agencies. Two separate Requests For Proposals (RFP) were issued.

Recommendation to Support Uniformity in the Adoption of Uniform Building Codes The MAG Building Codes Committee was established in 1968 to encourage and promote uniformity in the interpretation and enforcement of building, mechanical, plumbing and electrical codes adopted by its members. On November 18, 1998, the MAG Building Codes Committee recommended adopting the 1997 Uniform Building Code, the 1997 ICBO Mechanical Code, and the 1996 National Electrical Code. At a December 15, 1998 MAG Valley Building Codes Stakeholders Meeting, elected officials and building industry representatives emphasized the need for their input in the development of uniform building codes. On December 16, 1998, the MAG Building Codes Committee recommended that member agencies set July 1, 1999 as a target for adopting the 1997 Uniform Building Code, 1997 ICBO Uniform Mechanical Code, and the 1996 NEC Amendments Building Codes. The Management Committee concurred with this recommendation. In January, the Regional Council discussed this issue and directed that it be placed on the February agenda for consideration. Please refer to the enclosed material. 14.

GX270-90-3633841	"Oklahoma Tobacco Settlement Endowment Trust Fund Board of Directors August 27, 2003 Minutes Board of Directors Members Present: Robert McCaffree M.D., Marvin Apple, Don Cooper M.D., Susan Walters Biz, Brian Maddy, Suzanne Olive M.D. Staff Present: Tracey Strader, Dorothy Antwine Members Absent: None Guests Present: State Treasurer Robert Butkin, Deputy State Treasurer Ken King, Richard Barnes, Sally Carter, Linda Eakers, Janet Love, Doug Matheny, Joyce Morris, Jeff Packham, Abby Rosenthal, Joann Stevenson, Gay Tudor Call to Order and Open Meeting Act Dr. McCaffree called the meeting to order and announced that the requirements of the Open Meeting Act, including the filing of the meeting and posting of the agenda, had been met. He announced Susan Biz would be joining the meeting later, and introduced Joann Stevenson, the new liaison from the Attorney General's office. Meeting with Secretary Adelson Dr. McCaffree reported that he and Tracey Strader met with the new Secretary of Health, Tom Adelson to orient him to the Trust. Secretary Adelson had some very pertinent questions about the Trust's operations and programs and offered this assistance and support, as needed. Press Conference launch of the Helpline Dr. McCaffree reported that he and the Governor, Treasurer, Attorney General addressed a room filled with press and supporters from across the State, during the August 20th press conference to launch the Oklahoma Tobacco Helpline. The television, newspaper, and radio coverage that followed resulted in nearly 600 calls the first day and another 400 calls the second day. Tracey Strader said that the Attorney General pointed out that Dr. McCaffree was there ""to carry the freight"" in 1996 when Oklahoma's lawsuit against the tobacco industry was filed and that he was at the press conference seven years later ""to deliver the cargo."" Resolution  ""Recognizing Tracy Foor, Charter Board Member and Secretary"" Dr. McCaffree announced that Tracy Foor had resigned from the Board. Tracy indicated that he resigned due to his commitments to his students, church, and family. His resignation letter was very complimentary of Tracey's work and the Board's accomplishments to date. Dr. McCaffree directed the Board members to a resolution and plaque that were prepared in recognition of Tracy's exceptional service. Marvin Apple made a motion to approve the resolution, ""Recognizing Tracy Foor, Charter Board Member and Secretary"". Dr. Cooper seconded the motion and the motion passed unanimously. Upcoming Training Events Tracey reminded the Board of these upcoming training events: 1) the American Public Health Association Annual Meeting in San Francisco, CA, November 15th - 19th. The deadline for early   registration is September 5th. 2) The National Conference on Tobacco or Health in Boston, MA, December 10th-12th. The deadline for early registration is also in early September. 3) The Oklahoma State Department of Health is sponsoring a workshop on the Community Preventive Services Task Force recommendations, October 21st. The location is pending. Notice of election of officers to take place at the next Board meeting Dr. McCaffree announced that officers would be elected at the next Board meeting. He said that although officers may be re-elected, according to the enabling legislation the Chair can only serve two consecutive terms, and he is currently serving his second term. Marvin Apple stated that Dr. McCaffree would still be eligible to serve as Vice-chair or Secretary. He also said that he believed that the Chair should be near the Oklahoma City area in order to easily respond to the media, get to the Capitol, or respond to other immediate needs as necessary. Certification of FY 2003 Earnings Dr. McCaffree welcomed state Treasurer Robert Butkin and expressed the Board's appreciation for the leadership he provided in establishing the Trust and his continued partnership the organization's accomplishments. Treasurer Butkin expressed his appreciation to Tracey, Dorothy, and the Board for their cooperation, and stated that it had been a pleasure to participate in the recent Helpline press conference. He said that the Board of Investors met on August 21st, reviewed the Fund's performance over the last fiscal year, and voted to certify to the full amount of earnings from FY 2003 of $2,757,686.05 net of any investment management fees. Board of Investors Operating Budget Treasurer Butkin requested approval for the $5,500 operating budget for the Board of Investors. He explained that the investment management expenses were not included in the budget request this year because, as a result of HB 1457, investment management expenses are no longer considered an operating expense. Treasurer Butkin also explained that although the Trust's enabling legislation allows the Treasurer's office to claim up to two FTE as an operating expense beginning in FY 2004, he would not be seeking reimbursement this year. He stated that the service he and his staff provide to the Trust is a labor of love, and that he would refrain from seeking reimbursement as long as possible. However, he has asked his staff, including the Deputy Treasurer, Public Information Officer, Internal Auditor and Comptroller to begin tracking the time they spent on TSET matters in case there is a need to seek funding from the Trust for these services in the future. They have spent a considerable amount of time tracking income, interest, and dividends, staffing the Board of Investors, and providing communications support. Dr. McCaffree affirmed that the Board and staff have enjoyed a wonderful working relationship with the Treasurer and his entire staff and that this has been of great benefit to the TSET. Brian Maddy made a motion to approve the Board of Investors operating budget. Dr. Cooper seconded the motion and the motion passed unanimously. Finance Committee Report Marvin Apple reported that a change in the Policy on Allocation of Funds was needed in order to reflect the changes brought about through HB 1457. The policy currently states that ten percent   of available funds would be placed in reserve; however, available funds were defined as certified earnings, less operations and investment management fees. As a result of HB 1457, investment management fees are deducted before earnings are certified. Joann Stevenson confirmed that the policy revision was in accordance with the legislation. Marvin Apple made a motion to adopt the new policy on allocation of funds. Dr. Cooper seconded the motion and the motion was passed unanimously. FY 2004 Operating Budget Revision Marvin Apple explained that a revision of the operating budget (which had been approved at the April meeting) was needed. Tracey Strader explained that the difference between the FY 2003 budget of $210,000 and the FY 2004 budget of $288,000 was due to the fact that Dorothy Antwine joined the staff in January, 2003 and the unexpended $30,000 budgeted for consultation in FY 2003 was to be carried over to FY 2004. Other changes included funds for an initial purchase of grants management software, an increase in OneNet fees, increase in fees for use of the copier, a new contract with the Attorney General's office the services of a 1/8th time attorney. Marvin Apple made a motion to approve the operating budget of $288,000. Dr. Olive seconded the motion and the motion was passed unanimously. FY 2004 Funds Available for Programs Marvin Apple said that approximately $2.3 million should be available for new programs. This is determined by adding certified earnings and carryover from FY 2003, and deducting FY 2004 operating expenses, reserves, and funds obligated to the Helpline project. The Board discussed the Helpline's ongoing costs, including Helpline services, media promotion, and evaluation. Brian Maddy asked if the media promotion of the Helpline would be an ongoing cost and if that was assumed when the Helpline project budget was approved last year. Tracey explained that the Helpline project has always been discussed in three parts, including services media, and evaluation. In addition the majority of funds for the Helpline project were unexpended in FY 2003, since the contract was not awarded until June. Marvin Apple stated that most of the Helpline expenses projected in FY 2004 were funded with carryover from the FY 2003 budget. As a result, the majority of earnings certified from FY 2003 will be available for new programs. Mr. Maddy asked if the Board's vote last year included an ongoing commitment to the media promotion budget. Dr. McCaffree said that the Board had discussed and agreed to the need for media promotion, but he was not certain that it was part of the vote. Tracey agreed to review the minutes and report back on that discussion and vote. Marvin Apple asked when the Board might expect to see an initial evaluation of the Helpline. Tracey said that it might be possible to have preliminary results after nine months, but that evaluation (of caller satisfaction and quit rates) could not begin until the initial callers have enough time to complete the program. There will be an evaluation of the media used to promote the Helpline, but Tracey was unsure of how long it would take to collect and analyze that data.   Brian Maddy asked if the ten percent used for surveillance and evaluation was also separate from the Helpline services budget. Tracey replied that the evaluation budget was separate, and this was based the Board's strategic plan calling for an independent evaluation of all funded programs. Dr. McCaffree said it was never part of a formal policy but rather a general guideline. Marvin Apple said evaluation expenditures would depend on how quickly projects were implemented. Tracey said that a portion of evaluation expenditures were needed during the project development phase as well. As an example, Tracey brought Dr. Beebe into the development of the RFP for the Helpline to assure that the necessary evaluation elements were in place from the beginning. Brian Maddy also asked if the evaluation contract had been competitively bid and Tracey explained that it had not. Since it was a contract between two government entities, there was no requirement that it be competitively bid. In addition when the Program Committee sought consultation from the CDC, they recommended that the Trust look to a university with expertise in evaluating tobacco control programs, and with the ability to grow as additional programs were funded. The OU College of Public Health was selected because they had the capacity and experience, and were willing to sub-contract with OSU for media evaluation because of their expertise and capacity in that arena. Mr. Maddy suggested that in the future the Board should consider looking beyond the traditional entities to perform evaluation in order to avoid the appearance of favoring OU or OSU as opposed to a private institution. Gay Tudor joined the Board meeting. Strategic Planning Committee Report Dr. McCaffree said that the Strategic Planning Committee had been working with Leslie Pine, the consultant from The Philanthropic Initiative to prepare for a Board retreat to update the strategic plan and set funding priorities for the next few years. Brian Maddy left the Board meeting. Susan Biz joined the Board meeting. Funding Priorities TSET consultant, Leslie Pine with The Philanthropic Initiative, facilitated the Board discussion on funding priorities. She said the Board has a wonderful opportunity to accomplish important things for the State of Oklahoma. Ms. Pine stated that the issue at this point was figuring out how to have the greatest impact with the resources available. She said she considered the current strategic plan to be a building block and that the plan reflected a lot of what is considered to be ""best practice"" in the world of philanthropy, being very outcome oriented, working toward measurable results, focusing available funding to maximize impact, leveraging other resources and collaborating with other groups in a way that could enhance the impact the Trust's resources. Ms. Pine said that the strategic plan has some very ambitious goals and a vision for what the Board wants the Trust to accomplish over time. For example the goals of reducing overall usage of tobacco among children and adults over the next six or seven years are very clear.   Based on discussions with each of the Board members, Ms. Pine said that she and Tracey Strader developed options for strategic funding priorities. One of the options was to focus solely on tobacco control until results are achieved, understanding that tobacco control programs impact each of the other focus areas. Marvin Apple stated that the Board had decided that tobacco control is their number one priority. Dr. McCaffree said that all of the Board members have been in agreement with that some time now. He also said that the State Plan for Tobacco Use Prevention and Cessation was based primarily on the CDC's recommendations, which were all evidence-based recommendations and best practices. Dr. Cooper said that the Helpline touches all people across the board and that the Board should make sure that it is as effective and well-publicized as possible before moving into other initiatives. Ms. Pine said the role of the Board was to provide Tracey with enough direction to pull materials together for the Board retreat so that the Board could lay out a clear plan for how then Trusts resources could best be used over the next three to five years. After further discussion Ms. Pine concluded that the consensus among the Board was that the first priority was clearly tobacco control. Beyond that, there was a very clear desire to make the Helpline as successful as possible. Dr. Olive agreed and said the Board also needs to take another look at the Four Cornerstones, and that it seemed a logical next step would be tobacco use prevention. Presentation  Oklahoma Tobacco Helpline Implementation Sally Carter with the Oklahoma State Department of Health, Tobacco Use Prevention Service, presented on the issues involved in implementation of the Helpline. She said that a core work group was established to work intensively with Group Health Cooperative to assure timely and effective implementation of the Helpline. Weekly conference calls were held and extensive work plans were developed for Group Health and for the Oklahoma team. Ms. Carter described the processes involved throughout the 60-day implementation period, including development of a logo and marketing plan, tailoring Helpline protocols, caller materials and monthly reports for Oklahoma, assuring that callers would have the same counselor throughout their quitting process, development of databases of community-based cessation resources and health plan coverage for tobacco dependence treatment, development of promotional materials and fax referral forms for health care providers, assuring the seamless transition from the quitline vendor previously serving Tulsa County to the Oklahoma Tobacco Helpline vendor, and development of a ""secret shopper"" program to monitor services for quality. Ms. Carter acknowledged Janet Love of the OSDH and Brothers & Co. for their work on the logo and marketing plan, the Native American Tobacco Coalition of Oklahoma and the Latino Community Development Agency for their assistance in materials development to deal with issues of ceremonial use of tobacco among Native Americans and Spanish translations of the fax referral form and other materials, Dr. Beebe and Leslie Ballenger of the OU College of Public Health for their assistance with the reporting requirements, evaluation plan, and ""secret shopper"" program, and Tracey Strader for her consultation throughout all aspects of the implementation. Brian Maddy returned to the Board meeting.   Dr. Cooper requested that the workgroup contact the Stillwater Community Health Center and mail them some of the `tip cards' to have available for their patients. Ms. Carter agreed to do this and to provide those materials to the Board members to distribute as needed. Presentation  Best Practices in Cessation Systems Dr. McCaffree introduced Abby Rosenthal from the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Office on Smoking and Health. Ms. Rosenthal is an expert on cessation services and systems interventions. Abby Rosenthal stated that the Board was doing an incredible job, and that most states have been unable to move into implementation of a Helpline or other cessation services quite as quickly. She attributed this accomplishment to the hard work of the Board members, Tracey Strader, Sally Carter, and other partners that have been involved to date, and expressed her confidence that this momentum would carry the TSET forward toward achieving their goals. In addition, Ms. Rosenthal said that policies such as Oklahoma's new Smoke-Free Workplaces and Public Places Act, and the initiative to increase the excise tax on tobacco products definitely work toward changing the social norms around tobacco use. She also said that higher prices for tobacco products, reducing the cost of treatment, counter-advertising, and clean indoor air policies are all part of a comprehensive approach to reducing tobacco use. Ms. Rosenthal said that while the policies will serve to promote cessation and reduce youth initiation, it is also important to help the health insurers understand that not treating tobacco use is costing them, and that there is a need to promote full coverage of tobacco dependence treatment. Oklahoma's smoking prevalence is right at the national average, but smokeless or ""spit"" tobacco use in Oklahoma is higher than the national average. While the direct and indirect costs of tobacco use are in the range of $300 to $500 per capita in most states, in Oklahoma tobacco use costs $600 per capita. Ms. Rosenthal stated that the CDC has been encouraging states to think in terms of comprehensive programming when implementing a Helpline and that Oklahoma is well on the way to doing this. The fact that the Helpline will allow fax referrals will be an outstanding opportunity to begin to promote tobacco dependence treatment among health systems. Ms. Rosenthal said that according to the Community Preventive Services Task Force, provider training alone doesn't work. What works is an overall system to address tobacco use, that includes provider training in combination with office practice changes to assure that all patients are screened for tobacco use at every visit (as a vital sign), and tobacco users are offered assistance with quitting and referral to the Helpline. Ms. Rosenthal said that a few managed care organizations have been able to implement other things like the 305.1 ICD-9 code for tobacco dependence, as a method of tracking tobacco users within a health system and seeking reimbursement when services are covered. The Board and Ms. Rosenthal discussed several issues around an employer's ability to identify their employees who smoke including running pharmacy data, or looking at certain CPT codes, in order to inform them of the Helpline. Ms. Rosenthal said that some of the larger employers   have simply done blanket educational programs, rather than acting on private information. Others have offered Health Risk Assessments (HRA) and, with consent, have fed information and educational materials back to smokers identified through the HRA. Some large employers ask employees to self-identify as smokers and then either pay for tobacco dependence treatment or charge the employee higher insurance premiums. Brian Maddy said that it would be important to work with the programs serving state employees and the OU physicians to implement tobacco dependence treatment systems similar to the work that has begun with the Health Care Authority. Sally Carter said that the OSDH and other partners have been creating action plans to begin the work with a variety of health systems to address comprehensive coverage of tobacco dependence treatment. Board Retreat After a review of Board member availability, Board members agreed to hold a retreat on Friday, November 7th and Saturday morning, November 8th for the purpose of updating the strategic plan and setting funding priorities for the next three to five years. Tracey Strader agreed to explore meeting location options in Tulsa and notify the Board as soon as possible. Brian Maddy made a motion to reschedule the October 8th Board meeting to November 7th and 8th . Dr. Cooper seconded the motion and the motion passed unanimously.

Employee was technically advanced; dress and grooming were very professional. Another customer wanted to access employer web sites, but was told he could not do this. Was there a misunderstanding? The answer to these questions depends on what employer sites were wanted by the customer.  Debra VanLeeuwen, Mystery Shopper at Park City, said her report was the same as Mystery Shopper #1.

S. Census, the population 65 years of age or older grew at 82%. One in eight Americans is 65 years old or older. By 2010, about 67 million people 65 years of 2     age will be living in the United States. Because of a tight labor market, employers will look for strategies to keep the business fully staffed. Corporate Culture: Rethink and change attitudes about older adults in the workplace. For every dollar spent on elder care benefits, it is estimated there is a return of $1.50 through higher productivity, retention, reduced absenteeism and turnover. This makes for a win-win situation: Employers view older workers as reliable, flexible, competent and healthy. You can teach somebody technical skills any day of the week, but you cannot amass 20-30 years of business savvy and interpersonal skills that only time develops. Older workers are concerned about lack of training; prefer flexible schedules and phased retirement. Title V's grant for the Aging includes money for computer training.

As you leave be really, really careful. Your representation at the Park City Council of Councils was appreciated. We have received training and new ideas and still have a lot to do to build and present ourselves. There are issues to target and decisions of what to do about them. In the mean time, let’s focus on the Mystery Shopper activity which permits us to give feedback to DWS and DWS to educate us on the available services.   OUTSTANDING CUSTOMER SERVICE RECOGNITION - Kevin Crandall                           1. Kent Gygi                           Going extra mile for all customers; giving quality    service. Example was displayed during lunch today - he bought Judy Bell a Diet    Coke today so she could have a diet drink with her lunch!     Employers request him often for writing job orders, recruiting             and other needs they may have.                                 2. Sherami Jara                           Has the ability of putting people at ease with her    exceptional customer service.     She was involved with coordinating a customer conference where             customers gave feedback on what made them comfortable when applying             for services, etc.                                         MYSTERY SHOPPER UPDATE/ASSIGNMENTS - Bill Snow                           1. The Pilot Project has been completed and positive as well as         negative feedback has been gathered and reported.           2. The objectives which were feedback concerning DWS services to the         Employment Centers and education about DWS (services, pathways,         processes) for the Regional Council were met.           3. The Mystery Shopper program will continue.                           Two Mystery Shopper visits will be made to each    Employment Center bi-monthly.     Completed by January 24, 2002     American Fork: Jack Trent     Heber/Park City: Christie Hulet will send two Micron    staff members     Payson: Gary Ashby     Provo Employment Center: Kevin Crandall     Use the telephone as a job seeker for part of the    mystery shopping. This would be helpful since the telephone referrals at the    Provo Employment Center have tripled, and it would be good to review the    service being given.     Rate only the categories that are applicable.     Use the Mountainland Mystery Shopper Survey to gather                 feedback. A written summary is also acceptable.                                                             4. Mystery Shoppers will present findings at each full Council         meeting.           5. The Executive Council members will discuss and evaluate each of         the surveys before releasing the data to the Region Management Team.           6. The Regional Council Executive Committee will finalize the         report(s) and present the information in Mountainland Region Management         Team meeting.           7. Individual Center data will be shared with the Employment Center         manager.           8. Individual Center data will not be shared with other Centers.           9. Based on the scores received, Centers may receive a grade, A or B,         but competition has been removed; thus, the original traveling trophy         and celebration is eliminated.                   CUSTOMER SIMULATION EXERCISE -  Hour                           1. Each Council member will be given a scenario and assigned to an         employment counselor who will be expecting them.                           It will be necessary to give a social security    number, but the information you give for the Form 61 is not trackable, etc.     The information (name, SS#, address, etc.) will be    entered into the computer, but can be made inactive.     Scenarios     #1 Kevin Crandall (Shane Jorgenson)     #3 Christie Hulett (Jenny Nisonger)     #4 Rickie Bryant (Bret Pope)     #5 Ron Tiffany (Veterans)     #7 Judy Bell (Michelle Viertel)     #8 Rod Crockett (Colleen Cowden)     #9 Duane Frisby (Susan Rogers)     #10 Jack Trent (Sarianna Kay)     #12 Larry Ellertson (David Matkin)     #13 Gary Ashby (Jason Miller)                                                             2. Begin at the Information Desk. Give the Information Specialist the         scenario information and follow the pathway as directed.           3. There are four types of services.                           Core     Intensive     Training     Support                                 4. Go to the Information Desk and present the reason you are at the         Center today to the Information Specialist. Follow the instructions and         pathway as directed.           5. As you proceed, ask these questions to yourself: What services         were offered? Was it easy to access these services?           6. If you find something while shopping, make a recommendation(s) to         managers.                           It is important to have staff up on newspaper    articles as to the jobs available. Customers come to DWS wanting information    on job ads such as the one hiring air marshals. There was no information to be    had about this ad. Some information is being shared. Sometimes there is no    information, even after several inquiring phone calls.     Services may be labeled alphabetical, but as a shopper be             careful in judging the information given as the official title may             not be used, but the same information may be given under different             terms.                                 7. After following the ""customer"" scenario, complete the         Mountainland Mystery Shopper Survey and give to Julie.           8. Julie and Bill will rate A or B and report to the Regional         Council.           9. The Mystery Shopper feedback will then be reported in Region         Management Meeting.           10. TANF RAINY UPDATE/PACMIS PROPOSAL - Dave Ostrom                           1. The PACMIS Gap Analysis of October 9, 2001, was performed by         Information Technology International.                           The purpose was to determine whether PACMIS (Public    Assistance Case Management Information System) adequately meets the    eligibility-related business needs of Department of Human Services, DWS and    Department of Health.     Based on the report findings, PACMIS is only meeting    52% of business needs. It only does what we tell it to do. It does not support    looking at other programs. It is now a support system, but a decision making    system is needed.     Recommendations were to replace PACMIS.                                 2. PACMIS is a project costing approximately 20 million dollars and         does have an impact on TANF dollars. Shortfalls caused money shifts.         There are programs that are not being worked on or utilized which would         allow monies. The Adult Literacy program has given $117,000 for the         ""new"" PACMIS.                           Concern: How will the programs giving up money be    impacted? It seems unfair - people versus program.     Answer: PACMIS will utilize information and give assistance to             people more accurately and readily; thus, the people really are             served better.                                 3. PACMIS will come from partnering with other states who want to         implement, some product will be purchased and some will be developed on         our own. TANF surplus funds will be paying for this.                           The expense to enhance the current PACMIS system was    proposed at 2.6 million. The decision was to put this amount into the pot to    building a new system.     Projects in session have money to fund them.     $400,000 is being used to begin the new PACMIS    system.     #42 Education and Training Software-Mtland $183,000     #43 Grant to Fund Literacy Program-Mtland $40,000     #44 Discretionary Services, Family Issues-Mtland $200,000                                                             4. MOTION by Ron Tiffany for approval.                           Rod Crockett seconded the motion.     The voting was unanimous.         PROPOSAL for OREM EMPLOYMENT CENTER AND REGIONAL ADMINISTRATION OFFICE -     John Talcott                       1. Justification                           Consistency of Services     Convenience to Customers     Improved Customer Service     Employment Center Design     Consolidation of Offices eliminating duplication of offices in             the same city.                                 2. Approximate cost for the above building: $460,000. This amount         would come from the operating budget. There would be no additional cost         to the State. The on-going costs a year would be $247,000. Other         agencies will rent the currently DWS Region occupied 3rd and 4th floor         spaces at 150 E Center which will pay the State so tax payers are not         getting hit. Agencies are already showing a great interest as to when         DWS will vacate and what properties (desks, chairs, etc.) will remain.           3. Floor space would be 16,500 square feet which is 11,000 square         feet less than what the Region now occupies. However, a lot of the         27,500 square feet we now pay for, is wasted space. The Region does not         facilitate the kind of service DWS gives. The Region would be housed in         the same building, but would be separate from the Employment Center.           4. Central north Orem is the location in mind, but the specific         property has not been selected. There is a glut of office space for rent         in Orem. There will be O&N included on the rent on the new facility.         Fifteen dollars ($15.00), which is a ball park figure includes O&N.           5. It is desired to have the contract secured in the next four to six         months, but the Council’s support is needed by way of vote before this         proposal can be taken to the building utilization committee. This is         early in the process, but it takes a long time to complete the necessary         steps.           6. MOTION by Jack Trent to accept the proposal for an Orem Employment         Center and Regional Administration Office. John forward on to DFCM.                           Seconded by Gary Ashby     A unanimous vote from the 8 Council Members present    was received.     4 additional votes will be taken by telephone calls to the             Council members not present to vote. A total of 12 votes are needed             to have a valid count. Report at the January 24, 2002                                 7. Concern: Will there be money left for failure of equipment and         etc.? Computer recycles will not be impacted.           8. Next Steps (Depending on result telephone calls to voting Council         Members.)                           Present proposal to the building utilization    committee.     Make recommendation to the Senior Management Team,    pending approval to proceed.     Get with the facility planner of DFC - work on RFP,    select site.     Develop floor plans     Have the proposal hit the paper by February, 2002.     If DWS has the money to pay for the building, DFCM will give             the approval.     COUNCIL CONCERNS - None expressed.   DATE OF NEXT MEETINGS                       January 24, 2002 - Location TBA     No meetings in February, 2002.

For the past five years, this conference has been a forum for States        to learn about the latest findings in evaluations of welfare reform, strategize        about ways to incorporate evaluation results into the design and implementation        of programs and policies, and develop effective strategies to ensure sound        evaluations of welfare reform. This year’s conference will continue        to serve this purpose by featuring new research on a range of topics such        as the relationship between marriage and family structure on low-income        populations, services for the hard to employ, barriers to employment, assessments        of the impacts of welfare reform, as well as methods to measure social policy        impact. Additionally, we have made a number of changes that we believe will        enhance the experience of conference participants including moving to a        new hotel located within the District of Columbia and providing this comprehensive        and interactive conference Web site.            In preparing for the conference,          the Web site will be a primary source for information. Based on recommendations          from our previous conferences, we’re constructing an agenda that          will maximize the opportunity for interaction among the participants,          while featuring up-to-date research results and the latest developments          in the evaluation field.                   On the Web site you can register          for the conference using our secure server, as well as download information          on hotel reservations, air or ground transportation, as well as amenities          in Washington, D.C. If you have any questions or need assistance and can’t          find it on the Web site, please contact Brendan Kelly by phone at (202)          401-5600 or via E-mail at  bkelly@acf.hhs.gov .                             Building on the success of previous          conferences, we intend to provide participants with a valuable opportunity          to work together as well as share findings and assess applicable lessons          from current welfare reform evaluation projects. I hope you will join          us in May.

CVC Tom Hart, Moss Landing Fisherman's Association Draft Meeting Notes  a Brief Summary of the Meeting's Proceedings. Welcome and Introductions: Dave E., BTAP Chair gave welcoming comments and individual introductions commenced. Items Not on the Agenda/Announcements: 1) Mike B. reminded those attending that some of the workgroups associated with the Sanctuary's Joint Management Plan Review Process (JMPR) may continue meeting longer. 2) Stephanie H. gave a very brief overview of the SAC Coordinators Meeting held in Santa Barbara in February. 3) Laura C. indicated an interest in working on a ""50 Ways to get Your Feet Wet in the MBNMS"" type brochure for Monterey County. 4) Steve S. mentioned that the MBNMS is looking at potential sites for a Visitor Center. February 2003 SAC Meeting Review: Dave E. reviewed some of the major topics discussed at the SAC meeting. These included cruise ships, the National Marine Sanctuary Program (NMSP) ""white paper"" on regulatory coordination between the NMSP and the National Marine Fisheries Service, a presentation on oil spill prevention and response activities, sanctuary staffing, etc. For more information on the February SAC meeting, see the SAC meeting minutes located on the Sanctuary's web site at http://montereybay.nos.noaa.gov/intro/advisory/sac_min.html. Steve S. commented that there were still a lot of questions to be answered about spill response and prevention and more detail was needed on where clean up vessels were located, what was in place in the  1   region, how dispersants would be used, and whether and how fishermen might be involved in response. Letter Writing Protocols for Working Groups Update: Dave E. reported on a March 10th meeting he had with Sanctuary Superintendent Bill Douros, SAC Chair Stephanie Harlan, Research Activities Panel (RAP) Chair Chris Harrold and Pat Clark-Gray, Chair of the Sanctuary Education Panel (SEP) (the Chairs of the Conservation Working Group were invited but could not attend). The meeting was convened in response to a request by Dave E. on behalf of the BTAP to try and iron out more consistent protocols for the BTAP, RAP, SEP, and CWG to follow when sending letters to the MBNMS or SAC or taking other actions. Dave E. reported that Bill's position was that letters written by these working groups to the Sanctuary Superintendent or the SAC had to be reviewed and approved by him before they were formally submitted. Rachel S. clarified that the Sanctuary was not in fact talking about approving letters, but having a chance to review and discuss the issues ahead of time. Rachel S. stated that this was the way the other work groups have generally operated and that the idea behind it was to facilitate open lines of communication. Steve S. and Tony W. agreed that enhanced communication and seeking a higher standard was generally a good thing, but continued to question why letters had to be reviewed ahead of time. Mike B. noted that it was an extra step that he found unusual. Maggie I. expressed strong negative feelings about it and said that she thought that it would repel people. A question was also raised about whether SAC AtLarge members would have to follow the same protocol in sending correspondence to the SAC or MBNMS. Rachel S. indicated that a recent memo brought forward to the SAC by an At-Large member regarding staffing issues had been reviewed and discussed with Bill and MBNMS staff prior to it being sent on to the SAC. Dave E. closed the discussion by indicating that Bill had agreed to come to the next BTAP meeting in May and that the group could talk directly to Bill about this issue if needed. The SAC will also be reviewing the SAC charter and protocols at their April 4th meeting, and so may also address this matter. Cruise Ships Update: Steve S. reported on the actions taken by the Monterey City Council to address the recently disclosed discharge in the MBNMS by the vessel Crystal Harmony, owned by Crystal Cruise Lines. The City Council voted to ban the cruise line for 15 years and ban the particular vessel forever. They also adopted several amendments to the City's Cruise Line Action Plan. Rachel S. noted the action taken by the SAC at its February meeting recommending that the MBNMS develop and implement a regulation prohibiting harmful cruise ship discharges. Fishing White Paper: Steve S. raised concerns over the recent released ""white paper"" on regulatory coordination between the NMSP and the National Marine Fisheries Service. The ""white paper"" was developed by National Marine Sanctuary Program Headquarters and is a statement of national policy applying to all the sanctuaries. (A copy of the policy paper can be found as a PDF file at the following web link, under the 11:00 a.m. agenda item: http://montereybay.nos.noaa.gov/sac/2003/020703/agenda.html). Steve S. stated that to a large degree the language was consistent with the Sanctuary's designation documents, but that the tone was more aggressive and it asserted a stronger role for the  2   sanctuary with regard to the management of fishing. He expressed concern that it was going to replace or supercede the current language in the MBNMS management plan. The SAC at its February meeting took action in support of sending a letter to the Secretary of Commerce expressing their view that the ""white paper"" will make it more difficult for the Sanctuary to work successfully with the fishing community. In the letter the SAC also requested that the language not replace or supercede what's in the MBNMS designation documents. Rachel S. passed out a copy of the SAC letter to the group. Joint Management Plan Review (JMPR) Workgroup Updates: Several people attending the meeting reported on the progress of some of the JMPR workgroups they are involved with. Kelly S. gave a brief overview of the motorized personal watercraft (MPWC) workgroup, but focused primarily on the issue of tow-in surfing as one item the workgroup is grappling with (will it be allowed and, if so, where will the exceptions be). Kathy F. spoke about several of the workgroups: 1) Incorporating Fishing Issues into Education and Research  Kathy noted her view that the Sanctuary should focus on facilitating research, rather than conducting it themselves and she noted a role for the Sanctuary to cooperate with Cal Fish and Game to pull info together; she also noted the need for community involvement in the process 2) Davidson Seamount  Kathy said the focus here was on the value of the benthic habitat and whether or not the area should be further evaluated for inclusion in the Sanctuary. She relayed concerns that fishermen have about the Sanctuary regulating fishing in the future. She stated that industry would likely favor other alternatives for the area and probably would not be in favor of expanding the MBNMS boundary. Mike B. briefly reported on the Desalination workgroup and indicated that generally things were moving along. Art S. talked about the goals for the Tidepool Protection workgroup and reported that the workgroup had identified various sites within the Sanctuary and that they were dealing with a number of issues (i.e., visitation, take, trampling, etc). Steve S. reported that within the Marine Protected Areas workgroup there was much spirited debate about the need for mpa's, identifying what problems mpa's fix, other potential tools, and the relationship between the Sanctuary's effort and that state of California's Marine Life Protection Act effort .For more information on the specific workgroups and issues, please see the JMPR web site at http://sanctuaries.nos.noaa.gov/jointplan/. Sanctuary Scenic Trail (SST): Time ran out for any discussion of this item, but Rachel S. passed out a brochure on the trail and suggested that this was a project that the business and tourism community might get involved in. Additional Announcements: An announcement was made that Monty Criss, SAC Tourism Rep (alternate) and BTAP Co-Chair has resigned from his seat on the Council. Monty has taken a job in the Bay Area. The MBNMS will be conducting a recruitment process for the seat and will be sending out a notice in within the next month or so. The meeting then adjourned. Next BTAP Meeting: The next BTAP meeting is May 21st from 9:30-11:30 a.m. Location: TBA, but possibly Moss Landing Marine Lab.  3"
GX239-31-9185307	DHS  Home  | Contact Us  |  Search  DHS  |  Site Map  |  Related Links                Texas Board of Human Services  Minutes – May 18, 2001    The Texas Board of Human Services convened at 10:13 a.m. at the Texas Department  of Human Services, 701 West 51st Street, Austin, Texas. Board members in attendance  were Chair David Herndon, Jon M. Bradley, John Cuellar, Manson B. Johnson, Jerry  Kane, and Terry Durkin Wilkinson. A quorum was present. Also present were Commissioner  Eric M. Bost and department staff. The parliamentarian was J.B. McReynolds.   Agenda Item No. 1 – Approval of the April 20, 2001 minutes.  Mr. Johnson  moved to approve the minutes and Ms. Wilkinson seconded the motion. The board  approved the minutes without discussion.   Agenda Item No. 2 – Proposed budget adjustments, FY 2000-2001.  Bobby  Halfmann presented the item to the board. Ms. Wilkinson commended Mr. Bost and  DHS staff for their leadership and hard work in earning enhanced funds. Mr. Herndon  asked if the budget adjustments would affect existing programs, and Mr. Halfmann  replied that the funds that were being transferred from one fiscal year to the  next were lapsed funds and so no programs were adversely affected. No public testimony  was offered.   Ms. Wilkinson moved to approve the adjustments. Mr. Bradley seconded the motion,  and the board approved the item.   After the item was approved, Mr. Herndon opened the floor for discussion of  the FY 2002-03 budget. Mr. Bost told the board that the budget was not yet finalized  and DHS staff has only preliminary information. Mr. Halfmann said that a proposed  operating budget for fiscal 2002 will be brought to the board in June, when the  agency has more information about the final appropriations bill. Board approval  for the operating budget will be sought in July.   Agenda Item No. 3 – Proposed rules to collect claims against clients who  traffic Food Stamp benefits.  George Duran presented the item to the board.  There was no discussion or public testimony.   Mr. Kane moved to approve the item, and Mr. Cuellar seconded the motion. The  board approved the item.   Agenda Item No. 4 – Presentation: results of the customer services studies.   Eric Bost and Suzanne Biermann presented the item to the board. Mr. Bost reported  that DHS undertook two customer services studies to make sure clients were being  treated with dignity and respect and DHS staff were receiving appropriate training.  He said that the agency had been criticized about its customer service, without  solid evidence that supported the allegations. Achieving positive customer services  has been a DHS priority over the past couple of years, he said, and the studies  gave the agency measurable data to identify and analyze problem areas.    Ms. Biermann described the mail survey, which was sent to 3,500 long-term care  and 3,600 Texas Works clients and provided DHS with a statewide, statistically  valid sample of responses. The University of North Texas Survey Research Center  conducted the survey. The mystery shopper assessment was performed by Business  Resources, Inc., a business that conducts mystery shopping for a variety of private  and public entities. The mystery shopper assessment provided DHS with a snapshot  view of how clients may be handled in various offices around the state.    Ms. Biermann stated that clients reported an overall high level of satisfaction  with DHS services. Areas identified for improvement included the automated phone  system messages, the amount of time clients are kept waiting for appointments  or on the phone, and information given to clients about how to file a complaint  against the agency. Ms. Biermann also said that the agency has implemented telephone  technology and training improvements, and established customer complaint and compliment  lines in some of the regions. Also, DHS is developing an automated complaint tracking  system.   Board members asked various questions about whether such studies have been  done in the past, the use of automated telephone systems in local offices, and  general questions about how the surveys and assessments were conducted. No public  testimony was offered.    Agenda Item No. 5 – Presentation: TIERS client self-screener . Eric Bost,  Suzanne Biermann and Kirsten Jumper presented the item to the board. Mr. Bost  opened the presentation by explaining that the newly developed TIERS self-screener,  called STARS, achieved a milestone in improving customer service. Texas is leading  the nation in using technology to make systems more efficient and improve services  to clients, he said. Ms. Biermann told the board that the goal of STARS was to  improve public access to and understanding about available services. The screener  is a confidential, bilingual, online Internet application that will screen for  services across many state agencies. It was piloted in February 2001 in Austin  and San Marcos, and is expected to be available to the general public in July.     Kirsten Jumper walked the board through the screening process using a fictitious  family. Board members asked questions about the screens, project implementation  and the availability of management reports.   Bruce Bower, an attorney with Texas Legal Services Center, told the board that  the TIERS staff was very open to input from public interest groups when developing  the STARS screener. He suggested that the screener be modified to accommodate  people who are visually impaired and to include a list of county assistance programs.   Agenda Item No. 6 – Commissioner’s report.  Commissioner Eric M. Bost  briefed the board on the following:     Governor Perry received a letter from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA)  announcing an award of $28.6 million to DHS in enhanced funding.    DHS staff have deemed more than 100,000 children eligible for the Children’s  Health Insurance Program (CHIP), which is significant because the DHS is not responsible  for determining CHIP eligibility.    Managing problems within 14 nursing facilities run by Crescent Care is coming  to an end. DHS staff and court-appointed trustees have stabilized abandoned facilities  and either found new owners or closed facilities and moved the clients.    DHS staff has been surveying clients, advocates and staff on ways to improve  eligibility determination, and in the next week or so will be synthesizing responses  to determine where improvements could be made.    The Senate committee confirmation hearing went well last Wednesday, and Mr.  Bost is waiting consideration by the full U.S. Senate of his appointment to the  USDA.     Mr. Herndon adjourned the meeting at 11:33 p.m.   I certify that the above minutes of the May 18, 2001 meeting of the Texas Board  of Human Services are a true and correct copy and were approved by the board on  June 15, 2001.       Kristie Zamrazil  Board Secretary   A copy of the approved Board of Human Services meeting minutes will be submitted  along with corresponding agenda items to the Legislative Reference Library and  the State Library and Archives Commission.

Meeting Date: Wednesday, January 15, 2003          Time: 9:30-11:30 AM        Location:  Moss Landing Marine Laboratories         Attendance:                   Dave           Ebert, BTAP Chair, SAC Business/Industry Representative           Rachel           Saunders, Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary           Sean           Morton, Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary           Michael           Bekker, Cannery Row Company, Monterey           Steve           Schieblauer, Monterey Harbor, City of Monterey           Art           Seavey, Monterey Abalone Company           Tony           Warman, SAC Business Alternate           Steve           Abbott, Duke Energy, Moss Landing           Kathy             Fosmark, Alliance of Communities for Sustainable Fisheries           Jorge             Corral Meza, West Marine                 Draft           Meeting Notes – a Brief Summary of the Meeting’s         Proceedings.         Welcome         and Introductions:                   Dave               E., BTAP Chair gave welcoming comments and individual introductions             commenced.                 Items         Not on the Agenda:                   Steve               S. asked that recent SAC discussions about cruise ships be put             on the agenda.           Dave             E. wanted to discuss protocols for the working groups to write letters                 to the SAC and/or               the Sanctuary Superintendent.                  Letter         Writing Protocols for Working Groups:                   Dave               E. expressed concerned about the Sanctuary’s stance regarding the protocol                               for working groups to use to write letters to the SAC                 and/or Bill Douros, Sanctuary                               Superintendent. He said that the various working groups                 seemed to be handling this differently and that one consistent protocol                               needed                               to                               be developed. He indicated that at various times Bill                 had informed                               the SAC and BTAP that all letters written by working                 group chairs to the                               sanctuary superintendent had to be reviewed and approved                 by the Superintendent prior to formally submitting them. Several BTAP                               members questioned                               this approach and why letters had to be reviewed ahead                 of time.                               Dave also                               raised questions about what actions the working groups                 could take vs. the SAC. Rachel noted that Bill and SAC Chair Stephanie                               Harlan                               were meeting                               next week to talk about these and other issues. After                 some discussion                               BTAP members at the meeting agreed that Dave should write                 a letter to Bill requesting that Bill, the SAC chair and working group                               chairs meet                               to iron out a formal protocol for working groups sending                 letters                               to the superintendent and to discuss other working group             protocol issues.                  December         2002 SAC Meeting:                    The               focus of this discussion was on the cruise ship item at the December               6, 2002 SAC meeting. At the SAC                     meeting, the Conservation                                   Working                                 Group (CWG) reviewed a letter they sent addressing                   3 issues, one                                   of which                                   was cruise ship discharges. The CWG recommended                     that a new sanctuary regulation                                   be enacted that would prohibit discharges from                     cruise ships. While Peter Grenell, SAC Harbor Rep, made                   a motion calling on                                   the SAC to support                                   adoption of a cruise ship dumping ban, the SAC                     voted to delay taking                                   action in favor of developing a more formal resolution                                   for consideration by the SAC at their February                     2003 meeting. Steve S. reiterated                                   his concern that no prior notification was had                     made that the SAC was                                 going to take                                   action on this issue at the December meeting and                   that no one from the cruise industry had been contacted                     about a                                   possible                                   regulation..                                 Kathy                                   F. expressed concern that a regulation on cruise                   ship discharges would open the door to the regulation of                     other, smaller craft.                             Tony                                 raised                                   a question as to whether the best approach was                     to target cruise ships as a “bad industry” or whether                     the better approach was to lean on them to do a better job. Steve                     S. indicated that the Sanctuary                                   was doing a good job on the cruise ship issue but                     felt that studies should be done regarding the impacts from other                     large vessels too (tankers,                                   military, etc). Mike B. noted the positive aspect                     of cruise ship visits in terms of good pr for the area and increased                     business for the area                                   through return visits.

Joint         Management Plan Review (JMPR):                    Sean               Morton provided a brief update on the JMPR process,                       the issues and                                       the workgroups. For                                       more information                                       on the specific workgroups, please see the               JMPR web site at                                      http://sanctuaries.nos.noaa.gov/jointplan/ .               Sean was asked whether alternates would be allowed                       to sit on                                       the workgroups. Sean explained that because               it was very important to                                       have as much consistency                                       in participation on the work groups as possible,                                       alternates would not be permitted. Sean indicated                                       that observers                                       would be permitted                                       and                                       that the meetings are open to the public. He                       also reminded folks that they                                       could certainly contact and talk to any of               the workgroup members. Sean was also asked how the                                       workgroups would                                       make decisions.                                       Sean explained                                       a consensus process for coming up with recommendations                                       (the outline for this process is on the web               at the JMPR site identified                                       above).                                       If consensus                                       can’t be reach those items, along with                                       the consensus items, will be brought forward                                       to the SAC to consider and then ultimately                                       to the                                       Sanctuary program. Some at the meeting wondered                                       how the SAC would be able to be informed enough                                       to make decisions on such complex                                       issues. Sean said that the SAC will be fully                                       briefed on the findings of each                                       workgroup and will have time to digest the material                                       prior to making any                                       decisions. Kathy F. expressed concern about the                                       make-up of the marine reserves workgroup, contending                                       that it was very heavy                                       with conservation                                       representatives. Kathy also questioned whether                                       the socioeconomic rep on the workgroup was biased.                                       Sean indicated that there was                                       actually a                                       diverse mix of stakeholders on the reserves workgroup                                       and all the other workgroups (e.g., for the list                                       of participants on the                                       marine                                       reserves             workgroup please see:  http://sanctuaries.nos.noaa.gov/jointplan/mb_mpa.html ).                 BTAP         Role and Future Directions:                     This               item was continued from the November meeting and                                           was identified                                           as a                                           focal point of                                           discussion                                           for this                                           meeting. However, time ran out before any                       discussion could occur. Several people                                           suggested that some additional folks be               recruited for the BTAP; specific names mentioned were                                           Hank Armstrong                                           from                                           the Monterey                                           Bay Aquarium                                           (Mike B. offered to contact him), folks               from kayaking businesses (Kayak Connections                                           was mentioned and Steve S. offered to contact                                           them), and the dive reps on the SAC (Dave                       E. offered to             contact them).

He announced Susan Bizé would be      joining the meeting later, and introduced Joann Stevenson, the new liaison      from the Attorney General's office.       Meeting with Secretary Adelson      Dr. McCaffree reported that he and Tracey Strader met with the new Secretary      of Health, Tom Adelson to orient him to the Trust. Secretary Adelson had      some very pertinent questions about the Trust's operations and programs and      offered this assistance and support, as needed.        Press Conference launch of the Helpline      Dr. McCaffree reported that he and the Governor, Treasurer, Attorney General      addressed a room filled with press and supporters from across the State,      during the August 20th press conference to launch the Oklahoma Tobacco      Helpline. The television, newspaper, and radio coverage that followed      resulted in nearly 600 calls the first day and another 400 calls the second      day. Tracey Strader said that the Attorney General pointed out that Dr.      McCaffree was there ""to carry the freight"" in 1996 when Oklahoma's lawsuit      against the tobacco industry was filed and that he was at the press      conference seven years later ""to deliver the cargo.""       Resolution – ""Recognizing Tracy Foor, Charter Board Member and      Secretary""      Dr. McCaffree announced that Tracy Foor had resigned from the Board. Tracy      indicated that he resigned due to his commitments to his students, church,      and family. His resignation letter was very complimentary of Tracey's work      and the Board's accomplishments to date. Dr. McCaffree directed the Board      members to a resolution and plaque that were prepared in recognition of      Tracy's exceptional service. Marvin Apple made a motion to approve the      resolution, ""Recognizing Tracy Foor, Charter Board Member and Secretary"".      Dr. Cooper seconded the motion and the motion passed unanimously.       Upcoming Training Events      Tracey reminded the Board of these upcoming training events: 1) the American      Public Health Association Annual Meeting in San Francisco, CA, November 15th      - 19th. The deadline for early registration is September 5th. 2) The      National Conference on Tobacco or Health in Boston, MA, December 10th-12th.      The deadline for early registration is also in early September. 3) The      Oklahoma State Department of Health is sponsoring a workshop on the      Community Preventive Services Task Force recommendations, October 21st. The      location is pending.        Notice of election of officers to take place at the next Board meeting      Dr. McCaffree announced that officers would be elected at the next Board      meeting. He said that although officers may be re-elected, according to the      enabling legislation the Chair can only serve two consecutive terms, and he      is currently serving his second term. Marvin Apple stated that Dr. McCaffree      would still be eligible to serve as Vice-chair or Secretary. He also said      that he believed that the Chair should be near the Oklahoma City area in      order to easily respond to the media, get to the Capitol, or respond to      other immediate needs as necessary.        Certification of FY 2003 Earnings      Dr. McCaffree welcomed state Treasurer Robert Butkin and expressed the      Board's appreciation for the leadership he provided in establishing the      Trust and his continued partnership the organization's accomplishments.      Treasurer Butkin expressed his appreciation to Tracey, Dorothy, and the      Board for their cooperation, and stated that it had been a pleasure to      participate in the recent Helpline press conference. He said that the Board      of Investors met on August 21st, reviewed the Fund's performance over the      last fiscal year, and voted to certify to the full amount of earnings from      FY 2003 of $2,757,686.05 net of any investment management fees.        Board of Investors Operating Budget      Treasurer Butkin requested approval for the $5,500 operating budget for the      Board of Investors. He explained that the investment management expenses      were not included in the budget request this year because, as a result of HB      1457, investment management expenses are no longer considered an operating      expense.       Treasurer Butkin also explained that although the Trust's enabling      legislation allows the Treasurer's office to claim up to two FTE as an      operating expense beginning in FY 2004, he would not be seeking      reimbursement this year. He stated that the service he and his staff provide      to the Trust is a labor of love, and that he would refrain from seeking      reimbursement as long as possible. However, he has asked his staff,      including the Deputy Treasurer, Public Information Officer, Internal Auditor      and Comptroller to begin tracking the time they spent on TSET matters in      case there is a need to seek funding from the Trust for these services in      the future. They have spent a considerable amount of time tracking income,      interest, and dividends, staffing the Board of Investors, and providing      communications support.        Dr. McCaffree affirmed that the Board and staff have enjoyed a wonderful      working relationship with the Treasurer and his entire staff and that this      has been of great benefit to the TSET. Brian Maddy made a motion to approve      the Board of Investors operating budget. Dr. Cooper seconded the motion and      the motion passed unanimously.       Finance Committee Report      Marvin Apple reported that a change in the Policy on Allocation of Funds was      needed in order to reflect the changes brought about through HB 1457. The      policy currently states that ten percent of available funds would be placed      in reserve; however, available funds were defined as certified earnings,      less operations and investment management fees. As a result of HB 1457,      investment management fees are deducted before earnings are certified.        Joann Stevenson confirmed that the policy revision was in accordance with      the legislation. Marvin Apple made a motion to adopt the new policy on      allocation of funds. Dr. Cooper seconded the motion and the motion was      passed unanimously.       FY 2004 Operating Budget Revision      Marvin Apple explained that a revision of the operating budget (which had      been approved at the April meeting) was needed. Tracey Strader explained      that the difference between the FY 2003 budget of $210,000 and the FY 2004      budget of $288,000 was due to the fact that Dorothy Antwine joined the staff      in January, 2003 and the unexpended $30,000 budgeted for consultation in FY      2003 was to be carried over to FY 2004. Other changes included funds for an      initial purchase of grants management software, an increase in OneNet fees,      increase in fees for use of the copier, a new contract with the Attorney      General's office the services of a 1/8th time attorney.       Marvin Apple made a motion to approve the operating budget of $288,000.      Dr. Olive seconded the motion and the motion was passed unanimously.       FY 2004 Funds Available for Programs      Marvin Apple said that approximately $2.3 million should be available for      new programs. This is determined by adding certified earnings and carryover      from FY 2003, and deducting FY 2004 operating expenses, reserves, and funds      obligated to the Helpline project.        The Board discussed the Helpline's ongoing costs, including Helpline      services, media promotion, and evaluation. Brian Maddy asked if the media      promotion of the Helpline would be an ongoing cost and if that was assumed      when the Helpline project budget was approved last year. Tracey explained      that the Helpline project has always been discussed in three parts,      including services media, and evaluation. In addition the majority of funds      for the Helpline project were unexpended in FY 2003, since the contract was      not awarded until June. Marvin Apple stated that most of the Helpline      expenses projected in FY 2004 were funded with carryover from the FY 2003      budget. As a result, the majority of earnings certified from FY 2003 will be      available for new programs.        Mr. Maddy asked if the Board's vote last year included an ongoing      commitment to the media promotion budget. Dr. McCaffree said that the Board      had discussed and agreed to the need for media promotion, but he was not      certain that it was part of the vote. Tracey agreed to review the minutes      and report back on that discussion and vote.        Marvin Apple asked when the Board might expect to see an initial      evaluation of the Helpline. Tracey said that it might be possible to have      preliminary results after nine months, but that evaluation (of caller      satisfaction and quit rates) could not begin until the initial callers have      enough time to complete the program. There will be an evaluation of the      media used to promote the Helpline, but Tracey was unsure of how long it      would take to collect and analyze that data.        Brian Maddy asked if the ten percent used for surveillance and evaluation      was also separate from the Helpline services budget. Tracey replied that the      evaluation budget was separate, and this was based the Board's strategic      plan calling for an independent evaluation of all funded programs. Dr.      McCaffree said it was never part of a formal policy but rather a general      guideline. Marvin Apple said evaluation expenditures would depend on how      quickly projects were implemented. Tracey said that a portion of evaluation      expenditures were needed during the project development phase as well. As an      example, Tracey brought Dr. Beebe into the development of the RFP for the      Helpline to assure that the necessary evaluation elements were in place from      the beginning.        Brian Maddy also asked if the evaluation contract had been competitively      bid and Tracey explained that it had not. Since it was a contract between      two government entities, there was no requirement that it be competitively      bid. In addition when the Program Committee sought consultation from the CDC,      they recommended that the Trust look to a university with expertise in      evaluating tobacco control programs, and with the ability to grow as      additional programs were funded. The OU College of Public Health was      selected because they had the capacity and experience, and were willing to      sub-contract with OSU for media evaluation because of their expertise and      capacity in that arena. Mr. Maddy suggested that in the future the Board      should consider looking beyond the traditional entities to perform      evaluation in order to avoid the appearance of favoring OU or OSU as opposed      to a private institution.        Gay Tudor joined the Board meeting.       Strategic Planning Committee Report      Dr. McCaffree said that the Strategic Planning Committee had been working      with Leslie Pine, the consultant from The Philanthropic Initiative to      prepare for a Board retreat to update the strategic plan and set funding      priorities for the next few years.        Brian Maddy left the Board meeting. Susan Bizé joined the Board meeting.       Funding Priorities      TSET consultant, Leslie Pine with The Philanthropic Initiative, facilitated      the Board discussion on funding priorities. She said the Board has a      wonderful opportunity to accomplish important things for the State of      Oklahoma.        Ms. Pine stated that the issue at this point was figuring out how to have      the greatest impact with the resources available. She said she considered      the current strategic plan to be a building block and that the plan      reflected a lot of what is considered to be ""best practice"" in the world of      philanthropy, being very outcome oriented, working toward measurable      results, focusing available funding to maximize impact, leveraging other      resources and collaborating with other groups in a way that could enhance      the impact the Trust's resources.       Ms. Pine said that the strategic plan has some very ambitious goals and a      vision for what the Board wants the Trust to accomplish over time. For      example the goals of reducing overall usage of tobacco among children and      adults over the next six or seven years are very clear.        Based on discussions with each of the Board members, Ms. Pine said that      she and Tracey Strader developed options for strategic funding priorities.      One of the options was to focus solely on tobacco control until results are      achieved, understanding that tobacco control programs impact each of the      other focus areas.        Marvin Apple stated that the Board had decided that tobacco control is      their number one priority. Dr. McCaffree said that all of the Board members      have been in agreement with that some time now. He also said that the State      Plan for Tobacco Use Prevention and Cessation was based primarily on the      CDC's recommendations, which were all evidence-based recommendations and      best practices. Dr. Cooper said that the Helpline touches all people across      the board and that the Board should make sure that it is as effective and      well-publicized as possible before moving into other initiatives.        Ms. Pine said the role of the Board was to provide Tracey with enough      direction to pull materials together for the Board retreat so that the Board      could lay out a clear plan for how then Trusts resources could best be used      over the next three to five years. After further discussion Ms. Pine      concluded that the consensus among the Board was that the first priority was      clearly tobacco control. Beyond that, there was a very clear desire to make      the Helpline as successful as possible. Dr. Olive agreed and said the Board      also needs to take another look at the Four Cornerstones, and that it seemed      a logical next step would be tobacco use prevention.        Presentation – Oklahoma Tobacco Helpline Implementation      Sally Carter with the Oklahoma State Department of Health, Tobacco Use      Prevention Service, presented on the issues involved in implementation of      the Helpline. She said that a core work group was established to work      intensively with Group Health Cooperative to assure timely and effective      implementation of the Helpline. Weekly conference calls were held and      extensive work plans were developed for Group Health and for the Oklahoma      team.        Ms. Carter described the processes involved throughout the 60-day      implementation period, including development of a logo and marketing plan,      tailoring Helpline protocols, caller materials and monthly reports for      Oklahoma, assuring that callers would have the same counselor throughout      their quitting process, development of databases of community-based      cessation resources and health plan coverage for tobacco dependence      treatment, development of promotional materials and fax referral forms for      health care providers, assuring the seamless transition from the quitline      vendor previously serving Tulsa County to the Oklahoma Tobacco Helpline      vendor, and development of a ""secret shopper"" program to monitor services      for quality.        Ms. Carter acknowledged Janet Love of the OSDH and Brothers & Co. for      their work on the logo and marketing plan, the Native American Tobacco      Coalition of Oklahoma and the Latino Community Development Agency for their      assistance in materials development to deal with issues of ceremonial use of      tobacco among Native Americans and Spanish translations of the fax referral      form and other materials, Dr. Beebe and Leslie Ballenger of the OU College      of Public Health for their assistance with the reporting requirements,      evaluation plan, and ""secret shopper"" program, and Tracey Strader for her      consultation throughout all aspects of the implementation.       Brian Maddy returned to the Board meeting.       Dr. Cooper requested that the workgroup contact the Stillwater Community      Health Center and mail them some of the ‘tip cards' to have available for      their patients. Ms. Carter agreed to do this and to provide those materials      to the Board members to distribute as needed.        Presentation – Best Practices in Cessation Systems      Dr. McCaffree introduced Abby Rosenthal from the Center for Disease Control      and Prevention, Office on Smoking and Health. Ms. Rosenthal is an expert on      cessation services and systems interventions.        Abby Rosenthal stated that the Board was doing an incredible job, and      that most states have been unable to move into implementation of a Helpline      or other cessation services quite as quickly. She attributed this      accomplishment to the hard work of the Board members, Tracey Strader, Sally      Carter, and other partners that have been involved to date, and expressed      her confidence that this momentum would carry the TSET forward toward      achieving their goals. In addition, Ms. Rosenthal said that policies such as      Oklahoma's new Smoke-Free Workplaces and Public Places Act, and the      initiative to increase the excise tax on tobacco products definitely work      toward changing the social norms around tobacco use. She also said that      higher prices for tobacco products, reducing the cost of treatment,      counter-advertising, and clean indoor air policies are all part of a      comprehensive approach to reducing tobacco use.        Ms. Rosenthal said that while the policies will serve to promote      cessation and reduce youth initiation, it is also important to help the      health insurers understand that not treating tobacco use is costing them,      and that there is a need to promote full coverage of tobacco dependence      treatment. Oklahoma's smoking prevalence is right at the national average,      but smokeless or ""spit"" tobacco use in Oklahoma is higher than the national      average. While the direct and indirect costs of tobacco use are in the range      of $300 to $500 per capita in most states, in Oklahoma tobacco use costs      $600 per capita.        Ms. Rosenthal stated that the CDC has been encouraging states to think in      terms of comprehensive programming when implementing a Helpline and that      Oklahoma is well on the way to doing this. The fact that the Helpline will      allow fax referrals will be an outstanding opportunity to begin to promote      tobacco dependence treatment among health systems.        Ms. Rosenthal said that according to the Community Preventive Services      Task Force, provider training alone doesn't work. What works is an overall      system to address tobacco use, that includes provider training in      combination with office practice changes to assure that all patients are      screened for tobacco use at every visit (as a vital sign), and tobacco users      are offered assistance with quitting and referral to the Helpline. Ms.      Rosenthal said that a few managed care organizations have been able to      implement other things like the 305.1 ICD-9 code for tobacco dependence, as      a method of tracking tobacco users within a health system and seeking      reimbursement when services are covered.        The Board and Ms. Rosenthal discussed several issues around an employer's      ability to identify their employees who smoke including running pharmacy      data, or looking at certain CPT codes, in order to inform them of the      Helpline. Ms. Rosenthal said that some of the larger employers have simply      done blanket educational programs, rather than acting on private      information. Others have offered Health Risk Assessments (HRA) and, with      consent, have fed information and educational materials back to smokers      identified through the HRA. Some large employers ask employees to      self-identify as smokers and then either pay for tobacco dependence      treatment or charge the employee higher insurance premiums.        Brian Maddy said that it would be important to work with the programs      serving state employees and the OU physicians to implement tobacco      dependence treatment systems similar to the work that has begun with the      Health Care Authority. Sally Carter said that the OSDH and other partners      have been creating action plans to begin the work with a variety of health      systems to address comprehensive coverage of tobacco dependence treatment.            Board Retreat      After a review of Board member availability, Board members agreed to hold a      retreat on Friday, November 7th and Saturday morning, November 8th for the      purpose of updating the strategic plan and setting funding priorities for      the next three to five years. Tracey Strader agreed to explore meeting      location options in Tulsa and notify the Board as soon as possible.        Brian Maddy made a motion to reschedule the October 8th Board meeting to      November 7th and 8th . Dr. Cooper seconded the motion and the motion passed      unanimously.        Approval of Minutes      Brian Maddy made a motion to approve the minutes of the May 30, 2003 special      meeting of the Board of Directors. Dr. Cooper seconded the motion and the      motion passed unanimously.       Proposed Executive Session      Dr. Cooper made a motion to move into executive session. Brian Maddy      seconded the motion and the motion was passed unanimously.       Evaluation of the TSET Executive Director, Tracey Strader      After the executive session, Dr. Cooper made a motion that the Board commend      Tracey for an excellent job during her first year of employment and that      they appreciated her dedication and hard work. Dr. Olive seconded the motion      and the motion was passed unanimously.       Adjournment      Dr. Cooper made a motion to adjourn the board meeting. Brian Maddy seconded      the motion and the motion passed unanimously.                          (View these minutes in  Adobe Acrobat (.PDF) format .)

GX051-30-16568047	Regional       CQI Team Notes                         July 3, 2003                 Present:    Kathy       K.,         Malinda        , Don, Brian, Gary, Kathy H. & Mike         I.                            Team Roles                         Once again it was time for       the team to look at changing team roles.          The Team decided to take a new approach to help ease the burden       related to each roll.    It was       decided to rotate facilitation and scribe duties every month.          The scribe duties will precede facilitation.                 Malinda        will begin facilitation in August and duties will rotate as follows:                August                    Malinda        September       Mike        October           Alex        November        Brian        December          Don        January                           Gary        February           Kathy K.        March                      Malinda                 II.                          Timing Grid / Reports                         The updated schedule is       provided at the bottom of these notes.          It is our intent to note on the grid when particular data becomes       available such as comment cards or mystery shopper reports.          It was noted that the QAC report should be about the same as the       Leadership report so preparing for one should cover both.           The emphasis for the next       QAC report should be business customers.          To accomplish this we will review 2 nd  quarter business       comment card data at our next meeting.                         Gary                will ensure Bonnie gets all the numbers together (business and job seeker)       and to Don in enough time for Don to send the numbers out for everyone to       review prior to our next meeting (        7/17/03        ).           III.                        Data Display Update                                CQI Team        members had been previously asked to look into the effectiveness of our       data displays.    Are the       displays being effective?    Team       members have not been able to collect any information (anecdotal or       otherwise) that would tell us our displays are effective.          It was suggested that a question related to the effectiveness of       our data displays might be added to the fall exit survey we plan to       conduct and/or addition Mystery Shops we expect to purchase.           IV.                       Problem Resolution Grid ( Continued       Work )                         The Team reviewed to grid       for completeness with respect to solutions.          The Team determined that most of the Center or staff specific       problems have been addressed, but other systematic problems may not have       been identified.    The Team       identified the following systematic problems embedded in the Resolution       Grid:         1.              Job referrals .    This       is a key process issue the team addressed before.           2.              Level of evaluation/screening on job orders .          Another key process issue where we are not likely meeting business       needs.           3.              Staff are not consistently checking to see if customer       needs are being met .    We       have launched initiatives to address this known concern with limited       effectiveness.    We recommend       that when we purchase addition Mystery Shops this be evaluated in shops.           4.              Level of probing question is not consistently at a high       level .           The Team decided to review       this list at the July 17 th  meeting and come up with       recommendations to be included in the Leadership report.          The Team also recommends that all CUT’s review the core services       grid for gaps in service.           V.                         Other                                        Gary                updated everyone on the status of hiring a data/program analyst staff       person.    The job description       has been created and the WDC is in the interview process.                  CQI Team        members will be invited to attend a future meeting (TBD) with OQOB (Office       of Quality Organizational Presentation) to discuss the Mystery Shopper       Program in our area.           VI.                       Next Agenda’s                         July 17 th  Meeting       – Mt Vernon         ·

Stephanie             H. gave a very brief overview of the SAC Coordinators Meeting                 held in Santa Barbara in February.           Laura             C. indicated an interest in working on a “50 Ways to get Your             Feet Wet in the MBNMS” type                   brochure for Monterey County.           Steve             S. mentioned that the MBNMS is looking at potential sites for a Visitor             Center.                 February           2003 SAC Meeting Review:                   Dave               E. reviewed some of the major topics discussed at the SAC meeting.               These included cruise ships, the               National Marine Sanctuary Program (NMSP) “white paper” on               regulatory coordination between the NMSP and the National Marine Fisheries               Service, a presentation on oil spill prevention and response activities,               sanctuary staffing, etc. For more information on the February SAC meeting,               see the SAC meeting minutes located on the Sanctuary’s web site               at  http://montereybay.nos.noaa.gov/intro/advisory/sac_min.html .               Steve S. commented that there were still a lot of questions to be answered               about spill response and prevention and more detail was needed on where               clean up vessels were located, what was in place in the region, how               dispersants would be used, and whether and how fishermen might be involved               in response.                  Letter           Writing Protocols for Working Groups Update:                   Dave               E. reported on a March 10th meeting he had with Sanctuary Superintendent               Bill Douros,                 SAC Chair Stephanie Harlan, Research Activities Panel (RAP) Chair               Chris Harrold and Pat Clark-Gray, Chair of the Sanctuary Education               Panel                       (SEP) (the Chairs of the Conservation Working Group were invited                       but could                 not attend). The meeting was convened in response to a request by               Dave E. on behalf of the BTAP to try and iron out more consistent protocols                 for the BTAP, RAP, SEP, and CWG to follow when sending letters to               the                 MBNMS or SAC or taking other actions. Dave E. reported that Bill’s                 position was that letters written by these working groups to the Sanctuary                 Superintendent or the SAC had to be reviewed and approved by him before                 they were formally submitted. Rachel S. clarified that the Sanctuary                 was not in fact talking about approving letters, but having a chance                 to review and discuss the issues ahead of time. Rachel S. stated that                 this was the way the other work groups have generally operated and                 that the idea behind it was to facilitate open lines of communication.                 Steve                 S. and Tony W. agreed that enhanced communication and seeking a higher                 standard was generally a good thing, but continued to question why                 letters had to be reviewed ahead of time. Mike B. noted that it was                 an extra                 step that he found unusual. Maggie I. expressed strong negative feelings                 about it and said that she thought that it would repel people. A question                 was also raised about whether SAC At-Large members would have to follow                 the same protocol in sending correspondence to the SAC or MBNMS. Rachel                 S. indicated that a recent memo brought forward to the SAC by an At-Large                 member regarding staffing issues had been reviewed and discussed with                 Bill and MBNMS staff prior to it being sent on to the SAC. Dave E.                 closed the discussion by indicating that Bill had agreed to come to                 the next                 BTAP meeting in May and that the group could talk directly to Bill                 about this issue if needed. The SAC will also be reviewing the SAC                 charter                 and protocols at their April 4th meeting, and so may also address this                 matter.                  Cruise             Ships Update:                   Steve               S. reported on the actions taken by the Monterey City Council to address               the recently disclosed discharge                       in the MBNMS                 by the vessel Crystal Harmony, owned by Crystal Cruise Lines. The               City Council voted to ban the cruise line for 15 years and ban the               particular                 vessel forever. They also adopted several amendments to the City’s                 Cruise Line Action Plan. Rachel S. noted the action taken by the SAC                 at its February meeting recommending that the MBNMS develop and implement                 a regulation prohibiting harmful cruise ship discharges.                  Fishing           White Paper:                     Steve               S. raised concerns over the recent released “white               paper” on regulatory coordination between the NMSP and the National               Marine Fisheries Service. The “white paper” was developed               by National Marine Sanctuary Program Headquarters and is a statement               of national policy applying to all the sanctuaries. (A copy of the policy               paper can be found as a PDF file at the following web link, under the               11:00 a.m. agenda item:  http://montereybay.nos.noaa.gov/sac/2003/020703/agenda.html ).               Steve S. stated that to a large degree the language was consistent with               the Sanctuary’s designation documents, but that the tone was more               aggressive and it asserted a stronger role for the sanctuary with regard               to the management of fishing. He expressed concern that it was going               to replace or supercede the current language in the MBNMS management               plan. The SAC at its February meeting took action in support of sending               a letter to the Secretary of Commerce expressing their view that the “white               paper” will make it more difficult for the Sanctuary to work successfully               with the fishing community. In the letter the SAC also requested that               the language not replace or supercede what’s in the MBNMS designation               documents. Rachel S. passed out a copy of the SAC letter to the group.                  Joint           Management Plan Review (JMPR) Workgroup Updates:                   Several               people attending the meeting reported on the progress of some of the               JMPR workgroups               they are involved with. Kelly S. gave a brief overview of the motorized               personal watercraft (MPWC) workgroup, but focused primarily on the               issue of tow-in surfing as one item the workgroup is grappling with               (will it               be allowed and, if so, where will the exceptions be). Kathy F. spoke               about several of the workgroups: 1) Incorporating Fishing Issues into               Education and Research – Kathy noted her view that the Sanctuary               should focus on facilitating research, rather than conducting it themselves               and she noted a role for the Sanctuary to cooperate with Cal Fish and               Game to pull info together; she also noted the need for community involvement               in the process 2) Davidson Seamount – Kathy said the focus here               was on the value of the benthic habitat and whether or not the area should               be further evaluated for inclusion in the Sanctuary. She relayed concerns               that fishermen have about the Sanctuary regulating fishing in the future.               She stated that industry would likely favor other alternatives for the               area and probably would not be in favor of expanding the MBNMS boundary.               Mike B. briefly reported on the Desalination workgroup and indicated               that generally things were moving along. Art S. talked about the goals               for the Tidepool Protection workgroup and reported that the workgroup               had identified various sites within the Sanctuary and that they were               dealing with a number of issues (i.e., visitation, take, trampling, etc).               Steve S. reported that within the Marine Protected Areas workgroup there               was much spirited debate about the need for mpa’s, identifying               what problems mpa’s fix, other potential tools, and the relationship               between the Sanctuary’s effort and that state of California’s               Marine Life Protection Act effort .For more information on the specific               workgroups and issues, please see the JMPR web site at  http://sanctuaries.nos.noaa.gov/jointplan/ .                  Sanctuary Scenic Trail (SST):                     Time               ran out for any discussion of this item, but Rachel S. passed out a               brochure on the trail and suggested               that this was a project that the business and tourism community might               get involved in.                  Additional           Announcements:                   An               announcement was made that Monty Criss, SAC Tourism Rep (alternate)               and BTAP Co-Chair has resigned from his seat on the Council. Monty                     has taken a job in the Bay Area. The MBNMS will be conducting                     a recruitment               process for the seat and will be sending out a notice in within the                     next month or so. The meeting then adjourned.

Dr. Lee further emphasized      that once deployed, all the NITAAC contracts would use this system to      ensure process consistency and integrated financial information.              The next Program Review Quarterly meeting was      discussed.    Dr. Lee stated that      Elmer Sembly III was tasked with this effort and that next Monday Elmer      will email to the IAC members the new date. Victor also mentioned a panel      format will be used at the next quarterly.              End of FY actions were discussed as far as cut      off dates – Victor said that T.O. schedule had not changed and ECS3 orders      would be taken up to the last moment. Dr. Lee stated that the MIPERS were      anticipated for end of year monies but they have been coming in all year.      OFM requirements will be determined. The NITAAC 2.5% fee modifications of      MIPERS would have a later date.         NITAAC will communicate these cut-off dates with all the prime      contractors to ensure that End-of-Year process goes smoothly for both      NITAAC and the primes.              Questions were raised on how the annual      Re-Certification for SB’s would affect the prime contractors on the NITAAC      contracts. Victor said that in order for NITAAC to keep its Executive      Agency Status, they would have to comply with OMB’s mandate for annual      re-certification.    NITAAC is      currently working with OMB on their process and schedule for reporting      this data to OMB.    Jeffrey      Westerhoff commented that NITAAC contract primes would need guidance on      the timing and the cut-off of the SB size standard reporting on the      contract since this would impact large primes SF-294 and SF-295      reports.     Suggestions were made to      refer this topic to the Government Affairs subcommittee for      recommendations.    At this time, all      comments should be forwarded to Victor Powers.              On marketing activities, BMOCO is going to be      kicking off the NITAAC Hour on the road, which will use the same format as      the NITAAC Hour on the news radio but will be done at various conferences.      The AIIM show which expects to draw over 100 companies and a large      government crowd is one of the targeted conferences. BMOCO will send out      further information to allow primes to participate in this event.              Pattie Buel complimented Greg, Donald and Tim      for getting the currency of the contract award data updates on the NITAAC      web site.              Victor stated that 8 companies applied for the      8(a) credit on the NITAAC contract.         The package is now with SBA for final determination.               The status on the NITAAC contracts are as      follows:      ·           CIO-SP2:    231 TOs processed = $566M Base, $2.1B including options    ·           IW2                      185 DOs processed = $24M            TOs processed = $11.5M Base, $17M including options    ·           ECS3          4000 DOs processed = $31M thru end of May                10. The next meeting will be held on September 18, 2003.
GX253-39-9691080	"Draft Minutes of the State Board of Health  March 13, 2002 A meeting of the Washington State Board of Health (SBOH) was held at the Phoenix Inn in Olympia, Washington. The public meeting of the SBOH was called to order at 9:35 a.m. by Linda Lake, Chair. The following Board members were present: Linda Lake, MBA, Chair Vickie Ybarra, RN, MPH Maxine Hayes, MD Margaret Pageler, JD Charles Chu, DPM State Board of Health Staff present: Don Sloma, Executive Director Craig McLaughlin, Senior Health Policy Manager Doreen Garcia, Senior Health Policy Advisor Marianne Seifert, Health Policy Advisor Guests and Other Participants: Mike Gallagher Marianne Guichard Jamie Green Jim Vanderslice Lisa Messmer Bonita Hill Thelma Simon Kendall Osborn Maria Mason Julene Pague James Green Warren Perry Art Busch Glenna Green Sherri Wills Bill Barron Katherine Sanders Judie Stanton APPROVAL OF AGENDA Motion: To approve the March 13, 2002 agenda. Motion/Second: Corkrum/Locke Approved: Unanimously ADOPTION OF JANUARY 9, 2002 MEETING MINUTES Motion: To approve the January 9, 2002 minutes as submitted. Ms. Corkrum requested that the Juris Doctor title be removed after her name. Motion/Second: Ybarra/Osaki Approved: Unanimously as amended DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH UPDATE Dr. Maxine Hayes, State Health Officer, represented Department of Health (DOH) Secretary and Board Member Mary Selecky at the Board meeting. Because the Board was ahead of schedule, Chair Lake asked whether Dr. Maxine Hayes would provide the monthly Department of Health update for the Board prior to the public hearing. Dr. Hayes passed out materials on planning  The Honorable Neva Corkrum Thomas H. Locke, MD, MPH Joe Finkbonner, RPH, MHA Carl Osaki, RS, MSPH Ed Gray, MD  Desiree Robinson, Executive Assistant Jennifer Dodd, Assistant to the Board Melissa Burke-Cain, Assistant Attorney General  Marcia Riggers Joanne Prado Harriet Ammann Darrell Cochran Keith Simon Tom Eaton Sheila Sandwick Henry Mustin   Washington State Board of Health Draft Minutes  March 13, 2002  2  efforts for bioterrorism preparedness and federal funding. She said she would spend the entire time for her presentation discussing that planning. (For more information, see handout.) Board Member Margaret Pageler said it sounded as if funds would be focused on planning and coordination and asked what we would do to increase capacity. Dr. Hayes said the state is poised to deal with capacity because of the assessments and analyses it has already done. Chair Lake asked whether the federal funds would address the overall readiness of the public health system, which has been weakened over the years. Dr. Hayes said she anticipates that there will be improvements in the public health system. Board Member Ed Gray asked whether the state was working with the province of British Columbia. Dr. Hayes said there have been conversations between labs on both sides of the border, and conversation between health directors, and more conversations have to take place once more capacity exists within the state. Board Member Tom Locke asked what stage current thinking is at about models for creating preparedness regions. Dr. Hayes said a lot of legal and political work still needs to be done before reaching agreement on a regional model. PUBLIC HEARING ON PROPOSED CHANGES FOR WAC 246-215-150- SERVICE ANIMALS Chair Lake addressed the attendees with the following statement: ""This is a public meeting of the SBOH held under provision of RCW 43.20. Notice of the meeting was provided in accordance with provisions of RCW 34.05, the Administrative Procedures Act. Those members having any conflict of interest on any item coming before the Board will report that conflict with respect to the particular subject under consideration. In case of challenge of any Board members by the public, the Board shall decide the status of the challenged members to participate before considering the substance of the matter. Copies of all materials supplied to the Board for today's meeting have been available since close of business last Friday from the Board's Olympia office and on the Board's Web site at www.doh.wa.gov/sboh. They are also available today, along with anything else we have received since, at the table in the back of the room. To conserve public funds, we have only made as many copies as we feel will be needed, so we may run out of some particularly popular items. If you do not find a document you need, please ask Desiree Robinson, or another Board staff person for one. Our meeting today is open to the public, so please feel free to listen in on informal discussions involving Board members or staff, including any that may occur during breaks or lunch."" Board Member Carl Osaki referred Board members to the materials behind Tab 3 in the board packets and explained that the proposed rule change that would change ""Guide dogs or service dogs..."" to ""Dog guides or service animals..."" in WAC 246-215-150 (7)(c)(iv). He said the change would ensure that the current food regulation is consistent with federal law, specifically the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). Staff Member Marianne Seifert said the change resulted from a citizen contacting the department about perceived discrimination when she tried to enter restaurants with her miniature service horse. Chair Lake asked whether changing this rule would create any responsibility for distributing that information about the change. Mr. Sloma said staff could talk to DOH about communicating the change to local health directors. Dr. Gray asked the definition of the word ""service."" Mr. Sloma said that ""service animals"" is defined in chapter 70.84 RCW. Mr. Osaki recommended that the change to the rule be approved.   3  Washington State Board of Health Minutes  March 13, 2002  Dr. Gray said is he not comfortable that the Board is where it needs to be if industry has not been adequately consulted. Mr. Osaki mentioned that the Board might have some legal exposure if it is out of step with the ADA. Chair Lake noted that restaurant owners are already required to comply with the ADA. Dr. Locke said he supported the notion of being consistent with the ADA, but said he would prefer that the decision be evidence-based; if there is no evidence that there is disease transmission from service animals, then it is not an issue. Motion: The Board adopts the proposed rule changes to WAC 246-215-150 (7)(c)(iv) language changing ""Guide dogs or service dogs..."" to ""Dog guides or service animals..."" Motion/Second: Osaki/Corkrum Approved: 9 ayes, 1 nay (Gray) SBOH STAFF ANNOUNCEMENTS, BUDGET AND OTHER BOARD BUSINESS Mr. Sloma directed the Board to the newly published 2001 Final Report on Children's Health and Well-Being in the Board packets. Chair Lake complimented the people who had worked on this product. Dr. Gray asked whether practical benefits would result from producing this report. Mr. Sloma said several groups were looking at ways to provide critical preventive services for children and might make use of the report. Dr. Hayes mentioned the influence of the Board's work on the policy conversations and agreements about Medicaid within the Agency Medical Directors Group. Mr. Sloma then directed the Board to the proposed 2002 State Health Report in the Board packets and said it had been transmitted to the governor. Chair Lake noted that the process that led to the report was also beneficial. Dr. Locke asked when it becomes a public document that can be presented to different groups. Board members agreed they would like to promote the report with the governor and encourage him to take action. At Mr. Sloma's request, Marianne Seifert, Policy Analyst for the Board, reported on a meeting in Whatcom County about sewage spillage and mercury contamination issues around Lake Whatcom. Community members invited Board Member Joe Finkbonner, Ms. Seifert, Water District 10 staff, local health department staff, and others to discuss Lake Whatcom water quality issues. Mr. Finkbonner and Ms Seifert attended. Mr. Sloma provided a quick update on the rule review on the emergency powers and duties of local health officers, noting that a meeting with a workgroup with law enforcement and local government is scheduled for March 27. He then discussed several items in the packets: the transmittal letter and transmittal list on the 2001 Environmental Justice Final Report; materials on the Gene(sis) exhibit at the Henry Art Gallery and its ties to the April meeting of the Genetics Task Force; and changes to the FYI section of the agenda. He recognized both Patty Hayes and Maxine Hayes for their recent awards. The last item Mr. Sloma discussed was the budget. Chair Lake asked Mr. Sloma to walk the Board through his memo summarizing the budget. Ms. Pageler said it would be helpful to have a Board committee to work with Mr. Sloma and Chair Lake on budget issues. Ms. Corkrum asked if the Board might be treated like other boards and not be asked to take additional cuts. Mr. Sloma said the Board seems to be treated as an administrative cost within the Department of Health budget, while some boards and commissions have been exempt from budget cuts. Board Member Charles Chu asked if state revenue might increase. Mr. Sloma said the revenue   Washington State Board of Health Draft Minutes  March 13, 2002  4  assumptions are based on the best efforts of Revenue Forecast Council. Dr. Chu suggested the Board might want to meet at SeaTac to save money. Dr. Hayes said that austerity often precipitates more clarity and suggested the Board might want to start a conversation that would help it become clearer about its value and core functions. Dr. Locke said he has raised the issue of Board funding among local public health officials and said that cuts to the Board's budget are part of the dismantling of the public health system. He said people should examine what constitutes the core essential public health system in this state and discuss how to rebuild it. He warned that crisis-driven cuts often become the new funding base and that is how the system gets cut permanently. He noted that local public health has identified the need for stable, long-term funding and that the Board and elements of DOH have to find other stable funding source outside of the general fund-state. Chair Lake asked how members felt about Ms. Pageler's suggestion to form a budget committee. Board Member Vickie Ybarra suggested the budget committee comprise the Board chair and the chairs of the priority project committees. Dr. Gray said the Board should maintain a clear, established relationship between its work and the broader definition of health, and it should not separate public health from private medical care. LEGAL MEMORANDUM- SBOH AUTHORITY REGARDING GIFTS & GRANTS Mr. Sloma reviewed the previous Board discussions about its ability to solicit and receive gifts and grants. Melissa Burke-Cain, Board counsel, reviewed her memorandum to the Board. The memorandum concluded the Board has no authority to solicit or accept funds, but other agencies (for example, DOH and DSHS) have broad authority to accept grants, donations, etc., and the Board could form partnerships with them to perform grant-funded work. Attention must be paid to possible conflicts of interest, she said, especially given the Board's regulatory authority. Mr. Osaki presented the possibility of obtaining federal funds for work on children's environmental health as an example and asked whether grants might be identified to fund Board activities. Ms. Burke-Cain replied that the Board could receive those funds through a partnership agreement if the activities were within its statutory authority. LEGISLATIVE UPDATE Craig McLaughlin, Senior Health Policy Manager, reviewed his memo to the Board on proposed legislation during the 2002 session. He said Board staff and members were very active during the 2002 legislative session. He also reviewed the status and evolution of bills listed in Bill Watch. Ms. Pageler said the level of legislative activity indicates that the Board is seen as active in policymaking. Patty Hayes, Director of Legislative, Policy and Constituent Relations for DOH, reviewed the fiscal impacts of legislation and discussed improved processes for coordination of fiscal notes between DOH and SBOH. Chair Lake asked Board members how the process worked for them. Mr. Osaki expressed his concern about being asked for his opinion on legislation as a Board member when he cannot know the Board's opinions or speak for the entire Board. Chair Lake recommended that before next session Board members and staff review the legislative process. Mr. McLaughlin said that letters used in testimony clearly stated they reflected the opinions of individual Board members and that the entire Board had not taken a position on any legislation. Ms. Hayes reviewed targeted budget cuts for DOH. Mr. Osaki reminded the Board that Senate Bill 6588 regarding the food code would have a significant impact on the Board over the next two years due to the rule revision deadline of December 2004.   5  Washington State Board of Health Minutes  March 13, 2002  FEATHERSTONE REID AWARD Mr. McLaughlin directed the Board members to the Featherstone Reid Award nomination memo in the Board packets. He said the nomination review committee recommended that the Board forward the name of John Welsh to the secretary of health for further consideration. Mr. Locke agreed that John Welsh was an appropriate nominee. Chair Lake said she was impressed with the work of the committee members. Motion: Adopt the recommendation of the committee and forward it to the Secretary of Health. Motion/Second: Neva Corkrum/Tom Locke Approved: unanimously LUNCH HEALTH DISPARITIES WORK PLAN Mr. Finkbonner directed the Board to the materials behind Tab 9, including the draft work plan for the Health Disparities Committee. Motion: The Washington State Board of Health approves the Draft Summary Of Planned Work, Health Disparities, 2001-03 as submitted March 13, 2002. Approved: Unanimously Mr. Finkbonner then discussed the May 12 meeting of the Heath Care Workforce Diversity Network, which he said was very successful. Ms. Ybarra said people agreed to roll up their sleeves and see what they could achieve with limited resources. DISSOLUTION OF THE SOUTHWEST WASHINGTON HEALTH DISTRICT Mr. Sloma directed Board members to the material behind Tab 10, which concerns the proposal to dissolve the Southwest Washington Health District and have Clark County assume responsibility for delivering public health services in the county. He introduced Judie Stanton, Chair of the Clark County Commission, and Bill Barron, Clark County Administrator. He reviewed his memorandum to the Board, noting that the statute for the dissolution of a health district requires counties to meet standards established by the Board. He noted that other districts are considering actions similar to Clark County's. Ms. Stanton explained her role with the local Board of Health and provided background on how counties see the current situation. The County Commission has looked at reducing spending in response to citizen initiatives and referenda, and has focused on internal cuts, rather than reductions in the delivery of services. A lot of counties are now in financial difficulties. They also face increased federal impacts, such as reporting requirements under HIPAA. She said Clark County looked at how to reduce costs internally and noted that there may be internal efficiencies that come from bringing public health under the county administrative structure. She said the change would also provide better oversight and accountability. Currently, she said, the county's lead responsibility is to public safety and that will likely change to public health and safety. Mr. Barron spoke about how the change would be implemented. He said key department heads have formed a transition team, have developed a communications plan, have agreed to five overriding principles, and are working with their peers of the health district.   Washington State Board of Health Draft Minutes  March 13, 2002  6  Ms. Pageler asked about funding and participation from cities. Ms. Stanton said there is no funding from cities in Clark County. She said the county may form an advisory group and that group could include representation from city officials. Dr. Gray asked whether the essential elements of district, such as environmental health section, will remain, and whether that will be true also in Skamania County. Ms. Stanton said it has not been determined whether all the functions would stay under the executive director of the health district. Ms. Lake asked how much direct client or patient service the district provides. Ms. Stanton said it was more than she expected and there are still direct services provided by the district. Chair Lake asked about Board members' reactions when they heard that the district might be dissolved. Mr. Locke said a big concern of the Board is that the public health system might be falling apart. He suggested that advisory committees have been very beneficial in many jurisdictions, as have interagency agreements. Ms. Stanton said the county might need guidance about setting priorities for public health activities. Ms. Pageler urged Mr. Barron to talk to Dr. Gray or Bill White, DOH Assistant Secretary for Environmental Health about problems that arose when Pacific County folded environmental health into the permitting department. She also noted that public health could do a lot to improve public safety. Dr. Hayes said that Secretary Selecky would be working with the county and that DOH was available to assist with any transition.  PERSISTENT BIOACCUMULATIVE TOXINS Mr. Osaki reminded the Board that the issue of persistent bioaccumulative toxins (PBTs) had come before it about a year ago when the Department of Ecology (DOE) requested, and received, support from the Board. The Department of Ecology received funding from the Legislature for continued work on PBTs during the 2001 session and wished to report back to the Board on its progress. Ms. Seifert noted that PBTs had also been a legislative issue during the 2002 session. Mike Gallagher, Persistent Bioaccumulative Toxins Coordinator, Washington State Department of Ecology, introduced Sherry Peel, whom the Department of Ecology hired to draft a mercury action plan. Mr. Gallagher and Ms. Peel then provided an overview of Ecology's mercury reduction plan. (See the PowerPoint slide show.) Ms. Pageler asked if there is a market for reuse of collected mercury. Ms. Peel said that the market value is so low that you often have to pay to dispose of fluorescent light bulbs. Ms. Pageler said regulations that are not convenient for the consumer often undercut our efforts to protect the environment. Mr. Osaki asked about the symptomology of mercury poisoning and whether medical personnel are trained to recognize it. Harriet Amman, toxicologist with the Department of Health, said an occupational physician would ask appropriate questions, but a general population practitioner probably wouldn't. Most changes are very subtle, she said. Ms. Ybarra asked to hear from Board members who are physicians. Dr. Locke concurred that mercury poisoning is largely an occupational issue for physicians. He said the greatest environmental concern is organ damage and subtle neurological changes over time. Mr. Osaki said the DOE strategy is wonderful but asked how we evaluate whether it is making a difference, especially if physicians aren't picking up the symptoms. Joanne Bonner Prado, Department of Health, said her strategy was to develop communications strategy for fish advisories and included a component for reaching health providers. The DOH and DOE partnership opens up opportunities for educating health care providers. Dr. Hayes noted that DOH does have the ability to partner with provider groups, particularly those that treat children. She noted that we do have an epidemic of neurological dysfunction among children.   7  Washington State Board of Health Minutes  March 13, 2002  SCHOOL INDOOR AIR QUALITY Mr. Osaki introduced the discussion of indoor air quality in schools by providing some background about previous requests that the Board explore school indoor air quality issues. He recommended that the Board consider some strategies that may be helpful to deal with school indoor air quality concerns. Ms. Seifert provided additional background information (see Carl Osaki memo in Tab 12). Maryanne Guichard, of the Office of Environmental Health and Safety, Department of Health, talked about school programs and health and safety guidelines. She said that indoor air issues are real problems, that sometimes these issues are very complex (they often cannot be attributed to a single source), and that DOH is taking steps to address these issues. She mentioned that DOH's role is advisory, and that their indoor air program has 2 FTEs. DOH staff get directly involved with issues and take a proactive approach by issuing guidelines, consulting with the public, holding training classes, and doing field investigations as requested. When DOH is called into a site, she said, it will gather information by doing a site visit and walk-through examination, observe problems, consult with partners, look for remediation actions, and work with local health jurisdictions. She said that there are new initiatives within DOH to update guidance documents, that DOH is looking for grant dollars to provide technical expertise and education, and that the department will partner with the Office of the Superintendent for Public Instruction (OSPI), community groups, and others to put together a plan for addressing school issues. Jim Vanderslice, Office of Environmental Health Assessment, Department of Health, spoke about the DOH indoor air quality program. He emphasized the complexity of buildings, particularly the air systems, the potential for multiple sources of contaminants, and how difficult it is to track down specific sources of contamination. Contaminants have a wide variety of health impacts that are known. It can be hard to attribute symptoms to specific causes. There are also wide individual differences in susceptibility to contaminants. A great deal of information is required to identify the root cause of building air quality problems, so it is valuable to gather all sorts of information. Air quality is going to continue to be a problem that has to be managed, as both an acute problem and a chronic problem, to keep schools safe environments for kids, he said. Mr. Osaki asked whether people experienced with schools have identified effective public health protection measures. Ms. Guichard said schools have asked for a better data system. Mr. Vanderslice said it is more about proactive assessment and preventive measures. Ms. Seifert said a 1996 attorney general's report described school construction issues. Dr. Hayes noted that schools' infrastructure is old and many are very poorly constructed, but as we built new sites, health agencies should be working with the boards of education to ensure safety. Dr. Gray said the common thread is that the lowest bidder builds all schools and that some old assumptions about construction have turned out to be invalid. Ms. Amman said the research addressing construction of roofs in areas with a lot of snow concluded that roofs should be pitched and not flat. The secret is in prevention and maintenance, she said; building a school properly from the beginning. PUBLIC TESTIMONY   Washington State Board of Health Draft Minutes  March 13, 2002  8  Chair Lake addressed the attendees with the following statement: ""Let me say a few words before we begin the public testimony portion of our meeting. The Board listens carefully to everyone who comes before us, but Board members rarely respond directly to public testimony. We may follow up with questions to make sure we understand the testimony, but typically we do not engage in dialogue or consider any action at this time. If we think future action may be needed, we will ask a staff member to follow up, to conduct any necessary research, and to report back to the Board about possible actions at a future meeting."" Maria Mason, a parent from Bainbridge Island and member of the Coalition for Environmentally Safe Schools, said things have not changed significantly since she first testified before the Board nine years ago. She described several scenarios involving illnesses in schools and unsuccessful efforts to involve state officials. She showed two news videos about the Cle Elum schools and Woodward Elementary on Bainbridge Island. She distributed recommendations to the Board (see Tab 13). Ms. Mason introduced Kendall Osborn, a teacher for Cle Elum High School since April 1987. Mr. Osborn said he was hired full time in September 1988. In fall of 2000 he noticed a variety of symptoms. In February he met with other teachers and the superintendent. On September 25 he left the school so he could find out what was wrong with his health and the school. A physician said he should not return to the building. He distributed recommendations to the Board (see Tab 13). James Green, father of Jamie Green, a Cle Elum student who had symptoms including mild asthma and pneumonia, testified that her symptoms have grown worse. He described his daughter's medical history and his efforts to get action from state and local agencies. He presented 642 signed statements from citizens asking for testing and remediation at Cle Elum High School. (For written testimony, see blue binder on file.) Jamie Green, a former Cle Elum high school student, testified that she thought it was unfair that she had to be home schooled and miss out on high school and had to continue to fight this battle. (For written testimony, see blue binder on file.) Thelma Simon spoke as a parent of a former Cle Elum student who has had to transfer to another district for health reasons. She said the recommendations in various reports have not been implemented. She asked who is inspecting schools and said the local environmental health inspector had no background in indoor air quality. She noted the school buildings are used for a variety of community purposes. She said the Kittitas County Board of Health said it is not their responsibility to inspect schools. (See Tab 13 for testimony summary.) Sheila Sandwick, a member of the Washington Education Association task force for indoor air quality, testified that she has had health impacts from high levels of benzene and toluene in her blood from school exposure. She has also served on indoor air quality committees for the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and DOH. She has been trained in the EPA Tools for Schools program, and believes that many schools are looking for guidelines. She said the Board should help try to solve the problem. Because of the lack of funding, air quality problems will continue.   9  Washington State Board of Health Minutes  March 13, 2002  Henry Muston, health officer for Kittitas County for the past year, said air quality at the high school is a very complex issue. The local health department, DOH, and the state Department of Labor & Industries did a walk-through that involved climbing into the crawlspaces and walking around, he said. The group did not see any evidence of problems. He said the local health department has tried to get some expert help with this issue. He said he is struggling with this and is aware of multiple problems people are experiencing. There has been some thought given to bringing in professional assistance in risk communication. They will bring in Mr. Rich Prill, an expert from Washington State University, to do a walkthrough and local officials will participate. (See Tab 13 for memo from Nancy Goodloe, Kittitas County Health Department Administrator.) Mr. Osaki asked if the Board staff could get us the California legislation. He noted that this is a complex issue that could involve lots of agencies. He wondered if staff, perhaps DOH, might convene a group to examine the policy issues involved. Dr. Locke said the issue before the Board is the adequacy or inadequacy of the existing rule. Mr. Osaki said the Board's responsibility is to prevent these problems from occurring in the first place. Harriet Amman, State Department of Health, noted the National Institutes of Health is convening a panel about the health effects from damp buildings. That report might look at what is known and what is not known and where future research should go. Chair Lake said our criteria suggested the Board might want to take this on. Mr. Osaki said we might ask the Department of Health whether it could put together a workgroup. Dr. Locke said he brought up the issue of adequacy of the rule because when you have a system driven by the lowest bidder, the only thing that opposes that is a system of standards. Mr. Sloma said it was well within the Board's statutory authority. Marcia Riggers, Assistant Superintendent, Office of the Superintendent for Public Instruction, said school indoor air quality concerns raise particular issues, such as the lack of a data system for tracking efficacy of local solutions. She said her office would welcome the opportunity to partner with the Board. Chair Lake directed Mr. Sloma to work with OSPI and other partners to form a workgroup. Mr. Sloma asked for direction about timing. Chair Lake said she would like a progress report in May. Chair Lake adjourned the meeting at 4:45 p.m.  WASHINGTON STATE BOARD OF HEALTH  Linda Lake, Chair"
