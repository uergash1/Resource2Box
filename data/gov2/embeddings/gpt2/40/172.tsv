GX246-71-12481122	Choctaw County     First Oil Well In Alabama         On January 2, 1944, the State of Alabama granted Hunt Oil Company a permit to drill the A.R. Jackson Well No. 1 at this location near Gilbertown. Hunt Oil Company was owned by the famous oil man, H.L. Hunt of Dallas, Texas. Drilling commenced on January 10, 1944, and was completed approximately one month later. The well struck oil at a depth of 2,580 feet in fractured Selma chalk. The discovery of this well led to the creation of the State Oil and Gas Board of Alabama in 1945, and to the development and growth of the petroleum industry in the State.

Office of Economic Opportunity.    The grants were awarded to 107 nonprofit organizations and 3 local government    units operating 134 facilities for homeless people in 55 counties. (You may    access a complete list of grant recipients in PDF format on the Internet at    the following address:  www.dhhs.state.nc.us/pressrel/sheltergrants.pdf .    A free PDF reader is available at:  www.adobe.com/products/acrobat/readstep.html .)     The Office of Economic Opportunity, a division of the N.C. Department of Health    and Human Services, strives to help families pursue economic independence. The    grant program is designed to provide needed social services to homeless individuals    and families with children, improve the quality of existing shelters, help meet    the costs of operating emergency shelters and transitional housing programs,    and provide programs and activities that prevent homelessness.    Agencies receiving grants are in the following counties: Alamance, Beaufort,    Buncombe, Burke, Cabarrus, Caldwell, Carteret, Caswell, Catawba, Chatham, Cherokee,    Cleveland Columbus, Craven, Cumberland, Dare, Davidson, Durham, Edgecombe, Forsyth,    Gaston, Granville, Guilford, Haywood, Henderson, Iredell, Jackson, Johnston,    Lee, Macon, McDowell, Mecklenburg, Montgomery, Moore, Nash, New Hanover, Orange,    Onslow, Pasquotank, Pitt, Richmond, Robeson, Rockingham, Rowan, Rutherford,    Scotland, Surry, Swain, Union, Vance, Wake, Watauga, Wayne, Wilkes and Wilson.     The 1990 census found that 13 percent or 830,000 people in North Carolina live    in poverty. While many are employed, their wages are too low to cover their    basic needs for food, clothing and shelter.    The grant recipients depend on the funds from the Emergency Shelter Grant program    to provide shelter and needed services to homeless people in their local communities.    There are thousands of homeless people in North Carolina on any given night.    Of those, an estimated 60 percent are women and children.    Leading causes of homelessness in North Carolina are unemployment/underemployment,    alcohol and substance abuse, mental illness, eviction, domestic violence/sexual    assault, release from prison, child abuse and neglect, parental/child conflict,    natural disasters and HIV/AIDS.    The grants are available to non-profit organizations and general divisions    of local government that have operated an emergency shelter or transitional    housing facility for at least one year prior to the date of application for    funds and meet other program eligibility requirements.    The ESG program is authorized under the Stewart B. McKinney Homeless Assistance    Act of 1988 and is administered by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban    Development. Grants awarded in 1998 helped recipients in North Carolina provide    shelter and services to more than 43,000 homeless people in the state.              # # #                                        Public Affairs Office 101 Blair Drive, Raleigh, NC 27603 (919)733-9190 FAX (919)733-7447                   Debbie Crane Director
GX233-43-9606866	"Long Term Care in North Carolina              Housing and Retirement in North Carolina Frequently Asked Questions   The following questions/answers have been developed to assist persons who need information regarding housing options in North Carolina.       Does North Carolina offer special housing tax benefits for older citizens ?   What types of retirement housing are available in NC ?   I have never been to NC, but I have heard that it is a good place to retire so I'm making plans to move there now.  Do you have any advice ?   Where would be the best areas to look for a retirement community for someone on a fixed income ?   Where can I find information about available retirement housing in North Carolina ?   What about leisure-living retirement communities for active retirees which are comparable to ""Sun City"" in Florida and certain other states ?        Does North Carolina offer special housing tax benefits for older citizens?     North Carolina offers older and disabled homeowners the  Homestead Exemption , which provides qualifying homeowners a reduction on their property tax. The first $20,000 in appraised value of a permanent residence owned and occupied by a qualified owner is excluded from taxation. A qualifying owner: (1) is at least 65 years of age or totally and permanently disabled; (2) has an income for the preceding calendar year of not more than $15,000; and (3) is a North Carolina resident.    For more information, you can contact your local county tax office or  area agency on aging  that serves your county.        What types of retirement housing are available in NC?       Retirement housing  for independent living can be divided into two general categories. They are:      Independent housing/congregate housing for older adults that may or may not provide supportive services. Such housing may be privately owned with market rate rentals only, or it may be subsidized housing for persons who qualify based on income. Contact the  Area Agency on Aging  serving the county in which you are interested for a list of such properties.    Continuing Care Retirement Communities (CCRCs), which offer independent living (apartments, villas, some detached homes), meals and other services and amenities for active retirees. In addition, licensed nursing home care and/or licensed assisted living are available if needed. Because CCRCs guarantee certain health and/or personal care through a contractual agreement, they are regarded as an insurance product and regulated by the NC Department of Insurance. Contact the  area agency on aging  serving the county in which you are interested for a list of such properties. You can also contact the  Department of Insurance , Box 26387, Raleigh, NC 27611, 919/733-5633 or call toll-free within North Carolina through CARE-LINE, Information Referral Service, 1-800-662-7030 and ask to be connected to this agency.       I have never been to NC, but I have heard that it is a good place to retire so I'm making plans to move there now. Do you have any advice?      Relocating for retirement is a big step, but  resource information  is available to help with the process.  Such a major move has the greatest potential for success when retirees move to an area with which they are already well acquainted, and where family members or close friends can serve as a support network. It is important to have well-planned arrangements for housing, transportation, medical care, living costs, social needs, and finances before making a move.  It is beneficial for potential retirees to arrange for an extended stay in any area they are considering before making a commitment.  This allows an opportunity to develop a realistic sense of surroundings, differences in climate, cost of living, available services, and day-to-day life before making firm plans. Many rural areas and even cities may not offer the public transportation options that one may now depend on. Medical facilities and costs may differ in various parts of the country.  Our best advice is look before you leap. Out of state relocation can be expensive and complicated if you end up needing to ""re-relocate!""     Where would be the best areas to look for a retirement community for someone on a fixed income?      Cost of living rates vary considerably across the state, with highly urbanized areas such as the Triangle (Raleigh, Durham, and Chapel Hill) generally having higher costs. Unfortunately housing demand by growing numbers of older North Carolinians has created waiting lists for many retirement communities, particularly those of moderate cost. We highly recommend spending some time in the area you are considering so that you can visit potential communities and learn about them first hand.  The  Elder Housing Locator Service  and Housing links on the Division of Aging web site provide information on options available for individuals on a fixed income.     Where can I find information about available retirement housing in North Carolina?     You an find  information on housing  specifically planned for older adults, including subsidized housing.  You should first narrow your search to one or two areas of the state.  Also, the area  agency on aging  that serves the county(ies) in which you are interested, can direct you to various local sources of information or send you a listing of types of housing in the area. You may also want to review our  North Carolina Elder Housing Locator Service .     What about leisure-living retirement communities for active retirees which are comparable to ""Sun City"" in Florida and certain other states?      In North Carolina, there are a few leisure-living communities for active retirees, although at this point, we are not aware of any NC retirement communities on the scale of Sun City. The existing communities may offer building sites, single-family homes, condos or manufactured homes. Because such communities are not required to be licensed or registered with the state, they are not as easy for our office to identify and update. For such properties and for other single-family homes, town homes or apartments, contact a private real estate agency in the town of your interest, or the local chamber of commerce.

The red imported fire ant was first detected in the United States in Alabama in 1918. It was first identified in the southeastern part of North Carolina in Brunswick County in 1957.                Portions or entire areas of  57 of North Carolina's 100 counties  are considered generally infested with red imported fire ants. The NCDA&CS issues certification and compliance agreements to individuals and industries engaged in the movement of potentially contaminated commodities  (regulated articles)  to reduce man assisted movement of these ants.                Within the infested areas, the NCDA&CS maintains a Community Assistance Program to assist local citizens in the identification of efficacious and environmentally sound control measures.

One of our first steps to facilitate this objective is to ensure that your agency is aware of the duty of permitting authorities to notify Tribal Governments of issuance of title V permits to sources located near indian country.       The requirements of 40 CFR section 70.8(b) establish that a permitting authority shall ""give notice of each draft permit to any affected state"" on or before the time that the permitting authority provides notice to the public under 40 CFR section 70.7(h).  Section 301(d) of the Clean Air Act (CAA) authorizes the Administrator to treat Indian tribes as states.  Even though the definition of ""affected state"" in 40 CFR section 70.2 does not clearly establish the status of Indian tribes, the CAA specifies that unless the Administrator makes a determination deeming inappropriate to treat Indian tribes as states, they should be afforded the same treatment.  Therefore, title V permitting authorities must ensure that proper notification is given to the government of an Indian tribe as required by 40 CFR section 70.8(b).       To assist you in determining whether a permit action affects an Indian tribe, we are providing you with a listing of the counties in where the indian country areas in Region 4 are located, and the name and address of the environmental contact for the Indian tribes to whom correspondence should be addressed. If you need any additional information or have any questions about the contents of this letter, please contact Gracy R. Danois, Air Division Tribal Coordinator at 404/562-9119.                                Sincerely,                                /s/                                R.

GX266-38-8981287	"A Message from N.C. I n s u ran ce Commis s i on er Jim Long  Dear Consumer: The North Carolina Department of Insurance is proud to present the 2003 edition of the Continuing Care Retirement Communities Reference Guide. This guide has been compiled by the North Carolina Department of Insurance to assist prospective residents in their search for a continuing care retirement community (CCRC) in North Carolina. CCRCs are unique to the area of long-term care in that they provide a continuum of care to older adults under a contract for the life of an individual, or for a period longer than one year. Continuing care laws in North Carolina are designed to give you, the consumer, full disclosure concerning a community prior to the execution of a contract for continuing care. These laws exist for your benefit. I urge you to read the disclosure statement and the contract provided to you by a continuing care provider, and to ask questions if you are unsure of any of the provisions contained within them. If necessary, seek professional advice from an attorney and/or accountant. If you have any questions, please contact the Continuing Care Retirement Communities Section of the North Carolina Department of Insurance at (919) 733-5633, extension 249 or 268.  Sincerely,  Jim Long Commissioner   C  OVER STORY  For the first time, the North Carolina Department of Insurance held a Cover Art Contest for the 2003 edition of the Continuing Care Retirement Communities Reference Guide. Contestants were restricted to residents of continuing care retirement communities licensed and regulated by the North Carolina Department of Insurance. Each entry was requested to exemplify, in some manner, life at a continuing care retirement community. Artwork had to be of the contestants own creation, and could not be copied or duplicated from previously published artwork. Photography was not allowed. Each entry also had to be accompanied by a short description describing how the artwork related to the contest theme. The winning entry was selected based on artistic quality, tastefulness, reproducibility, and depiction of theme.  Winning Entry: Artist: Kitty O'Meallie (also known as Kitty Johnson)  Title of Work: ""...So Blessed..."" Type of Medium: Pencil and Pastel Community: Glenaire  Artist's Description: She's 101, predictable pains. She's black, can barely walk. But she's all smiles, constantly saying, ""I am so Blessed!"" She's in Glenaire's Continuing Care Community and also echoes views of Independent Residents...singing, golf, sightseeing, bridge, lectures, music, and more. ""Don't call us a Nursing Home"", they say, ""We are truly BLESSED!""  In addition to Ms. O'Meallie (Johnson), The North Carolina Department of Insurance would also like to thank each of the following individuals who participated in the Cover Art Contest: ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !

Continuing care is defined by the North Carolina General Statutes as, ""... the furnishing to an individual other than an individual related by blood, marriage, or adoption to the person furnishing the care, of lodging together with nursing services, medical services, or other health related services pursuant to an agreement effective for the life of the individual or for a period longer than one year."" In general, CCRCs are communities that provide a continuum of care to older adults under a contract for the life of an individual or for a period longer than one year. Typically there are three levels/stages of care offered by CCRCs: 1. Independent Living  is for individuals who are capable of doing the basic chores of everyday life but who may need occasional help from others. 2. Assisted Living  provides assistance for residents with chronic care needs excluding complete 24-hour skilled nursing care. Assisted living services include helping a resident with bathing, dressing, taking medications, and other daily activities. 3. Skilled Nursing Care  generally provides 24-hour nursing care, rehabilitative services, and assistance with activities of daily living to the chronically ill as well as those who have been hospitalized for an illness or operation and require a short period of rehabilitation before returning home. CCRCs are generally a collection of apartments, town homes, or cottages and include common activity areas such as a library, activity and craft rooms, a restaurant-like dining room, an assisted living facility, and a nursing home. Other amenities often include banking services, convenience stores, a golf course, walking trails, gardens, swimming pool, fitness center, beauty/barber shops, and guest accommodations.  ENTRANCE FEES There is usually a large up front payment called an entrance fee required to enter a CCRC. The amount of the entrance fee may depend on the size and type of dwelling you choose, your age, or the type of refund plan you choose. Entrance fees for North Carolina CCRCs range from a few thousand dollars to near $500,000. However, a typical entrance fee would range anywhere from $50,000 to $150,000. Entrance fee refund plans typically fall within one of the following categories: 1. Full Refund  Full refunds are rare, but sometimes offered. A fixed charge may be deducted before the refund is made and the agreement will state for how long the refund is valid and usually under what conditions a refund is due. Entry fees that  I   North Carolina Department of Insurance Continuing Care Retirement Communities Reference Guide ____________________________________________________________________________________________________________  offer full refunds are typically more expensive than those without refunds or those that are refundable partially or on a declining basis. 2. Partial Refund  Partially refundable entry fees guarantee that a specific percentage of the entrance fee will be refunded. For example, certain contracts guarantee that ninety percent (90%) or fifty percent (50%) of the entrance fee will be refunded upon the death of the resident or termination of the contract. 3. Declining Refund  With this type of refund, the agreement made specifies a period of time during which the entrance fee will be refundable to the resident on a declining basis. For example, if a entrance fee is refundable and declines at the rate of one percent (1%) per month, then eight-eight percent (88%) of the entrance fee would be refundable after twelve (12) months. 4. No Refund  Under this type of contract no refund is given. In addition to the entrance fee, a resident is usually expected to pay a monthly fee. Monthly fees for CCRCs in North Carolina can range from several hundred dollars up to just over $3,000. However, monthly fees will typically fall within the $1,100 to $2,000 per month range.  D  ISCLOSURE STATEMENT  One of the most important documents you will receive from a CCRC will be the disclosure statement. This document is required by law to be given to the person with whom a continuing care contract is being entered into, at the time of, or prior to, the transfer of any money or other property to a provider by, or on behalf of, a prospective resident. N.C.G.S. 58-64-20 requires the text of the disclosure statement to contain certain disclosure. Since the required disclosure is quite lengthy, it will not be addressed here, however, you are highly encouraged to obtain a copy of the statute and to become familiar with the required disclosure. Take your time reading the disclosure statement, and do not be pressured into signing any contract until you have had ample time to read and understand the information contained within it. If after reading the disclosure statement you are confused, or have questions, ask for clarification. You are also highly encouraged to seek professional advice from an attorney and/or accountant prior to signing any contract for continuing care.  C  ONTINUING  C  ARE  C  ONTRACTS  Probably the most distinguishing feature of a CCRC is the contract. A contract is typically defined as a binding agreement between two or more persons or parties. In order for a contract to be considered a continuing care contract, it must provide for lodging, together with nursing services, medical services, or other health related services, and be either for the life of an individual or for a period longer than one year.  T  YPES OF  CONTRACTS  II   North Carolina Department of Insurance Continuing Care Retirement Communities Reference Guide ____________________________________________________________________________________________________________  CCRCs typically offer one (or more) of the following types of agreements or contracts: 1. Extensive  Extensive contracts provide housing, residential services, and healthrelated services in exchange for a price, usually consisting of an entrance fee and a monthly fee. No additional fees are generally required as one moves from one level of service to another. 2. Modified  Modified contracts provide housing, residential services, and a specified amount of health-related services in exchange for an entrance fee and a monthly fee. Healthrelated services are provided at a subsidized rate or are free for a specified number of days. 3. Fee-for-Service  Fee-for-Service contracts provide housing, residential services, and guaranteed access to health-related services in exchange for an entrance fee and a monthly fee. Health related services are provided at the going, full per-diem rate. 4. Equity  Equity contracts involve an actual real estate purchase, with a transfer of ownership of the unit. Health-related service arrangements vary.  REQUIRED PROV  ISIONS  Although contracts may vary from community to community, all must, according to N.C.G.S. 58-64-25, contain certain provisions. Detailed below are the provisions that each provider must include within their contract for continuing care: 1. The party contracting with the provider may rescind the contract within 30 days following the later of the execution of the contract or the receipt of a disclosure statement that meets the requirements of N.C.G.S. 58-64. 2. The resident to whom the contract pertains is not required to move into the facility before the expiration of the 30-day rescission period. 3. If a resident dies before occupying a living unit in the facility, or if, on account of illness, injury, or incapacity, a resident would be precluded from occupying a living unit in the facility under the terms of the contract for continuing care, the contract is automatically cancelled. 4. If a contract is cancelled during the 30-day rescission period or if a resident dies before moving into a unit then the resident or the residents legal representative shall receive a refund of all money or property transferred to the provider less: - Periodic charges specified in the contract and applicable only to the period a living unit was actually occupied by the resident; - Those nonstandard costs specifically incurred by the provider or facility at the request of the resident and described in the contract or any contract amendment signed by the resident; - Nonrefundable fees, if set out in the contract; - A reasonable service charge, if set out in the contract, not to exceed the greater of one thousand dollars ($1,000) or two percent (2%) of the entrance fee. 5. The total consideration to be paid.  III   North Carolina Department of Insurance Continuing Care Retirement Communities Reference Guide ____________________________________________________________________________________________________________  6. The services to be provided. 7. The procedures the provider shall follow to change the resident's accommodation if necessary for the protection of the health or safety of the resident or the general and economic welfare of the residents. 8. The policies to be implemented if the resident cannot pay the periodic fees. 9. The terms governing the refund of any portion of the entrance fee in the event of discharge by the provider or cancellation by the resident. 10. The policy regarding increasing the periodic fees. 11. The description of the living quarters. 12. Any religious or charitable affiliations of the provider and the extent, if any, to which the affiliate organization will be responsible for the financial and contractual obligations of the provider. 13. Any property rights of the resident. 14. The policy, if any, regarding fee adjustments if the resident is voluntarily absent from the facility. 15. Any requirement, if any, that the resident apply for Medicaid, public assistance, or any public benefit program.  A  NNUAL  D  ISCLOSURE STATEMENT  R  EVISION  Pursuant to N.C.G.S. 58-64-30, every licensed provider must file with the North Carolina Department of Insurance a revised disclosure statement, setting forth current information required pursuant to N.C.G.S. 58-64-20, within 150 days following the end of each fiscal year. The revised disclosure statement must be made available to all of the residents of the facility.  C  ONTINUING  C  ARE  A  DVISORY  C  OMMITTEE  Pursuant to N.C.G.S. 58-64-80, there is a nine member Continuing Care Advisory Committee that serves in an advisory capacity to both the Commissioner of Insurance and the Continuing Care Retirement Communities Section of the North Carolina Department of Insurance. Members of the Committee are appointed by the Commissioner of Insurance and serve on the Committee for a two-year term. By law the Committee is to consist of at least two facility residents, two representatives of the North Carolina Association of Non-Profit Homes for the Aging (NCANPHA), one individual who is a certified public accountant and licensed to practice in the State of North Carolina, one individual skilled in the field of architecture or engineering, and one individual who is a health care professional.  IV   North Carolina Department of Insurance Continuing Care Retirement Communities Reference Guide ____________________________________________________________________________________________________________  A list of the current Continuing Care Advisory Committee members may be obtained by contacting the Continuing Care Retirement Communities Section at (919) 733-5633, extension 249 or 268.  O  PERATING  R  ESERVES  All licensed CCRCs are required, pursuant to N.C.G.S. 58-64-33, to maintain, after opening, operating reserves equal to fifty percent (50%) of the total operating costs projected for the twelve month period following the period covered by the most recent annual statement filed with the North Carolina Department of Insurance. However, if a facility maintains an occupancy level (independent and assisted living) in excess of ninety percent (90%), then the facility only has to maintain a twenty-five percent (25%) operating reserve. Operating reserves are to be funded by cash, by invested cash, or by investment grade securities, including bonds, stocks, U.S. Treasury obligations, or obligations of U.S. government agencies. Operating reserves can only be released upon the approval of the Commissioner.  R SELF-ORGANIZATION  IGHT TO  O  RGANIZATION  N.C.G.S. 58-64-40 gives residents of licensed CCRCs the right of self-organization, the right to be represented by an individual of his or her own choosing, and the right to engage in concerted activities to keep informed on the operation of the facility in which they are a resident or for mutual aid or protection. SEMI-ANNUAL MEETINGS N.C.G.S. 58-64-40 requires the board of directors or other governing body of a facility, or its representative, to hold semi-annual meetings with the residents of its' facility for free discussions of subjects including, but not limited to, income, expenditures, and financial trends and problems as they apply to the facility, and discussions of proposed changes in policies, programs and services. In addition, upon request of the most representative residents' organization, a member of the governing body of the provider, such as a board member, a general partner, or a principal owner shall attend such meetings. All residents are entitled to at least seven days advance notice of each meeting, and any agenda or other materials that are distributed by the governing body are to be made available upon request to all residents.

SHIIP stands for Seniors' Health Insurance Information Program. SHIIP is a consumer information division of the North Carolina Department of Insurance that helps Medicare beneficiaries and their families with Medicare, Medicare supplements, Medicare+Choice and long-term care insurance questions.  How does SHIIP work? SHIIP provides education and assistance to North Carolinians in three ways: ! by operating a Toll Free consumer information phone line, Monday through Friday from 8 a.m. until 5 p.m. ! by training volunteer senior citizens to counsel other seniors within their community about Medicare, Medicare supplements, Medicare+Choice and long-term care insurance, and ! by offering educational materials for consumer's use and speaking to civic, community, church and other groups about Medicare and other senior health issues.  When was SHIIP started? The program was founded in 1986 by Insurance Commissioner, Jim Long, in direct response to the growing concerns about health insurance for the more than 800,000 senior citizens in North Carolina. More than 70 different insurance companies sell Medicare supplements, Medicare+Choice, long-term care insurance and other medical insurance products to seniors in North Carolina. Because there are so many companies, and because the Medicare system is so complex, Commissioner Long says he felt there needed to be an objective information service for senior consumers, so he founded SHIIP.  How do North Carolinians contact SHIIP? You can contact SHIIP by dialing the Toll Free consumer line, 1-800-443-9354 or by visiting the website at www.ncshiip.com. There are also trained SHIIP volunteer counselors in all 100 counties of North Carolina who are coordinated through an existing human service agency such as the Council on Aging or the Cooperative Extension in each county. If your problem is too complex to handle over the phone, you will need to contact your local SHIIP coordinator for a one-on-one appointment with a SHIIP volunteer.  Can I get more information on SHIIP? Yes! Call SHIIP at 1-800-443-9354 and ask for more details on the Seniors' Health Insurance Information Program and how it can help you. 111 Seaboard Avenue# Raleigh, NC # 27601# 919-733-0111# 1-800-443-9354 # www.ncshiip.com"

It is located on 800 acres; however, only 60 acres are enclosed            by a fence. Many of the facility's original structures remain on the            grounds, but of the 60 buildings on the campus, only 23 are currently            in use.           Stonewall            Jackson normally provides custody and treatment to adjudicated males            between the ages of 10 and 18. However, as a result of the Juvenile            Justice Reform Act, violent offenders can remain at the facility until            age 19 or 21, depending on the committing offense. The bed capacity            at Jackson is 83.           Stonewall            Jackson seeks to meet the needs of each juvenile in their custody through            thoughtful academic, clinical, and milieu programming. Efforts are directed            at addressing the idiosyncratic risk factors that contributed to each            juvenile's criminal behavior, at building protective factors known to            reduce risk for re-offending, and at enhancing each juvenile's chances            for success following their release from the facility.            Jackson            offers vocational programming that includes a print shop, an auto shop,            a carpentry shop, a pet therapy program addressing both clinical needs            and vocational training, and a Work Adjustment Program in partnership            with the Department of Vocational Rehabilitation and Stanly Industrial            Services. Clinical programming centers on strength- and incentive-based            programs, leading staff and juveniles alike to take note of positive            behavior and achievement. All of this is offered in the context of a            structured code of conduct that emphasizes responsibility for one's            choices, and fairness and consistency in the delivery of consequences            for misbehavior.

Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services is expanding the quarantine area for the imported fire ant as part of the states ongoing battle with the pest.   North Carolinas quarantine now includes portions or entire areas of 49 of the states 100 counties. The majority of quarantined counties are located in southeastern North Carolina.   The imported fire ant is a nuisance and health concern to humans, livestock, and wildlife due to its painful sting.   ""Natural migration in addition to the movement of landscaping materials and equipment have combined to help this pest spread into these new locations,"" Ag Commissioner Meg Scott Phipps said. ""An effective regulatory program is critical to limiting movement from quarantined to non-quarantined areas of the state.""   Businesses and individuals in quarantined areas must obtain certificates or permits to relocate materials that can contain soil, such as sod, soil, hay and straw, nursery plants and soil-moving equipment through or to non-quarantined areas. For information on obtaining certificates or permits call (800) 206-9333. Movement of infested materials can result in the establishment and subsequent secondary spread of the imported fire ant to uninfected areas.   ""Failure to obtain the needed inspections and certifications can result in the issuance of a stop-sale notice and rejection or destruction of the regulated article,"" said Dr. Lloyd Garcia, NCDA&CS entomological program specialist.   The imported fire ant was first detected in the United States in Alabama in 1918. It was first identified in the southeastern part of North Carolina in Brunswick County in 1957.   Newly proposed quarantined areas will be presented to the N.C. Board of Agriculture for its review before the new areas are officially quarantined. The imported fire ant quarantine expansion is proposed as follows:   - Harnett County - The portion lying south of U.S. 421 from its western junction with the Harnett/Lee County line to its junction with Interstate 95, and north along I-95 to the Harnett/Johnston County line.   - Hertford County - The portion lying east of the junction of U.S. 13 at the Hertford/Bertie County line and north to CR 1419 (Newsome Grove Road), then north to CR 1415 (Catherine Creek Road), and northeast to CR 1409 (Hall Siding Road), and northwest to CR 1403 (Ahoskie-Cofield Road), and northeast to CR 1400 (River Road), and northwest to CR 1402 (Tunis Road), to its junction with the Chowan River and the Hertford/Gates County line.   - Johnston County - The portion lying south and east of I-95.   - Nash County - An area bounded by I-95 on the west, the Old Seaboard Railroad tracks on the south, Edgecombe County line on the east, and on the north N.C. 4 to its junction with U.S. 301 then following a straight line east to the Edgecombe County line.   - Sampson County - Expansion to include entire county.   - Wake County - The portion lying south of a line formed by the intersection of U.S. 70 at the Wake/Durham County line, then south and east to the junction of U.S. 70 and I-440, then east on I-440 to Wake Forest Road, and north to Spring Forest Road, and east to U.S. 401, north to its junction with the Neuse River, then south along the Neuse River to the Wake/Johnston County line.                                               -30-     North Carolina Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services 2 West Edenton Street, Raleigh, North Carolina 27601 Phone:  919-733-7125 Fax:  919-733-5047 An Equal Opportunity/Affirmative Action Employer"

GX235-91-2096108	Texas Education Agency                                 PRESS RELEASE                                                           October 18, 2001         37 Texas secondary schools nominated for ‘Blue Ribbon’ award             AUSTIN - Thirty-seven Texas secondary schools will be nominated by the Texas Education Agency for the U.S. Department of Education’s prestigious Blue Ribbon Schools Program for 2001-2002, Texas Commissioner of Education Jim Nelson announced today.   The program recognizes outstanding public and private schools that exemplify outstanding educational practices and is one of the highest national honors that a school can receive. States are invited to nominate schools for the program annually, alternating between secondary and elementary campuses each year.   All Texas school districts were invited to submit campuses for Blue Ribbon Schools consideration, and 78 applications were submitted. The applications were reviewed by a 105-member panel made up of public school educators, university professors, and administrators from previous Blue Ribbon School winners. The panel members chose schools as nominees if their applications showed evidence of a strong leadership and effective working relationships among the schools, their students’ parents and others in the community. The 37 schools being nominated also represent learning communities that are child-centered and have teachers that demonstrate professionalism. They provide high-quality instructional learning opportunities that exhibit a strong commitment to educational excellence for all students. In addition, each campus has made progress in meeting both state and national education goals.   ”I congratulate the students, teachers, principals, parents and others associated with these schools for being selected to represent Texas in the Blue Ribbon Schools program,“ Nelson said. ”This is a very prestigious honor, and we are pleased to call attention to these 37 Texas Schools of Excellence. These are just a few of the shining examples of the many fine schools we have here in Texas.“   In January, the Education Department will announce which state nominees will be selected for site visits from an experienced educator. The visit is conducted to verify the information contained in the nominated schools’ self-assessment portion of their nomination, observe classrooms at the nominated schools, and meet with the schools’ administrators, teachers, and other employees, parents and community members. A national review panel will examine the information from the site visits and will select the schools that will ultimately receive Blue Ribbon Schools status. That announcement will be made next May.   The Blue Ribbon Schools Program was established by the Education Department in 1982. Its purpose is to identify and give public recognition to outstanding public and private schools across the United States; make available a comprehensive framework of key criteria for school effectiveness that can serve as a basis for participatory self-assessment and planning in schools; and to facilitate communication and sharing of best practices within and among schools, based on a common understanding of criteria related to success   Since the program began, 301 Texas public schools have earned the Blue Ribbon Schools award, including 32 elementary schools that received the national award last May.   A list of the 37 Texas secondary schools nominated for the 2001-2002 Blue Ribbon Schools Program follows below.   More information on the Blue Ribbon Schools program is available on the Texas Education Agency’s website at http://www.tea.state.tx.us/awards.     - more -     2001-2002 USDE Blue Ribbon School Nominees from Texas Middle and Secondary Schools Program           District Name Campus Name Principal   Education Service Center Region 4     Brazosport ISD Freeport Intermediate Clara Sale-Davis   Cypress-Fairbanks ISD Carlos Watkins MS Diana L.

The day marks the anniversary of the certification of the 19th Amendment, granting women the right to vote and leading the way for increased political participation by women.  Last fall citizens elected North Carolina's first female lieutenant governor, agriculture commissioner and labor commissioner.   In proclaiming Women's Equality Day in North Carolina, Gov. Mike Easley urged North Carolinians ""to acknowledge and celebrate the progress made by women in politics both locally and nationally.""  The U.S. Congress established Aug. 26 as Women's Equality Day in 1971.  Each year celebrations are held on this date throughout the country honoring women and their accomplishments.   ""Women in North Carolina are working hard to shatter the political glass ceiling,"" said Peggy Alexander, interim executive director of the N.C. Council for Women.  ""This is the first year that women have occupied so many Council of State positions, judgeships and other elected positions.  If we continue this course, we will soon have a female governor or possibly a female U.S. senator.""   Nationally the number of women elected to U.S. congressional seats, council of state positions, local city councils, mayoral positions, and state boards and commissions has increased.  Despite these political breakthroughs, the N.C. General Assembly ranks 34th among all state legislatures in the number of women elected to serve, according to the Center for American Women and Politics.   Various activities have been scheduled throughout North Carolina in observance of Women's Equality Day.  Several local women's councils held Women's Equality Day celebrations during early to mid-August.  A gala celebration, sponsored by the Western Carolina Women's Coalition in cooperation with the western office of the Council for Women, is planned at Biltmore Square Mall in Asheville on Aug. 26 from 5 p.m. to 8 p.m.  Scheduled speakers include Beth Newburger of the National Trust for Historic Preservation and Helen Edington, who will make a presentation on the history of black women in Asheville during the days of the suffragette movement.  A symposium featuring Secretary of State Elaine Marshall as the keynote speaker is scheduled for Aug. 26 in Greensboro from 1:30 p.m. until 5 p.m.  For additional information about the Asheville event, contact Kathleen Balogh, western region director for the Council for Women, at (828) 251-6169.

Brad Miller (NC-13) today announced that                $500,000 he requested for a statewide traveler information program                passed the House 381-39 as part of the FY04 Transportation-Treasury                Appropriations bill.               ""Because of our rapid population growth, more                and more people are sharing our roads everyday,"" Miller said.                ""We must invest in mass transit and transportation infrastructure                in North Carolina and I believe these projects will help our state                work toward these goals.""               An important part of the state's Transportation                Improvement Program, this project will fund operations as well as                allow enhancements to the system that will ultimately provide multi-modal                traveler information by telephone, via the ""511"" phone                number across the state.               This earmark builds upon a $100,000 Federal Highway                Administration grant secured by the NC Department of Transportation                in 2002 to do a system design and implementation plan for the 511                system in North Carolina.               Miller also supported four additional projects in                the bill backed by the delegation, including:               --  $6.25                million for NC Bus and Bus Facilities  - Funding for this                project will be used to help increase mass transit service throughout                the state, especially in metropolitan areas like Greensboro and                Raleigh.               --  $1                million for NC State University Center for Transportation and the                Environment  - The center promotes research, education and                technology transfer to reduce the impacts of surface transportation                on the environment.                --  $250,000                Intermodal Transportation Hub Study in Raleigh  - This project                is a partnership between the Triangle Transit Authority, the city                of Raleigh, North Carolina Department of Transportation and Amtrak                to construct an inter-modal transfer facility in downtown Raleigh                to serve regional commuter rail, intercity high-speed rail, regional                bus and local bus transit.               --  Discretionary                grant funding for Burlington-Alamance Airport runway extension project                 - Priority will be given to a grant request for site preparation,                paving and airfield strengthening of a 1,000 foot runway extension                at the Burlington-Alamance Regional Airport. Reps. Richard Burr                (NC-5) and Howard Coble (NC-6) collaborated on this request.               The U.S. Senate must still consider the bill after                which a conference committee must agree upon the final bill.               .                . .

Would you like to get behind the wheel of an electric car or other alternative fuel and hybrid vehicles?  Your opportunity is coming Monday, March 19, when the Triangle Clean Cities Coalition and others sponsor the Advancing the Fuel Choice Conference at the Jane S. McKimmon Conference Center, N.C. State University, in Raleigh.   U.S. Department of Energy officials will travel from Washington to Raleigh in a van powered by compressed natural gas for the event, which will feature U.S. Rep. David Price.   Although the daylong conference is geared primarily toward vehicle managers, transportation engineers and elected officials, activities will be open to the public from 2 p.m. to 4 p.m.  Citizens are invited to browse the exhibit hall and participate in an alternative fuel vehicle ""Ride-n-Drive.""  In addition to low-speed electric cars and scooters, a wide variety of alternative fuel and hybrid vehicles from Ford, Toyota, GM and Honda will be available to test drive.  A 40-foot compressed natural gas motor home will also be on display.  No registration is required for the afternoon public event.   The conference will celebrate North Carolina's first ""Clean Cities"" designation presented to the Triangle Clean Cities Coalition, a group of over 40 members in a six-county area, including Chatham, Durham, Franklin, Johnston, Orange and Wake.  Clean Cities is a program sponsored by the U.S. Department of Energy to develop public/private partnerships in an effort to increase the use of alternative fuel technology.  Using alternative fuel is important in reducing U.S. dependence on imported oil and in cleaning up tailpipe emissions.   In addition to the Triangle Clean Cities Coalition, based at Triangle J Council of Governments, the conference is being sponsored by the State Energy Office in the N.C. Department of Administration, the N.C. Department of Environment and Natural Resources, and the U.S. Department of Energy.

GX086-06-8275913	"State of North Carolina Office of the Governor         Michael F. Easley         Governor                  Release:   IMMEDIATE   Contact:  Cari Boyce/Fred Hartman       Date:  March 22, 2002   Phone:  (919) 733-5612          N.C. GOVERNOR MIKE EASLEY HOSTS MULTI-STATE TEXTILE SUMMIT Calls on Washington to Assist Industry   RALEIGH, N.C.  - Gov. Mike Easley today hosted a regional textile summit  including Gov. Roy Barnes (GA), and Gov. Jim Hodges (SC)  to discuss ways to bolster the ailing industry.  The summit was held in Gaston County at Gaston College.           ""We must all work together to get the textile industry going and growing again,"" Easley said.  ""The industry, workers, and states will do our part but at the federal level, the new 'Textile Working Group' needs to become quickly the 'Textile Results Group.'  Agencies across the federal government must move aggressively to assist textile manufacturers and workers.   Every day the issue is discussed rather than acted upon, factories close and jobs are lost.""             At the conclusion of the summit, the Governors signed a letter to President Bush asking him to take immediate and specific action to help the textile industry.             The action items included the following:                   Direct the International Trade Commission to move aggressively to combat widespread dumping of textile goods on U.S. markets and to address the failure of trading partners to open their markets to U.S. exports of textile and apparel products, as committed in prior agreements.                   Provide the U.S. Customs Service with the additional staff and resources necessary to crack down on illegal smuggling and other customs fraud, which leads to billions of dollars in lost sales for our textile industry every year.                   Direct the U.S. Trade Representative to consider whether trading partners have already achieved competitive advantage through currency devaluation in determining whether or not to allow further adjustments or tariff reductions for textiles in future trade negotiations.                   Help our unemployed textile workers get the full two years of training and the Associates Degree that they need to secure a job at a sustainable wage, extend the Trade Adjustment Assistance program from 18 months to 24 months and expand the program to include health care coverage for those without coverage.                   Provide funding to Southeastern states to support market research to determine what type of training should be offered to displaced textile workers.                   Provide tax incentives and support for infrastructure projects in order to facilitate local economic development and expansion for our communities affected by the loss of a textile-manufacturing base.                   Help spur the innovation and collaboration that are key to the success of the U.S. textile industry in the global economy of the 21st century, expand federal support for the National Textile Center  an R&D consortium of U.S. academic institutions.             Panelists at todays summit included Governor Mike Easley; Governor Roy Barnes, GA; Governor Jim Hodges, SC;  Robert Connolly, Professor, UNC at Chapel Hill; Dean Blanton Godfrey, NCSU Textile College; Chuck Hayes, President ATMI; President and CEO of Guilford Mills; Bill Ott, Former President and CEO of Thomaston Mills; James Hall, former plant manager at Ithaca Industries; Donny Hicks, Director of the Gaston County Economic Development Commission; Peter Arnoti, Executive Director of The Greenwood County Economic Alliance, Inc.; Lynda Simmons, Head Lab Technician Inman Mills Ramey Plant, Enoree, SC; David Spooner, U.S. Trade Rep. Special Textile Negotiator; Steven Nesmith, Deputy Assistant Secretary for Intergovernmental and Congressional Relations for U.S. EDA; U.S. Rep. John M.

Beginning in 1993-94, where possible, scores for the entire accountability year are reported. The 1995-96 data are based on all cycles of testing for the July 1 to June 30 accountability year . Algebra I was scaled in 1993-94, and U.S. History, English I, and Biology in 1994-95 and 1995-96. Bold vertical lines between years indicate that the scores changed from mean raw core scores to mean scale scores and therefore, are not comparable across years separated by the bold vertical lines. Numbers to the left of these lines are mean raw core scores and numbers to the right are mean scale scores. From 1995-96 to 1997-98, five tests were administered statewide in the five high school course areas. Other end-of-course multiple-choice tests were administered as a local option and are not depicted in this report. In 1998-99 the ten tests in the table above were mandated statewide. Data for 1995-96 through 1997-98 are not available for Algebra II, Chemistry, Geometry, Physical Science, and Physics as these tests were not mandated during this period. 1 Participation Index is the number of students enrolled in the course, divided by the number of students who were in the eighth grade the year in which typical students in the course were in grade eight. For example, since English I is typically a ninth-grade course, the eighth grade membership for the previous year is the denominator. 2 The Algebra I score in 1993-94 and the Biology, English I, and U.S. History scores in 1994-95 are the mean scale scores. 3 Average core score is the mean raw score on the common items for all students. Data received from LEAs after October 15, 1999 are not included in this table.   Table 2. 1998-99 End-of-Course Multiple-Choice Test Results Percent of Students at or Above Level III by Ethnicity  Percent of Students at or Above Level III Number of Students Tested 87,404 48,956 76,872 41,261 77,740 89,679 60,764 67,397 11,221 70,187 Average Score 58.0 60.0 56.0 57.8 55.0 54.5 58.4 54.5 56.8 56.6 American Indian 54.4 34.3 44.3 37.6 46.8 46.6 31.2 34.6 36.5 29.5 MultiRacial 67.5 53.0 60.2 66.8 69.9 70.4 64.0 61.3 71.9 60.1  Course Algebra I Algebra II Biology Chemistry ELP English I Geometry Physical Science Physics U.S. History  State 65.4 59.0 57.7 60.5 67.4 64.6 58.4 55.7 72.0 51.0  Asian 78.9 72.5 60.2 69.3 64.0 66.0 67.2 52.8 77.8 58.7  Black 45.4 36.0 31.3 37.4 46.4 44.5 30.3 31.6 45.9 29.4  Hispanic 63.2 53.2 45.6 50.0 52.7 50.5 50.0 41.7 63.0 42.2  White 73.7 66.3 69.9 67.3 77.0 74.4 69.0 68.0 76.8 60.4  Data received from LEAs after October 15, 1999 are not included in this table.   Table 3. 1998-99 End-of-Course Multiple-Choice Tests Achievement Level Ranges by Course  Course Algebra I Algebra II Biology Chemistry ELP English I Geometry Physical Science Physics U.S. History  Level I 23-44 23-45 23-46 23-47 21-42 22-42 23-45 23-43 23-42 23-47  Level II 45-54 46-57 47-54 48-55 43-51 43-51 46-56 44-53 43-51 48-56  Level III 55-65 58-68 55-64 56-64 52-60 52-60 57-66 54-63 52-62 57-64  Level IV 66-87 69-92 65-89 65-90 61-87 61-86 67-91 64-89 63-87 65-90   100 90 80 70 60 50 40 30 20 10 0 State 1997-98 N Tested 1998-99 N Tested  Figure 1. 1997-98 to 1998-99 End-of-Course Multiple-Choice Test Results Percent of S tudents at or Above Level III in Algebra I by Ethnicity 75.3 61.6 65.4 49.8 54.4 45.4 40.0 57.5 78.9 63.2 64.1 67.5 70.3 73.7  American Indian 984 490 1,076 585  Asian 1,487 1,120 1,783 1,407 1997-98  Black 22,886 9,158 24,598 11,164  Hispanic 1,420 816 1,713 1,082 1998-99  Multi-Racial 362 232 530 358  White 55,852 39,274 57,601 42,468  83,124 N Level III, IV 51,166 87,404 N Level III, IV 57,124  100 90 80 70 60 50 40 30 20 10 0 State 59.0  Figure 2. 1998-99 End-of-Course Multiple-Choice Test Results Percent of S tudents at or Above Level III in Algebra II by Ethnicity 72.5 66.3 53.2 36.0 53.0  34.3  N Tested  48,956 N Level III, IV 28,881  American Indian 563 193  Asian 1,202 872  Black 11,028 3,972  Hispanic 744 396  Multi-Racial 283 150  White 35,060 23,255  Notes: ""N Tested"" and ""N Level III, IV"" for the ethnic categories do not sum to the ""N Tested"" and ""N Level III, IV"" for the state because some students did not indicate their ethnicity and therefore were reported in the state data only.

The revised Algebra I test assesses the Algebra I curriculum (revised in 1992) of the North Carolina Standard Course of Study. The end-of-course test assesses the entire Algebra I curriculum along three broad topics:  basic operations, equations, and inequalities (goals 1, 2, and 3);  functions and graphing (goals 4, 5, and 6); and  polynomials and nonlinear equations (goals 7, 8, and 9). The test is divided into two parts: calculator and non-calculator. .or the calculator part students are expected to have access to a graphing calculator. The basic difference between the two parts of the test is the emphasis on problem solving in the calculator part (regardles"

Tests of Computer Skills Report  Summary of 2001-02 Report of Student Performance North Carolina Tests of Computer Skills Background  The State Board of Education, as part of the Quality Assurance Program, initially established a computer proficiency requirement for diplomas issued to the Class of 2000. In October of 1995, the Board modified the requirement by making it effective beginning with the graduating Class of 2001. Students who were in grade eight for the 1996-97 school year and beyond are required to satisfy the computer proficiency requirement in order to receive a North Carolina high school diploma. The first opportunity to meet the computer skills proficiency requirement arises during eighth grade. Passing the computer skills standard is defined as passing both the multiple-choice and performance portions of the North Carolina Tests of Computer Skills. The Class of 2002 completed the eighth grade at the end of the 1997-98 school year, the Class of 2003 at the end of 1998-99, the Class of 2004 at the end of 1999-00, the Class of 2005 at the end of 2000-01, and the Class of 2006 at the end of 2001-02. For the 2001-02 school year, 79.3 percent of students who took the tests met the requirement at the end of grade eight. There were differences in performance among subgroups at grade eight. The Hispanic (54.2%), Black (65.7%), and American Indian (71.2%) subgroups had lower percentages passing the proficiency requirement than the Multi-Racial (80.3%), Asian (83.6%), and White (87.7%) subgroups. For the 2001-02 school year, 80.1 percent of students statewide met the requirement by the end of grade nine. There were differences in performance among subgroups at grade nine. The Hispanic (53.1%), Black (68.4%), and American Indian (69.9%) subgroups had lower percentages passing the proficiency requirement than the Asian (78.6%), Multi-Racial (81.0%), and White (88.4%) subgroups. For the 2001-02 school year, 89.3 percent of students statewide met the requirement by the end of grade ten. There were differences in performance among subgroups at grade ten. The percentages passing were 71.1 percent for Hispanics, 82.6 percent for Blacks, 84.5 percent for American Indians, 85.7 percent for Asians, 88.8 percent for Multi-Racial, and 93.5 percent for Whites.

Tests of Computer Skills Report  Introduction The State Board of Education, as part of the Quality Assurance Program, initially established a computer proficiency requirement for diplomas issued to the Class of 2000. In October of 1995, the Board modified the requirement by making it effective beginning with the graduating Class of 2001. Students who were in grade eight for the 1996-97 school year and beyond are required to satisfy the computer proficiency requirement in order to receive a North Carolina high school diploma. The requirement is based on the kindergarten through grade 8 competencies of the K-12 computer skills curriculum approved in July 1992 by the State Board of Education. These competencies are defined in the North Carolina Standard Course of Study (SCS). The goals of the requirement are to ensure that: (1) most students enter high school with sufficient computer skills, and (2) no student exits North Carolina high schools without sufficient computer skills. The North Carolina Tests of Computer Skills (multiple-choice and performance) must be administered by the end of grade eight with subsequent opportunities during high school, as needed, to allow students the opportunity to satisfy the requirement before completing their senior year in high school. Computers have become an integral part of today's world both in the home and marketplace; therefore, computer proficiency is an expectation for graduates of North Carolina's high schools. Initially, in order to meet the requirement, students were required to achieve a scale score on the performance part of the test equal to or greater than 49 and a combined scale score equal to or greater than 46. Under the old standard when the pass/fail status was assigned, it was assigned for student performance for both parts of the test. The multiple-choice and performance parts of the test were not separate but considered together to determine in a compensatory model a student's pass/fail status. At the recommendation of the Computer Skills Advisory Committee, after input from educators and others, the State Board of Education modified the standard for passing the computer skills requirement effective July 1, 1997. The modified standard requires that the test be separated into two tests: a multiple-choice test and a performance test. Either test may be passed independently of the other. To pass under the new standard, a student must achieve a performance test scale score of 49 or above and a multiple-choice test scale score of 47 or above. When documented through the Individualized Education Program (IEP), some students with disabilities may fulfill the computer skills proficiency requirement through the use of the portfolio assessment accommodation. Students with disabilities following the Occupational Course of Study may fulfill the computer skills proficiency requirement ""as specified in the IEP"" and may not be required to take the Computer Skills tests. The purpose of this document is to report the performance of students who took the computer skills tests during the 2001-02 school year. This includes the Class of 2002 as twelfth graders, the Class of 2003 as eleventh graders, the Class of 2004 as tenth graders, the Class of 2005 as ninth graders, and the Class of 2006 as eighth graders. Sample questions have been included in this report to provide examples of items on the tests.  vi   2001-02 N.C. Tests of Computer Skills Report  Background Definitions    The first opportunity to meet the computer skills proficiency requirement is during the eighth grade. Passing the computer skills standard is defined as passing both the multiple-choice and performance tests.

Students who entered grade 8 from the 1996-97 school year through the 1999-00 school year must meet the computer skills proficiency requirement based on the 1992 computer skills curriculum (old). The multiple-choice test assesses: (1) word processing; (2) keyboarding; (3) database use; (4) spreadsheet use; (5) telecomputing skills; (6) societal issues; (7) ethics; (8) terms, operation and care of computers; and (9) the use of computers in various curricular areas. The performance test consists of four parts: (1) keyboarding techniques, (2) word processing/editing, (3) database use, and (4) spreadsheet use. Students who enter grade 8 in the 2000-01 school year and beyond must meet the computer skills proficiency requirement based on the 1998 computer skills curriculum (new). The multiple-choice test assesses: (1) keyboard utilization/word processing/desktop publishing, (2) database use, (3) spreadsheet use, (4) telecommunications, (5) societal issues (including ethics and care/operations), and (6) multimedia presentation. The performance test consists of three parts: (1) desktop publishing, (2) database use, and (3) spreadsheet use. A student must test and a scale computer skills the old and new have a scale score of at least 47 on the multiple-choice score of at least 49 on the performance test to meet the proficiency requirement. The standard is the same for computer skills tests.      The Standard      Students are retested only on the test(s) that they have not passed.  vii   2001-02 N.C. Tests of Computer Skills Report  Computer Skills Requirement Guidelines    Beginning with the eighth grade, a student must be provided focused remedial instruction once the student fails to demonstrate proficiency by not passing the multiple-choice and/or performance test(s). Each senior must have at least one additional opportunity during the last month of school prior to graduation to demonstrate computer proficiency. Accommodations are available for students with disabilities with current IEPs or Section 504 Plans and students identified as limited English proficient. Accommodations may be provided in accordance with recommendations noted in Testing Accommodations for Students with Disabilities and Guidelines for Testing Students with Limited English Proficiency or to fulfill the needs of individual students. The need for accommodations must be documented (for example, in the student's current IEP, Section 504 Plan, or limited English proficiency plan). Accommodations used are to be consistent with routine instructional use and must not invalidate test results. The expectation is that all students will take the tests during the eighth grade. The portfolio assessment is available for those students with disabilities (only) who cannot take the test under standard administration conditions or with accommodations. Portfolio use must be documented in the current IEP or Section 504 Plan. The purpose of portfolio assessment is not to provide an easier alternative to demonstrating competency, but to provide an appropriate alternative that meets the same high standards as the tests for students who, because of their disability, are unable to access the test or parts of the test. There is no time limit for completion of the portfolio except that to demonstrate proficiency, successful completion is required which must occur prior to graduation. The expectation is that work to be included in the portfolio will be completed within the school setting over a period of time. The student's teacher and principal must verify the authenticity of the student's portfolio work and make the determination requiring the student's proficiency status as demonstrated by evidence presented in the portfolio. Students with disabilities following the Occupational Course of Study meet the computer skills proficiency requirement ""as specified in the IEP."" These students may or may not be required to take the computer skills tests.    Testing Accommodations        Computer Skills Portfolio          Occupational Course of Study    viii   2001-02 N.C. Tests of Computer Skills Report  Supported Software Packages for Performance Test    For the administration of the computer skills performance test, the NCDPI provides secure electronic files to accommodate the range of integrated software packages commonly used in schools. For the 200102 school year, the following software packages were supported:         AppleWorks for Mac Versions 5, 6 AppleWorks for Windows95 Version 5 Claris Works for Mac Versions 2, 3, 4, 5 Claris Works for Windows Versions 3, 4 MS Office Pro Versions 4, 95, 97, 2000 MS Works for DOS Versions 2, 3 MS Works for Windows Versions 2, 3, 4, 2000, 2000 Suite, 6.0 2001, 2001 Suite MS Works for Mac Versions 2, 3, 4    Effective with the 1999-00 school year, the NCDPI discontinued support for the DOS version of PFS First Choice and AppleWorks 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, and 4.0 for the Apple IIE when providing secure electronic files. LEAs using such platforms were to upgrade so that the upgraded platforms provide a higher level of standardization and are more in line with technology used in the marketplace. The LEA is responsible for scoring all portfolios for that system. The LEA test coordinator, the exceptional children director, and the computer coordinator provide direction for the scoring and approval process for completed portfolios. The LEA may involve other personnel as deemed appropriate. For the 2001-02 school year, the North Carolina Test of Computer Skills multiple-choice was scored and aggregated locally. The performance tests were scored by a contractor who provided the score reports to the LEAs. The LEAs provided the NCDPI with a pass/fail flag for enrolled by submitting an updated ""masterbuild"" file in the or by allowing the original ""masterbuild"" file aggregated in 2002 to be used.* LEAs exclude visiting students based directive. each student fall of 2002, the spring of on a NCDPI  Scoring the Tests       Data Verification    *Note: The ""masterbuild"" file includes absent and foreign-exchange pupils.  ix   2001-02 N.C. Tests of Computer Skills Report  Differences in Data Analysis: 1996-97 to 2001-02    The data collected for the computer skills tests in 1997 and 1998 used the same denominator, which included the number of pupils tested in both performance and multiple choice. In 1999, 2000, and 2001, the denominator included the number of pupils on the NCDPI ""masterbuild"" file, including absent and foreign-exchange pupils (but did not include visiting students). In 1999 and beyond, the denominator included the number of students who were exempted from participation in the test administrations. In 2001-02 foreign exchange, dually enrolled, and students not subject to the standard were excluded. These differences should be noted when making comparisons from year to year. As the testing program and methods of reporting data are standardized, differences in data reporting will be eliminated. In 1997, fall and spring data were merged centrally and LEAs had the opportunity to correct the final file of pupils. In 1998, all test administrations from fall 1997 to spring 1998 were merged centrally, accounting for the North Carolina State Board of Education's change in the standard. Most school systems edited the merged files locally and returned a file of pupil data that had a pass/fail flag for performance and a pass/fail flag for multiple choice. In 1999, a blank form was sent to LEAs to collect summary data (not pupil data), with a column for the number of pupils on the ""masterbuild"" file (including exempt and absent pupils), and a column for the number passing both performance and multiple choice. Since 2000-01, the LEAs updated scores as needed in their data systems and submitted a ""masterbuild"" file that contained each pupil's pass/fail flag (data updated after December 31, 2002 are not incorporated in the 2001-02 report). In every year, it was the responsibility of the LEA to submit accurate data and the NCDPI reported data that was submitted. Since the 2000-01 data year, some required reporting variables were added by merging the ""masterbuild"" file with other testing files where the required variables had been collected. For 2001-02, the merge included grade 8 end-of-grade data from 1997-98 through 2001-02 and all end-of-course files from 2001-02. Information from the other testing files was only applied to a student record when both the student name and identification number were identical; therefore, information was not obtained for students where name or identification number changed or was miscoded. Lesson plans and staff development activities have been provided by the NCDPI since the computer skills curriculum was revised in 1992. Some of the lesson plans are available on the DPI InfoWeb (www.ncpublicschools.org) and through the NCDPI Office of Publications.      Resources Provided by NCDPI    x   2001-02 N.C. Tests of Computer Skills Report  Resources Provided by NCDPI (continued)    The NCDPI Division of Accountability Services/Testing Program provides all school systems and charter schools with ample copies of the North Carolina Tests of Computer Skills Student Handbook to be distributed to the appropriate students. The handbook includes information about the graduation proficiency requirement, computer skills test-taking strategies, and sample questions. Students may practice answering the same sample questions interactively via the Testing Program website. In addition, information regarding rubrics for scoring the sample performance questions in the handbook is located at the same site.  xi   2001-02 N.C. Tests of Computer Skills Report  Findings 2001-02 Student Performance    For the 2001-02 school year, 79.3 percent of eighth graders, 80.1 percent of ninth graders, 89.3 percent of tenth graders, 92.9 percent of eleventh graders, and 94.7 percent of twelfth graders passed the computer skills graduation proficiency requirement. The percent of eighth graders passing the requirement increased from 77.5 percent in 1997-98 to 79.3 percent in 2001-02. The number of students in the cohort participating in the administration of the computer skills tests statewide from 1997-98 (in grade 8) to 2001-02 (in grade 12) dropped from 90,906 students to 70,821 students or by 22.1 percent. By the end of the 2001-02 school year, a smaller percentage of eighth graders had passed the proficiency requirement in the Hispanic (54.2%), Black (65.7%), and American Indian (71.2%) subgroups than in the Multi-Racial (80.3%), Asian (83.6%), and White (87.7%) subgroups. The percent of eighth graders passing the proficiency requirement increased for the Black subgroup from 1997-98 (58.1%) to 200102 (65.7%), for the American Indian subgroup from 1997-98 (62.2%) to 2001-02 (71.2%), for the Multi-Racial subgroup from 1997-98 (77.7%) to 2001-02 (80.3%), and for the White subgroup from 1997-98 (87.1%) to 2001-02 (87.7%). The percent passing decreased for the Hispanic subgroup from 1997-98 (58.3%) to 2001-02 (54.2%). By the end of the 2001-02 school year, the percentages passing for ninth graders were 53.1 percent for Hispanics, 68.4 percent for Blacks, 69.9 percent for American Indians, 78.6 percent for Asians, 81.0 percent for Multi-Racial, and 88.4 percent for Whites.

Tests of Computer Skills Report  Student Performance by Ethnicity (continued)    For the Class of 2001-02, the percent of students passing the proficiency requirement by ethnic subgroup from 1997-98 (cohort at grade 8) to 2001-02 (cohort at grade 12) increased significantly for the Black subgroup (from 58.1% of 25,467 students in 1997-98 to 91.7% of 18,849 students in 2001-02); the Hispanic subgroup (from 58.3% of 1,982 students in 1997-98 to 91.8% of 1,701 students in 2001-02); and the American Indian subgroup (from 62.2% of 1,394 students in 1997-98 to 94.9% of 828 students in 2001-02). The Multi-Racial subgroup (from 77.7% of 1,238 students in 1997-98 to 92.9% of 535 students in 2001-02); the Asian subgroup (from 77.9% of 1,437 students in 1997-98 to 93.5% of 1,545 students in 2001-02); and the White subgroup (from 87.1% of 58,910 students in 1997-98 to 96.1% of 47,315 students in 2001-02) also showed an increase in the percentage passing. With the exception of the Asian subgroup, the number of eligible students in the cohort participating in the administration of the computer skills tests at grade 8 in 1997-98 to grade 12 in 2001-02 decreased for the Hispanic subgroup by 14.2 percent (1,982 students in 1997-98 to 1,701 students in 2001-02); for the White subgroup by 19.7 percent (58,910 students in 1997-98 to 47,315 students in 2001-02); for the Black subgroup by 26.0 percent (25,467 students in 1997-98 to 18,849 students in 2001-02); the American Indian subgroup by 40.6 percent (1,394 students in 1997-98 to 828 students in 2001-02); and for the Multi-Racial subgroup by 56.8 percent (1,238 students in 1997-98 to 535 students in 2001-02). The number of students in the cohort for the Asian subgroup increased 7.5 percent from 1997-98 (1,437 students at grade 8) to 2001-02 (1,545 students at grade 12). Females have higher passing rates than males on the North Carolina Tests of Computer Skills. At the end of the 2001-02 school year, 83.1 percent of females and 75.5 percent of males had passed at the end of grade eight. At the end of grade twelve, 95.6 percent of females and 93.7 percent of males had passed. For the 2001-02 school year, 49.2 percent of 15,439 eighth-grade students with disabilities (including students identified only under Section 504) met the computer proficiency requirement. Also, 55.2 percent of 15,480 ninth-grade students, 70.6 percent of 10,486 tenth-grade students, 77.7 percent of 7,554 eleventh-grade students, and 84.3 percent of 5,857 twelfth-grade students with disabilities passed. For students identified as limited English proficient, 30.2 percent of 2,308 students in grade 8 met the computer proficiency standard in 2001-02. For the other grades in 2001-02, 43.2 percent of 2,808 students at grade 9, 63.0 percent of 2,036 students at grade 10, 75.6 percent of 1,377 students at grade 11, and 89.2 percent of xiii    Student Performance by Gender Performance of Students with Disabilities      Performance of Students Identified as Limited English Proficient     2001-02 N.C. Tests of Computer Skills Report  1,048 students at grade 12 met the computer proficiency requirement. Eighth Graders Taking the Performance Test for the First Time in 2001-02  In 2001-02, 94,533 eighth graders took the computer skills performance test for the first time. The percent of the students passing the performance portion of the requirement on their first attempt was 81.5 percent in comparison to 75.8 percent in 200001. Disparities were present among subgroups. The Black (66.6%), Hispanic (69.8%), and American Indian (74.6%) subgroups had lower percentages passing the performance test than the MultiRacial (82.6%), White (89.6%, and Asian (90.5%) subgroups. More females (84.5%) passed than males (78.6%). From 2000-01 to 2001-02, the percent of students passing the computer performance test increased for all ethnic subgroups: Black (58.0% to 66.6%), American Indian (61.2% to 74.6%), Hispanic (62.9% to 69.8%), Other (67.5% to 75.4%), Multi-Racial (75.6% to 82.6%), White (85.3 to 89.6%), and Asian (85.5% to 90.5%). In general, students whose parents had more education had higher passing rates than students whose parents had less education; however, students who reported parents with a four-year degree (88.6%) did slightly better than students who reported parent with a graduate degree (85.9%). Students whose school computers were located in a lab setting (79.7%) had lower passing rates than students whose school computers were located in class (83.0%) or in the media center/library (82.3%). The percent passing for students with access to computers outside of class (89.1%) was higher than for students with no access (57.5%). Students who often have opportunities to use computers to plan, develop, or present information, activities and/or projects (89.3%), had a higher passing rate than students who have such opportunities sometimes (78.6%) or never (78.0%). The percent proficient of students with disabilities in the eighth grade who took the performance test for the first time increased from 48.8 percent in 2000-01 to 57.6 percent in 2001-02. Data for certain classifications of disabilities (i.e., traumatic brain injured, autistic, severely/profoundly mentally disabled, multihandicapped, deaf-blind, and trainable mentally disabled) are not included in this report because fewer than 30 students participated. However, of the reported classifications of disabilities, the percent of students meeting the performance standard at grade 8 increased from 2000-01 to 2001-02.

In previous years' reports, Section 504 students and all students with exceptionalities were sometimes counted in both categories; however, beginning with the 2001-02 Computer Skills Report, the data for these two groups of students have been revised and are now reported as mutually exclusive groups across all years. *No scores are reported for groups with fewer than thirty students. ""Number Tested"" and ""Number Passed"" totals for ""All Students with Disabilities"" data include all students with performance answer sheets coded as having a disability. Data for autistic, severely/profoundly mentally disabled, multihandicapped, deaf-blind, and trainable mentally disabled were combined under the Other Exceptional Classification (OEC) prior to 2000-01. OEC is no longer reorted as category starting in 2000-01. ""Learning Disabled-Other"" is not reported due to incomplete coding. All data use ""Number Tested"" as the denominator. Students who began grade 8 in 1996-97 through 1999-00 were tested on the 1992 computer skills curriculum; students who began grade 8 in 2000-03 and beyond were tested on the 1998 computer skills curriculum.

Today, those efforts           are being recognized as the center is formally renamed the “J.           Iverson Riddle Developmental Center.”           The center, which is located in Morganton, opened in 1963. It is one           of five state residential facilities for people with mental retardation           and related disabilities. Dr. Riddle has been at the helm of the center           since before it opened. He is a native of Morganton.           In naming the center, DHHS Secretary Carmen Hooker Odom recognized           Dr. Riddle’s lifetime commitment to the center, its residents           and their families. “Your capabilities are respected on a national           level,” she said. “The programs and research at Western           Carolina Center have made vast contributions to the treatment of developmental           disabilities.           “The first time I visited the center, I was struck by what an           incredible vision Iverson had in making the center a reality,” she           added. “By any measure, the J. Iverson Riddle Developmental Center           is a showcase – providing a supportive environment for people           with mental retardation. You can see it in the faces of the residents.           You can see it in the effort put forth by a staff absolutely dedicated           to this vision. One man’s vision has equaled happier lives for           the people who have lived here and their families.”           During its four decades under Dr. Riddle’s leadership, the center           has compiled an impressive list of “firsts,” for a residential           mental retardation center, including:                        The nation’s first Residential Advocacy Program, which             is now both a federal and state requirement for such facilities;              The first Human Rights Commitment in the Southeast;              The first             state-funded early intervention program;              The first residential               fine arts program for people with mental retardation (residents             of the center have displayed artwork at major galleries             across the country);               The first group home east of the Mississippi;              The first             Volunteer Services Program;              The first institutional Covenant               Center for research and development of religious and ministry services               for people with severe, multiple             handicaps;              The first pet therapy program; and,              The first equestrian                 program for people with multiple handicaps.                                ###                                   Public Affairs Office          101 Blair Drive, Raleigh, NC 27603          (919)733-9190          FAX (919)733-7447                          Debbie Crane          Director
