Interagency Contracts Directory          This site, when fully operational, will provide an online source of searchable  information on contract vehicles intended for multiple agency use.   Vehicles to be covered will include government-wide acquisition contracts, multi-agency contracts, General Services Administration Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) contracts, including multi-agency blanket purchase agreements (BPAs) under FSS contracts, and other procurement instruments intended for multiple agency use.  Federal agencies who operate these vehicles will enter and update contract information and users will be able to search this information by various data elements to learn about the services or goods offered through these vehicles as well as the procedures required for evaluating contract holders and placing orders.    The Federal Acquisition Regulatory Council has proposed an amendment to the FAR to reflect the creation of this site. The Federal Government and the public at large are invited to submit comments on this rule  as well as the data elements that are being considered for use on this site. (For a tentative listing of data elements, see the preamble to the proposed rule)    Please reference the Proposed Rule 2001-030, Electronic Listing of Acquisition Vehicles  Available for Use by More Than One Agency for more detailed information.
